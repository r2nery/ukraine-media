# Monitoring the Russo-Ukrainian War Through Media

## About
This repository is a reproduction package for Resonant Journalism in the Russo-Ukrainian War: A Topic Modeling Approach to Key-Point Detection, the thesis for my BSc in Economics (Universidade de Bras√≠lia - Brazil)

This study sheds light on the potential of unstructured data for the detection of major happenings in global events. We detect key points of the Russo-Ukrainian War using topic modeling on a newly curated, large-scale dataset of news stories and investigate whether the differences in topic distributions can highlight unique trendsetting potentials in reporting across major news outlets.
