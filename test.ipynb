Leaked documents and recordings have shown the Belarusian leadership allegedly plotting murders <a href=\"https://euobserver.com/foreign/150486\">in Germany</a>, back in 2012. In the same year, what is still called the Belarusian KGB was allegedly recorded <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2021/01/04/the-president-is-waiting\">referring to</a> another émigré, the journalist Pavel Sheremet, as “a massive pain in the arse”, saying “the president is waiting for these operations”. Sheremet’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/20/ukraine-journalist-pavel-sheremet-killed-kiev-car-bombing\">murder</a> by a car bomb in Kyiv in 2016 remains unsolved. Another leak had President <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexander-lukashenko\">Alexander Lukashenko</a> reportedly threatening to build barbed wire concentration <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/leaked-belarusian-audio-points-to-plan-for-barbed-wire-bound-camp-for-protesters/31052734.html\">camps</a> in Belarus. Since his arrest, Pratasevich has featured not once but <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/31346235.html\">several</a> times in what are effectively hostage videos on Belarusian TV, alongside its increasingly hysterical propaganda about armed coups and chimerical plots against the president’s life.</p> <p>Lukashenko may not have read many biographies of Richard Nixon, but he seems to be testing out the US president’s “<a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/nixons-nuclear-specter-the-secret-alert-1969-madman-diplomacy-and-the-vietnam-war\">madman</a>” theory of foreign policy, according to which unpredictability and rash behaviour are actually an asset, unsettling opponents and even allies. In this case, softer EU states will be worrying if the sanctions now in place against Belarus are worth the trouble. President Vladimir Putin also seems to be a target. He and Lukashenko have met many times since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/10/its-outrageous-belarus-election-result-sparks-night-of-defiance-and-violence\">fraudulent elections</a> and mass protests in August 2020; but Putin has repeatedly refused to write him a blank cheque. Another reason for provoking conflict with the west is to draw Putin closer in.</p> <p>The Belarusian pirate state is now multiply rogue. Coercion is so far off the scale that the west does not know how to respond. As of June 2021, there are reportedly 526 political prisoners in jail, with nearly <a href=\"http://spring96.org/en/news/104120\">4,700 show trials</a> since last year’s sham elections. The UN special rapporteur on human rights for Belarus, Anaïs Marin, reported to the security council that 35,000 have been <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=27266&amp;LangID=E\">arrested</a> since August 2020. There is a growing refugee crisis: the likes of Pratasevich, who had been based in Warsaw, Shyshov and now Tsimanouskaya are just three of the <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2021/04/21/i-was-in-a-panic-how-belarusians-have-fled-in-growing-numbers-since-last-year-s-disputed-e\">tens of thousands</a> who have left Belarus since August 2020. Foreign policy unpredictability is everywhere. In June, Belarus walked out of the EU’s eastern partnership, having been a founder member since 2009. In July, Lukashenko shut the border with Ukraine, citing stories of nonexistent arms smuggling, and threatening to open a second front in Ukraine’s war with Russian proxies in the east. Lukashenko has threatened to flood the EU with drugs as well as migrants.</p> <p>Economic piracy may be next. The economy is in a hand-to-mouth state of survival, but there are worrying reports of the surviving elite grabbing anything that makes a profit. The Russian word for this is <em><a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2014/03/reiderstvo-asset-grabbing-russia\">r</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2014/03/reiderstvo-asset-grabbing-russia\">eiderstvo</a> – </em>not just corporate raiding, but physical takeover.

On 3 August, Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/03/uk-on-your-side-boris-johnson-belarus-opposition-leader\">met</a> opposition leader Sviatlana Tikhanouskaya at No 10, but his warm words that the UK was “on your side” have not translated to much. The online investigators Bellingcat have said they will look into the Shyshov case. Belarusian dissidents need proper protection when they are abroad. Lithuania needs help with policing its forest border. The deaths in Kyiv of Shyshov and Sheremet underline the importance of helping Ukraine with reforming and modernising its security forces. The UK has helped train the Ukrainian army – a bill is now before the Ukrainian parliament to reform the over-mighty but often incompetent and corrupt SBU, the Security Service of Ukraine. The UK should also be looking at the London-based assets of the Russian and Belarusian oligarchs who prop up the regime. </p> <p>Whether or not his madness is calculated, the country’s dictator can no longer be allowed to act with such impunity. Though while protecting ourselves and other states, we should not forget that the biggest problems are for Belarusians themselves.</p> <ul> <li><p>Andrew Wilson is professor of Ukrainian Studies at UCL and the author of <em>Belarus: The Last European Dictatorship</em></p></li> </ul>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/opinion', 'pillarName': 'Opinion'}, {'id': 'sport/2021/aug/07/us-finds-its-own-way-to-top-the-medal-table-at-tokyo-olympics', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'sport', 'sectionName': 'Sport', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-08-07T18:37:58Z', 'webTitle': 'US finds its own way to top the medal table at Tokyo Olympics', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/aug/07/us-finds-its-own-way-to-top-the-medal-table-at-tokyo-olympics', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2021/aug/07/us-finds-its-own-way-to-top-the-medal-table-at-tokyo-olympics', 'fields': {'body': '<p><br></p> <p>For most of the world, it has been considered the golden rule.

The German chancellor was reportedly distrustful of the former KGB officer from his first appearance in 2001 before the Bundestag, where he wooed MPs in fluent German as he called for unity against international terrorism.</p> <p>The two never looked quite comfortable in conversation, whether in German or Russian. Both formidable leaders, their clashing political styles and visceral distrust for each other made their summits compelling viewing.</p> <p>“No other politicians on the global stage have been so good at getting on badly over such a long time as these two,” wrote Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper in an article before Friday’s summit.</p> <p>Merkel’s early wariness of Putin has been justified by the events of the past 15 years, from Russia’s annexation of Crimea to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/01/alexei-navalny-says-he-believes-vladimir-putin-was-behind-poisoning\">poisoning attack on the dissident Alexei Navalny</a> and assassinations in Europe.</p> <p>There were personal slights too, such as an incident in 2007 when Putin allowed his labrador Koni to approach Merkel, who has a fear of dogs. “I understand why he has to do this – to prove he’s a man,” she told a group of reporters after. “He’s afraid of his own weakness.”</p> <p>And yet, as many in the west have sought to isolate Putin, she and France’s Emmanuel Macron have urged EU nations to maintain a direct dialogue with the Russian leader. As she enters the twilight of her term in office, allies of the Russian president believe Merkel will seek a breakthrough in talks on conflict in Ukraine when she meets with Putin on Friday.</p> <p>But what scope there is for cooperation remains unclear. The Minsk dialogue – the peace talks largely shepherded by Merkel between Ukraine, Germany, France, and the Russian-backed separatists in southeast Ukraine – are deadlocked.</p> <p>And the meeting comes on the first anniversary of the poisoning attack on Alexei Navalny, the Putin opponent imprisoned in Russia in a case clearly motivated by political revenge. It was Berlin’s Charité clinic that confirmed he had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/24/alexei-navalny-was-probably-poisoned-says-germany\">targeted with a novichok poison</a> last year, a diagnosis Russia has rejected.</p> <p>“This still unresolved case of course puts great strain on our relationship to Russia,” Merkel spokesperson Steffen Seibert said on Wednesday. “Our demands have still not been met. You will also know that Mr Navalny is unjustly imprisoned, spends his sentence in a penal camp and that there are even new charges being raised against him. All these points weigh on the relationship between Germany and Russia.”</p> <p>Other critics see Merkel as far too soft on Russia. Her final visit comes as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/18/us-warns-nord-stream-pipeline-is-russian-geopolitical-project\">Nord Stream 2</a>, a pipeline that links Russia to Germany, nears completion. The pipeline, which will allow Russia to deliver gas directly to Germany and bypass other countries that it currently uses for transit, has put eastern Europe on edge.</p> <p>Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, has called the pipeline a “powerful weapon being given to Russia”. He was <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/zelensky-biden-ukraine-russia-nord-stream-pipeline-fe50756b-6b82-43f0-b390-734ea3e95de0.html\">reportedly “surprised” and “disappointed”</a> after the US and Germany announced they had reached a deal to allow the pipeline to go ahead.</p> <p>Merkel has said Germany will respond if Russia uses the threat of gas cutoffs to pressure Ukraine and she is scheduled to visit Kyiv on Sunday in what appears to be an attempt to allay concerns. The Atlantic Council, a thinktank strongly critical of Russia, has called on her to use the visit to “reject Russia’s imperial claims to Ukraine”.</p> <p>Merkel is likely to phrase it differently when she meets Putin for the last time as chancellor this week. She has said she challenges the Russian president directly in private, adding: “When it comes to criticism of him, I don’t hold back.”</p> <p>But her calls for direct talks with Putin, also supported by Macron, are increasingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/25/fractious-eu-summit-rejects-franco-german-plan-putin-talks\">facing a backlash in the EU</a>, where some believe the Russian leader cannot be reasoned with.</p> <p>“Overall, we have a lot of conflicts with Russia that unfortunately make our relationship very difficult,” <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-angela-merkel-dialogue-russia-ukraine/\">she told the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg</a> earlier this year. “Nevertheless, I am someone who says we must always talk.”</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2021/aug/24/ukraine-denies-ministers-claims-of-hijacked-afghanistan-evacuation-flight-iran', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-08-24T10:10:16Z', 'webTitle': 'Ukraine denies minister’s claims of hijacked Afghanistan evacuation flight', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/24/ukraine-denies-ministers-claims-of-hijacked-afghanistan-evacuation-flight-iran', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/aug/24/ukraine-denies-ministers-claims-of-hijacked-afghanistan-evacuation-flight-iran', 'fields': {'body': '<p>A Ukrainian minister has claimed a passenger jet meant to evacuate people fleeing Afghanistan to Ukraine was hijacked at gunpoint and flown instead to Iran, in an unconfirmed incident that was later denied by his own government.</p> <p>Ukraine’s deputy minister for foreign affairs, Yevhen Yenin, said armed hijackers seized the plane at Kabul’s Hamid Karzai international airport, where a multinational evacuation is under way ahead of a 31 August deadline for foreign militaries to leave the country set by the Taliban.</p> <p>“Our plane was hijacked last Sunday by [unknown] people,” Yenin told Ukrainian public radio. “They were armed, including with firearms.

Ms Merkel, who did meet Mr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Sunday, admitted that talks between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany over the Donbass region have gone nowhere because of Mr Putin’s refusal to acknowledge Russian involvement in the conflict.</p> <p>Given this context of blandishments from the west and sabre-rattling from the east, it is understandable that Ukraine has raised bitter objections to the soon-to-be completed <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2021/07/21/ukraine-poland-slam-insufficient-deal-struck-by-germany-and-u-s-on-nord-stream-2\" title=\"\">Nord Stream 2</a> pipeline. Passing under the Baltic Sea, this will allow Russia to eventually bypass Ukraine when exporting gas to Germany, costing Kyiv billions of dollars in transit fees and potentially freeing Moscow to adopt a still more threatening posture towards its neighbour. Mr Biden, who had originally opposed the pipeline, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/21/democrats-biden-russian-pipeline-deal-500474\" title=\"\">dropped</a> his objections last month, signing an agreement on its completion with Ms Merkel, who views it as an economic priority.</p> <p>Ukraine thus has legitimate reasons to be critical of the level of support it is receiving from its powerful allies in the west. The debacle of the Afghanistan withdrawal – and the continuing weakness of the EU as a geopolitical force – will deepen the sense of insecurity.

Igor may not have inherited the rare combination of technique and musicianship of David Oistrakh, one of the greats of 20th-century violin playing, but he made a fine international career, and with a different background might well have achieved more open recognition of his ability and achievements.</p> <p>At the time of Igor’s birth in Odessa, on the south-west coast of Ukraine, the region was part of the Soviet Union: among the striking number of other soloists it produced were the violinists Mischa Elman, Isaac Stern and Nathan Milstein, and pianists Sviatoslav Richter and Emil Gilels. Igor knew from an early age what was expected of him. Both his parents were musicians; his mother, Tamara Rotaryova, was a fine pianist, and his father encouraged him to begin lessons as a young boy and to work hard. </p> <p>David, although often away, felt responsible for Igor’s musical development and sent frequent letters of encouragement. He was determined that his only son would play the violin, in the spirit of a respect for hard work and for the value of acquiring of knowledge from a young age. He warned his son of the unenviable lives of his own lazy schoolfriends, and admonished him to work hard and not to make his mother cry. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d0e3ff2feb907078ef079d79af94f44ba6dac5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d0e3ff2feb907078ef079d79af94f44ba6dac5e/0_15_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Igor Oistrakh, left, and Yehudi Menuhin at the Royal Festival Hall, London, in 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Igor Oistrakh, left, and Yehudi Menuhin at the Royal Festival Hall, London, in 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After two years with his first teacher, <a href=\"http://www.mvdaily.com/articles/2003/02/igor1.htm\" title=\"\">Valeria Merenblum</a>, Igor grew tired of failing to produce the sorts of sounds on the violin that his father did, and turned to the piano. Yet a photograph of parents and son in their garden shows a seven-year-old Igor looking accomplished and confident.</p> <p>It was not until the family moved to Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) at the outbreak of the second world war, when Igor was 11, and had violin lessons with his father’s teacher, Pyotr Stolyarsky, that there was any real progress. During just three months, Stolyarsky was able to convince Igor that he should not just play the violin because his parents wanted him to, but because it was stimulating and interesting. Oistrakh then went to the Central Music School in Moscow, studying again with Merenblum, and thrived in an environment that was producing some of the world’s greatest musicians. Igor recalled playing violin sonatas with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/17/gennady-rozhdestvensky-obituary\" title=\"\">Gennady Rozhdestvensky</a>, later known as a conductor, but a brilliant pianist as a student.</p> <p>Oistrakh started lessons with his father at the Moscow Conservatoire in 1949. Many of the lessons took place at home. Standards were high, his father strict, exacting and critical. The encouragement was for fine technique. He did not insist on musical imitation, and the younger Oistrakh was determined to follow his own instincts in performance, regularly rejecting his father’s ideas of interpretation, the use of vibrato, and the choice of tempo. In 1952, Igor won the first prize in the <a href=\"https://www.wieniawski.com/prizewinners_international_henryk_wieniawski_violin_competition.html\" title=\"\">International Wieniawski Competition</a> in Poland, and the following year made his debut in London in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F219R7QEdM\" title=\"\">Beethoven</a> and Khachaturian concertos. Coming shortly after the death of Stalin, this and <a href=\"https://www.gramophone.co.uk/other/article/classic-interview-david-oistrakh\" title=\"\">his father’s London debut in 1954</a> marked significant steps in the cultural thaw for Soviet artists encouraged by the impresario <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/mar/24/victor-hochhauser-obituary\" title=\"\">Victor Hochhauser</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35b580cc9530c0d247921cc342ebdf8d144ea66a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35b580cc9530c0d247921cc342ebdf8d144ea66a/0_199_3736_2241/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Igor Oistrakh, left, and his father, David, in 1961.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Igor Oistrakh, left, and his father, David, in 1961.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Deutsch/Corbis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gradually the two musicians began to work together, giving concerts of works for two violins, for violin and viola (Igor usually playing the violin to his father’s viola), or with Igor playing and his father conducting. Their celebrated performances of the Bach Double Concerto for two violins started in 1947, but the beginning of their many years as a duo on the international stage and in the recording studio started later, at the end of the 1950s.</p> <p>Mozart’s Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola, works by Wieniawski and Sarasate, and trio sonatas by Leclair and Tartini, with Vladimir Yampolsky on the piano, were all part of their repertoire. A 1961 recording of duos by Haydn, Spohr, Honegger and Prokofiev (the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BboZoRA9kaA\" title=\"\">Sonata Op 56</a>) won the Grand Prix du Disque.

In 1958 he became his father’s assistant at the Moscow Conservatoire. Seven years later he became a full professor and taught a class, combining this with engagements as a violinist and conductor and a busy independent solo and recording career, which took him all over the world.</p> <p>On the unexpected death of his father in 1975, Igor formed another violin duo <a href=\"https://victorhochhauser.co.uk/page/igor-valery-oistrakh.php\" title=\"\">with his son, Valery</a>, a fine musician in his own right. After the collapse of the USSR he settled in Brussels, and in 1996 was appointed professor at the Koninklijk Conservatorium there.</p> <p>With his pianist wife, Natalia Zertsalova, he recorded the complete sonatas by Mozart and Beethoven, and for the latter they were awarded honorary membership of the Beethoven Society in Bonn. Igor’s other honours included the presidency of the Russian section of the European String Teachers Association, and in Belgium that of the César Franck Foundation and honorary membership of the Ysaÿe Foundation.

Others starting the holiday of a lifetime. But they never arrived at their destination. On 17 July 2014, a missile shot down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh17\">Malaysia Airlines MH17</a> over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board, including 196 Dutch nationals. More than seven years later, a court in the Netherlands has heard some of their stories and how the lives of their grief-stricken families were changed for ever.</p> <p>Over three weeks, more than 90 relatives of MH17 victims have given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/06/i-am-full-of-feelings-of-revenge-families-of-flight-mh17-victims-demand-justice\">testimony of lives cut short</a>. Schools not started, plans never to be realised, ordinary pleasures of family meals and hobbies denied.</p> <p>“The speakers shared their grief, their pain, their frustration, sometimes their anger, but also their memories and many happy moments and often hopeful thoughts for the future,” said presiding judge, Hendrik Steenhuis, in brief closing remarks on Friday at the court near Schiphol airport. Thanking the relatives for giving the victims “a voice and a face”, he said: “This has made a deep and lasting impact on the court and the court is grateful to you for it.”</p> <p>Earlier in the week, Richard van Vreeswijk told the court about his youngest son, Huub, a good-looking boy with dark curly hair, who played football and was planning to take driving lessons. Huub was 17 when he was killed, alongside his mother, Barbara de Bruin, her partner, Rob van de Kraats, and his son, Lorenzo. </p> <p>The four were going to Bali on holiday, before Huub began studying sport and business at college in Arnhem on 1 September. Instead that was the day Richard van Vreeswijk viewed his son’s body in the mortuary. Dressed in black shirt, tie and jacket, he recalled his pain as he thought of the empty chair at the college his son had chosen. </p> <p>“That chair was meant for my son. He had worked hard for it and he had really earned it. He was the one who hadn’t turned up to class, who no one knew and no one missed,” van Vreeswijk said.</p> <p>For van Vreeswijk, grief manifested itself as physical pain – sometimes his left arm was out of action, or he had searing toothache. He went to the doctor because his face was inflamed with persistent crying. After some years he realised “the physical pain I felt was grief. It was the reverse of the love I felt for Huub. It was the price I paid for loving him and for missing him every single day.”</p> <p>Richard’s older son, Nick van Vreeswijk, now 25, described the pain of losing his mother and brother, compounded by people’s expectations about how he should grieve. “Every year I dread 17 July, Mother’s Day, birthdays and other holidays. But for me personally the emptiness is not greater on those days, but others expect me to feel that way. But to me, no one is extra dead on certain days.”</p> <p>The relatives’ testimony is just the tip of an iceberg of grief. The victims of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh17\">MH17</a> were from 10 countries. Some relatives gave testimony via video link from Australia and Indonesia. Judges and lawyers dressed in black robes were shown pictures of the victims, smiling family snaps that no one in their worst nightmares could have imagined would end up in a legal file.</p> <p>“The magnitude and intensity of the impact is unfathomable: 298 loved ones leave thousands behind in grief,” Arlette Schijns, a lawyer for the relatives, said on Friday. “The right to address the court has made it clear to us that the grief is not limited to one generation. It will have a lasting impact on several generations … the pain and suffering that has been caused can be compared to war trauma.”</p> <p>Four men stand accused of murder: three Russians, Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinskiy, Oleg Pulatov, and a Ukrainian, Leonid Kharchenko.</p> <p>An international investigation concluded that the men <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/mh17-criminal-charges-ukraine-russia\">did not “push the button” themselves</a>, but were responsible for bringing the anti-aircraft system to eastern Ukraine. The soldiers, investigators said, “formed a chain” linking the Moscow-backed separatist Donetsk People’s Republic with Russia.</p> <p>The Netherlands and Australia said in 2018 that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/25/mh17-australia-and-netherlands-accuse-russia-of-complicity\"> Russia was responsible for the disaster,</a> after investigators concluded the BUK missile had come from a Russian military base.</p> <p>The Kremlin has angrily denied any involvement, while claiming it was excluded from the investigation.</p> <p>All four are being tried in absentia. Only Pulatov has chosen to be represented by lawyers, who have denied the charges on his behalf. Relatives voiced anger that no one had taken responsibility for the crime.</p> <p>“They are lying, we know they are lying and they know that we know they are lying,” said Ria van der Steen, the first relative to give testimony. She lost her father and stepmother and told the court how she began to have nightmares soon after learning of their deaths.</p> <p> “I am full of feelings of hate, revenge, anger and fear that we will not obtain justice,” she said. “Anger and frustration that those who are responsible will not take responsibility. I can’t put an end to this process of saying goodbye, certainly not until those who are responsible for their deaths are tried and found to be guilty for what they have done.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/06/i-am-full-of-feelings-of-revenge-families-of-flight-mh17-victims-demand-justice\">‘I am full of feelings of revenge’: families of flight MH17 victims demand justice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nick van Vreeswijk appealed to those responsible for downing the plane to tell the court the truth. “The relatives of 298 victims for seven years now have been looking at this jet black puzzle that doesn’t seem to fit. And my grieving process cannot progress without that truth. Over 1,000 people, 1,000 relatives are still waiting for that answer, for the story. Was it an accident? Was it intentional? How did it happen?”</p> <p>Paul Marckelbach-Hellings told the court “my whole family was snatched from me when MH17 was blasted from the sky”. He lost his mother, Christiene de Sadeleer, “a warm, hospitable, life-loving woman” of 64 taking her first big trip after being widowed. Also killed was his “wise, beautiful sister in her prime” Simone Marckelbach, his “jovial go-getting brother in-law”, Antoine van Veldhuizen, and their two children, Quint and Pijke. </p> <p>Quint, who was seven years old, would never take part in the school musical or have a first crush, Marckelbach-Hellings told the court. Pijke, who was three, would never go to big school or learn to ride a bike, he said. “The life that lay before him cannot be lived.”</p> <p>Via a statement read by her husband, his wife, Joyce Hellings-Marckelbach, told the court how that carefree sunny day flipped into the darkest period of their lives. Coping with her own grief that caused her health to decline, she watched as her husband struggled with all-consuming despair. On that day “we lost joy in living, we lost confidence, a feeling of security. There is the constant knowledge that it could all be over in an instant.”</p> <p>Never in the history of the Dutch criminal justice system have so many relatives taken up their right to address the court.

In total, the trove consists of 11.9m files leaked from a total of 14 offshore service providers, totalling 2.94 terabytes of information.

Their clients are typically seeking to discreetly set up companies or trusts in lightly regulated tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Panama, the Cook Islands and the US state of South Dakota. Companies registered offshore can be used to hold assets such as property, aircraft, yachts and investments in stocks and shares. By holding those assets in an offshore company, it is possible to hide from the rest of the world the identity of the person they actually belong to, or the “beneficial owner”.</p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p><strong>Why do people move money offshore?</strong></p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p>Usually for reasons of tax, secrecy or regulation.

Offshore jurisdictions also tend to be highly secretive and publish little or no information about the companies or trusts incorporated there. This can make them useful to criminals, such as tax evaders or money launderers, who need to hide money from tax or law enforcement authorities. It is also true that people in corrupt or unstable countries may use offshore providers to put their assets beyond the reach of repressive governments or criminal adversaries who may try to seize them, or to seek to circumvent hard currency restrictions.

His spokesperson <a href=\"https://tass.com/world/1312441\">Sergiy Nikiforov</a> messaged: “Won’t be an answer.”</p> \\n<p>The files reveal Zelenskiy participated in a sprawling network of offshore companies, co-owned with his longtime friends and TV business partners. They include Serhiy Shefir, who produced Zelensky’s hit shows, and Shefir’s older brother, Borys, who wrote the scripts. Another member of the consortium is Ivan Bakanov, a childhood friend. Bakanov was general director of Zelenskiy’s production studio, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvartal_95_Studio\">Kvartal 95</a>.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e776aca1b62b4f6bf720b828ada7a73949f28d59\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e776aca1b62b4f6bf720b828ada7a73949f28d59/0_0_1440_961/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still from Servant of the People, the satirical comedy show starring Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the lead as the Ukrainian president.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Still from Servant of the People, the satirical comedy show starring Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the lead as the Ukrainian president.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kvartal 95</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>All are associated with Zelenskiy’s home town in southern Ukraine, Kryvyi Rih. After winning power, Zelenskiy brought these close allies into government. Bakanov became head of Ukraine’s SBU security agency. Zelenskiy made Serhiy Shefir his first assistant, an unpaid role that involves handling the president’s daily schedule. A fourth member of this close-knit group, Andriy Yakovlev, is a film director and Kvartal 95 producer.</p> \\n<p>Zelenskiy has said these appointments were about personal trust rather than financial cronyism. “I have a few people who work with me who have been my friends for a long time … They have no relation to business, or to the budget,” he told the Guardian in 2020.</p> \\n<h2>A secret transfer</h2> \\n<p>Before becoming president, Zelenskiy declared some of his private assets. They included cars, property and three of the co-owned offshore companies. One, Film Heritage, which he held jointly with his wife, Olena, a former Kvartal 95 writer, is registered in Belize.</p> \\n<p>But the Pandora papers show further offshore assets that Zelenskiy appears not to have revealed. Film Heritage had a 25% stake in Davegra, a Cyprus holding company. Davegra in turn owns Maltex Multicapital Corp, a previously unknown entity registered in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Zelenskiy, the Shefir brothers, and Yakovlev each held a 25% stake in Maltex.</p> \\n<p>On 13 March 2019, two weeks before the first round of voting in Ukraine’s election, Zelenskiy gave his quarter stake in Maltex to Serhiy Shefir, documents show. It is unclear if Shefir paid Zelenskiy. Bakanov witnessed this secret transfer and signed the offshore papers. </p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcdf901d3c9a7b0131e53a9ab370343d49c44963\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcdf901d3c9a7b0131e53a9ab370343d49c44963/0_125_2691_1901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his wife, Olena, at a polling station during a parliamentary election in Kyiv, Ukraine, in July 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his wife, Olena, at a polling station during a parliamentary election in Kyiv, Ukraine, in July 2019.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters/Alamy</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Roughly six weeks later, after Zelenskiy’s landslide victory, a lawyer acting for the Kvartal 95 group signed another document. It stipulated that Maltex would continue to pay dividends to Zelenskiy’s Film Heritage, even though it no longer owned any stake in the company. Its main revenue comes from activity in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus, according to a Maltex client profile. </p> \\n<p>The Pandora papers do not indicate whether any dividends were ever paid or their size. Nor do they reveal how many payments might have been made. Zelenskiy’s wife, Olena, is now the declared beneficial owner of Film Heritage, meaning any payments since 2019 would have flowed to her. </p> \\n<p>The key document – dated 24 April 2019 – says Maltex holds shares in companies that produce and distribute TV films. One reason for setting up Maltex was “tax-efficient accumulation of business profits”; another, it states, was “legal protection”. Borys Sheifir said Bakanov had mostly set up these offshore “financial schemes” in order to protect the company from “authorities and bandits”.</p> \\n<p>“Speaking honestly, I’m not ready to respond to you. It could be that I’m an owner [of Maltex],” Shefir told the <a href=\"https://www.occrp.org/en\">Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project</a> (OCCRP), one of the Pandora papers’ media partners. He said he was trying to divest himself of his offshore interests, but said this was a slow and difficult process. Serhiy Shefir, Bakanov and Yakovlev declined to comment, as did their lawyer.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Story%20tips%3F&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20use%20Signal%20or%20WhatsApp%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566%20or%20(US)%20%2B1%20646%20886%208761.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Do you have information about this story?

Last month, Ukraine’s parliament passed an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-parliament-passes-law-oligarchs-final-reading-2021-09-23/\">anti-oligarch bill</a>. The vote took place a day after unknown assassins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/22/shots-fired-car-carrying-ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskiy-top-aide\">tried to kill</a> Shefir. A gunman had opened fire on his car outside Kyiv. He was unharmed, but his driver was wounded. The attempt may have been motivated by opposition to the bill.</p> \\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/president-zelenskyy-deoligarchization-is-the-key-to-ukraines-future-success/\">opinion piece</a> for the Atlantic Council, Zelenskiy said his ultimate goal as president was to destroy “the traditional oligarchic order” and to replace it with a “fairer system”. Critics, however, say Zelenskiy has failed to reform the state and embraced the same shadowy ways as his predecessors. EU auditors <a href=\"https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/INSR21_23/INSR_fight-against-grand-corruption-in-Ukraine_EN.pdf\">warned</a> last month that “grand corruption and state capture” remained widespread in Ukraine.</p> \\n<p>Since entering politics Zelenskiy has been dogged by claims he is under the influence of <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/public-designation-of-oligarch-and-former-ukrainian-public-official-ihor-kolomoyskyy-due-to-involvement-in-significant-corruption/\">Igor Kolomoisky</a>, a billionaire whose TV channel screened Zelenskiy’s show. During the campaign Zelenskiy’s opponents <a href=\"https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/570044.html\">alleged $41m from Kolomoisky entities</a> found its way between 2012 and 2016 into offshore firms belonging to Zelenskiy and his circle, including Film Heritage. </p> \\n<h2>Russian connection</h2> \\n<p>The Pandora papers show that at least some of the details in the scheme <a href=\"https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/570044.html\">alleged by Poroshenko’s party</a> correspond to reality. They show that part of the Kvartal 95 network was managed with help from Fidelity Corporate Services, an offshore consultancy and one of 14 firms whose documents make up the leak. The files show that Zelenskiy and his business partners used companies based in the BVI, Belize and Cyprus.</p> \\n<p>The assets held via these offshore companies are wide-ranging. They include real estate in London. Shefir owns two top-end properties – a three-bedroom apartment in an Edwardian mansion block in Regent’s Park bought in 2016 for £1.575m, and another three-bedroom flat in nearby Baker Street, opposite the Sherlock Holmes Museum, and purchased for £2.2m, according to Land Registry records.</p> \\n<p>Meanwhile, Yakovlev’s BVI company Candlewood Investments owns a luxury flat in a Victorian mansion block in Artillery Row, Westminster. The properties were acquired around the time Zelenskiy’s show was turned into a feature film and recommissioned for a second series. It is unclear if the three flats are let out or used on an occasional basis. A <a href=\"http://www.westhome-invest.com/\">Russian company</a> that bills itself as an “individual service for high status clients” manages them.</p> \\n<p>Zelenskiy’s apparent business connections to Russia via Maltex are likely to prove controversial. Poroshenko faced criticism for owning a chocolate factory in Russia at a time when Ukraine was fighting a war against Russian troops and their proxies following the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/conflict-ukraines-donbas-visual-explainer\">conflict</a>, in which 14,000 people have died, continues in the east of the country and in the Moscow-backed rebel territories of Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia was previously a major market for Kvartal 95, with Russian TV screening its comedy shows.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'news/2021/oct/04/pandora-papers-tax-avoidance-revelations-prompt-outraged-denials', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'news', 'sectionName': 'News', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-10-04T18:09:17Z', 'webTitle': 'Pandora papers: tax avoidance revelations prompt outraged denials', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/04/pandora-papers-tax-avoidance-revelations-prompt-outraged-denials', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2021/oct/04/pandora-papers-tax-avoidance-revelations-prompt-outraged-denials', 'fields': {'body': '<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/pandora-papers\">Pandora papers’</a> revelations prompted an avalanche of international reaction on Monday, ranging from solemn government pledges to clamp down on tax avoidance to outraged denials and a few cries of “old news”.</p> \\n<p>The leak published on Sunday by the Guardian and other global media partners revealed the leading role played by the US in the offshore industry, including in the state of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/the-great-american-tax-haven-why-the-super-rich-love-south-dakota-trust-laws\">South Dakota</a>.

The British chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the UK’s tax authorities would “look through those to see if there’s anything we can learn”.</p> \\n<p>Sunak – whose father-in-law is an Indian tycoon and billionaire – was asked if he had personally benefited himself from an offshore arrangement. “No, I haven’t,” he told Sky News.</p> \\n<p>The Australian tax office said it would examine any links to Australians that emerge from the leak. About 400 Australian names are in the papers, which feature southern hemisphere tax havens such as Samoa, as well as the British Virgin Islands, Monaco and Switzerland.</p> \\n<p>The government of Panama said it would begin a “supervision” of offshore service companies mentioned in the Pandora papers. One of those providers, a <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/alcogal-panama-latin-america-politicians/\">Panama-headquartered law firm known as Alcogal</a>, plays a major role in helping Latin America’s political class set up shell companies in tax havens. It says it complies with all legal requirements wherever it operates.</p> \\n<p>Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, said his government would investigative all citizens mentioned in the documents – including several of his own ministers and key members of his inner circle.</p> \\n<p>They include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/04/pakistan-minister-ditched-offshore-plans-tax-authority-concerns-chaudhry-moonis-elahi\">Pakistan’s minister for water resources, Chaudhry Moonis Elahi</a>. Elahi pulled out of making a large investment in a tax haven after he was told his country’s tax authorities would be informed, documents in the Pandora papers suggest. Instead he set up a trust structure in the UK. Elahi denies impropriety and says his family’s assets were declared.</p> \\n<p>“If any wrongdoing is established, we will take appropriate action. I call on the international community to treat this grave injustice as similar to the climate change crisis,” Khan tweeted. The ruling elite in the developing world was plundering national wealth in the same way the East India Company once looted India, he said.</p> \\n<p>“Unfortunately, the rich states are neither interested in preventing this large-scale plunder nor in repatriating this looted money,” Khan said. The UN had calculated that a staggering $7tn in stolen assets was parked in largely offshore tax havens, he said, pointing out that corruption caused poverty in his and other countries.</p> \\n<p>Meanwhile, the billionaire Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, reacted angrily to the Pandora claims. They show he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/03/revealed-czech-pm-used-offshore-companies-to-buy-13m-french-mansion\">used a convoluted offshore structure to finance his purchase in 2009 of a £13m mansion in the south of France</a>. The timing of Sunday’s publication – ahead of elections on Friday and Saturday – was a murky political plot, he suggested.</p> \\n<p>“So it’s here. I had expected them to pull something out on me just before the elections in order to harm me and influence the Czech elections,” Babiš tweeted. He said he had never done anything “illegal or wrong”. “That does not prevent them from trying to denigrate me again and influence the Czech parliamentary elections.”</p> \\n<p>Babiš did not deny the substance of the offshore claims. He conceded that a politician should not proceed in this way, but said he was not active in politics at the time. “Of course a politician cannot afford to do that, but I did the transaction 12 years ago,” he said. Czech police’s organised crime unit said it would investigate the disclosures relating to Babiš and about 300 other Czechs.</p> \\n<p>There was a similarly unhappy reaction from the royal family in Jordan. On Sunday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/03/king-of-jordan-hidden-property-empire-worth-more-than-100m-pandora-papers-reveal\">it emerged that the country’s ruler, King Abdullah II, had splurged $100m on properties in the US and UK</a>, including a mansion in Malibu, California, and three houses in Belgravia in central London. All were concealed behind a dense web of shell corporations.</p> \\n<p>In a statement, Jordan’s royal court dismissed the reports by the Guardian, Washington Post and other media as “distorted”. It said they “included inaccuracies and exaggerated the facts”.

beyond, the Russian state-backed energy giant Gazprom confirmed last month that it had finished building Nord Stream 2, a 760-mile pipeline with the potential to send 55bn cubic metres of gas under the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea\" title=\"\">Baltic Sea</a> to Germany every year.</p> <p>Russia is already Europe’s biggest gas supplier, but once running, Nord Stream 2 would offer a significant boost to the annual 170bn cubic metres that keep lights on across the continent.</p> <p>Never shy of seizing an opportunity in a crisis, Russia’s deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, suggested last week that swift approval from Germany’s regulators for Nord Stream 2, currently set to take months, could be the answer to the soaring gas prices troubling European governments.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/07/europes-soaring-gas-prices-does-russia-hold-solution-to-crisis\">Europe’s soaring gas prices: does Russia hold solution to crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a move that cooled markets and followed intense pressure from Europe and the International Energy Agency, the world’s energy watchdog, to boost supplies.</p> <p>In reality, Nord Stream 2 cannot be the answer to the short-term crisis. At best, Gazprom has conceded that it would probably only be running at 10% of capacity in the remaining months of this year. If Gazprom really wished to cool markets, it could book further capacity for gas supply via pipes through Poland and Ukraine.</p> <p>Indeed, there are signs that Russia has been increasing supply in the past two days, and once Gazprom has hit a November deadline of being fully stocked for this winter’s domestic demand, even more gas should be available for Europeans.</p> <p>The Nord Stream 2 argument underlines the dilemma facing Europe as it wrestles with how to clean up its energy supplies. </p> <p>Europe is setting itself some challenging targets in the name of the climate emergency, including raising the share of renewable energy in the EU to 40%. That is where money is being invested.</p> <p>But as Europe closes its coal mines and gears up its wind turbines, there will be a difficult transition period. Germany made that situation even tougher with its decision to phase out nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, leaving it relying on fossil fuels to help bridge the gap to a renewables-powered future. </p> <p>Those opposed to Nord Stream 2, including the White House, argue that it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/18/us-warns-nord-stream-pipeline-is-russian-geopolitical-project\" title=\"\">part of the Kremlin’s geopolitical strategy</a>. While ostensibly a private-sector project, it is clearly under Vladimir Putin’s control. The US argues that regulatory approval will only reinforce Europe’s dependence on Russia and undermine Ukraine, a key western ally, by making its pipelines redundant.</p> <p>Perhaps Putin will seek to play politics with gas. But the Kremlin has been loth to do so in the past, seeking instead to be a reliable partner. And Russia has one key interest above all, and that is to sell as much gas as it can as swiftly as possible.</p> <p>Putin’s change of heart last week had this economic reality in mind: while it revels in being a nuisance for its neighbours, it is not in its interests to accelerate the shift to renewables in Europe. The clock is ticking on fossil fuels, and Russia would be undermining its finances by speeding up Europe’s decarbonisation.</p> <p>As for Ukraine, there is ample evidence that the transit fees paid by Europeans for gas sourced from its old pipelines have ended up in the pockets of some less than reputable characters. And they are old pipelines, prone to leaks and explosions. Nord Stream 2 would be a cheaper and more efficient source of supply. Europe has every interest in helping Ukraine rebuild its economy, but the broken model of today isn’t necessarily what needs preserving.</p> <p>Some additionally argue that the growth of the liquefied natural gas market (LNG) makes pipelines and Nord Stream 2 less relevant. LNG can be shipped around the world. The developments over the past few days offer some pause for reflection.</p> <p>Most LNG is locked into long-term contracts – the majority of which are destined for Asia. As China emerged from the global pandemic it was insatiable in buying up the unreserved stock. Brazil added to the shortfall, as it turned to LNG to produce electricity normally generated by hydropower dams.</p> <p>Putin is not a man Europe wants to do business with. But the global energy crunch has given him and his pet project a powerful negotiating position – one that may force Europe’s hand. </p> <h2>BA may rue its lack of generosity</h2> <p>Two of the UK’s biggest airlines, British Airways and Ryanair, were adjudged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/07/regulator-drops-ba-and-ryanair-lockdown-flights-refund-case\" title=\"\">by the Competition and Markets Authority not to have broken the law when they refused to refund customers who were prevented by Covid rules from taking flights they had booked</a>. But the airlines were far from vindicated: only a lack of legal clarity and an uncertain court battle prompted the CMA to drop its investigation, and it stated unequivocally that passengers had unfairly lost out.</p> <p>Some may see this as a demonstration of the toothlessness of a CMA, but neither government nor the airlines come out of the chapter looking good. BA had called the CMA investigation – at a time when it was pole-axed by travel bans and making redundancies – “incredible”. Ryanair maintained more bullishly that it was providing the flights and obeying the law.</p> <p>The carriers had offered their most generous terms and conditions ever, refunding millions of cancelled flights and allowing free rebooking. Their own schedules were thrown into disarray at short notice by suddenly changing government travel rules. Any fine would have paled beside the billions airlines lost during the pandemic.</p> <p>Wider consumer behaviour also complicates the picture. Essential international travel was permitted – and those who needed to fly accepted the hardship of quarantine. As UK city hotels could testify after a summer of late cancellations, plenty of holidaymakers saw flexible Covid policies as a risk-free back-up plan.</p> <p>Many, though, will have been unjustly stung in situations that slipped through insurance policies. For low-fare Ryanair, low expectations are priced in. BA, however aggrieved it feels, should be concerned that customers will perceive it has not met a fairer standard. In the long run, more generous competitors may reap the rewards.</p> <h2>Dave, there’s a wee problem saving Christmas</h2> <p>He managed to dig the UK’s biggest supermarket out of a hole, and now the government is hoping Dave Lewis can rescue Christmas. As a supply chain tsar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/08/supply-chain-crisis-uk-government-brings-in-ex-tesco-boss-to-help-sort-issues\" title=\"\">the former Tesco boss has been tasked with fixing a crisis caused largely by staff shortages</a>. It started with lorry drivers, but retailers are now struggling to recruit warehouse workers, especially those with special skills, such as forklift truckers.</p> <p>After Brexit, many people who used to come from Europe for seasonal work can find better and more lucrative jobs elsewhere. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/24/uk-cabinet-split-over-solution-to-lorry-driver-shortage\" title=\"\">government’s slow and ill-conceived “action”</a> on resolving the issue is pushing industry into finding creative solutions. </p> <p>Tesco last week credited its investment in rail freight for helping it ride out the worst of the supply chain crisis: it has plans to increase the number of containers it transports by train from 65,000 a year to 90,000 at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/02/christmas-shortages-what-are-britons-ordering-this-year\" title=\"\">Christmas</a>.</p> <p>The supermarket is not the only one trying new ideas. Last week John Lewis was the latest business to open a driver academy, aiming to get 90 more people behind the wheel of a lorry every year.</p> <p>On a completely different tack, Ikea announced plans to shift production of some furniture from the far east to Turkey – cutting the distance goods will have to be shipped. And Ocado last week invested £10m in self-driving vehicle startup Wayve, and will trial four vans in London over the coming months (supported by human operators).</p> <p>Such ideas are, for now, a small-fry alternative to a battle for workers that has led to pay rises and big bonuses for some formerly underpaid and under-appreciated groups of employees.</p> <p>In the longer term, though, driving lorries in the UK must be made much more attractive.

It suggests Kenyatta and his close relatives have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/03/pandora-papers-biggest-ever-leak-of-offshore-data-exposes-financial-secrets-of-rich-and-powerful\">amassed more than $30m (£22m) of offshore wealth</a>, concealed in offshore tax havens such as Panama.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \\n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"179d4598-8722-426b-ae74-42cdf83cd84f\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p>The Pandora papers are the largest trove of leaked data exposing tax haven secrecy in history. They provide a rare window into the hidden world of offshore finance, casting light on the financial secrets of some of the world’s richest people. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which shared access with the Guardian, BBC and other media outlets around the world. In total, the trove consists of 11.9m files leaked from a total of 14 offshore service providers, totalling 2.94 terabytes of information. That makes it larger in volume than both the Panama papers (2016) and Paradise papers (2017), two previous offshore leaks.</p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p><strong>Where did the Pandora documents come from?</strong></p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p>The ICIJ, a Washington DC-based journalism nonprofit, is not identifying the source of the leaked documents. In order to facilitate a global investigation, the ICIJ gave remote access to the documents to journalists in 117 countries, including reporters at the Washington Post, Le Monde, El País, Süddeutsche Zeitung, PBS Frontline and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In the UK, the investigation has been led by the Guardian and BBC Panorama.</p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p><strong>What is an offshore service provider?</strong></p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p>The 14 offshore service providers in the leak provide corporate services to individuals or companies seeking to do business offshore. Their clients are typically seeking to discreetly set up companies or trusts in lightly regulated tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Panama, the Cook Islands and the US state of South Dakota. Companies registered offshore can be used to hold assets such as property, aircraft, yachts and investments in stocks and shares. By holding those assets in an offshore company, it is possible to hide from the rest of the world the identity of the person they actually belong to, or the “beneficial owner”.</p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p><strong>Why do people move money offshore?</strong></p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p>Usually for reasons of tax, secrecy or regulation. Offshore jurisdictions tend to have no income or corporation taxes, which makes them potentially attractive to wealthy individuals and companies who don’t want to pay taxes in their home countries. Although morally questionable, this kind of tax avoidance can be legal. Offshore jurisdictions also tend to be highly secretive and publish little or no information about the companies or trusts incorporated there. This can make them useful to criminals, such as tax evaders or money launderers, who need to hide money from tax or law enforcement authorities. It is also true that people in corrupt or unstable countries may use offshore providers to put their assets beyond the reach of repressive governments or criminal adversaries who may try to seize them, or to seek to circumvent hard currency restrictions. Others may go offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning.</p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p><strong>Has everyone named in the Pandora papers done something wrong?</strong></p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p>No. Moving money offshore is not in or of itself illegal, and there are legitimate reasons why some people do it. Not everyone named in the Pandora papers is suspected of wrongdoing. Those who are may stand accused of a wide range of misbehaviour: from the morally questionable through to the potentially criminal. The Guardian is only publishing stories based on leaked documents after considering the public interest. That is a broad concept that may include furthering transparency by revealing the secret offshore owners of UK property, even where those owners have done nothing wrong. Other articles might illuminate issues of important public debate, raise moral questions, shed light on how the offshore industry operates, or help inform voters about politicians or donors in the interests of democratic accountability.</p>\\n    <p></p>\\n   </div>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>A Biden administration official told Associated Press that Biden <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-abiy-ahmed-uhuru-kenyatta-ethiopia-africa-5c9fb5cd1e183b7a7ac065c23c169586\">would raise the Pandora papers</a> in one-on-one talks.</p> \\n<p>On Wednesday the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, was asked if it was “rich” to discuss transparency with Kenyatta given that he was a “poster boy” for the use of murky offshore structures.</p> \\n<p>Biden had been “quite vocal” on inequities in the financial system at home and abroad, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/10/13/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-october-13-2021/\">Psaki said</a>, avoiding a direct answer.</p> \\n<p>Kenyatta has denied wrongdoing. He claims he is not named in the leak – despite <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/kenya-uhuru-kenyatta-family-offshore-wealth/\">reporting to the contrary</a> – and says he will address the issue when he flies back to Kenya.</p> \\n<p>Like the Panama papers in 2016 – after which Iceland’s prime minister resigned – the Pandora papers have caused <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/political-and-business-links-to-pandora-papers-roil-parliaments-anti-corruption-and-tax-authorities-as-global-fallout-swells/\">large-scale political turmoil</a>, across Latin America and in Europe. The billionaire Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/11/czech-president-milos-zeman-still-in-hospital-andrej-babis-election-defeat\">lost an election last weekend</a> that he had been widely tipped to win.</p> \\n<p>Babiš’s defeat came after it emerged he had set up a network of offshore companies. In 2009 he used them to buy a £13m villa in the south of France. The news is likely to have contributed to his populist party, the Action for Dissatisfied Citizens (AN), losing about 8% of its backing, with opposition parties now holding a narrow parliamentary majority.</p> \\n<p>Babiš says the purchase predates his time in politics. He is attempting to stay in power. On Wednesday he claimed that his main political patron, the Czech president, Miloš Zeman, had told him to carry on. The claim could not be verified as Zeman is in hospital and, according to reports, gravely ill.</p> \\n<p>Meanwhile in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has dodged questions about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/03/revealed-anti-oligarch-ukrainian-president-offshore-connections-volodymyr-zelenskiy\">his ownership of an offshore company</a> in the British Virgin Islands. A comedian and actor turned politician, Zelenskiy won a landslide victory in a 2019 election by promising to clean up corruption.</p> \\n<p>While Zelenskiy declared several shell companies before the vote, he failed to disclose an interest in the firm Maltex Multicapital Corp. A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp0WWZbNGq4\">documentary by the website Slidstvo.info</a> unravelling Zelenskiy’s holdings has now been viewed 1.8m times, the highest number ever for a Ukrainian investigative film. On Monday Zelenskiy’s critics set up <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBe9weofal8\">an impromptu screening</a> outside his presidential palace in Kyiv as police looked on.</p> \\n<p>Zelenskiy’s defeated predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, has accused Zelenskiy of bringing Ukraine into international disrepute. Ironically enough, Poroshenko <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/04/panama-papers-ukraine-petro-poroshenko-secret-offshore-firm-russia\">featured in the 2016 Panama papers leak</a>. Zelenskiy’s associates have said he and his TV colleagues set up offshore companies in 2012 to protect their assets from the then president, Viktor Yanukovych, who has since fled to Russia.</p> \\n<p>Ukraine’s national agency for prevention of corruption is now examining official asset declarations by Zelenskiy and his longtime friend Ivan Bakanov. Bakanov is linked to the president’s network of companies and is executive chief of Ukraine’s powerful SBU security service. He has not replied to requests for comment. The agency’s findings are due on Monday.</p> \\n<p>Arguably, the Pandora papers have had the biggest impact in Latin America, where an estimated $40bn each year is diverted into offshore tax havens. A disproportionate number of past and present world leaders found in the data – 14 out of 35 – come from the region. Most hold conservative views. They include three wealthy businessmen who have gone on to become heads of state.</p> \\n<p>In Chile, opposition politicians have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/13/chile-sebastian-pinera-impeachment-proceedings-pandora-papers\">launched impeachment proceedings</a> against the billionaire president, Sebastián Piñera, after the leak exposed new details of his extensive financial interests. They allege possible irregularities in a controversial mining deal.</p> \\n<p>Piñera’s family sold their stake in the Dominga mine project in 2010 to his close friend and business partner Carlos Alberto Délano. Documents suggest the third instalment of the payment contained a clause requiring the government <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-10-04/pandora-papers-world-leaders\">not to strengthen environmental protections</a> in the proposed area for the mine in the north of Chile, next to a nature reserve.</p> \\n<p>Piñera is reaching the end of his four-year term in office. He has rejected the accusations and says no irregularities took place. Chile’s public prosecutor’s office has announced an investigation into possible bribery-related corruption charges and tax violations linked to the deal, which was completed in the British Virgin Islands.</p> \\n<p>In Ecuador, meanwhile, the legislature voted to launch an investigation into the offshore finances of <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/power-players/?player=guillermo-lasso\">President Guillermo Lasso</a>. It is alleged Lasso may have broken the law by moving money into tax havens, according to <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211011-ecuador-s-legislature-to-investigate-president-over-pandora-papers\">news reports</a>. Lasso has previously had ties to 10 offshore companies and trusts in Panama, as well as the US tax havens of South Dakota and Delaware.</p> \\n<p>Lasso says his past use of offshore shell companies was legitimate. None were related to his public service, he said, adding that he dissolved these entities before running for president.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2021/oct/15/masked-men-storm-moscow-screening-of-film-about-stalin-era-famine', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-10-15T12:36:35Z', 'webTitle': 'Masked men storm Moscow screening of film about Stalin-era famine', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/15/masked-men-storm-moscow-screening-of-film-about-stalin-era-famine', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/oct/15/masked-men-storm-moscow-screening-of-film-about-stalin-era-famine', 'fields': {'body': '<p>A group of masked men stormed the offices of a renowned human rights organisation in Moscow on Thursday to disrupt the screening of Mr Jones, a British co-produced film about the Holodomor, the Stalin-era famine that killed millions of peasants in Soviet Ukraine during the 1930s.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/11/mr-jones-review-agnieszka-holland-james-norton-berlin-film-festival\">2019 movie</a>, starring the British actor James Norton and directed by the Polish film-maker Agnieszka Holland, depicts the real-life story of Gareth Jones, a Welshman who is widely considered to have been the first journalist to document the famine, after repeated visits to the Soviet Union.</p> <p>In footage posted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/olegbut52/status/1448851772886429727\">online</a> on Thursday evening, about 30 people are seen entering the office of Memorial, Russia’s oldest NGO, which documents Soviet-era repressions.

In 2015 it was one of the first <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34767014\">organisations</a> to be labelled as a “foreign agent” under a 2012 law that obliges groups considered to have international funding to submit extensive documents every three months outlining their finances.</p> <p>The screening of Mr Jones comes at a time when a growing number of Russians view Stalin in a favourable light.

A cold one would complicate the unfinished battle with Covid and, more awkwardly, drive up demand for the natural gas that fires power stations and heats homes.

Gas markets are more complex than a tap that Mr Putin turns on and off.

The strategic implications of that decision are now a hot-button issue in Berlin and wider EU policy debates.</p> <p>It can be simultaneously true that Russia is not to blame for European energy vulnerability and that the Kremlin exploits the weakness to make mischief for political and commercial gain.</p> <p>The diplomatic dimension of the crisis comes about from the interaction of two distinct but related trends. One is Europe’s failure over many years to develop the kind of strategic resilience it needs in a world that has moved on from the era of expanding liberalisation and dissolving borders. European energy policy and infrastructure bear the imprint of the epoch, before the 2008 financial crisis, marked by complacency in viewing globalisation on terms dictated by liberal democracies as inevitable and irreversible.</p> <p>The second trend is Mr Putin’s abandonment of even a pretence of being a reliable partner on the global stage. Three decades have now elapsed since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the flame of Russian democracy that briefly flickered is now an ember protected by a brave but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/29/ruling-united-russia-party-offers-payouts-to-ensure-poll-victory\" title=\"\">endangered opposition</a>. Parliamentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/20/pro-putin-party-wins-majority-in-russian-elections-despite-declining-support\" title=\"\">elections last month</a> were rigged to guarantee a majority for the United Russia party that will do Mr Putin’s legislative bidding. The fraud was nothing new, but the techniques are becoming more elaborate to work around increasingly agile pro-democracy campaigners. Old Soviet-style repression is becoming more flagrant, as a means of generalised intimidation, to keep the population compliant. Mr Putin does not want momentum to build for any hint of regime change ahead of the next presidential poll in 2024.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Russians have endured a prolonged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/05/there-is-little-reason-to-be-cheerful-about-russias-growth-prospects\" title=\"\">cost-of-living crisis</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/09/russia-reports-record-daily-covid-death-toll-as-kremlin-shrugs-off-new-lockdown\" title=\"\">mismanaged pandemic</a>. Corruption, nationalistic swagger, malicious espionage and revenue from resource exports are what keep the Kremlin show on the road. It is hard, under those circumstances, for European leaders to develop policies based on the normal rules of diplomacy. That applies to Britain as much as the EU. Brexit gives no advantages on that front. It is a weakening of European solidarity that had Mr Putin’s moral (and, almost certainly, material) support.</p> <p>Relations in the short term are likely to remain volatile and chilly. Meanwhile, the whole of Europe must accelerate the transition to a more resilient, self-sufficient and renewable energy infrastructure. As the clocks go back in Britain this weekend, signalling the change of seasons, Boris Johnson must move on from petty post-Brexit ideological vendettas with Brussels, and re-engage sensibly with the EU on matters of foreign and security policy. The Channel is not a moat that can protect Britain from economic and political turbulence if the whole of Europe faces a cold, hard winter.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 29 October 2021.

Trump claimed, without evidence, that Biden sought the firing of the prosecutor so his son would escape scrutiny. Trump hoped to make the allegations a centerpiece of his 2020 re-election campaign.</p> <p>As part of that effort, Lutsenko, the then prosecutor general of Ukraine, analogous to the attorney general in the US, agreed to publicly announce a criminal investigation in Ukraine of Joe Biden and Hunter. <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/23/the-ukrainian-prosecutor-behind-trumps-impeachment\">Lutsenko </a>simultaneously had been a driving force to award Giuliani, Toensing and DiGenova the hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal retainers and contracts, according to the same sources described above.</p> <p>Only the unexpected election of a new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, with whom the plotting Ukrainian prosecutors had little or no influence, led them to abandon their<strong> </strong>plan – although only briefly. That’s because Trump was obsessed with getting it back on track as soon as possible.</p> <p>To that end, in July 2019, Trump made his now infamous “perfect” phone call to Zelenskiy – at the time he was withholding almost $400m in military aid to Ukraine – to pressure the new Ukrainian president to announce he was investigating the Bidens. The disclosure of Giuliani’s shadow diplomacy and Trump’s phone call with Zelenskiy led directly to Trump becoming only the third US president to face impeachment.</p> <p>Federal investigators have obtained documents and witness statements detailing how the three Ukrainian prosecutors would, at Giuliani’s behest, help Trump and Giuliani promote the Biden-Ukraine allegations, even if there was no truth in them, according to people close to the investigation.</p> <p>First, Lutsenko would publicly declare that he was reopening a long dormant investigation of Burisma, and that the Bidens were under investigation as part of the broader inquiry. A deputy of Lutsenko, Konstantin Kulyk, would take charge of the portion of the investigation that focused on the Bidens, and publicly verify any allegations of wrongdoing on their part. Finally, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/viktor-shokin-ukraine-prosecutor-trump-biden-hunter-joe-investigation-impeachment-a9147001.html\">Viktor Shokin</a>, a former prosecutor general of Ukraine, who had previously investigated<strong> </strong>Burisma, agreed to allege publicly that Biden had fired him to quash an investigation of Burisma he had conducted years earlier.</p> <p>Lutsenko and the others were so eager to gain influence in the Trump White House, through Giuliani, that they decided they could garner even greater access if they arranged for Giuliani’s personal enrichment. Even though Giuliani was engaged by then president Trump as his personal attorney, Trump did not pay him, a frustration that Giuliani expressed to the Ukrainians.</p> <p>Giuliani and Lutsenko reached a preliminary agreement in March 2019 between Giuliani and the Ukrainian ministry of justice and the Republic of Ukraine to assist Ukraine in recovering money in overseas bank accounts Lutsenko said was owed to his government. Various drafts of the contract called for Giuliani to receive either $300,000 or $500,000 for his work.</p> <p>Then, acting on Giuliani’s strong recommendation, Lutsenko, Kulyk and Shokin agreed to pay two lawyers close to Giuliani, Toensing and DiGenova, at least $250,000 to represent them as a means to publicize their various allegations about Hunter Biden and Burisma.</p> <p>The husband-wife legal team of Toensing and DiGenova are decades-long friends of Giuliani and ardent supporters of Trump. Like Giuliani and Trump, they have espoused various conspiracy theories that an amorphous and malign “deep state” had plotted against Trump to destroy him and his presidency.</p> <p>Along with Giuliani, Toensing and DiGenova are under federal criminal investigation by the United States attorney for the southern district of New York.</p> <p>On 12 April 2019, Toensing and DiGenova sent a draft retainer agreement to Lutsenko and Kulyk, agreeing to represent both men and to help uncover “evidence of illegal conduct in Ukraine regarding the United States” – an apparent reference to the allegations about the Bidens. The contract called on Lutsenko and Kulyk to pay a $125,000 retainer.</p> <p>Three days later, on 15 April, Toensing and DiGenova sent a similar retainer agreement to Shokin, agreeing to represent him “for the purpose of collecting evidence regarding his March 2016 firing as prosecutor general of Ukraine and the role of then vice-president Joe Biden in such firing, and presenting such evidence to US and foreign authorities”. That contract called for Shokin to pay the lawyers a $125,000 retainer.</p> <p>But a week later, their plans were suddenly upended: on 21 April, Ukraine overwhelmingly elected Zelenskiy as president.</p> <p>Lutsenko had been appointed prosecutor general by the outgoing Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko. It was unclear<strong> </strong>whether Lutsenko would remain as prosecutor general under Zelenskiy. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0985a7b282e96ae51673e452114870d25938c162\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0985a7b282e96ae51673e452114870d25938c162/0_152_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rudy Giuliani speaks to media outside his apartment building after the suspension of his law license in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rudy Giuliani speaks to media outside his apartment building after the suspension of his law license in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Kelly/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moreover, it was unlikely that a Zelenskiy regime would allow for a contract between Giuliani and the Ukrainian ministry of justice to move ahead. Giuliani has since claimed that he decided not to proceed with the contract because he began to have ethical qualms about representing Trump and the Ukrainians at the same time. In reality, Lutsenko probably did not have the influence or authority to award Giuliani the contracts.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Toensing and DiGenova had additional reservations about signing retainer agreements with the three Ukrainian prosecutors.</p> <p>Toensing and DiGenova feared that if they moved forward with their representation, they would have to abide by a federal transparency law known as the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or Fara, which requires Americans who provide legal, political or public relations advice to foreign governments or foreign political interests to register with the US justice department as foreign agents, and to disclose to the public in great detail everything they do on behalf of their foreign clients.</p> <p>The draft retainer agreements between Toensing and DiGenova and the Ukrainians demonstrate that compliance with Fara was clearly on their mind.</p> <p>The draft contracts for all three stated: “Client acknowledges that he has been advised that the firm’s services may entail services subject to the mandatory disclosure under United States law. In particular, the Foreign Agents Registration Act … requires the firm to register [as a foreign agent] and report some of its activities on behalf of particular political parties or entities.”</p> <p>Toensing and DiGenova did not want to register as foreign agents, investigators believe. After all, if the two high-powered attorneys officially acknowledged they were acting as agents of Ukrainian political interests, they would find it harder to appear on Fox News and other media venues, thereby making it more difficult to promote Trump’s various conspiracy theories regarding Ukraine.</p> <p>Federal investigators have also reviewed records and questioned witnesses regarding an instance in which Toensing had <a href=\"https://efile.fara.gov/docs/6445-Exhibit-AB-20170724-1.pdf\">registered as a foreign agent</a>: Toensing <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/158609/iraq-barzani-pentagon-oil-beverly-hills-mansion\">previously represented</a> the Kurdistan Democratic party, the largest political party in Iraqi Kurdistan, and the party’s representatives in the United States and Canada. That 2017 representation might prove to be powerful evidence for prosecutors if they were to charge Toensing, because it demonstrates both her familiarity and experience with Fara.</p> <p>Toensing learned first-hand the downside of registering as a foreign agent while representing the Kurds. She circulated a column to several publications advocating that the Kurds should have their own homeland. But it was turned down repeatedly because she was a foreign agent. Her column was eventually published in the Hill, where it received little attention.</p> <p>Another incentive for Toensing, DiGenova and Giuliani to avoid registering as foreign agents was that their work required greater secrecy. Although Poroshenko, the outgoing president, was willing to go along with backing an investigation of the Bidens, the new Zelenskiy regime, knowing there was no factual basis which might serve as a foundation for such an investigation, was refusing to proceed.</p> <p>That’s when Trump and Giuliani engaged in their campaign to force Zelenskiy to announce such an investigation by withholding the $400m in military aid.</p> <p>Still wanting to aid Trump and Giuliani, but not wanting to have to publicly disclose details of their activities, Toensing and DiGenova moved forward with providing much the same services to the three Ukrainians, but now without a formal retainer letter and no longer seeking to be paid for their services, witnesses have told federal investigators.</p> <p>Tessa Capeloto, a Washington-based attorney who has counseled clients on Fara matters for more than a decade, says that providing services to a foreign client for free or not executing a formal contract does not excuse lawyers from registering as a foreign agent and disclosing their activities to the public, in almost all such instances.</p> <p>“Even if services are provided on a pro-bono basis, a Fara registration requirement can still result,” Capeloto said in an interview. “Nor is it the case that a formal contract or other formal relationship with a foreign principal is needed to satisfy agency under the statute.”</p> <p>Federal prosecutors have identified more than two dozen specific acts by Giuliani, Toensing and DiGenova, the non-disclosure of which they believe constitutes evidence of Fara violations.</p> <p>These include everything from attempting to obtain a visa for Shokin to visit the United States when it was being held up at the state department, to having Trump fire a US ambassador to Ukraine who the Ukrainian prosecutors considered an adversary, to DiGenova amplifying their story on Fox News.</p> <p>Giuliani, through his attorney, Bob Costello, declined to comment for this story.</p> <p>But Giuliani has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-investigation.html\">previously said</a> that he could not have violated the federal agents registration law because he was acting on behalf of Trump in his dealings with the Ukrainians, telling the New York Times: “It would be kind of ridiculous to say that I was doing [anything] on Lutsenko’s behalf when I was representing the president of the United States.”</p> <p>Underscoring the seriousness of the criminal investigation, during the early morning hours of 29 April, FBI agents executed search warrants at Giuliani’s Madison Avenue apartment and his Park Avenue office in Manhattan, confiscating his cellphones and other electronic devices. Almost simultaneously, FBI agents executed a second search warrant at Toensing’s suburban Washington home.</p> <p>Papers unsealed in federal court in the southern district of New York on 28 September shed further light on the investigation. They described materials federal prosecutors have sought, including “retainer agreements with any Ukrainian national including former prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko” and “evidence of knowledge of Fara laws”.</p> <p>A source who has seen the search warrant for Giuliani says it also listed some 12 people investigators were seeking information on. Those include all three of the Ukrainian prosecutors: Lutsenko, Shokin and Kulyk. The search warrant also sought any records in Giuliani’s possession relevant to his communications with Toensing and DiGenova.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'film/2021/nov/09/natural-light-review-reprisals-and-revenge-in-chilling-examination-of-the-toll-of-war', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'film', 'sectionName': 'Film', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-11-09T10:00:08Z', 'webTitle': 'Natural Light review – reprisals and revenge in chilling examination of the toll of war', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/09/natural-light-review-reprisals-and-revenge-in-chilling-examination-of-the-toll-of-war', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2021/nov/09/natural-light-review-reprisals-and-revenge-in-chilling-examination-of-the-toll-of-war', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Hungarian director and documentarist Dénes Nagy makes his feature debut with this gruelling, slow-burning drama set in the vast trackless forests of the eastern front during the second world war, a film which won him the Silver Bear for best director at this year’s Berlin film festival. This is a world of brutality and fear from which the movie averts its gaze at key moments, but the chill is unmistakable. The title appears to refer to a light which is inexorably fading.</p> <p>Having become one of the Axis powers, Hungary sends troops into the grim, freezing forests of Ukraine to secure the territory, keep order, establish supply lines and root out pockets of pro-Soviet “partisans”, naturally making an example of them to cow the other resentful civilians into submission. István Semetka, played by Ferenc Szabó, is a corporal with a machine-gun unit on this grim mission: a diffident, blank-faced man with the semi-official job of taking photographs, who is mocked a little by his commanding officers. They move in on a village which is, at least apparently, docile enough. But having taken food from these peasants, the Hungarian unit move on and are set upon in the forest, the villagers having evidently told partisans their movements. Almost all the officers are killed except Semetka, who gets back to the village with the other survivors, to be met by Hungarian reinforcements, led by Koleszár (László Bajkó), a friend of Semetka’s. It is Koleszár who, via his insolent sergeant-major, orders Semetka out on a spurious task searching the forest, simply in order to get his gentle old friend out of the way, so that he can get on with the job of carrying out the necessary terrible reprisals.</p> <p>And how does Semetka feel about this? Is he, in fact, capable of feeling anything under these inhuman conditions? Could anyone? Apart from anything else, they are crucified with hunger nearly all the time. The film begins with an eerie extended sequence in which two peasants are carrying a dead elk downriver on a raft, when the Hungarian troops order them to stop and wordlessly begin cutting it up: this elk provides almost all their protein for the rest of the film.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRqaob6dDo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/enRqaob6dDo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The reprisals on both sides include a grisly form of humiliation. Two guards are punished for falling asleep on watch by being tied up with a placard around their necks; a village elder is murdered for fraternising with the Hungarian troops and punished the same way by the partisans with the placard “Traitor”. These ugly signs are almost a primitive war language, a crude declaration of meaning and identity.</p> <p>And there is the most dangerous label of all: “partisan”. The point is that everyone is a partisan: everyone has picked a side, and everyone can get killed for disloyalty. Semetka is loyal to the Nazis: he is hardly a hero, and though he does not witness the brutality, or in some sense chooses not to witness it, he does not dissent from it in any way, merely gratefully accepting Koleszár’s order to return to the city with wounded men. His emotions, his very consciousness, have been worn down to a mute stub.</p> <p>Natural Light is a reminder of the darkly inspirational potency of Elem Klimov’s 1985 war movie Come and See, surely an influence here, as it has been on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/11/the-painted-bird-review-vaclav-marhoul-stellan-skarsgard-harvey-keitel\">Václav Marhoul’s The Painted Bird</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/25/in-the-fog-review\">Sergei Loznitsa’s In the Fog</a> from 2012.

Is she dead? Hiding? Or perhaps she is frozen there by supernatural forces beyond his understanding, forces of terrible malign power.</p> <p>• Natural Light is released on \\u200b\\u200b12 November in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/arts', 'pillarName': 'Arts'}, {'id': 'film/2021/nov/09/volcano-review-ukrainian-adventure-takes-a-surreal-turn', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'film', 'sectionName': 'Film', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-11-09T12:00:07Z', 'webTitle': 'Volcano review – spoon-glueing Ukrainian adventure takes a surreal turn', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/09/volcano-review-ukrainian-adventure-takes-a-surreal-turn', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2021/nov/09/volcano-review-ukrainian-adventure-takes-a-surreal-turn', 'fields': {'body': '<p>“That’s our wandering buoy. It slipped its anchor near the dam. It appears and disappears at will.” A light, unfathomable absurdity governs this 2018 fiction debut by Ukrainian documentarian Roman Bondarchuk, set in the area around the city of Kherson; a sun-roasted steppe north of the Crimea where Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) interpreter Lukas (Serhiy Stepansky) becomes stranded. He’s escorting an SUV full of foreign delegates when it breaks down and he wanders off in search of a mobile signal. On his return, both car and foreigners have vanished.</p> <p>Hitching a ride, Lukas is invited to stay with Vova (Viktor Zhdanov), a middle-aged potterer living with his mother and daughter in a capacious ramshackle construction on the banks of the Dnieper river. So begins Lukas’s initiation – like a milder Ukrainian version of Wake in Fright – into the local anomie. Vova enjoys sticking spoons to his forehead using the supply of glue that was his severance payment from the Soviet fish farm he worked for; then Lukas gets an invite to a listless student party where someone nicks his jacket and wallet. Constantly slipping sly details into the frame, Bondarchuk handles the whole farrago with a lovely deadpan poise. Incensed by the theft, Lukas heads to the police station to make a complaint.

Taking place in a weird demilitarised zone between the present conflict and a deeper Soviet hinterland, Lukas’s adventure feels post-historical, post-democratic and – with everyone comically flailing for their bearings on this disorientating new frontier – almost post-ironic. Perhaps in its second half, Bondarchuk lets the drama get a little directionless, and the direction he does pick – Lukas’s fling with Vova’s daughter Murushka (Khrystyna Deylyk) – is a bit obvious. But combining roving vérité-style long takes with grand compositions such as the opening overhead cargo-ship shot, Bondarchuk is able to both immerse and surreally startle en route.</p> <p>• Volcano is released in cinemas on 12 November.</p> <p><br></p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/arts', 'pillarName': 'Arts'}, {'id': 'world/2021/nov/15/nato-chief-warns-russia-against-further-provocation-amid-ukraine-tensions', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-11-15T21:15:51Z', 'webTitle': 'Nato chief warns Russia against ‘further provocation’ amid Ukraine tensions', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/15/nato-chief-warns-russia-against-further-provocation-amid-ukraine-tensions', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/nov/15/nato-chief-warns-russia-against-further-provocation-amid-ukraine-tensions', 'fields': {'body': '<p>The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has cautioned Moscow against “any further provocation or aggressive actions” following warnings by US officials that Russia could be preparing to a launch a winter offensive in Ukraine.</p> <p>The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said last week that Russia had amassed nearly 100,000 soldiers near Ukraine’s border, as Washington warned that Moscow may be “attempting to rehash” its 2014 invasion.</p> <p>“We have seen large and unusual concentrations of Russian forces close to Ukraine’s borders,” Stoltenberg said on Monday. “Nato remains vigilant … Any further provocation or aggressive actions by Russia would be of serious concern.

And for what? The exact intentions informing the large-scale deployment of Russian forces close to Ukraine’s eastern border remain opaque. But it seems increasingly clear that the tensions stoked by Vladimir Putin in the spring – when a prior military build-up took place – were the initial phase of a new approach rather than a one-off performative episode. After five years of frozen conflict, a worrying thaw appears to be taking place.</p> <p>In April, having marched tens of thousands of troops to the Ukrainian border, Mr Putin announced a partial pull-back, to the relief of Kyiv and the west. It has since emerged that the retreat was merely superficial; troops stayed in the region and many of the tanks, ballistic missiles and assorted artillery remain in place. This hardware is now supplemented by an estimated 100,000 troops to the north, south and east of the Donbass region of Ukraine, controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/15/nato-chief-warns-russia-against-further-provocation-amid-ukraine-tensions\" title=\"\">warned</a> Moscow this week against “further provocation or aggressive actions” against an EU neighbour and ally. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/us/politics/russia-blinken-ukraine.html\" title=\"\">said</a> that any such aggression would be a “serious mistake”. But Tuesday’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/16/germany-suspends-approval-for-nord-stream-2-gas-pipeline\" title=\"\">decision</a> by the German energy regulator to temporarily suspend certification of the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline adds another unpredictable dimension to an unstable situation. The pipeline, which will allow Russia to bypass Ukraine when transporting energy to Germany, is seen by Kyiv as a threat to both its finances and security.</p> <p>US intelligence <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4eada1f-2849-4d3a-9c40-be797addd8cb\" title=\"\">suggests</a> a high probability of Russian military intervention. An outright invasion would constitute an enormous geopolitical risk for the Kremlin to take, as sanctions imposed in 2014 continue to bite hard. But it is evident that Mr Putin has decided that the time is right to substantially raise the temperature in the Donbass. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, elected in 2019, has not proved as amenable to Russian influence and demands as anticipated, and Moscow has railed at treason charges brought against the pro-Russian politician and key Putin ally, <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putins-key-ukraine-ally-charged-with-treason/\" title=\"\">Viktor Medvedchuk</a>. The military build-up vastly enhances the Kremlin’s scope to convincingly sabre-rattle and react rapidly to alleged provocations. Moscow’s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/kremlin-says-turkish-drones-risk-destabilising-situation-east-ukraine-2021-10-27/\" title=\"\">suggestion</a> that a recent drone attack in a separatist-controlled area could “destabilise the situation” is likely to be a taste of things to come. Having decided that moribund peace negotiations no longer serve its primary purpose of bullying Kyiv and obstructing its relationships with the EU and Nato, Moscow appears to be enacting a highly threatening plan B.</p> <p>The military build-up thus represents a de facto escalation of a conflict that, while continuing to claim lives, has remained relatively static since the Minsk II agreement was signed in 2015. The west must make it clear to Moscow that upping the ante further will carry a substantial economic cost in the form of further sanctions and scupper the Nord Stream 2 project. From Bosnia to Belarus, Mr Putin’s baleful influence in the former Soviet sphere is deepening. Robust western solidarity with Kyiv will be needed to prevent a resurgence of the same in Ukraine this winter.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/opinion', 'pillarName': 'Opinion'}, {'id': 'politics/2021/nov/17/uk-defence-minister-to-visit-poland-amid-border-dispute-with-belarus', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-11-17T19:09:22Z', 'webTitle': 'UK defence minister to visit Poland amid border dispute with Belarus ', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/17/uk-defence-minister-to-visit-poland-amid-border-dispute-with-belarus', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2021/nov/17/uk-defence-minister-to-visit-poland-amid-border-dispute-with-belarus', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Britain’s defence minister will visit Poland on Thursday hoping to set out how UK troops can help strengthen the country’s border with Belarus at a time when thousands of migrants are trying to cross into the EU.</p> <p>The mission comes two days after Ben Wallace visited Ukraine, where the two countries finalised an arms deal, and underlines the UK’s post-Brexit willingness to reach defence agreements with countries near Russia’s borders.</p> <p>A study team of about 10 UK soldiers, invited over by Warsaw last week, are racing to complete an assessment before the summit between Wallace and his Polish counterpart, Mariusz Błaszczak.</p> <p>The expectation is that Poland will ask for a British contingent of engineers to help with reinforcing the border fence, which has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/17/belarusian-border-crisis-could-last-for-months-says-polish-minister\">repeatedly breached by people</a>, mostly from the Middle East, desperate to start new lives in the west.</p> <p>Poland, embroiled in a constitutional dispute with the EU, has refused to allow the EU’s Frontex border agency to help, declaring a state of emergency on the frontier and denying access to media and humanitarian agencies.</p> <p>Aid agencies have criticised the UK’s approach to the crisis.

In both cases the US could be drawn into a conflict, with potentially catastrophic results.</p> <p>The head of Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency, Brig Gen Kyrylo Budanov, told the Military Times on Saturday that Russia had more than 92,000 troops around Ukraine’s borders and was preparing for an attack in January or February. Others say the threat is not so imminent and that Russia has a lot to lose by invading Ukraine, but few if any experts would rule out an invasion entirely.</p> <p>In confronting Putin over Ukraine, every policy option available to Biden is fraught with risk.</p> <p>In a statement on Wednesday commemorating the Holodomor famine in Ukraine of the early 1930s, Biden restated “our unwavering support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”. Such statements of support are meant as a deterrent, but each time they are repeated they heighten the dilemma that Biden will face if Putin calls his bluff.</p> <p>“What I am worried about, frankly, is that if we, the United States, continue to make ironclad commitments to Ukraine and get ourselves in a position where we are obliged to defend it, or not to defend it and look completely weak, we will be putting ourselves in a very difficult position,” said Rajan Menon, a professor of political science at the City University of New York.</p> <p>Hanna Shelest, the director of security programmes at the Foreign Policy Council’s <a href=\"http://prismua.org/en/pro-radu/\">Ukrainian Prism</a> thinktank, said US support for Ukrainian sovereignty did not imply it would ultimately be drawn into combat.</p> <p>“There has been panic and hype about new American boots on the ground. Come on, who is inviting you to fight?” Shelest said. “When we talk about a guarantee of security there are plenty of other options. For example, sharing intelligence, the satellite pictures of the buildup, and making it public is already a support. You don’t need an American soldier to stand at the contact line. You can have diplomatic statements at the proper level that are very clear.”</p> <p>CNN has reported there is an urgent policy debate in the Biden administration over whether to step up deliveries of weaponry, such as Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. Some in the administration say such weapons would raise the costs of any Russian military incursion and thereby influence Putin’s calculations. Others argue it would represent a dangerous escalation, and increase fear of a US or Nato attack, which is at the base of Russia’s aggressive military stance.</p> <p>“You’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t,” said Fiona Hill, a former senior director for European and Russian affairs in the national security council.</p> <p>Hill helped prepare for Donald Trump’s summits with Putin and advised the Biden team before his first meeting as president with the Russian leader in June. She said new talks were urgent and essential, but did contain traps Biden would have to avoid.</p> <p>“The problem right now is the way that Russia is framing the Ukraine issue as a very stark choice: the United States capitulate on Ukrainian sovereignty – over the heads of not just Ukraine but also of Europe – or risk all-out war,” Hill said. She added that the Kremlin had long wanted to return to the cold war paradigm of the two superpowers sitting down and deciding on spheres of influence.</p> <p>One of the solutions being floated is for Russian fears to be assuaged by ruling out future Nato membership for Ukraine as well as putting limits on its military capabilities, but Hill said that would make a nonsense of Ukraine’s sovereignty, setting a damaging precedent.</p> <p>“We can have a virtual summit. We can have the sitdown with the United States and Russia, but Ukraine can’t be on the bargaining table. We can talk about strategic stability, but we’re not in a position to bargain away Ukraine,” Hill said. “And it can’t just be the United States. The Europeans have to take this seriously.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/22/russia-accuses-west-of-building-up-forces-on-its-borders\">Russia accuses west of building up forces on its borders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Menon, a co-author of the 2015 book Conflict in Ukraine: The Unwinding of the Post-Cold War Order, suggested that the imminent threat was being exaggerated.

He added: “Britain is an important ally. Boris Johnson does not look like he is afraid to confront Putin and he is calling things by their names.” He pointed out the UK could not be decisive since the outcome could depend on EU energy law.</p> <p>Vitrenko argued the current Russian pipeline through Ukraine acted as “an important deterrent to a full-scale war” since if an invasion happened once Nord Stream 2 gas started flowing, “the revenues of Russia will not be affected, European consumers will not be affected – what we will hear is some deep concerns from European politicians, but it will not change Russia policy or military aggression.”</p> <p>It was thought the long running economic and political battle against the 1,200-mile pipeline had been largely lost since so much of the construction was complete, and because the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/18/us-warns-nord-stream-pipeline-is-russian-geopolitical-project\">Biden administration</a>, in a compromise agreement with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/16/germany-suspends-approval-for-nord-stream-2-gas-pipeline\">Germany</a> in May, dropped sanctions against the $10bn pipeline. Germany instead agreed to provide Ukraine with a subsidy to transition to green energy.</p> <p>But British ministers intent on backing Ukraine do not think the battle to contain Nord Stream – one largely conducted inside the EU - is lost. They point to paragraph two in the German-US statement of June, which says: “Should Russia attempt to use energy as a weapon or commit further aggressive acts against Ukraine, Germany will take action at the national level and press for effective measures at the European level, including sanctions, to limit Russian export capabilities to Europe in the energy sector, including gas, and/or in other economically relevant sectors.”</p> <p>The UK claims Russia has been endangering European allies by limiting gas supplies in exactly the way that the agreement sought to rule out, a view strongly shared by many US Republican senators who are now blocking the defence budget to block Nord Stream.</p> <p>Britain is also testing the water to see how the new German coalition will handle Nord Stream 2, noting the coalition agreement was silent on the issue. At least rhetorically, the new government is much tougher about defending Ukraine and Russian human rights abuses, British officials believe.</p> <p>Oliver Krischer, a German Green politician, tipped by some to join the new super ministry for the climate and the economy, told Frankfurter Allgemeine this week: “Since gas demand will not increase in Germany or Europe, I see no need for Nord Stream 2. There is no commitment to this in the coalition agreement.”</p> <p>To add to the sense of policy in flux, certification of the pipeline was temporarily suspended by Germany’s energy regulator on 16 November on the technical grounds that its owners, Russia’s Gazprom, had created a German subsidiary for the German branch of the pipeline that did not meet the requirements of domestic law. </p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2021/dec/01/us-warns-russia-plans-large-scale-attack-on-ukraine', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-12-01T17:15:59Z', 'webTitle': 'US warns Russia has plans for ‘large scale’ attack on Ukraine', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/01/us-warns-russia-plans-large-scale-attack-on-ukraine', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/dec/01/us-warns-russia-plans-large-scale-attack-on-ukraine', 'fields': {'body': '<p>The US says it has evidence Russia has made plans for a “large scale” attack on Ukraine and that Nato allies are “prepared to impose severe costs” on Moscow if it attempts an invasion.</p> <p>Speaking at a Nato ministers meeting in Latvia, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said it was unclear whether Vladimir Putin had made a decision to invade but added: “He’s putting in place the capacity to do so in short order, should he so decide.</p> <p>“So despite uncertainty about intention and timing, we must prepare for all contingencies while working to see to it that Russia reverses course.”</p> <p>He said he had found solidarity among his fellow Nato ministers in the Latvian capital, Riga, saying the alliance was “prepared to impose severe costs for further Russian aggression in Ukraine” and would “reinforce its defences on the eastern flank”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/26/ukrainian-intelligence-warns-russia-backed-december-coup\">Ukraine has uncovered Russian-linked coup plot, says president </a> </p> </aside>  <p>While repeating the US position that Washington is “unwavering in our support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and committed to our security partnership with Ukraine”, the secretary of state stopped well short of saying the US or the alliance would intervene militarily. “Should Russia follow the path of confrontation, when it comes to Ukraine, we’ve made clear that we will respond resolutely, including with a range of high impact economic measures that we have refrained from pursuing in the past,” Blinken said.</p> <p>He did not specify the nature of those measures, but most observers believe that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/30/truss-urges-nato-allies-to-block-russias-nord-stream-2-gas-pipeline\">Nord Stream 2 pipeline project</a>, intended to bring Russian gas to Europe, could be cancelled if there is another invasion.

The White House has signalled it is open to the idea but no date has been agreed. On Wednesday, Putin proposed holding negotiations to ensure Nato would not accept new members along Russia’s borders.</p> <p>“In dialogue with the United States and its allies, we will insist on developing concrete agreements that exclude any further Nato advances to the east and the deployment of weapons systems threatening us in close proximity to Russian territory,” he said during a ceremony at the Kremlin. “We propose to start substantive negotiations on this matter.”</p> <p>The suggestion that Russia and the US in effect hammer out spheres of influence was direct even for Putin, who has denied that Russia’s recent buildup near Ukraine is anything but defensive in nature.</p> <p>The Biden administration is seeking to avoid being drawn into a situation where the US is negotiating Ukraine’s future over the heads of the government in Kyiv and its European neighbours.

Earlier this week President Vladimir Putin warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/30/russia-will-act-if-nato-countries-cross-ukraine-red-lines-putin-says\">increased Nato military support for Ukraine would cross a “red line”</a>. In particular, he warned against the stationing in Ukraine of western missile defence systems, similar to those in Romania or Poland.</p> <p>The focus on arms links to broader reasons on why Russia might want to force the issue. Orysia Lutsevych, a Ukrainian analyst from the Chatham House foreign policy thinktank, said that “time plays in Ukraine’s favour” as it seeks to develop along western lines.</p> <p>Putin does not want Kyiv to drift gradually and decisively into the western sphere, she adds. “Russia wants greater control over its near abroad and to prevent Nato enlargement – and that includes Georgia as well Ukraine,” she said.</p> <p>It is easy to argue that recent developments are designed by Russia to test the west and the US’s resolve, particularly as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/24/german-parties-agree-coalition-deal-to-make-olaf-scholz-chancellor\">a new left-leaning German government</a> is poised to take over. However, western diplomats emphasise that Ukraine is not a member of Nato and that therefore there is no obligation to defend the country if attacked.</p> <p>Instead Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, emphasised an economic response on Wednesday morning. “We all made it very clear that there will be a high price to pay and sanctions is one of the options,” although Melvin added that years of escalating sanctions have “raised the costs to Russia but not deterred it”.</p> <p>A full-scale attack remains hard to imagine, however, and Russia’s aim is most likely diplomatic. Melvin believes that Russia hopes to restart the stalled <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/eastern-europe/ukraine/260-peace-ukraine-ii-new-approach-disengagement\">Minsk peace process</a>, the 2014-2015 agreements struck after Russia seized Crimea and separatists took over the Donbass region, now divided from the rest of the country by sniping over military frontlines.</p> <p>“Russia wants to neutralise Ukraine and turn it into a buffer state. It would be optimal, from its point of view, to have Donbass recognised as autonomous with a leadership elected under Russia’s control, with a veto over Kyiv’s foreign policy,” he said.</p> <p>Such an interpretation of the Minsk agreements would, however, be politically unsellable to Ukraine, which is partly why their implementation has been stalled. With western leaders, such as the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, again declaring on Thursday “support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”, the trial of strength between west and east has some way to run.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2021/dec/02/us-and-russia-no-closer-to-breakthrough-on-ukraine-after-talks', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-12-02T17:56:19Z', 'webTitle': 'Biden and Putin to hold talks after diplomats make no progress on Ukraine ', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/02/us-and-russia-no-closer-to-breakthrough-on-ukraine-after-talks', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/dec/02/us-and-russia-no-closer-to-breakthrough-on-ukraine-after-talks', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin are due to hold talks “in the near future” after their top diplomats made no apparent progress in Stockholm towards defusing a standoff over Ukraine, amid fears of a Russian invasion.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, opted not to make a joint appearance after trading threats during a 40-minute meeting whose short duration indicated there was little chance of a breakthrough.</p> <p>“We had a very direct, very candid, non-polemical exchange of views,” Blinken said afterwards. “It was serious; it was sober.

And he has never reconciled to the post-Soviet loss of cold war-era satellite republics in eastern Europe. This is especially true of Ukraine.</p> <p>The Russian view that Ukraine is stolen territory to which it has a natural right has roots in tsarist times and before. Ukrainians (and Belarusians) were habitually called “little Russians”. Indigenous narratives stress a common history and common faith indissolubly linking two brotherly eastern Slavic races. Putin has repeatedly stated that “Russians and Ukrainians are one people”.</p> <p>Conveniently forgotten is 19th-century imperial oppression that included a ban on Ukraine’s language. In 1918, after the Russian Revolution, Ukraine declared its independence, only to have it swiftly snuffed out. In the 1930s, a man-made “terror famine”, known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor\" title=\"\">Holodomor</a>, killed more than 7 million mostly ethnic Ukrainians and is now officially viewed as a Soviet genocide.</p> <p>Despite all this, Putin views modern Ukraine’s bid for closer ties to the EU and Nato as a betrayal. This attitude recalls that of 1950s France towards Algeria and of 19th-century England towards Ireland. Yet he also appears to be genuinely fearful that Kyiv’s westwards lurch, encouraged and exploited by the US and allies, <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2021-11-22/russia-wont-let-ukraine-go-without-fight\" title=\"\">poses a threat</a> to Russia.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The US debacle in Afghanistan may have convinced Putin that another adventure in Ukraine could yield positive dividends</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Understanding a little of this shared history is essential to understanding why current tensions on Ukraine’s borders have the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/01/us-warns-russia-plans-large-scale-attack-on-ukraine\" title=\"\">potential to explode</a> into a European war.

By stationing more than 90,000 troops and heavy weapons around Ukraine’s borders, Putin may be trying to push Kyiv and the west into a permanent settlement, the lifting of sanctions and formal recognition of Crimea’s new status.</p> <p>But he has other motives, too. Moscow has always objected to Nato’s post-1990 eastwards expansion, especially into Poland and the Baltic republics.

So that much is straightforward and clear.”</p> <p>Russia has virtually frozen direct contacts with the Ukraine government and Zelenskiy, whom it has accused of preparing his own attack against regions of south-east Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed forces. Ukraine has strongly denied the claims.</p> <p>The Ukraine defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, on Friday told its parliament that Russia had an estimated 94,000 troops near the Ukrainian border and may be preparing an offensive beginning in late January. US officials have given similar estimates of Russian troop numbers and potential timeline for an attack as Putin upped his rhetoric about the west crossing Russia’s “red lines” in terms of providing military support to the Kyiv government.</p> <p>Both western and Russian analysts have said that Moscow is making a credible threat of launching a large-scale military offensive, although there are differing estimates to how likely a Russian offensive is and what may trigger it.</p> <p>“This is the largest Russian military deployment completely out of cycle that we’ve probably seen period, certainly since 2014,” said Michael Kofman, the research programme director in the Russia studies programme at the CNA security thinktank.</p> <p>Kofman said the size of the buildup – the second this year – unusual troop movements and efforts to prepare reservists were far more elaborate than required to send a credible threat to Ukraine and its western allies. “You could intimidate or scare people with a much smaller force, much more visibly deployed,” he said.</p> <p>The Russian government has accused Washington of creating war hysteria, but Putin has publicly directed government officials to maintain high levels of tension with the west to make sure that its interests are not ignored.</p> <p>Ukrainians have strongly opposed having their fate dictated by the Russian government and officials have called for more military and economic support from the west.</p> <p>Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent Russian foreign policy analyst, said he did not believe Russia was imminently preparing to launch an offensive. But Moscow had shown that it was ready to use force if it could not negotiate a change to the post-cold war security arrangement in Europe, he said.</p> <p>“There is a real red line,” he said. “Right or wrong. But Russia perceives any kind of military alignment between Ukraine and the west, not necessarily Nato membership … That is seen here as absolutely unacceptable.” </p> <p>He said Putin had shown a personal interest in the conflict’s outcome. “He’s not under time pressure because I don’t see any signs that he is going to leave soon,” said Lukyanov. “But he sees his duty as president not to leave this problem for the next leadership.”</p> <p>There are modest expectations for what Biden and Putin can achieve in Tuesday’s video call, and much will depend on whether Russia at least halts its military buildup after the negotiations.</p> <p>“I’d love them to walk out of this and see Russian forces start to pull back, but I think the Russian forces are going to stay where they are until there’s more of a deal because they are Russia’s leverage,” said Olga Oliker, Crisis Group’s programme director for Europe and central Asia. The considerable Russian forces arrayed on Ukraine’s border were, she said, “reminding you that the unthinkable is there”.</p> <p>The decision of whether or not to engage with the Kremlin in negotiations has elicited strong opinions in Washington and in European capitals, where policy is often presented as either one of strict deterrence or appeasement.</p> <p>Lukyanov said that just an agreement to hold further talks on European security could be viewed as a success in Moscow. But after threats of an invasion for the second time since April, pressure is also growing on the Kremlin to walk away with a concrete win or risk seeing its threats disregarded in the future.</p> <p>“Just to de-escalate for nothing now would be a loss,” said Kofman.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2021/dec/07/ukraine-russia-latvia-foreign-minister-invasion-warning', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-12-07T13:13:28Z', 'webTitle': 'Prepare a swift response to Russia invading Ukraine, Latvia tells west', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/07/ukraine-russia-latvia-foreign-minister-invasion-warning', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/dec/07/ukraine-russia-latvia-foreign-minister-invasion-warning', 'fields': {'body': '<p>A swift reprisal package against Russia – including US troops and Patriot missiles stationed in the Baltics, the cutting off of Russia from the Swift banking payments system and reinstated sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline – must be prepared now in case it invades Ukraine, the Latvian foreign minister has said.</p> <p>The warning from Edgars Rinkēvičs comes as Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin prepare to hold talks about the growing tensions.</p> <p>The US has said it would send reinforcements to Nato’s eastern flank in the event of an invasion, as well as imposing severe new economic measures against Russia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0216abbbfabe1b16572727a7ffd9655fc68d7cf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0216abbbfabe1b16572727a7ffd9655fc68d7cf3/708_0_1867_2333/800.jpg\" alt=\"Edgars Rinkēvičs\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Latvia’s foreign minister, Edgars Rinkēvičs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With an estimated 100,000 Russian troops already gathered within striking distance of the borders, the situation is the worst it’s been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/ukraine-ceasefire-aims-pave-way-comprehensive-settlement-crisis\">since 2015</a>, when Moscow staged a large-scale incursion into Ukraine, clandestinely sending tanks and artillery to encircle Ukrainian troops and compelling Kyiv to sign a peace agreement in Minsk that has since come close to collapse.</p> <p>Rinkēvičs said he had already discussed the issue with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, when Latvia hosted the Nato foreign ministers summit last week.</p> <p>“Russia has to know that if you do something bad in Ukraine then the Nato and US presence in the eastern flank of the alliance will increase.

Nikolai Patrushev, a former intelligence officer who now heads the Kremlin’s security council, has represented Russia during meetings with the CIA director, William Burns. In recent remarks, he called Ukraine a “protectorate” and warned of a potential of an “outburst of tensions so strong that millions of Ukrainians will flee to seek refuge in other places”.’</p> <p>But even if the Kremlin bluster is just a smokescreen for Russian power politics, Kremlin officials have indicated that they think they can merely conclude agreements over Kyiv’s head or manage public opinion through friendly elites. Direct engagement with the administration of Volodymyr Zelensky has virtually ceased.</p> <p>“The key problem is that Russia denies Ukraine any agency,” said Orysia Lutsevych, a research fellow and manager of the Ukraine forum in the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House. “They genuinely believe that Ukraine is a kind of puppet state … That’s why I believe the situation is so dangerous because Putin is demanding something that Biden cannot give.”</p> <p>For instance, Moscow has said Biden should force Kyiv to negotiate directly with Russian-backed separatist governments as agreed to in a 2015 peace deal. But both sides have violated that deal and public opinion in Ukraine strongly opposes direct negotiations with forces viewed as Russian proxies. The demand is a non-starter.</p> <p>Putin’s anger over Ukraine’s 2014 revolution, in which a pro-western government replaced that of Viktor Yanukovych, has become intertwined with other historical grievances, specifically the accession of former Soviet countries into Nato in 2004.</p> <p>Putin does believe in his rhetoric about Ukrainian statehood, said Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder of the R.Politik political analysis firm, but is primarily focused on the perceived security threats posed by Nato.</p> <p>“In my view, if he begins a military operation against Ukraine … it won’t be for him to try to reclaim what he considers Russian [land],” she said. “It will be to stake out territory where he believes there could be Nato missiles.”</p> <p>For many Russians, Ukraine remains a blind spot that is viewed primarily as a junior partner.</p> <p>“They view Ukraine as their little brother and they have a subconscious fear that the little brother will achieve more than the older,” said Abbas Gallyamov, a Russian political analyst and former speechwriter for Putin.</p> <p>And Putin’s rhetoric has convinced many that he is among them.</p> <p>“He still believes Ukraine is a kind of conspiracy, a kind of aberration,” said Klimkin. “It’s all about Slavic unity, about trying to get Ukraine away from Russia.

The enemy is just 50 metres away behind a concrete slab. From time to time Russian voices float eerily across a wintry no man’s land of ragged trees and scrub.</p> \\n<p>“When they light their stoves you can see the smoke,” Novitskyi – a senior lieutenant in the Ukrainian army – said, speaking from what is in effect Europe’s eastern front with Russia. He added: “Every day they shoot at us.”</p> \\n<p>The conflict between Kyiv and pro-Russian separatists has gone on for nearly eight long years. There are first world war echoes. Both sides face off along a fixed 250-mile “border”, or line of contact, which snakes across Ukraine’s Donbas region.</p> \\n<p>There are muddy trenches, fortified command posts and buildings smashed up by shell fire. Novitskyi defends a former textiles factory. It is now a ghostly and roofless ruin. On a wall someone has scrawled a helpful reminder: “Fuck up and you die.”</p> \\n<p>All is quiet until it isn’t. On Thursday morning Ukrainian soldiers were making their way towards a nearby frontline position overlooking the city of Donetsk. The separatists are based at its wrecked airport, along what was once the runway. Three shots rang out: sniper rounds.</p> \\n<p>The soldiers quickened their pace. A pheasant rose from a yellow field marked out with red signs warning of mines and unexploded ordnance. Old-fashioned metal wires connect the brigade’s forward post – an ant-hill-like embankment with bunkers and ladders – to its nearby village HQ.</p> \\n<p>Much of the diplomacy of the past week is reminiscent of a bygone age, too. Vladimir Putin has made no secret of his contempt for Ukraine. It is, in his view, sub-sovereign: less of a country, more an enduring zone of Russian imperial influence and control.</p> \\n<p>In 2014 Putin seized Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula and installed separatist proxies in Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk, adjoining Russia. What Putin intends next is worryingly unclear.</p> \\n<p>The signs are ominous. This autumn Moscow has amassed troops and heavy weapons right across Ukraine’s borders. Satellite images showing about 175,000 Russian soldiers have spooked the US and its allies. It remains unclear whether this is a negotiating tactic or buildup to invasion.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2fb9b93cd0e77122f4ffbc2cdaec623bd1e75c0\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2fb9b93cd0e77122f4ffbc2cdaec623bd1e75c0/59_12_1330_798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukraine frontline\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n</figure> \\n<p>On Tuesday Joe Biden spoke to Putin for two hours via video link. The US president reaffirmed his commitment to Ukraine’s territorial integrity. But he refused to offer Putin what he wants: a cast-iron guarantee that Kyiv will never join Nato.</p> \\n<p>Biden on Thursday briefed Ukraine’s comedian turned president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on his talks with his Russian counterpart. Eastern European nations are concerned. They fear the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/09/eastern-europe-urges-nato-unity-in-biden-talks-with-russia\">is preparing to “accommodate” the Kremlin’s apparent security concerns</a> – thereby rewarding Moscow for solving a problem it created.</p> \\n<p>Why Putin has chosen this moment to escalate tensions is a mystery. One theory is that he realises Ukraine is moving inexorably away from Moscow’s orbit. For his part, Novitskyi rejected Putin’s recent assertion made in an essay that Ukraine and Russia are “a single people”.</p> \\n<p>Novitskyi said: “Russia is stuck in the Soviet past. Ukraine is travelling in another direction, towards the west and Europe. We are an independent nation.</p> \\n<p>“Russia and Ukraine are not one people but black and white, yin and yang.”</p> \\n<p>Earlier this week Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, toured the frontline where Novitskyi is based, at an industrial area in the city of Avdiyivka. A little way to the south is Donetsk, under rebel control since 2014.</p> \\n<p>Reznikov predicts there will be a bloody massacre, should Moscow attack, with both sides taking huge casualties. For now, nobody knows whether Putin’s tanks will advance here, across a landscape of vast black fields, belching chimney stacks and Orthodox churches adorned with glinting gold cupolas.</p> \\n<p>The existing conflict might seem retro in nature, but this is very much a 21st-century war. “We have better weapons than in the past,” Lt Alexander Tymoshuk pointed out, standing in a trench corridor fixed up with netting and reinforced with metal plates.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7e98922ab052488ea8fb872a3f7ee615c4d0f5b\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7e98922ab052488ea8fb872a3f7ee615c4d0f5b/46_0_1375_825/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukraine frontline\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n</figure> \\n<p>In the first world war, reconnaissance involved sending out groups of men. Now surveillance cameras could detect any movement or intrusion, Tymoshuk noted. Ukraine recently used for the first time a Turkish-made drone <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=467614907881638&amp;ref=sharing\">to blow up a Russian-made howitzer</a>.</p> \\n<p>Paradoxically, those serving on the Ukrainian frontline say they are unworried by the threat of invasion. They claim Kyiv’s army is stronger, more experienced and better equipped than it was eight years ago, when it crumpled under superior Russian firepower.</p> \\n<p>According to Vitaly Barabash, Avdiyivka’s mayor, Russia would soon find itself embroiled in a partisan war, were it to grab more territory. He estimated about 300,000 military veterans would pick up weapons – in contrast to 2014, when some of the patriotic volunteers who fought and died were IT workers from Kyiv.</p> \\n<p>Too much blood had already been spilled on the front, he said, and on the Maidan, the central square in Kyiv where in 2014 anti-government protesters ousted Ukraine’s pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych. He added: “We won’t go back to Russia. Nobody wants to be Putin’s slave.”</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0125f4e68f1e54f50038fd168e39ed545975a38\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0125f4e68f1e54f50038fd168e39ed545975a38/70_8_1349_809/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukraine frontline\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n</figure> \\n<p>As Biden prepares to hold further talks with Moscow, including over Nato, people continue to die. Since September, 16 members of the Ukrainian forces have been killed, including a 22-year-old private shot dead last week. Most are killed by snipers or IEDs. Others are wounded.</p> \\n<p>“It’s really hard to take casualties. Some strings in me are broken. I’ve become more cynical,” Lt Ivan Skuratovsky said, showing off his basement living quarters. Two cats dozed on his bed. The base has a small library and mess room, its wooden pillars decorated with drawings sent by Ukrainian schoolchildren.</p> \\n<p>The civilian cost of this unresolved conflict with Russia has been enormous. The villages directly in range of hostile fire are mostly abandoned, though a few elderly residents refuse to leave. The frontline runs through Timiryazev Street, named after a Russian botanist.</p> \\n<p>The street’s once-pleasant dachas are all wrecks. The gardens survive. In summer the soldiers gather walnuts, as they thread their way past on patrol. They also look after the dogs left behind when their owners left in a hurry, never to come back. In the absence of humans nature has flourished, with the odd blue tit and many crows.</p> \\n<p>Since the war began, Avdiyivka’s character has changed. According to Mariia Lepilova, a former teacher, the younger generation is more pro-Ukrainian. Donbas was once mostly Russian-speaking. There had been a switch to the Ukrainian language in schools and shops, she said. Children learn Ukrainian in class from the age of six or seven.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/12/archive-zip/giv-825LPQoIEM5Np9v/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> \\n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/12/archive-zip/giv-825LPQoIEM5Np9v/\">Map</a> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Lepilova said she was forced to leave the town in the winter of 2014, when shelling made living there impossible. “There was no power.

A day later, Russia closed nearly 70% of the Sea of Azov, a shared body of water also used by Ukraine, for firing drills. Then there is the escalating rhetoric.</p> <p>Deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov has said Russia and the US may be hurtling towards a repeat of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1962/oct/28/cuba\" title=\"\">1962 Cuban missile crisis</a>. And Putin said that the situation in eastern Ukraine “looked like genocide” in a recent meeting, raising fears he could seek a pretext to send his troops into the country.</p> <p>With its military threat on the table, Russia’s foreign ministry released its list of demands for how to end the crisis on Friday. Chief among them was for Nato to “officially disavow the decision of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/apr/01/natoheadsforrockysummit\" title=\"\">2008 Bucharest Nato summit</a> that ‘Ukraine and Georgia will become Nato members’”.</p> <p>Putin has spent the last two decades trying to fight Nato expansion, but the possible accession of Ukraine into the military alliance has always touched deeper emotions, and in part motivated him to order the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/putin-confirms-annexation-crimea-ukrainian-soldier-casualty\" title=\"\">annexation of Crimea</a> and provoke a war in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 14,000 people.</p> <p>“I told them: please don’t touch Ukraine or there’s going to be a problem,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, an influential Russian foreign policy analyst, of his discussions with western colleagues about Nato’s enlargement in the 2000s. “There is a real red line. Right or wrong … this kind of engagement with Ukraine on security and military affairs – that is seen here as absolutely unacceptable.”</p> <p>Lukyanov said Putin saw it as his “duty as president” not to leave the “Ukrainian problem” – meaning its trajectory towards the west – for the next Russian leader.</p> <p>The US has sought to persuade Russia that Ukraine would not join the alliance any time soon, but on Friday Moscow demanded a more formal declaration. That was a non-starter, Nato head Jens Stoltenberg said within hours of the demand being made public. “Nato’s relationship with Ukraine is going to be decided by the 30 Nato allies and Ukraine – no one else,” he said during a press conference with Germany’s new chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/08/olaf-scholz-to-be-voted-in-as-german-chancellor-as-merkel-era-ends\" title=\"\">Olaf Scholz</a>.</p> <p>In Ukraine, support for joining Nato has jumped considerably in recent years as the country has sought protection from an increasingly aggressive Russia. And for the nations on Nato’s eastern flank, allowing Russia to dictate the alliance’s policy on Ukraine is seen as the first step down a slippery slope towards recognising a Russian sphere of influence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef2ab1226d55f30b7183aa974204ce7fad8c3290\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef2ab1226d55f30b7183aa974204ce7fad8c3290/0_338_8138_4881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A satellite image of a Russian troop location in Voronezh, near the border with Ukraine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A satellite image of a Russian troop location in Voronezh, near the border with Ukraine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“History shows that pledges of neutrality by Ukraine or any other country in the region do nothing to abate Putin’s appetite; rather, they feed it,” wrote Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2021-12-10/dont-sell-out-ukraine\" title=\"\">an article published by </a><em><a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2021-12-10/dont-sell-out-ukraine\" title=\"\">Foreign Affairs</a></em> on Friday. “The best way to respond to such ultimatums is to ignore them altogether.”</p> <p>There are doubts whether Russia really wants to strike any deal at all. Analysts noted that despite Moscow building up its forces for months, Russian diplomats had not prepared any formal documents or even formulated the country’s demands until last week. And the idea of mustering nearly 100,000 troops within striking distance of the Ukrainian border (the US has said that Russia could increase that number to 175,000 by the end of January) just to hold talks with Biden has struck western observers as overkill.</p> <p>That brings us back to the Buk, which, as CIT noted, had its numbers crudely painted over in an effort to prevent identification. Russia employed similar tactics during its clandestine invasion of Ukraine in 2014.</p> <p>The clock is ticking. Putin could pull back, but it would be embarrassing to do so without a solid win in hand. And Russia’s demands look impossible to fulfil for the west: “Putin thinks that if Biden wants, he can move mountains, he can convince allies and convince Kyiv [to make concessions],” said Stanovaya. “This problem could lead Putin to demand the impossible and push the stakes so high that everything ends in war.”</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2021/dec/12/g7-leaders-sanctions-russia-buildup-ukraine-border', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-12-12T16:43:18Z', 'webTitle': 'G7 leaders warn Russia all sanctions on table over Ukraine border buildup', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/g7-leaders-sanctions-russia-buildup-ukraine-border', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/dec/12/g7-leaders-sanctions-russia-buildup-ukraine-border', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Foreign ministers of the G7 group of rich democracies have warned Russia of “massive consequences” if it invades Ukraine and urged it to de-escalate its military buildup on its border.</p> <p>A communique from the meeting in Liverpool said the group reaffirmed its “unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future” and praised what it called Ukraine’s “restraint” as tensions grew.</p> <p>“Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited under international law.

A fresh offensive could begin in the new year, western intelligence agencies have warned.</p> <p>The Kremlin has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/russia-issues-list-demands-tensions-europe-ukraine-nato\">issued a list of demands</a> over Kyiv’s head directly to the US. It wants a cast iron guarantee that Ukraine will never join Nato, despite the fact that such a prospect is a long way off, with little consensus among Nato members. Moscow wants special status for the separatist eastern territories, already run by proxies controlled from Russia. The demands amount to the de facto return of a Kremlin sphere of influence in eastern Europe. Western leaders are likely to reject them. Moscow can in turn use this as a predicate for war.</p> <p>All of which presents Zelenskiy with the gravest crisis of his presidency. A former comedian, he played the role of president in a popular TV drama, Servant of the People, before getting the job for real. His predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, espoused hardline anti-Moscow views. Zelenskiy, by contrast, ran as the peace candidate.</p> <p>“Zelenskiy was very naive about Russia’s policy. He said that to stop the war it was necessary to talk to Putin. His rhetoric was pacifist,” Olexiy Haran, professor of politics at the university of Kyiv’s Mohyla academy, said. Zelenskiy’s team played with the idea of possible concessions to Moscow, Haran added, including supplying water to Crimea.</p> <p>In the early days of Zelenskiy’s tenure, this engagement strategy produced some results, leading to prisoner exchanges and a series of short-lived ceasefires along the so-called line of control – a fortified 250-mile frontline running through the Donbas, with the Ukrainian army on one side and Russian forces and their proxies on the other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"180494d113c668596a0bdc38adf8dc98ba523cb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/180494d113c668596a0bdc38adf8dc98ba523cb4/0_147_4133_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volodymyr Zelenskiy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volodymyr Zelenskiy attends a summit in Brussels last week.

He thought: “I’m making concessions and nothing changes.’”</p> <p>Moscow has made no secret of its disdain for the comic turned president. “Why contacts with the current Ukrainian leadership are pointless,” read the headline of an article written by the former prime minister Dmitry Medvedev earlier this year. In it, he laid out Moscow’s strategy of speaking directly to Washington: “It’s pointless for us to deal with vassals. Business needs to be conducted with the suzerain [sovereign].”</p> <p>“There is a deep conviction that Zelenskiy is a guy with whom it doesn’t make any sense to try to discuss things politically,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, a foreign policy analyst. In the halls of power, he said, Zelenskiy was being compared unfavourably with Poroshenko, whom Moscow considered a “provocateur” but who at least understood where Russia’s “red lines” lay. By contrast, he said, Zelenskiy’s inexperience was seen as potentially dangerous.</p> <p>Of course, Moscow never gave Zelenskiy much of a chance. The Kremlin began its relationship with the president-elect by playing hardball, offering to expedite Russian passports for residents of east Ukraine before his inauguration, deepening a conflict it had created in 2014.</p> <p>When negotiations came, Moscow also drove a hard line. Zelenskiy’s first domestic crisis came in October of 2019, after he announced he had agreed to the so-called Steinmeier formula with Russia, which would allow elections in the Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to move forward under supervision from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Veterans and activists in Kyiv protested under the slogan “No to capitulation!” That effort to jump-start the Minsk peace agreements ultimately floundered.</p> <p>The Kremlin grew angrier as smaller deals, such as one to create a consultative body within the Minsk agreements, also fell through. It began leaking details of its negotiations with Zelenskiy’s team and ultimately cut off most political contacts entirely.</p> <p>Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist at the RAND corporation, said it may have come down to Putin’s belief that Zelenskiy could not deliver the concessions he wanted. “They came to a conclusion that they don’t really have a partner to negotiate with,” he said of the Kremlin.</p> <p>In the face of hardball tactics from Moscow, Zelenskiy took a tougher stand. In February, Ukraine’s national security council shut down three TV channels controlled by Viktor Medvedchuk, an influential pro-Kremlin Ukrainian politician and oligarch. It was a bold move. Putin is godfather to Medvedchuk’s daughter. Medvedchuk is under house arrest and accused of treason.</p> <p>These channels were spreading a pro-Russian narrative about the conflict in Donbas, Zelenskiy’s supporters say. One member of Medvedchuk’s opposition political party, however, said Putin viewed the clampdown as a “personal insult”. By arresting Medvedchuk, Zelenskiy removed a trusted interlocutor, leaving Moscow with only military options, the person said.</p> <p>Some kind of Russian military action was now likely, Lutsevych added. This might stop short of a full-scale ground invasion. It could include punitive airstrikes on Ukrainian military infrastructure and the Russian army moving overtly into rebel-held Donetsk and Luhansk, where residents would greet Putin’s soldiers with flowers, she said – a perfect image for Russian state TV.</p> <p>Zelenskiy was a “bit despairing” about the west’s slow-moving response to the crisis, Lutsevych said, and its failure to provide Ukraine with additional defensive missiles. Kyiv and Moscow currently had irreconcilable differences over how to resolve the Donbas situation, she suggested. Zelenskiy wanted a ceasefire and the removal of heavy weapons before the region’s political fate was determined; Putin the exact opposite.</p> <p>Moscow has a long history of baiting its neighbours into conflicts and has sought to portray Zelenskiy as another Mikheil Saakashvili, the Georgian president defeated in a short war with Russia in 2008. And as Moscow maneuverers its troops along Ukraine’s borders and demands concessions that its diplomats know will not be granted, it appears Russia may look to provoke that very outcome.</p> <p>“Many people here think that he is ready to risk an external crisis in order to solve his domestic problems, more than previous leaders,” said Lukyanov of the Kremlin.</p> <p>Zelenskiy’s ratings have dipped since 2019, when he won an astonishing 70% of the vote. Halfway through his presidential term, he commands about 25% support. He remains the country’s most popular politician. As things stand he is likely to be re-elected in 2024 – assuming, that is, that Russia does not occupy Kyiv first and topple its pro-EU government.</p> <p>“His character can be impulsive,” Ihor Todorov, a professor of international relations at Uzhhorod National University, said of Zelenskiy. Todorov added: “His electorate is pretty solid. There is an active patriotic majority.”</p> <p>Todorov used to teach at Donetsk University and was forced to flee in 2014. He said he did not expect Russia to escalate its existing military conflict with Ukraine. Rather, he said, Putin was playing a “global political game” designed to divide the west and to extract maximum concessions.</p> <p>Observers say Zelenskiy still shows moments of political immaturity, adding that he is excessively reliant on a small group of advisers who previously worked with him in TV. They cite his ad hoc suggestion last week that a referendum might solve the Donbas problem. And his renewed offer of talks with Putin – a non-starter in Moscow and a forum where Zelenskiy would likely struggle against a more experienced adversary.</p> <p>“It would be KGB vs a comic,” Haran said. He added: “Zelenskiy is stronger mentally since the time he was elected. But there are no clear views in his mind. He believes he is going to do something good for the country. He doesn’t understand many things about politics. He believes that anyone who criticises him, for example, is somehow being manipulated.”</p> <p>For now, Zelenskiy and the western world wait to see what Putin will do next. Russia believed itself to hold all the cards, Haran said. “For Putin it’s important to go down in history as a real national hero, as a person who reunited Russian Slavic lands. He has Belarus in his pocket. He has the DNR [the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic]. Many people there now have Russia passports. Putin can say he’s defending them.”</p> <p>And for Putin, who views it as his duty to reverse Kyiv’s trajectory to the west, he sees Ukraine’s would-be peacemaker as an obstacle in his way. “Anything related to Ukraine is very personal for him, it’s not negotiable, he is willing to be punished in order to achieve this,” said a former Russian government official. “And when he looks at Zelenskiy, he doesn’t see an equal … He sees a person who is wasting his time.”</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'commentisfree/2021/dec/20/the-guardian-view-on-russias-nato-demands-upping-the-ante', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'commentisfree', 'sectionName': 'Opinion', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-12-20T19:27:18Z', 'webTitle': 'The Guardian view on Russia’s Nato demands: upping the ante | Editorial', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/20/the-guardian-view-on-russias-nato-demands-upping-the-ante', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/20/the-guardian-view-on-russias-nato-demands-upping-the-ante', 'fields': {'body': '<p>In a documentary broadcast this month to mark the 30th anniversary of the collapse of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Putin told interviewers that during the subsequent economic chaos, he had to supplement his KGB income by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/vladimir-putin-says-he-resorted-to-taxi-driving-after-fall-of-soviet-union\" title=\"\">moonlighting</a> as a taxi driver. The personal struggles of Russia’s president in the 1990s were offered as a poignant vignette, symbolising the humiliating consequences of what Mr Putin has called “the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century”.</p> <p>In different circumstances, western leaders might be tempted to roll their eyes at the pretensions of one of the world’s most powerful bullies to victimhood. But Mr Putin’s 30th anniversary reminiscences were of a piece with an aggressively revanchist mood in Moscow, as tensions on Russia’s border with Ukraine continue to grow. About 100,000 Russian troops remain <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-says-russia-has-nearly-100000-troops-near-its-border-2021-11-13/\" title=\"\">massed</a> close to eastern Ukraine, along with heavy weaponry and other hardware transported across thousands of miles. Western intelligence officials believe that no final decision has been taken by the Kremlin on whether to launch a military operation, after having backed separatist pro-Russian rebels in the Donbass region since 2014. But it seems clear that the sabre-rattling reflects a new determination to reassert Moscow’s eroded authority in what Mr Putin <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/12/17/ukraine-russia-military/\" title=\"\">considers</a> Russia’s legitimate “sphere of influence”.</p> <p>On Friday, the Kremlin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/russia-issues-list-demands-tensions-europe-ukraine-nato\" title=\"\">issued</a> a series of demands to Washington and Nato that would, in effect, rewrite the security settlement that has emerged in former Soviet territories and satellite states. Along with a guarantee that Ukraine would never become a Nato member, Russia demanded the removal of Nato troops and weapons from the eastern European countries that have joined the alliance since 1997. The likelihood of Moscow being granted an effective veto over the deployment of Nato troops and missiles in countries such as Poland and Romania is zero, and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been <a href=\"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/europe/nato-chief-to-hold-joint-presser-with-ukraines-president-after-their-meeting-in-brussels.html\" title=\"\">reassured</a> by Nato that the path to Kiev’s membership remains open (although there is no timeframe). But the combination of massed troops on the Ukrainian border and Mr Putin’s willingness to publicly demand the impossible seems extremely ominous.</p> <p>This week, the Kremlin upped the ante still further, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russia-wants-urgent-answer-to-demands-over-nato-withdrawal-amid-ukraine-tensions-k82hw50rz\" title=\"\">requesting</a> an “urgent” response from Washington and Nato to its demands. Faced with a game of brinkmanship that is escalating week by week, the west has little option but to demonstrate a desire to keep talking and make it clear to Mr Putin that a heavy price in sanctions will be paid in the event of a Russian military incursion. Western solidarity with Ukraine has been bolstered by the new German government’s willingness to block the completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, while last week it was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/12/17/ukraine-russia-military/\" title=\"\">reported</a> that the Biden administration was considering sending military helicopters originally intended for Afghanistan. There may also be room for negotiation on issues relating to Nato military exercises and missile placement, if corresponding concessions are offered by Moscow.</p> <p>Ultimately, however, Ukraine and its western allies are in the uncomfortable position of waiting to find out what the Kremlin’s true intentions are. Having nurtured a decades-long sense of deep resentment at the decline in Russian regional influence and authority, Mr Putin has decided to force a crisis. It must be hoped that he can be convinced that military action would entail such isolation and economic damage that it would be utterly counterproductive.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/opinion', 'pillarName': 'Opinion'}, {'id': 'world/2021/dec/21/putin-warns-of-possible-military-response-to-aggressive-nato-russia', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-12-21T13:17:33Z', 'webTitle': 'Putin warns of possible military response over ‘aggressive’ Nato', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/21/putin-warns-of-possible-military-response-to-aggressive-nato-russia', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/dec/21/putin-warns-of-possible-military-response-to-aggressive-nato-russia', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Vladimir Putin has said he will consider a military response if Russia feels threatened by Nato, in a sign that he is not ready to de-escalate tensions over a potential invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>In a combative speech on Tuesday, Putin – who has demanded “security guarantees” from Nato – told his top military commanders that the west was to blame for the rising tensions.

Do they think we’ll just watch idly?”</p> <p>Putin did not specifically refer to the possibility of an offensive operation in Ukraine and Russian diplomats have previously suggested a response could employ other measures, such as moving intermediate-range missiles within striking distance of European targets.

At the press briefing, Putin said Russia needs an “immediate” response from the US and its allies to its demands. </p> \\n<p>“We have made it clear that Nato’s move to the east is unacceptable,” he said. “The United States is standing with missiles on our doorstep. Is it an excessive requirement not to install shock systems at our house? How would the Americans react if missiles were placed at the border with Canada or Mexico?”</p> \\n<p>He once again expressed anger over Nato’s expansion since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, an issue that has become central to his growing antagonism with the west.</p> \\n<p>“Sometimes it seems we are living in different worlds,” he said. “They said they wouldn’t expand, but they are expanding.”</p> \\n<p>Putin said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/we-do-not-want-war-russia-says-it-will-begin-talks-with-us-and-nato\">talks with the US</a> should begin next year in Geneva, adding “the ball is now in their court”.</p> \\n<p>He said: “American partners tell us that they are ready to launch this discussion, these talks in Geneva at the very beginning of next year. Both sides’ representatives have been appointed. I hope that the situation will unfold exactly under this scenario.”</p> \\n<p>Washington has confirmed it is ready to hold talks in January, although officials have made it clear that they’re not ready to discuss European security without the Europeans in the room. A Biden administration official on Thursday said a specific date and location were yet to be set.</p> \\n<p>But the Kremlin has warned Washington not to stall, with Putin saying he wanted security guarantees “right away, right now”. His spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has said he is not ready to engage in “marathon” talks.</p> \\n<p>All that leaves open the possibility of a new Russian offensive in January, as weapons and crucial logistics infrastructure have continued to arrive by rail to Russia’s border with Ukraine.</p> \\n<p>On Thursday, Russia’s defence ministry announced it would deploy hundreds of Russians paratroopers to hold drills in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and nearby Krasnodar region. The drills would simulate the capture of a territory and involve 1,200 troops and more than 250 vehicles and aircraft, the defence ministry said.</p> \\n<p>Russian state television pundits have also grown increasingly aggressive, openly discussing the possibility of a conflict with Nato. “The TV set in our barrack hysterically fights Nato all day long,” wrote Alexei Navalny, the jailed opposition leader, in remarks from prison that were posted online. “On every channel, they talk about Nato threats. Putin himself laments that Nato is at our doorstep and we have nowhere to retreat. It seems that all of Russia lives on this only and people are no longer interested in any other news.”</p> \\n<p>Putin’s remarks came during a four-hour press conference on Thursday that the Kremlin holds annually in December. The event often has a carnival atmosphere, as serious questions about geopolitics are followed by softball questions meant to humanise Russia’s president. Some journalists arrive in costume. Due to coronavirus, the Kremlin reduced the number of journalists in the hall to 500 and also installed special tunnels that sprayed attenders with an aerosol disinfectant.</p> \\n<p>Over the four hours, Putin took three questions on the possibility of a war with Ukraine, while also deflecting questions on flagging vaccination rates (Europe’s are just as bad, he claimed), Gazprom’s role in the European gas crisis (which he claimed was invented), his crackdown on internal dissent (“exaggerated”) and the search for the masterminds of the murders of journalist Anna Politkovskaya and the opposition politician Boris Nemtsov (“exhaustive”, Putin said).</p> \\n<p>“I want to remind you what our opponents have said over the centuries: ‘Russia cannot be defeated, it can only be torn apart from within’,” he told a BBC Russia journalist during the event, when answering a question about the arrest of opposition figures and declaration of dozens of news outlets as foreign agents.</p> \\n<p>Putin also took some of questions on “cancel culture”, giving support to the Harry Potter author JK Rowling, as he compared views on transgender rights to new strains of the coronavirus.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2021/dec/23/vladimir-putin-russian-president-ukraine-analysis', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-12-23T17:40:09Z', 'webTitle': 'Why Putin is acting like a man who has run out of time', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/vladimir-putin-russian-president-ukraine-analysis', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/dec/23/vladimir-putin-russian-president-ukraine-analysis', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Vladimir Putin has deployed his troops to the border with Ukraine, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/russia-issues-list-demands-tensions-europe-ukraine-nato\">delivered impossible demands on Europe</a> and appears ready to launch a new offensive to establish his domination over Kyiv.</p> \\n<p>Putin is said to feel a “historical mission” to reverse Ukraine’s drift towards the west, despite his own role in creating a rift by annexing Crimea and fuelling a war in Ukraine’s south-east. But his current fast pace raises questions of why he appears to feel the moment to act is now, as if he is running out of time.</p> \\n<p>From Putin’s perspective, he may look to recent events in Ukraine and believe it’s all downhill from here. His attempt to force Ukraine to reintegrate the eastern Donbas region, a poison pill that could give him a veto over the country’s geopolitical path, has failed as the Minsk agreements that would have steered it come close to collapse. His proxies may control a sliver of Ukraine’s south-east but the rest of the country has drifted further from his control.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \\n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0ed88964-b9e3-4dd4-a766-45d75dd086ee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eaQ4XcSm3Hw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>At the same time, Putin is alarmed by growing military cooperation between Ukraine and the west, including military assistance and prospective arms sales from the UK, joint military drills with Nato countries, deliveries of US Javelin anti-tank missiles, and purchases of Turkish drones. He argues that the country is de facto becoming an “unofficial” member of Nato, an “anti-Russia” that he claims could one day host western troops or even missiles.</p> \\n<p>“They came to the conclusion that trends weren’t heading in their direction, that they were heading toward geopolitical defeat,” said Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist at the Rand Corporation. The Kremlin’s early plan of “waiting it out”, for Ukrainians to lose patience with their new government and for the west to lose interest in Ukraine, was no longer viable. The Kremlin “decided that the status quo was intolerable and it needed to be changed”.</p> \\n<p>To do that, Putin has said he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/we-do-not-want-war-russia-says-it-will-begin-talks-with-us-and-nato\">open to negotiations</a> and has demanded a new treaty with Nato to roll back its expansion by removing troops and infrastructure from countries that joined after 1997, a non-starter in much of eastern Europe. At the same time, Putin has made it clear he is impatient to obtain his “security guarantees” immediately and has treated his potential negotiating partners with open disdain.</p> \\n<p>Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, who ran for office on a peace platform, has come “under the influence of radical elements,” Putin said on Thursday. Negotiations with his government have basically ceased.</p> \\n<p>Last month Russian diplomats leaked their communications with their French and German counterparts, essentially scuttling chances for further negotiations with European powers.</p> \\n<p>That leaves Joe Biden, a politician whom Putin may grant more respect but has made clear he does not trust. Even his promises, Putin says, may as well be written in sand.</p> \\n<p>“You and I know well that even they, legal guarantees, cannot be trusted because the United States easily withdraws from all international agreements it loses interest in for one reason or another while explaining it somehow or giving no explanations whatsoever,” he told his top commanders on Tuesday.</p> \\n<p>That leaves Putin the option of military force, a contingency that he appears ready to use. The Russian president appears consumed with the Ukraine question – this summer he published a <a href=\"http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181\">6,000-word essay on the topic</a> under his own name – and Russian analysts have proposed that solving his dilemma could determine his own timeline as Russia’s leader.</p> \\n<p>“It appears that what he manages to achieve in Ukraine will be the deciding factor in whether or not Putin stays on after 2024,” wrote Alexander Baunov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, this month.</p> \\n<p>While it is difficult to imagine Putin stepping down after 24 years in power, it is also possible that his desire to regain Ukraine as a “brotherly” nation could be one factor compelling him to stay on into the future.</p> \\n<p>“If victory hasn’t yet been achieved, perhaps it’s not the time to step down,” wrote Baunov.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2021/dec/24/ukrainians-brush-aside-talk-russian-invasion-ukraine-christmas', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-12-24T08:00:19Z', 'webTitle': '‘We’ve heard it all before’: Ukrainians brush aside talk of Russian invasion', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/ukrainians-brush-aside-talk-russian-invasion-ukraine-christmas', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/dec/24/ukrainians-brush-aside-talk-russian-invasion-ukraine-christmas', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Russia is threatening war on Ukraine, but in Kyiv the city council is putting up Christmas trees rather than bomb shelter notices, and organising concerts rather than army recruitment drives.</p> <p>Amid a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/02/ukraine-border-russia-west-troop-buildup\">Russian military buildup</a> on Ukraine’s eastern border and in annexed Crimea, hostile rhetoric between Russia and the US and its allies is edging towards a cold war high, with Ukraine the battlefield for any actual fighting.

But it is thought to be more likely that eastern and southern areas nearer the frontline will be a target, with Kyiv having to deal with interrupted supplies and communications, as well as Russian sabotage and increased cyber and information warfare. </p> <p>Although a nationwide poll published on 17 December by Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that half of Ukrainians would resist a Russian invasion by taking up arms or through civil resistance, not many believe they will be called on to do so, or are rushing to prepare. After losing swaths of territory to Russia and Russian-backed forces in 2014, and enduring a simmering armed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/east-ukraine-frontline-europe-forgotten-war\">conflict in east Ukraine</a> ever since, not to mention economic hardship and the impact of Covid, many Ukrainians are so inured to threatened disaster they no longer believe politicians and media who, they say, have cried wolf too often.</p> <p>“We’ve heard it all too many times over the last few years,” said Simbirova. “And usually it’s just hype.”</p> <p>Earlier this year the Russian troop buildup on the border began to invoke the spectre of impending invasion, inspiring Simbirova’s mother to announce she was moving to Spain to be safe. The invasion came to nothing at that point, and her mother stayed in Ukraine. More recently, at a November press conference, the Ukrainian president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a>, devoted as much time to talking about an alleged 1 December coup plot as he did to Russian invasion.

She says she is too busy to think about another possible war, and her neighbours never discuss it either.</p> <p>“After Donetsk and all the pain we went through, now we live in a little world of family, home, repairs. I’m just happy if I can buy some shelves, because when we moved in we just had bare walls,” she said. “Life goes on and we have to live it, with these little pleasures, and war is somewhere there, in the subconscious.”</p> <p>In Mariupol, 20km from the frontline of the east Ukraine conflict and a likely target of any possible invasion, many residents are also largely ignoring the threat and the council has gone all out on seasonal decorations and events.</p> <p>“They’re planning lots of concerts. City hall is trying to make Mariupol an example of security and cultural development of Ukrainian towns, in contrast to towns on the other side of the frontline,” said Galyna Balabanova, an activist and project manager in Mariupol.</p> <p>Alongside developing military capacity, one of Ukraine’s strategies to counter the Russian threat is to develop cities such as Mariupol so as to win the “hearts and minds” of Ukrainians sympathetic to – or still living in territory de facto controlled by – Russia.</p> <p>Balabanova and her friends are following the news and trying to analyse where Russia might attack, but they are not worried. “We trust in our army and our volunteers,” she said.</p> <p>As Ukrainians continue to focus on the near and dear, Burdiyan knows she cannot influence events anyway. “What we want and what happens are two different things; it doesn’t depend on us,” she said.

Russia’s president has steadily broadened the scope of his demands to encompass defence and security arrangements in Europe as a whole. Even if current tensions on Ukraine’s borders do not ultimately result in open conflict, this deliberate escalation bodes ill for 2022.</p> <p>What Putin wants, in effect, is to turn the clock back to the 1990s, before former Warsaw Pact countries such as Poland and ex-Soviet republics such as Estonia joined Nato. If he had his way, he would probably reconstitute the Soviet Union, whose demise he mourns. This bitter old KGB spy never accepted cold war defeat.</p> <p>The western alliance must make clear that such dangerous revisionism is unacceptable. Russia cannot have a veto on Ukraine’s (or Georgia’s) future Nato membership. Nor may Putin revive the old Soviet “near abroad”, resurrect spheres of influence or dictate where western forces are stationed. Talks on confidence-building measures to ease Russia’s concerns would be a more sensible way forward.</p> <p>Yet by deploying an estimated 100,000 troops to Ukraine’s frontiers and maintaining a verbal bombardment, Putin has made clear he will not quickly relax the pressure on Europe’s leaders. For Washington, this is a geopolitical puzzle. For Europeans, a hostile, angry Russia is an immediate, menacing danger lurking on their doorstep.</p> <p>Sensing US weakness, eastern European countries in particular are alarmed by President Joe Biden’s statement that the US is ready to address “Russia’s concerns relative to Nato” – and by Putin’s aggressive demand last week for “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/putin-accuses-west-coming-with-missiles-doorstep\" title=\"\">immediate</a>” concessions. The broader worry for 2022 is that, following the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal, US security guarantees cannot be trusted.</p> <p>Despite assurances at last summer’s G7 summit in Cornwall that “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/world/europe/us-europe-biden-china.html\" title=\"\">America is back</a>”, Biden is focused primarily on his domestic agenda and on containing China. Neither policy is going well. Covid is surging again, while the president’s signature spending bills, aimed at sparking a post-pandemic recovery, have been watered down or blocked by wayward Democrats in Congress. Biden will be preoccupied by a difficult campaign for November’s midterm elections.</p> <p>Thus for Europe, and the EU in particular, the new year looks set to begin on a disconcertingly uncertain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/21/instability-grips-a-weakened-europe-as-global-predators-smell-blood\" title=\"\">lonely note</a>. It’s squeezed between a malignant Moscow and an ambivalent America. And to make matters worse, postwar Europe’s foundational relationship – that between France and Germany – may be about to come under fresh strain. Olaf Scholz, Germany’s new chancellor, wasted no time in opening a dialogue with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, travelling to Paris two days after taking office. On paper, the centre-left, three-party coalition led by Scholz backs deeper EU integration and enhanced European sovereignty, ideas promoted by Macron and diluted by Angela Merkel, Scholz’s predecessor.</p> <p>But in practice, French-German convergence may be hard to achieve. There are sharp differences on EU energy policy, the “green transition” and French efforts to classify nuclear energy as a “sustainable” fuel at a time of fast-rising gas prices. Macron wants Germany to support more <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/macron-urge-scholz-invent-new-financial-solutions-for-eu/\" title=\"\">pan-European spending</a>, funded by shared debt along the precedent-setting lines of the EU’s €800bn (£679bn) Covid recovery fund. This is unpopular in Berlin.</p> <p>Macron argues passionately that, in a world of fierce predators and unreliable friends, Europe must strive for greater autonomy in defence, security and foreign policy. Yet he has opposed calls for a tougher line towards Russia and China from, for example, <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/china-uneasy-over-incoming-german-ministers-threat-to-curb-imports/a-60016727\" title=\"\">Annalena Baerbock</a>, co-leader of the German Greens, who is Scholz’s new foreign minister and a keen human rights advocate. It will be hard to square this circle.</p> <p>Europe’s ability to deal with a host of other pressing problems – the row between Brussels, Poland and Hungary over constitutional issues, separatist tensions in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/eu-working-to-amend-law-on-srebrenica-genocide-denial-to-blame-for-bosnia-crisis\" title=\"\">Balkans</a>, friction with Turkey, Islamist terrorism in the Sahel, Iran’s nuclear ambitions and unresolved Brexit arguments – will not be helped by France’s assumption of the six-month EU presidency in January.</p> <p>Although he denies it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/02/restless-doomed-hero-is-macron-fated-to-follow-in-napoleons-footsteps\" title=\"\">Macron</a> is certain to be distracted by his bid for a second term in April’s elections. This epic battle unites three central issues that will dominate Europe’s agenda in 2022: rightwing populism, migration and the pandemic. Some surveys indicate that since the German election, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/18/support-for-populist-sentiment-falls-across-europe-survey-finds\" title=\"\">the populist tide has been receding</a>. But in France, strong support for the xenophobic racists, Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour, suggests such conclusions are premature.</p> <p>Having followed Biden in abandoning Afghanistan, European Nato members can hardly complain if, as aid agencies predict, they face a big new wave of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/9/eu-member-states-agree-to-take-in-40000-afghan-asylum-seekers\" title=\"\">Afghan refugees</a> this winter. This would again highlight the EU’s collective failure to agree a comprehensive, humane migration policy – and will be exploited by the French far right.</p> <p>Another failure, the extraordinary absence of a coordinated European response to the Omicron variant as countries impose different, contradictory and often deeply unpopular, draconian restrictions, could help tip how France votes. As with Boris Johnson, the Covid bug, not the machinations of Russia, China and the US, may yet be Macron’s and Europe’s undoing.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/opinion', 'pillarName': 'Opinion'}, {'id': 'world/2021/dec/27/ukraine-crisis-how-putin-feeds-off-anger-over-nato-eastward-expansion', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-12-27T04:00:41Z', 'webTitle': 'Ukraine crisis: how Putin feeds off anger over Nato’s eastward expansion ', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/27/ukraine-crisis-how-putin-feeds-off-anger-over-nato-eastward-expansion', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/dec/27/ukraine-crisis-how-putin-feeds-off-anger-over-nato-eastward-expansion', 'fields': {'body': '<p>It is more than 13 years since Nato’s Bucharest summit, the meeting that agreed that the western alliance wanted the former Soviet states of Ukraine and Georgia to become members.

Granting them a so-called membership action plan would allow the two countries to follow a string of former eastern bloc states that had been allowed to join since 1999.</p> <p>Putin, however, addressed the assembled leaders at the start of the meeting, describing such a move <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/05/world/europe/05nato.html\">as a “direct threat” to Russian security</a>. “I remember him clearly saying to Angela Merkel and Bush: ‘For me Ukraine is not a real country’,” said Jamie Shea, who spent 38 years inside Nato.</p> <p>Putin’s language helped produce a partial retreat – and a problematic compromise.</p> <p>“There was furious haggling with Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy [the then French president] and the result was that Ukraine would be offered membership in the future, but there would be no membership action plan, no firm date to join Nato,” Shea said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/12/nato-zip/giv-825YCIiEUiOcmWb/\" data-alt=\"Nato new member states\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/12/nato-zip/giv-825YCIiEUiOcmWb/\">Nato new member states</a> </figure>  <p>As a result the issue was allowed to linger, with Nato and its members not fully committed to Ukraine. “I was actually present,” said Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, at a press appearance with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, last week. “We stand by that decision.”</p> <p>But the half-promise remains an open sore to Russia’s long-serving leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/07/putins-ukraine-rhetoric-driven-by-distorted-view-of-neighbour\">obsessed by the two nations’ long, pre-1991 history as one country</a>. “I am confident that true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia,” Putin wrote <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/05/world/europe/05nato.html\">in a historical essay</a> released by the Kremlin in July. “For we are one people.”</p> <p>During this winter’s crisis Russia has massed an estimated 100,000 troops to the north, east and south of Ukraine, prompting fears among Nato allies of an invasion and a conflict “on a scale not seen since world war two”, according to Britain’s new head of the armed forces, Adm Sir Tony Radakin. But in the past week the attention-seeking Kremlin has pivoted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/russia-issues-list-demands-tensions-europe-ukraine-nato\">a series of diplomatic demands</a>.</p> <p>Russia presented a draft security treaty to the US <a href=\"https://mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/rso/nato/1790818/?lang=en\">before making it public</a>. Its provisions say the US should prevent Ukraine and Georgia and other former Soviet states from joining Nato. It also insists the US should not establish military bases or even engage in “bilateral military cooperation” with Ukraine or any other non-Nato, former Soviet state – an attempt to carve out a clearly defined Russian sphere of influence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a82e6e497754aa9c53fe77dbab44b41c4f0ee64a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a82e6e497754aa9c53fe77dbab44b41c4f0ee64a/0_171_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Russian soldier takes part in drills in the Rostov region near its border with Ukraine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Russian soldier takes part in drills in the Rostov region near its border with Ukraine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such an idea is clearly controversial, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/09/eastern-europe-urges-nato-unity-in-biden-talks-with-russia\">particularly in eastern Europe</a>, where memories of communist domination linger. “Russia’s proposed <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/12/russian-treaty-proposals-hark-back-post-cold-war-era\" title=\"Russian treaty proposals hark back to post-Cold War era\">two draft treaties on 17 December</a> outline the establishment of a two-tier Europe – one with the right to defend itself from Russian encroachment while the other must accept Russian supremacy as a new geopolitical reality,” wrote Orysia Lutsevych, an analyst with the Chatham House thinktank, <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/12/ukraine-stands-firm-its-allies-must-do-likewise\">in a recent paper</a>.</p> <p>Other experts argue that Nato has become overconfident. Joshua Shifrinson, an associate professor of international relations at Boston University, said the US and the west “in the grand sweep of post-cold war relationships have become less sensitive to Russian concerns”, losing sight of the idea that the Kremlin too has vital interests.</p> <p>He added: “Russia does not want other political groupings present near their homeland. That’s not a hard thing to understand. Imagine if China were to form an alliance with Canada. Powerful states don’t want other powers forming alliances near their borders.”</p> <p>Shifrinson, a historian, said that at the end of the cold war, US and German strategists had given “very clear signals” that Nato would not expand farther eastward if Germany were allowed to reunite. But this sphere of influence commitment was quickly dropped in the 1990s and early part of the 2000s as Russia struggled as an independent country and a string of eastern bloc countries joined Nato and the EU.</p> <p>Critics of this thinking argue that if anything, Nato’s recent support for Ukraine has been too slight. “It’s a lack of resolute action in the past that has taught Russia that it [can] upscale and descale a crisis whenever they want it,” said William Alberque, an American former Nato official and now the director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies thinktank. “Russia has all the momentum in the current crisis,” he added, as the US and Nato have agreed to hold <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/we-do-not-want-war-russia-says-it-will-begin-talks-with-us-and-nato\">talks with Kremlin diplomats in the new year</a>.</p> <p>Ukraine has already had to endure the war of 2014, when Russia seized Crimea and helped create a crisis leading to separatists holding the eastern Donbas region, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/nobody-wants-to-be-putins-slave-on-the-ukraine-frontline-as-tensions-rise\">an unresolved, low-intensity conflict</a> has <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/conflict-ukraines-donbas-visual-explainer\">claimed the lives of an estimated 14,000</a>.

But the president was crystal clear about where the United Stated stands on all these issues,” said the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.</p> <p>During those talks, Putin demanded “reliable, legal guarantees” that would prevent Nato’s expansion towards Russia or place missile systems in Russia’s bordering countries.</p> <p>Shortly after the talks, Russia put forward a list of highly contentious security guarantees it says it wants the west to agree to in order to reduce tensions in Europe and defuse the crisis over Ukraine.</p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/russia-issues-list-demands-tensions-europe-ukraine-nato\"> demands</a> include a ban on Ukraine from entering Nato and limiting troop deployment and weapons to Nato’s eastern flank. Russia has also asked Nato to not hold drills without previous agreement from Russia in Ukraine, eastern Europe, in Caucasus countries or in central Asia.</p> <p>Peskov said the two leaders are expected to continue discussions that began at the video summit and that they would also discuss upcoming talks between Russia and the US, Nato, and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe set to begin in mid-January.</p> <p>Moscow has said that ignoring its interests will result in a “military response” similar to the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.</p> <p>Putin announced this week that he will hold new joint military drills with Belarus, which also borders Ukraine. The drills are scheduled for February or March, Putin said after meeting with Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko. He did not say how many troops would take part in the drills or what their objective would be.</p> <p>On Sunday, Putin said he would consider a slew of options if the west fails to meet his push for security guarantees precluding Nato’s expansion to Ukraine.</p> <p>In Wednesday’s statement, Horne said: “President Biden has spoken with leaders across Europe, and Biden administration officials have engaged multilaterally with Nato, the EU and the OSCE [Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe].</p> <p>“The Biden administration continues to engage in extensive diplomacy with our European allies and partners, consulting and coordinating on a common approach in response to Russia’s military build-up on the border with Ukraine.”</p> <p>The senior official said that the US is “also prepared to respond if Russia advances with a further invasion of Ukraine”.</p> <p>“We have made plans to reinforce Nato’s force posture in allied states in the event of a further invasion, and we are prepared to provide Ukraine with further assistance to defend its territory,” he added.</p> <p>Nevertheless, he reiterated that Biden will emphasize to Putin that “there is a clear diplomacy path to de-escalating tensions in the region if President Putin is interested in taking it”.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'us-news/2021/dec/30/biden-putin-call-russia-us-ukraine-tensions', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'us-news', 'sectionName': 'US news', 'webPublicationDate': '2021-12-30T22:32:09Z', 'webTitle': 'Biden and Putin exchange warnings during phone call amid rising Ukraine tensions', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/biden-putin-call-russia-us-ukraine-tensions', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/biden-putin-call-russia-us-ukraine-tensions', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Joe Biden and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have exchanged warnings over the crisis in Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/29/joe-biden-vladimir-putin-talks-russia-ukraine\">during a 50-minute phone call</a> that did little to lower the political temperature, according to their governments.</p> <p>Russia has alarmed the US and its allies by massing <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/russia-putin-eyes-possible-ukraine-invasion-8ab64d70-7f71-4e9f-aa4a-f81692087e1b.html\">tens of thousands of troops</a> near its border with Ukraine over the past two months.

Lavrenchuk left Russia for Ukraine in 2014 in protest at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/putin-confirms-annexation-crimea-ukrainian-soldier-casualty\">Russia’s annexation of Crimea that year</a>.</p> <p>Lavrenchuk told the court of appeal in Naples that he was being persecuted by Russia for publicly voicing his dissent. He claimed the persecution led to him being beaten up outside the Odessa opera and ballet theatre, where he was a director, in December 2020. He has refused extradition, saying that he feared being “exposed to discrimination”.</p> <p>Lavrenchuk is being held at Poggioreale prison in Naples, where he was visited this week by Francesco Emilio Borrelli, a regional councillor for the Europa Verde party.</p> <p>“I spoke to him for about 15 minutes during a prison check, which we do periodically,” Borrelli said.</p> <p>“He was calm and in good form; he came across as a person aware of living an injustice and that in the end he will be proven right. He said he’s determined to return to his country to fight against the oppression of Putin’s regime.”</p> <p>Lavrenchuk had never been to Italy before landing at Capodichino airport on 15 December on a stopover in his journey between Tel Aviv, where he had been visiting his sister, and Lviv in Ukraine.</p> <p>He was arrested at a hotel close to the airport after providing his ID at check-in. By law, hotels in Italy have to scan a copy of a guest’s ID document; the details are then sent to the local police for registration.</p> <p>“Police found his name had been inserted into an international search system with a mandate for his arrest,” said Alfonso Tatarano, Lavrenchuk’s lawyer. “He didn’t know he was being looked for by Russian authorities or that his name was in this system.”</p> <p>The case comes as fears mount over the possibility of a Russian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/liz-truss-says-russia-faces-high-level-sanctions-if-it-invades-ukraine\">invasion of Ukraine</a>.</p> <p>Liudmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian parliamentary commissioner for human rights, said on Thursday that Lavrenchuk’s arrest was not made on the basis of a “red notice” by Interpol, as was originally reported, but on a circular note distributed to a limited number of countries.</p> <p>“This testifies to Russia’s abuse of the Interpol charter and its misuse as an instrument of hybrid warfare for the politically motivated persecution of Ukrainians,” Denisova wrote on her Facebook page.</p> <p>The warrant for Lavrenchuk’s arrest was issued by a Moscow court in July 2020. The accusations against him date back eight years, when he allegedly defrauded one of his students by asking for money to pay for repairs to the Polish Theatre.</p> <p>However, it is not yet clear to Italian judicial authorities whether the court had issued a conviction for his alleged crimes or a preliminary injunction. The crime is punishable by 10 years in prison.</p> <p>“We don’t yet have the complete records of the proceedings,” said Tatarano.</p> <p>Russia has 40 days, from the day it was notified of Lavrenchuk’s arrest, to send its formal extradition request and related documents. The case is being handled by Luigi Riello, the chief public prosecutor of the Naples appeals court.</p> <p>“He will evaluate on what basis the request for extradition is being made before submitting his evaluation to the court,” said Tatarano. “If there is concrete danger that Lavrenchuk will receive unfair treatment or that the accusations are based on political opinions, the court will reject the extradition request. But we have to prove this, and I think we can.”</p> <p>Tatarano will appeal for Lavrenchuk to be either released from custody or placed under house arrest pending the outcome of the legal process.</p> <p>A Facebook page calling for Lavrenchuk’s release has attracted more than 1,400 followers while members of the Ukrainian community in Italy are planning to protest in Milan on Saturday. “We are mobilising to show how the Russian regime exploits legal cases against Ukrainian citizens for its own political purposes,” the protest organisers wrote on Facebook.</p> <p>PEN America, the writers’ association, has also called for Lavrenchuk’s immediate release.</p> <p>“The circumstances of Lavrenchuk’s detention – he was detained in Naples while transferring to a flight to Lviv after travelling from Tel Aviv – are a disturbing echo of Belarus’s move last year to force a Ryanair flight to land in order to arrest blogger Raman Protasevich,” said Polina Sadovskaya, PEN America’s Eurasia director. “In this case, Lavrenchuk is one of the most visible voices against the Russian annexation of Crimea in the Eurasian theatre community, and Russia’s extradition request against him bears the hallmarks of politically motivated repression.”</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/07/eu-must-have-frank-exacting-dialogue-with-russia-emmanuel-macron-says', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-07T13:59:11Z', 'webTitle': 'EU must have ‘frank, exacting’ dialogue with Russia, Macron says', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/eu-must-have-frank-exacting-dialogue-with-russia-emmanuel-macron-says', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/07/eu-must-have-frank-exacting-dialogue-with-russia-emmanuel-macron-says', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Emmanuel Macron has said the EU needs a “frank, exacting” dialogue with Russia to defuse tensions, as he called for new security arrangements on the continent.</p> <p>The French president was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/25/fractious-eu-summit-rejects-franco-german-plan-putin-talks\">rebuffed by other EU states in June</a> when he and the then German chancellor, Angela Merkel, made a surprise proposal for a summit with Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Speaking in Paris at the start of France’s six-month EU presidency, Macron said: “I think that the European Union must have a dialogue with Russia.

It is gradually building up with artillery and electronic warfare equipment.” </p> <p>He warned that in the event of a Russian invasion, there would be a major movement of troops to protect Nato countries on the border of Russia.</p> <p>The Nato show of strength was intended as a message to Vladimir Putin that he will be unable to lure the US into any concessions in separate bilateral talks about Ukraine’s sovereignty or Nato’s future structure.</p> <p>Although Stoltenberg said Nato was prepared to discuss issues such as troop transparency, western officials are sceptical that next week’s round of talks will lead to a breakthrough and believe the demands Putin set out on 17 December in the form of two draft treaties have been framed to be rejected.</p> <p>“We are ready to engage in arms control with Russia, conventional and nuclear, but that has to be reciprocal,” Stoltenberg said. “That’s a different thing [from] imposing one-sided restrictions … we can’t end up in a situation where we have second-class Nato members where Nato as an alliance is not allowed to protect them.”</p> <p>Nato is adamant that its conditional offer of membership to Georgia and Ukraine, first made in 2008, will not be withdrawn, even if in practice membership is not imminent. Both countries have been invited to attend part of a meeting of Nato defence ministers next month.</p> <p>The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: “Russia’s military buildup on the border of Ukraine and in illegally annexed Crimea is unacceptable. There is no justification for its aggressive and unprovoked stance towards Ukraine.</p> <p>“We stand with our Nato allies in urging Russia to end its malign activity and adhere to international agreements it freely signed up to.</p> <p>“We will defend democracy in eastern Europe and around the world. Our support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering. We are clear that any Russian incursion would be a massive strategic mistake, for which there would be a severe cost.”</p> <p>UK officials remain unclear whether Putin will invade, but they appear increasingly focused on strengthening forward defences inside Nato. The west has promised massive economic sanctions against Russia if an incursion occurs, but it has ruled out sending troops – as opposed to arms – into Ukraine.</p> <p>The round of talks start on Monday with a bilateral meeting in Geneva between US and Russian officials over future security structures. This will be followed by a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday of the Nato Russian council, the first such meeting for two years, and finally a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) chaired by Poland in Vienna.</p> <p>Western officials suggested the dispatch of a few thousand Russian troops to suppress the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/kazakhstan-president-vows-to-destroy-bandits-and-terrorists-behind-protests\">rebellion in Kazakhstan</a> would not alter Putin’s military calculations, even if it represents an unexpected political headache for Moscow.</p> <p>The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said Putin was trying to discuss with Nato proposals “to sort of return to the zones of influence from the past … which would mean Russia restore the spirit of Yalta” – a reference to the conference between second world war allied powers in February 1945 that gave the Soviet Union control over its eastern European neighbours.</p> <p>“This is not our point of view, but we have to accept the discussion,” Le Drian said.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/09/history-of-wests-summits-with-russia', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-09T15:35:29Z', 'webTitle': 'Is it good to talk?

If the west is firm, the Kremlin concludes that it wants to destroy Russia; if the west offers concessions, the Kremlin concludes that it is weak and pressure should be increased.</p> <p>“Very often the best policy with Russia is that of silence and distance: do nothing, say nothing and stand your ground. Clinging to dialogue at all costs, especially when Moscow keeps us at gunpoint like a madman holding a hostage, only shows our weakness and encourages the Kremlin to escalate.”</p> <p>But Joe Biden has clearly taken the view that with allied self-discipline and unity, the risks of being seen to be rewarding Putin are outweighed by the need for dialogue, and diplomatic reconnaissance.</p> <p>Not to talk would be to feed the Russian narrative that the west is not prepared even to listen. Besides, it is billed as a dialogue, not a negotiation, officials say.</p> <p>The specific agenda of each meeting next week is subtly different, and while the west will want the discussion to focus on the sovereignty of Ukraine, and missile placement, Russia will want a response to its threefold formal demands set out last month in draft treaties: the withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from Europe, the removal of Nato forces close to Russian borders, and the legal permanent renunciation of Nato membership for Ukraine and Georgia, as part of a commitment to end Nato’s enlargement.</p> <p>One way or another, these have been the permanent demands of the Russian political elite for the past 20 years. Putin’s demands bear comparison with Dmitry Medvedev’s largely ignored <a href=\"http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/6152\">European security treaty proposal</a> in 2009, but this time the demands are being presented in a more peremptory fashion. Indeed, some western officials fear they have been packaged to be rejected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a62ea7fadce04e4bd779c00e74e26d7cccf0196\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a62ea7fadce04e4bd779c00e74e26d7cccf0196/0_0_4096_2897/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dmitry Medvedev, Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel at the end of a press conference in Deauville, France, in October 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dmitry Medvedev, Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel at the end of a press conference in Deauville, France, in October 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Horacio Villalobos/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Ukraine there is concern that dialogue with Russia on the future security architecture of Europe, under threat of blackmail and without a formal presence of the EU bloc, will be taken as vindication by Putin. From Putin’s perspective, he has already made progress, and can make more. Russian thinktanks such as IMEMO are claiming, for instance, that the meeting shows “the ice has already broken”.</p> <p>It is the bread and butter of diplomacy to judge whether to “parley” – as Churchill put it – with an adversary either in the open or through a back channel, or instead to sit tight and wait. Never is that judgment more acute than in the case of Russia.</p> <p>The cold war US diplomat George Kennan’s contention was that “Moscow is a special case”. It saw security “only in [a] patient but deadly struggle for total destruction of [the] rival power, never in compacts and compromises with it”. He said the Soviet Union under Stalin was a master at distorting bromide American offers of dialogue, for example over the future of Berlin in April 1949, into a full-scale offer to redraw the map of Europe. The solution was patience and containment. </p> <p>Henry Kissinger for a period was to argue that the state department was populated by naive men who believed well-constructed argument could persuade Russia. The whole idea of signing treaties with Russia was to misunderstand the mentality. Russia, it was said, operated by probing for weaknesses, “by kicking all the doors and seeing which fell off their hinges”.</p> <p>Alexander Cadogan, the UK Foreign Office’s wartime permanent secretary, made a similar point in his diaries about asymmetry in talking to Russia: “Everything favours the evildoer. Any honest government fights (in peacetime) with two hands tied behind its back. The brilliant blatancy of the Russians is something that we can admire but cannot emulate. It gives them a great advantage.”</p> <p>By contrast, most politicians’ instinct is often to parley, or seek a reset or trust personal charm. Churchill once said all the world’s problems could be solved if only he could meet Joseph Stalin once a week. John F Kennedy argued it was better to “meet at the summit than at the brink”, something the US attempted more regularly after the shock of the Cuban missile crisis. Famously at the 1986 Reykjavík conference a personal rapport between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev led them to the brink of abandoning nuclear weapons. George Shultz, the US secretary of state, recalled that in advance “there was a unique sense of uncertainty in the air … Nothing seemed predictable”. Gorbachev’s surprise plan, nearly taken up by Reagan, showed the value of dialogue, even if Margaret Thatcher later confided her despair with Reagan to Robin Butler, her cabinet secretary: “He knows nothing, Robin.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6f84b01f04b5f1c47dd9181ad9848d4654bcfbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6f84b01f04b5f1c47dd9181ad9848d4654bcfbf/0_0_2048_1364/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mikhail Gorbachev talks to Ronald Reagan in Reykjavík during their October 1986 summit meeting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mikhail Gorbachev talks to Ronald Reagan in Reykjavík during their October 1986 summit meeting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Sargent/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reagan’s successor, George HW Bush, promised no more chaotic Reykjavíks, but at a summit in Malta in 1989, the first meeting since the fall of the Berlin Wall, <a href=\"https://www.georgeandbarbarabush.org/2019/12/1989-malta-summit-watching-the-world-wake-up-from-history/\">he too was captured by Gorbachev’s sense of history unfolding</a> (“the United States and the USSR are doomed to cooperate for a long time”) and by his plea that “we have to abandon the images of an enemy”. In reality, Gorbachev was betrayed at a dinner the next evening in Brussels where Bush gave Chancellor Kohl the green light for Germany’s unification, opening the long argument about the terms of Nato’s expansion eastwards, starting with East Germany.</p> <p>With Gorbachev crushed by events, the Bill and Boris show ensued. Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, tasked with integrating Russia into the international system, met face to face 18 times, often clashing about Nato expansion, leading Yeltsin to describe a cold peace. The apogee may have been the summit in Birmingham in 1998, when relations were so intimate they exchanged their respective confidential briefing cards. That relationship probably collapsed in a phone call of uncontrolled fury over the Nato bombing of Serbia a year later. It showed that when fundamental interests conflict, as they did over Nato, personal relations take you only so far.</p> <p>Thereafter the era of two men sitting alone to solve the world was over.

In policy terms that meant choosing between an emphasis on arms control or Nato expansion.</p> <p>But there is also a professional diplomat’s aversion to unstructured large-scale gatherings, whether they involve Russia or not. Harold Nicolson, after a long diplomatic career, <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/1935-12-19/debates/10875ec0-9485-4551-a0d9-60c2690991f4/LeagueOfNationsAndAbyssinia\">argued in the Commons in 1935</a>: “It is a terrible mistake to conduct negotiations between foreign ministers … international negotiations were best left to the professionals. Diplomacy is not the art of conversation. It is the art of the exchange of documents in a carefully considered and precise form and in such a way that they cannot be repudiated later … Diplomacy by conference is a mistake.”</p> <p>The worry for the professional diplomat is that in the emotion of the moment, resolve dissipates and pre-set red lines are rubbed out, and allies betrayed.</p> <p>With the Biden administration, the expectation is this week’s discussions will be far more structured, predictable and scripted. In theory, since neither of the principals – Biden and Putin – will be present in Geneva, there should be no rush of blood to the head by men of goodwill, but instead a staking out of familiar positions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fe98c386cd27dd66636df65214cb38481daebb04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe98c386cd27dd66636df65214cb38481daebb04/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin meet for the US-Russia summit at Villa La Grange in Geneva, Switzerland, in June 2021.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin meet for the US-Russia summit at Villa La Grange in Geneva, Switzerland, in June 2021.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The US messaging, bolstered by the UK, has been carefully framed, and seems well coordinated with Europe. Expansion of Nato was inherent in the Nato-Russia Founding Act signed by Boris Yeltsin in 1997. No country can determine another country’s foreign alliances, as Russia agreed in the Helsinki Final Act 1975, and again in the Budapest memorandum in 1994. In the words of Sauli Niinistö, the Finnish president, in his striking new year address: “Spheres of interest do not belong to the 2020s. The sovereign equality of all states is the basic principle that everyone should respect.”</p> <p>But the test, according to Evelyn Farkas, a former US deputy assistant secretary of defence for Russia, will be whether Putin sees this week’s talks as a piece of political theatre, a moment to issue an ultimatum, or whether he sanctions Russia getting into the weeds, and starts to negotiate. Few hold out much hope for the latter.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/09/ukraine-fate-hangs-in-balance-as-critical-week-of-talks-begins', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-10T15:49:47Z', 'webTitle': 'Ukraine crisis: tense talks between US and Russia open in Geneva ', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/09/ukraine-fate-hangs-in-balance-as-critical-week-of-talks-begins', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/09/ukraine-fate-hangs-in-balance-as-critical-week-of-talks-begins', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Formal talks are under way between US and Russian officials in Geneva over the fate of Ukraine, amid low expectations and high tensions driven by fears that the Kremlin will order an invasion.</p> \\n<p>The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, and his delegation arrived under Swiss police escort at the US diplomatic mission in Geneva for face-to-face talks with Wendy Sherman, the US deputy secretary of state, and her team.

Finnish leaders in particular have hinted heavily in the past few days that they might look anew at Nato membership.</p> \\n<p>“We believe that after bilateral talks with the United States and then the Nato format, in this wider forum, some developments are possible,” said Nikodem Rachoń, the spokesperson for the Polish embassy in Washington. </p> \\n<p>The OSCE talks are the only negotiations in which Ukraine will take part, though its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, announced a parallel bilateral diplomatic initiative directly with Moscow last month.</p> \\n<p>Washington says the US-Russia meeting in Geneva would primarily be an opportunity to present positions rather than resolve them.</p> \\n<p>“I don’t think we’re going to see any breakthroughs next week.

So, if we’re seeing de-escalation, if we’re seeing a reduction in tensions, that is the kind of environment in which we could make real progress.” </p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bd4f029b76e1c822d7e0f9e2c3290f87f2ed0a5\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bd4f029b76e1c822d7e0f9e2c3290f87f2ed0a5/0_334_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US president, Joe Biden, and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/Sputnik/AFP/Getty</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>In Geneva, Sherman will also list the costs to Russia if it goes ahead with military action in Ukraine, including sweeping financial sanctions, possibly cutting it off from the international electronic payments system Swift, and limits on its citizens’ ability to buy western technology.</p> \\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/08/us/politics/us-sanctions-russia-ukraine.html\">New York Times</a>, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, has also warned his Russian counterpart, Gen Valery Gerasimov, that an invasion would face a long insurgency, backed by advanced US weaponry. US officials have refused to comment on reports that Stinger anti-aircraft missiles were being sent to Ukraine in anticipation of such a guerrilla war.</p> \\n<p>“This week’s diplomacy is critical. From a certain moment it was clear that the west would not say an outright no to Moscow’s proposal because too much was at stake. The question was, how far Washington and Europeans are ready to go with the talks,” said Andrey Baklitskiy, a senior research fellow at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations.</p> \\n<p>Russia’s rushed military intervention in Kazakhstan has thrown another wildcard on to the table, but Baklitskiy does not expect it to have any impact on the Ukraine crisis. “There is no direct link between Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Even the people handling the issue in Russia are different, except for the very top,” he said.</p> \\n<p>Others say it is too early to tell whether the uprising and the response will unnerve or embolden the Kremlin. “To what extent are the Russians worried about Kazakhstan or believe they can manage it? I don’t think we have a feel for that yet,” one European diplomat said.</p> \\n<p>If there is wriggle room at all in this week’s negotiations, it could come in one of a handful of categories. The Biden administration and Nato’s secretary general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/nato-chief-warns-of-real-risk-of-ukraine-conflict-as-russian-buildup-continues\">Jens Stoltenberg</a>, have ruled out bowing to Russian demands to preclude Ukraine’s membership of the alliance, but some analysts say that leaves open the possibility of a compromise, in which the theoretical possibility of membership is asserted at the same time as a clear statement that there would be many obstacles to overcome and so it would not happen in the near future.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7a3050941a69e2a21a4c7426431e032c055a616\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7a3050941a69e2a21a4c7426431e032c055a616/0_27_3898_2341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jens Stoltenberg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>That may be palatable in Washington and Nato capitals, but it may well not be enough for Putin. “Frankly, I’d be surprised if it was,” the European diplomat said. “Given their demands, I think they prefer to have the issue not addressed at all. Otherwise it shows they haven’t got their demand about Ukraine not joining Nato written down.”</p> \\n<p>US officials have repeatedly denied reports that Washington would<strong> </strong>negotiate on troop deployments in Europe but said they were willing to discuss reciprocal limits on missile deployments and military exercises.</p> \\n<p>“Russia has said it feels threatened by the prospect of offensive missile systems being placed in Ukraine. As President Biden told President Putin, the United States has no intention of doing that. So, this is one area where we may be able to reach an understanding if Russia is willing to make a reciprocal commitment,” the senior US administration official said.</p> \\n<p>Blinken said the US was also open to talking about limits on missiles previously banned by the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, from which the Trump administration withdrew in 2019 following longstanding US complaints of Russian violations.</p> \\n<p>“There may be grounds for renewing that,” Blinken said, adding that there could also be limits on war games.</p> \\n<p>“There are agreements on the deployment of conventional forces in Europe, things like the scope and scale of exercises that if adhered to reciprocally – that is, Russia makes good on its commitments, which it’s repeatedly violated – then there are grounds for reducing tensions, creating greater transparency, creating greater confidence,” he said. “All of which would address concerns that Russia purports to have.”</p> \\n<p>Missiles and war games are both areas where Russia has called for limits, albeit only on the US and Nato’s activities. It is an open question whether Putin would be satisfied with deals in these areas without some radical change in Ukraine’s status.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/eu-top-diplomat-ukraine-frontline-show-solidarity-russia\">EU’s top diplomat visits Ukraine frontline in show of solidarity</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>“Putin could go back and say we’ve been assured that there’s no imminent admission of Ukraine to Nato and we have assurances there will be no strike weapons – combat aircraft, missiles – or US bases in Ukraine,” said Rajan Menon, a political scientist at the City University of New York. “But will Russians insist that this be put in writing? That’s the sticky part.”</p> \\n<p>The most severe limiting factor in the negotiations could turn out to be the political constraints on the main parties.</p> \\n<p>“If you look at the polarisation here, it suggests that we have no bandwidth on the US side to actually do anything, sue for peace, let alone come up with a treaty or series of treaties,” said Fiona Hill, a former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the US national security council. “Putin has his own time frame of elections in 2024, and he wants to have something to show because his own popularity is lagging somewhat.”</p> \\n<p>The deployment of so many troops and the Kremlin’s rhetoric have set high Russian expectations of what would constitute a satisfactory outcome from the week’s diplomacy. Officials in Moscow have insisted that nothing short of “legally formulated guarantees of security” would be enough to pull back the troops from the Ukrainian border.</p> \\n<p>“Putin has put himself in a position where he has to come back with something, without looking really weak,” Menon said. “Given the political realities now, am I confident that a deal is going to happen? No, not at all.

Yet, experts following the crisis closely say that for an invasion of the whole country that number would need to nearly double again, and would almost certainly involve forces passing through Belarus.</p> \\n<p>Dr Fred Kagan, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said: “This will likely require an invasion on a scale not dissimilar to 2003, somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 troops.” </p> \\n<p>He predicted that a force that size could be in position by the end of January. About 175,000 US and other allied troops were involved in the invasion of Iraq.</p> \\n<h2>Is occupation possible?</h2> \\n<p>Kagan, who co-authored a series of reports that led to the 2007 US troop surge in Iraq, said the real challenge for Putin was how an almost certainly hostile Ukraine may be held by the Russians if there was an insurgency after the capture of Kyiv.</p> \\n<p>A determined operation would require one counter-insurgent per 20 inhabitants, said Kagan in a paper he co-wrote with other experts from the <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Ukraine%20Invasion%20Forecast%20Series%20Part%202%20ISW%20CT%20December%202021.pdf\">Institute for the Study of War</a>. That “would suggest a counter-insurgency force requirement on the order of 325,000 personnel” would be needed to hold Kyiv and Ukraine’s major cities in the south and east, they added.</p> \\n<p>Ukraine has an army of 145,000, according to the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS),, but there are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/nobody-wants-to-be-putins-slave-on-the-ukraine-frontline-as-tensions-rise\">an estimated 300,000 veterans</a> of the low-intensity conflict in the Donbas region of the country that started in 2014. Polling says a <a href=\"https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=ukr&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=1079&amp;page=1\">third of Ukraine’s citizens would be willing to take up “armed resistance”</a>.</p> \\n<p>Burnt by the Soviet experience in Afghanistan, Russia generally viewed US attempts to hold countries against insurgents as a mistake. “Putin will have studied what happened to the US in Iraq after 2003. The difficulties of dealing with partisan activity keeps my mind open to the possibility that the Russian president does not intend to invade and conquer Ukraine,” Kagan told the Guardian.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/01/ukraine-zip/giv-825Tfw6XRKlPr6R/\" data-alt=\"military options\"> \\n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/01/ukraine-zip/giv-825Tfw6XRKlPr6R/\">military options</a> \\n</figure> \\n<h2>Russia’s advantages</h2> \\n<p>Nevertheless, Moscow has overwhelming advantages in terms of an initial invasion, most notably in terms of rocketry and airpower. Ukraine faces potentially terrifying consequences, in an all-out assault, which could shatter a country’s morale and prompt millions to flee west, rather than fight.</p> \\n<p>Rob Lee, a former US marine and fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said: “Russia has the capacity to devastate Ukraine’s military units from afar with weapons such as Iskander ballistic missiles. We almost never see modern weaponry like this unleashed; it gives Russia the capability to inflict thousands of casualties a day.” </p> \\n<p>A military assault will also have a transformational effect on international opinion. Civilian casualties in considerable numbers are almost certain, amounting to an operation unlike almost any Putin has conducted before, including the war with Ukraine in 2014, where responsibility for military action was denied.</p> \\n<p>Dr Samir Puri, a senior fellow at the IISS, who has previously spent a year as a conflict monitor in Ukraine, said: “It is hard to imagine a full invasion without the use of airpower, but that is such a huge threshold for Russia to cross.”</p> \\n<p>Much has been made about Ukraine’s recent purchase of weapons from the west, but the Javelin antitank missiles have a range of about 1.5 miles (2.5km) and can only delay an mechanised advance.</p> \\n<p>The country has a relatively modest number of Turkish TB2 drones for now, half a dozen or a dozen, tiny compared with Russia’s thousands of tanks, the core of any ground force.</p> \\n<h2>Capturing Kyiv</h2> \\n<p>Russia also has to decide how to deal with Ukraine’s cities, principally Kyiv, with a population of 3 million, but also Kharkiv in the north-east, with a population of almost 1.5 million. “Urban warfare is hard, it does fearful damage and Russia struggled with it in Aleppo,” Kagan said, citing Putin’s intervention in Syria’s civil war.</p> \\n<p>Speculation about Russia’s plans – based in part on <a href=\"https://www-bild-de.translate.goog/politik/ausland/politik-ausland/bild-exklusiv-russlands-kriegsplaene-so-koennte-putin-die-ukraine-vernichten-78425518.bild.html?_x_tr_sl=de&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=scn\">apparent leaks published in the German newspaper Bild</a> – suggests the Kremlin would surround Kharkiv and ultimately Kyiv, cutting off supplies, hoping in a medieval fashion they will surrender. That may be less violent but would still undercut the idea of Russia acting as a unifying force.</p> \\n<p>Nor is encircling Kyiv easy, western analysts say. The key points of the city, including the presidential palace, are to the west of the readily defensible Dneiper River. The first bridges south of the city are 60 miles away; a dam four miles north has turned the stretch of the river that runs to the border with Belarus into a lake.</p> \\n<h2>Exploiting Belarus</h2> \\n<p>The simplest way across the river is to cross in a safe territory – Belarus to the north. That would require Minsk’s support, which would be highly probable given its recent rapprochement with Moscow. In a speech to mark Orthodox Christmas on 7 January, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said his country would <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Liveuamap/status/1479423021639208963\">“do everything” to take back Ukraine</a>.</p> \\n<p>Russian mechanised forces would aim to encircle Kyiv from the west. One route is to cross the Pripet marshes, which freeze in winter, and the Chernobyl area (not deemed a great complication for a modern military able to operate in a radiation zone).</p> \\n<p>An alternative would be to strike from further west in Belarus, such as the Baranovichy training area. A key sign that Russia is ready to act, Kagan said, will be if “Russian mechanised forces deploy to Belarus”.</p> \\n<p>Even if Putin does not invade, a permanent Russian military garrison in Belarus would have advantages to the Kremlin, as an potential threat not just to Ukraine but to the Baltic states to the north. It would “create a large military base that would give Russia air dominance over Nato’s eastern flank”, said Orysia Lutsevych, a research fellow at foreign policy thinktank Chatham House.</p> \\n<h2>Putin’s military alternatives</h2> \\n<p>The risks inherent in invasion and occupation leave experts such as Dr Taras Kuzio, an associate fellow with the Henry Jackson Society,arguing in a newly released paper that an all-out attack “the least likely” of the military scenarios available to Putin. Instead, the Ukraine expert sees three other options.</p> \\n<p>In the first, Russia simply occupies and annexes the part of the Donbas controlled by separatists, a partial invasion mirroring the 2008 Georgia crisis. That began, Kuzio wrote, after “repeated military provocations” by proxies “led to intervention by Georgian troops”, giving Putin a pretext to respond.</p> \\n<p>A second is to enlarge the occupied territory with a land corridor to previously annexed Crimea, capturing the coastal city of Mariupol. Russia could also seize other key industrial sites and try to degrade Ukraine’s nearby military. “They could take out Turkish TB2 drones and artillery in the Donbas” in an overt, limited campaign designed to weaken Ukraine, said Lee.</p> \\n<p>A final option, said Kuzio, is the “revival of the 2014 ‘New Russia’ project” that would try “to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea”. This would amount to seizing the south, capturing the port of Odessa and perhaps the industrial city of Dnipro.</p> \\n<p>Taking Odessa, population 1 million, would probably require a dramatic air and naval operation, using paratroopers from Crimea followed by marines landing on nearby beaches.</p> \\n<p>Of those options, annexing occupied Donbas would almost certainly be popular in Russia, However, it would be an extremely limited response given the Kremlin’s insistence that its chief goal, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fab301ed-a0ed-404a-9359-9e88f9d7860e\">as most recently repeated by Sergei Ryabkov,</a> Russia’s deputy foreign minister, is “the non-expansion of Nato, the non-accession of Ukraine, Georgia and other countries to the alliance” – raising concerns that a military campaign is probable.</p> \\n<p>“You have to take a step back and ask what Russia’s political goals are,” said Lee. “If Russia wants to force a change in Ukraine’s political orientation, you can see why the Kremlin might look at military options.”</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \\n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"331fb106-f403-4585-bdca-83d2d7e90c59\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\\n    <p></p>\\n    <p><b>Russia</b>&nbsp;</p>\\n    <p><b>Army: </b>280,000, including 2,840 tanks and 6,920 fighting vehicles; 150 Iskander ballistic missiles; 4,684+ artillery; 1,520 surface-to-air batteries.&nbsp;</p>\\n    <p><b>Navy</b>&nbsp;(just the Black Sea fleet): 6 submarines; 6 warships; 35 patrol ships.&nbsp;</p>\\n    <p><b>Air force:</b> 1,160 combat planes, 394 attack helicopters, 714 air defence systems.</p>\\n    <p><b>Ukraine</b></p>\\n    <p><b>Army:</b> 145,000, including 858 tanks and 1,184 fighting vehicles; 90 Tochka ballistic missiles; 1,818 artillery; 75+ surface-to-air batteries.&nbsp;</p>\\n    <p><b>Navy:</b> 1 warship, 12 patrol and coastal ships.&nbsp;</p>\\n    <p><b>Air force: </b>125 combat planes, 35 attack helicopters; 6 medium TB2 drones; 322 air defence systems.&nbsp;</p>\\n    <p><i>Source: International Institute of Strategic Studies</i></p>\\n    <p></p>\\n   </div>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/10/its-our-house-mood-in-kyiv-calm-despite-threat-of-russian-attack', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-10T16:53:02Z', 'webTitle': '‘It’s our house’: mood in Kyiv calm despite threat of Russian attack', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/its-our-house-mood-in-kyiv-calm-despite-threat-of-russian-attack', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/10/its-our-house-mood-in-kyiv-calm-despite-threat-of-russian-attack', 'fields': {'body': '<p>At weekends Yevgeny Tereshchenko goes to the woods outside Kyiv and practises his shooting. “We need to be ready, morally and physically,” Tereshchenko explained, showing off a video in which he springs athletically into action and fires a rifle several times.</p> <p>A Ukrainian army officer until two years ago, Tereshchenko is preparing for a possible Russian attack.

He lies.”</p> <p>Tereshchenko said he had fought in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/nobody-wants-to-be-putins-slave-on-the-ukraine-frontline-as-tensions-rise\">where Moscow-backed separatists run their own mini-fiefdoms from the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk</a>. He said there were some “traitors” active in Ukrainian politics, who would be willing to work with Russia in the event of a takeover.</p> <p>Ukraine and Russia are different countries with different traditions – one democratic, the other strongly autocratic and repressive, he said. He reeled off a series of dates, starting with 1648 when Ukrainian Cossacks allied with Crimean Tatars to throw out their Polish overlords.</p> <p>The rebellion led to the creation of a hetmanate, a “democratic system” in which Ukrainians voted for a military chief or hetman. At the same time, eastern Ukraine became part of the Russian empire. Over the next two centuries Ukrainian traditions, culture and language were eroded, he said.</p> <p>Ukrainian statehood was too precious and too hard won to be sacrificed once again to Russian ambitions, he suggested. “There are groups of us in every town.

Analysts have said that the aggressive demands made by Russia mean that the negotiations are headed for a dead-end.</p> <p>“Regrettably, there are also other aspects of the same sort where we disagree: something that is absolutely necessary to us is categorically unacceptable to the Americans,” Ryabkov told the press.</p> <p>He warned that Russia did not want negotiations to take months or years and insisted that Moscow would also stick to its demands for Nato to roll back its troops and infrastructure in eastern Europe to pre-1997 levels. The US presence on the alliance’s eastern flank was significantly reinforced after the Russian annexation of Crimea and covert military intervention in eastern Ukraine in 2014.</p> <p>“There needs to be a breakthrough, there needs to be a real step toward Russia – a step made by Nato,” Ryabkov said. “If this doesn’t happen ... we very much don’t want to have a situation where Nato countries led by the US make that kind of mistake and once again act to undermine their own security and the security of the whole European continent.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/what-would-be-russia-military-options-in-ukraine-invasion\">What would be Russia’s military options in Ukraine?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said both sides were looking to the upcoming Nato-Russia Council on Wednesday as a testing ground for whether Russia can come to a new arrangement with the security alliance.</p> <p>Ryabkov repeated Russian assurances that Moscow was not planning to attack Ukraine.

Amid this diplomatic whirl, Europe’s biggest diplomatic club has been absent. The EU has no formal role in the talks, although its officials are drawing up possible sanctions to levy against Russia if the Kremlin decides to invade Ukraine.</p> <p>The EU’s exclusion from talks on war and peace in its own backyard hurts. “Between Putin and Biden, Europe is sidelined,” ran a Le Monde headline last week. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell,struck an insouciant note. “I don’t care,” he said when the BBC asked whether the US should have gone ahead with the Geneva talks. The Russians, he said, had “deliberately excluded the EU from any participation” but he had been assured by the US that “nothing will be agreed without our strong co-operation, coordination and participation”.</p> <p>Officials have downplayed the exclusion of the EU. “European allies are at the table, because European allies are in Nato,” said the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. After Nato-Russia talks, Stoltenberg plans to brief EU defence ministers meeting in the port city of Brest in north-western France on Wednesday evening. The two organisations have 21 member countries in common and pages of pledges to improve cooperation.</p> <p>Not everyone buys this reassuring story about Europe’s absence from the top table. “It gives me huge concern,” Radosław Sikorski, a Polish former foreign minister, who now sits in the European parliament, told the Guardian. “The EU is a neighbour of both Ukraine and Russia, these are countries with whom we have intense relationships. And what happens between them affects several member states. Of course we should be there and I am astonished that we are not.”</p> <p>The EU’s foreign policy chief, then Catherine Ashton, was at the table with the US, Russia and Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/17/ukraine-crisis-agreement-us-russia-eu\">in 2014 in Geneva,</a> following the invasion of Crimea. France and Germany later switched to the narrower Normandy format, talking to Kyiv and Moscow, in an attempt to end the conflict in Ukraine. “It was the actions of some member states, Germany and France, and a diplomatic mistake by Ukraine to accept the Normandy formula, and then the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskiy-gives-putin-one-year-strike-deal-end-war\">Minsk formula</a>, that has got us nowhere,” argues Sikorski. “Through a series of missteps we have ended up with the EU excluded from an issue of vital importance for us.”</p> <p>In an uncomfortable irony the crisis is unfolding as EU defence and foreign ministers gather this week in Brest to discuss how the EU can be a more powerful player in a global order challenged by authoritarian powers and rogue actors. The search for the EU’s “strategic autonomy” is championed by France, which took charge of the EU rotating presidency this month. Europe, a senior French government official said, must be “fully sovereign, free in its choices and master of its own destiny”.</p> <p>Another Russian invasion of Ukraine is an obvious big test for “sovereign” Europe. More than 100,000 Russian troops are stationed around Ukraine’s borders and US intelligence has reported that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/russia-ukraine-crisis-putin-troops-visual-guide-explainer\">175,000 could be deployed by the end of January</a>.</p> <p>EU leaders have warned of “massive consequences” in response to any further military aggression against Ukraine. The precise consequences are a closely-guarded secret, as officials believe telegraphing the details would advantage Putin by allowing him to calibrate his response. Even senior diplomats say they are in the dark about exactly what the European Commission has prepared. Nonetheless, a broad list of options has emerged, covering finance, technology and individuals.</p> <p>In the event of a fully-fledged invasion, Russia could be cut off from Swift, the bank-messaging system that connects 11,000 corporations in more than 200 countries. Oligarchs close to the Kremlin could see their assets in western jurisdictions frozen. The EU would also be under pressure not to approve the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is complete, but must clear regulatory hurdles before Russia can start pumping has to Germany.</p> <p>“The Swift option is an option being looked at closely,” said veteran French diplomat Pierre Vimont, who was the top civil servant at the EU’s foreign service between 2010 and 2015. “It has to be looked at closely, and maybe more tailor-made financial sanctions, and also individual sanctions.” The final outcome would depend on the nature of the Russian aggression, he said. “If the Russians go ahead with a large-scale direct military invasion, one could expect that the EU would respond in equal strength.”</p> <p>Diplomatic sources suggested a full-scale invasion would unify the EU to act, whereas a continuing campaign of Russian hybrid attacks, disinformation and support for proxy forces in the Donbas makes the decision more difficult. European countries trade more with Russia and have more to lose than the US, making the sanctions calculus more complex.</p> <p>“If on the contrary there is still pressure from Russia, but we remain with the same level of tension it will be more difficult,” Vimont said, referring to Nord Stream in particular. “It seems this will very much depend on the circumstances.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, member states remain divided over whether to set up an EU military mission to train the Ukrainian army, adding to an EU civilian mission that has been on the ground since 2014 to help Kyiv improve police, courts and border forces.</p> <p>Poland, the Nordic and Baltic states would like to see a fully-fledged army-training mission with EU boots on the ground, whereas other countries wonder whether the same outcome could be achieved by increasing financial aid to Ukraine. The question has gone to and fro, since Ukraine’s government requested a military training programme last July.</p> <p>Sikorski argues Ukraine has much bigger needs from European countries. “What Ukraine really needs is a batch of anti-ship, anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles, but these would be national decisions. I hope the member states are preparing contingency plans to do that if Putin fulfils his threats.”</p> <p>Tomáš Valášek, a member of Slovakia’s parliament and former ambassador to Nato, argued against assuming the EU would be divided, pointing to the bloc’s decision to levy wide-ranging economic sanctions against Russia in 2014 – measures that remain in place. “Historically the track record suggests that when Russia crosses red lines we do the right thing, rather than the opposite.”</p> <p>“What [Putin] has done more recently, with the massing of 100,000-plus troops in Ukraine, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/russia-issues-list-demands-tensions-europe-ukraine-nato\">now with the unprecedented demands of a security architecture</a>, that has actually had a unifying effect.

Tomáš Valášek, a Slovak MP, who served as his country’s ambassador to Nato between 2013 and 2017, said the Nato-Russia Councils he attended “tended to be mere formalities, but not for lack of trying on the Nato side”. He said: “The Russian side wasn’t prepared to go beyond agreed notes, agreed talking points, so in the end these meetings ended up being very formalistic without breaking any new ground.”</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'business/2022/jan/12/russia-europe-gas-crisis-international-energy-agency-boss', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-12T16:54:26Z', 'webTitle': 'Russia is orchestrating Europe’s gas crisis, says energy agency boss', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/russia-europe-gas-crisis-international-energy-agency-boss', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jan/12/russia-europe-gas-crisis-international-energy-agency-boss', 'fields': {'body': '<p>The head of the International Energy Agency has accused Russia of orchestrating Europe’s deepening energy crisis at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions by withholding up to a third of its gas exports.</p> <p>Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, directly blamed Russia’s behaviour for the record-high energy market prices in Europe this winter that threaten to upend large parts of the European economy and plunge millions into a cost of living crisis.</p> <p>He said the historic low gas storage levels across Europe were largely due to Russia’s state-owned gas company, Gazprom, which has sent about 25% less gas than usual to Europe over recent months despite a surge in demand after 2020’s economic slump.<br><br>“We believe there are strong elements of tightness in the European gas market due to Russia’s behaviour,” Birol said reporters on Wednesday. “I would note that today’s low Russian gas flows to Europe coincide with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/gazprom-hits-record-income-as-russia-prospers-from-europes-gas-crisis\">heightened geopolitical tensions over Ukraine</a>.”</p> <p>The IEA’s most damning criticism of Russia’s energy policy to date has emerged after the Kremlin downplayed hopes of diplomatic solutions for the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> crisis on Tuesday, before a meeting in Brussels between Russia and Nato’s 30 member states.</p> <p>This week Russian forces deployed along the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> border conducted a live-fire military exercise involving 3,000 troops and tanks, in a clear rejection of US demands for a de-escalation in the region.</p> <p>At the same time, the world’s biggest supplier of gas has opted to keep a lid on gas exports to Europe where market prices have surpassed the all-time highs set in September to reach a new record last month. </p> <p>Analysts estimate that Europe’s gas prices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/gazprom-hits-record-income-as-russia-prospers-from-europes-gas-crisis\">could fall by half if Russia agreed to increase its exports by 20%</a>.

At one point, a bus stopped in front of the delegation, seemingly by chance, and its passengers poured out and went straight into a dance routine.</p> <p>“Everything was supposed to be ‘spontaneous’,” Sherman later told the Guardian. “And there was a cameraman following everything we did with a 1950s hand-cranked camera. It was all rather surreal.</p> <p>“When we wanted to talk, we walked outside, even knowing there might be bugs in the trees. When we wanted to get a message across and were not sure who we should be talking to, we would sit in a waiting room and speak, knowing we were being listened to.”</p> <p>Sherman did not set out to be a diplomat. She was an activist first, working as a social worker in Baltimore, trying to make affordable housing more available. After jobs as a staffer in Congress and the Democratic National Committee, she ran Emily’s List, an organisation committed to raising funds for pro-choice Democratic women’s candidates.</p> <p>That background combined with her deep involvement in negotiating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-nuclear-deal\">the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran</a>, have made her the subject of deep Republican suspicion. But her experience and cool demeanour won over enough Republicans to win Senate confirmation as deputy secretary of state, by 56 votes to 42.</p> <p>While the former secretary of state John Kerry would fly in at critical moments of the Iranian talks, it was Sherman who led the day-to-day negotiations for the US – a feat of stamina as the discussions frequently went deep into the night.</p> <p>Laura Rozen, who covered the Iran nuclear talks from beginning to end and who now writes the Diplomatic Substack newsletters, recalls a European diplomat observing that, while the Iranians got on better with Kerry, Sherman was seen as the more effective negotiator.</p> <p>“What I think about a lot, watching Sherman doing high-stakes [nuclear] diplomacy with Iran and now with Russia, is her mantra, that the skills are transferrable,” Rozen said. “She trained as a social worker and came into foreign policy through Democratic party politics … and now, as a 72-year-old grandmother, Sherman is working with her former Russian counterpart in the Iran nuclear deal talks [Russian Deputy FM Sergey Ryabkov], to see if the US/transatlantic alliance and Russia can agree on diplomatic solutions to avert war and preserve European peace and security.”</p> <p>The short silver hair and metal-rimmed glasses add to her reputation as a steely, no-nonsense negotiator, but her friend Douglas Rediker, an economist who was formerly the US representative on the executive board of the International Monetary Fund, insists that there is a softer side, that also enhances her skills as a negotiator.</p> <p>“It’s trite but she is tough as nails, she is smart as a whip and she is also enormously human,” Rediker said. “There are some people who are extremely tough and experienced to the point where they are so cynical, that they lose the element of humanity.</p> <p>“Wendy can act like and think like a person as well as someone simply espousing the mandate that she’s been given.”</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/13/russia-says-talks-with-nato-over-ukraine-are-hitting-a-dead-end', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-13T17:29:03Z', 'webTitle': 'Russia threatens military deployment to Cuba and Venezuela as diplomacy stalls', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/russia-says-talks-with-nato-over-ukraine-are-hitting-a-dead-end', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/13/russia-says-talks-with-nato-over-ukraine-are-hitting-a-dead-end', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Russia has refused to rule out a military deployment to Cuba and Venezuela if talks with the west on European security and Ukraine fail to go its way, while warning the latest discussions with Nato were hitting a dead end.</p> \\n<p>In an apparent attempt to up the ante with the Biden administration, Sergei Ryabkov, who led Russia’s delegation in a meeting with the US on Monday, told Russian television he could neither confirm nor exclude sending military assets to Cuba and Venezuela if talks fail.

He said the country’s western allies shared Ukraine’s position that it should be free to choose which security alliances it joined, including Nato.</p> \\n<p>“Ukraine will also continue to work actively with partners to implement a comprehensive package to deter Russia from a new wave of war in Europe, which has already begun,” he said, in a comment posted on his ministry’s website<strong>.</strong></p> \\n<p>A volley of bleak statements from Russian senior officials emerged as Poland’s foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, warned that Europe faced its greatest risk of war in 30 years.</p> \\n<p>Rau was addressing the 57 nations of the OSCE, an organisation that includes Russia, Ukraine, the United States and European nations. It was the third time this week Russia had discussed security with western countries.</p> \\n<p>The Polish minister, who has taken over the OSCE chair, told reporters he “cannot say a breakthrough is imminent” in discussions on European security, while pledging to launch a dialogue. “Some of the participating states believe that it’s enough to make a statement and not to participate in debate,” he said, without naming countries.</p> \\n<p>“It seems that the risk of war in the OSCE area is now greater than ever before in the last 30 years,” Rau had told delegates earlier. “For several weeks we have been faced with the prospect of a major military escalation in eastern Europe.”</p> \\n<p>Russia has mobilised 100,000 troops and placed military hardware along its border with Ukraine, while issuing a series of security demands that Nato has said are impossible to meet, such as removing troops from eastern members of the alliance and a block on any membership application from Kyiv.</p> \\n<p>Ryabkov said discussions were hitting a dead end. “I do not see any reason to sit down again in the coming days, to gather again and start these same discussions,” he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.</p> \\n<p>“We propose to go step by step through the text, to work on it in order to bring it to a stage where it would be ready to sign. This is impossible today, because on the key elements of these texts, the United States and its allies say categorically ‘no’.”</p> \\n<p>Carpenter reaffirmed US readiness to continue a dialogue but added “we are not going to renegotiate core principles”, listing the 1975 Helsinki Accords, the UN Charter and the 1990 Paris Charter, which affirmed the right of sovereign states to make their own decisions about their security, free from the threat of force, and guaranteed the inviolability of borders. “Those are sacrosanct. Those are our bedrock,” Carpenter said. He said he did not know if there were plans to put the US position in writing, as the Russians were demanding.</p> \\n<p>“We’re happy to talk about conflict resolution mechanisms, happy to talk about reciprocal restraint and risk reduction and confidence building, military transparency, all of those things are on the table,” Carpenter said, welcoming a Polish initiative to establish a more regular dialogue among the OSCE’s 57 members to discuss mutual security concerns.</p> \\n<p>Russian officials focused on the agreements that Moscow drafted in December and demanded a response. The country’s mission to the OSCE threatened Moscow would take “necessary measures” if the west did not respond to Russian demands. “If we don’t hear constructive response to our proposals within reasonable timeframe &amp; aggressive behaviour towards [Russia] continues, we’ll have to take necessary measures to ensure strategic balance and eliminate unacceptable threats to our national security,” Russia’s mission to the OSCE wrote on Twitter, citing its ambassador to the OSCE, Alexander Lukashevich.</p> \\n<p>The Russian OSCE mission also warned that “a crisis on the continent may arise with unpredictable consequences for European security”.</p> \\n<p>In Kyiv, Pavlo Klimkin, Kuleba’s predecessor as Ukrainian foreign minister, said this week’s talks with the Kremlin in Geneva, Brussels and Vienna had “eased tensions”. But he said the risk of a military or “other provocation” by Moscow remained extremely high, “especially in late winter or early spring”.</p> \\n<p>“As the talks continue, the threat of immediate escalation, at least the degree of tension, has decreased. This does not mean that the danger has become much less. It has become less, but it persists,” Klimkin told the news agency Interfax-Ukraine.</p> \\n<p>Klimkin predicted that Vladimir Putin was more likely to attack Ukraine using “hybrid methods” than stage a full-blown military invasion.</p> \\n<p>“Blitzkrieg against Ukraine is impossible. They understand that more than a third of our people are ready to hold weapons, and when there is danger for the country, I am sure there will be even more.” He said Putin wanted to turn back the clock and make central and eastern Europe a zone of Russian influence and domination again, as it was in Soviet times.</p> \\n<p>“This is by definition pure insanity … Russia’s real goal is the destruction of Ukrainian statehood. Our very existence hinders Putin’s model of vertical governance,” Klimkin said.</p> \\n<p>In Moscow, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said there could be a complete rupture in US-Russian relations if proposed sanctions targeting the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and other top civilian and military leaders were adopted. Senate Democrats have also proposed targeting leading Russian financial institutions if Moscow sends troops into Ukraine.</p> \\n<p>The EU is also drawing up possible sanctions, although has declined to reveal details.</p> \\n<p>Last month Ryabkov compared the current tensions over Ukraine with the 1962 Cuban missile crisis — when the Soviet Union deployed missiles to Cuba and the US imposed a naval blockade of the island. That crisis ended after John F Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev agreed Moscow would withdraw its missiles in exchange for Washington’s pledge not to invade Cuba and the removal of US missiles from Turkey.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/13/what-has-been-achieved-after-three-rounds-of-talks-on-ukraine', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-13T18:40:36Z', 'webTitle': 'What have Ukraine talks achieved, and is war now more likely?', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/what-has-been-achieved-after-three-rounds-of-talks-on-ukraine', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/13/what-has-been-achieved-after-three-rounds-of-talks-on-ukraine', 'fields': {'body': '<p>The Guardian’s world affairs editor assesses the outcome of three rounds of talks this week about the fate of Ukraine, involving Russia, the US, Nato and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).</p> <p><strong>Did the talks achieve anything?</strong></p> <p>Not much.

It is clear now that Russia was not using its troop build-up and its demands about Nato as a bluff to achieve gains on other matters. The three meetings this week have provided opportunities for Russia to take an off-ramp and find a face-saving solution, but Moscow has not taken them. There is little doubt any more that Vladimir Putin is seeking nothing less than a transformation in European security, with a much-reduced Nato presence along its borders.</p> <p><strong>Are there likely to be more talks?</strong></p> <p>Russian officials on Thursday did not make it sound like there was much appetite in Moscow for further discussions. The Poles suggested having an intensified dialogue on security issues within the framework of the OSCE, but the Russians have said all along they want a quick resolution, rather than an ongoing process of airing grievances. Ukraine has suggested a summit to address the crisis, this time with Kyiv at the table, but there has been no response from Moscow.</p> <p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p> <p>The diplomats go back to their capitals to discuss the next steps. All eyes will be on Moscow and the movements of Russian troops and armour in the region around Ukraine. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, is due to give a press conference on Friday. That should give a clearer idea of Putin’s state of mind. The Russians have demanded the US give written comments on the draft agreements that Moscow published in December, which include the proposed limits on Nato. It is not clear yet whether Washington will submit those written responses summing up its objections.</p> <p><strong>Has the chance of war increased or decreased after the</strong><strong> talks?</strong></p> <p>Increased. The probability that Putin was using the pressure on Ukraine as leverage to get something else was always small. Now it has all but disappeared. It is also clearer that the US and its allies are not ready to offer a fudge on Ukraine’s Nato membership, acknowledging that it is unlikely for the foreseeable future.

Sadly, we knew it could happen,” he said. He added: “It’s difficult to say [who is behind it]. I can’t blame anybody as I have no proof. But we can imagine.”</p> <p>Stoltenberg said Nato and Ukraine would in the coming days sign an agreement on enhanced cyber cooperation. Kyiv would get access to Nato’s malware information sharing platform, he said.</p> <p>Sweden’s foreign minister, Ann Linde, said the west must stand up to any Russian aggression. “We have to be very firm in our messages to Russia, that if there are attacks against Ukraine, we will be very harsh and very strong and robust in our response,” she said. Sweden stood in solidarity with Kyiv, she added.</p> <p>On Thursday, Russian envoys sounded a bleak note after discussions this week with the OSCE in Vienna, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato\">Nato</a> and the US. Sergei Ryabkov, who led Russia’s delegation, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/russia-says-talks-with-nato-over-ukraine-are-hitting-a-dead-end\">talks had hit a dead end</a>.</p> <p>The Kremlin has demanded an assurance Ukraine and Georgia will never join Nato. It wants Nato to remove troops and equipment from its member states in eastern Europe, and to return deployment to 1997 levels, before Nato expanded.</p> <p>On Friday Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow would not wait indefinitely for a response. “We have run out of patience,” he said at a news conference. “The west has been driven by hubris and has exacerbated tensions in violation of its obligations and common sense.”</p> <p>Russia has mobilised 100,000 troops on the border with Ukraine and sent in military hardware. Its defence ministry <a href=\"https://ria.ru/20220114/bezopasnost-1767782406.html\">announced</a> that further equipment would be relocated from the east of the country as part of what it said was an “exercise”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Moscow said it had carried out a special operation against the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-governments-turn-tables-ransomware-gang-revil-by-pushing-it-offline-2021-10-21/\">ransomware group REvil</a> following a request from the US. The FSB spy agency which Vladimir Putin used to run said it had detained and charged the group’s members.</p> <p>The US embassy in Moscow had no immediate comment. But the move appears to be part of carrot and stick operation following the latest cyber-attack on Ukraine, designed to wrong-foot the Americans. Thus far, the Kremlin has made little effort to curb hacks on western targets by Russia-based cyber-criminals.</p> <p>Ukraine has been repeatedly targeted since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea and kickstarted a war in the eastern Donbas region. About 288,000 cyber-attacks took place in the first 10 months of 2021, according to official figures, with 397,000 in 2020.</p> <p>The attacks have also been directed at critical infrastructure. In winter 2015 suspected Russian hackers took out parts of the country’s power grid, which led to almost a quarter of a million Ukrainians losing power and heat. A repeat attack happened in 2016.</p> <p>In 2017, suspected Russian hackers unleashed the NotPetya virus, causing mayhem. Banks, newspapers and leading companies were targeted.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/14/russians-buildup-troops-ukraine-border', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-14T09:29:30Z', 'webTitle': 'Low key and loyal: the domestic response to Russian troop buildup', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/russians-buildup-troops-ukraine-border', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/14/russians-buildup-troops-ukraine-border', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Russia’s buildup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/what-would-be-russia-military-options-in-ukraine-invasion\">a potential invasion force on Ukraine’s borders</a> has produced little reaction at home despite western threats of devastating economic consequences that would harm tycoons, top businesspeople and the general public alike.</p> <p>Since 2014, recurrent rounds of sanctions over the annexation of Crimea, the shooting down of the MH17 jetliner, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/16/qa-russian-hackers-vladimir-putin-donald-trump-us-presidential-election\">2016 US elections interference</a>, the Salisbury poisonings, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/uk-imposes-sanctions-seven-russians-alexei-navalny-poisoning\">attempted assassination of Alexei Navalny</a> and other international scandals have steeled Vladimir Putin’s elite supporters and prepared them for the worst.</p> <p>Many tripped over themselves to publicly show their loyalty to the Kremlin during the 2014 crisis, despite facing crippling sanctions as a result. “You must pay for everything in life, including knowing [Putin],” said Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire friend of the Russian president who was sanctioned in March 2014, in an interview with state media.</p> <p>Behind closed doors, top businesspeople and officials browbeat each other into staying loyal in the face of personal sanctions. “Our country is under sanctions. And the president is alone on the parapet,” Vladimir Yakunin, the then head of Russian Railways, said during a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/aug/19/2018-world-cup-russian-cup-crimean-teams\">leaked account</a> of a heated committee meeting in 2014 on whether to integrate Crimea’s football teams into the Russian league – a decision some feared would earn them personal sanctions.</p> <p>After eight years of persistent conflict with the west, the elite and the public appear largely resigned to whatever course Putin chooses in his quest to assert dominance over Ukraine.</p> <p>Despite signs pointing toward a greater conflict, polling and anecdotal evidence indicates that many Russians do not feel the threat of war as intensely.</p> <p>“This talk of war is more done on the western side,” said Dmitri Trenin, the head of the Carnegie Moscow Center, in a television interview this week. “On the Russian side, there is none of that. There is no feeling of an impending war in Ukraine. But military pressure is certainly there, and military pressure is certainly to continue; the military pressure may increase.”</p> <p>Russia has positioned more than 50 battalion tactical groups – or nearly a third of its total – within striking distance of Ukraine. More main battle tanks and other armoured vehicles have been filmed departing Russia’s far east on flatbed railcars, indicating the buildup is continuing even as high-stakes negotiations were under way in Europe this week. Top Russian officials have indicated talks are at an impasse.</p> <p>“I do not see any grounds to sit down, convene another meeting and begin the same discussion all over again in the coming days,” said Sergei Ryabkov, the deputy foreign minister who represented Russia at this week’s negotiations with the US in Geneva. He demanded that the US deliver concrete counterproposals or Russia would be forced to ensure its security via other means.</p> <p>While the Kremlin has delivered bombastic rhetoric blaming the west for the conflict, there has not been a similar outburst of nationalism like the one after the annexation of Crimea. “We don’t notice much enthusiasm … the government’s ratings continue to fall, despite the possibility of a large-scale confrontation,” said Denis Volkov of the independent Levada Centre.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/16/ukraine-russia-truce-crimea-referendum\">events of March 2014</a> also energised opponents of the clash with Ukraine, a portion of the Russian opposition that risked openly opposing the growing conflict in Ukraine. Liberals “are aghast of President Vladimir Putin’s warmongering, and they are very vocal in their condemnation of the Kremlin revanchism, but the situation in Ukraine itself is not the focus of their conversation,” wrote the journalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan.</p> <p>Ultimately, there is little in terms of domestic politics to restrain Putin from going to war in Ukraine if he so chooses.</p> <p>The Kremlin has spent years preparing for a broader economic conflict with the west, including building up considerable cash reserves that would insulate it from the economic shock of new US sanctions. And as the experience of 2014 shows, its powerful oligarchs will also be expected to shoulder their burden in the coming conflict.</p> <p>“Personal inconveniences and costs to one’s business can and should be neglected when it comes to the interests of the state,” said Timchenko in the interview. “There can be no compromise here.”</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'commentisfree/2022/jan/14/the-guardian-view-on-russia-and-ukraine-what-comes-after-jaw-jaw', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'commentisfree', 'sectionName': 'Opinion', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-14T18:02:09Z', 'webTitle': 'The Guardian view on Russia and Ukraine: what comes after jaw-jaw? | Editorial', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/14/the-guardian-view-on-russia-and-ukraine-what-comes-after-jaw-jaw', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/14/the-guardian-view-on-russia-and-ukraine-what-comes-after-jaw-jaw', 'fields': {'body': '<p>A week that began with low expectations has ended with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/what-has-been-achieved-after-three-rounds-of-talks-on-ukraine\" title=\"\">a still bleaker mood</a>. No one believed that three rounds of talks between the US, Russia and others would magically resolve the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\" title=\"\">Ukraine</a> crisis. But with 100,000 Russian troops massed near the country’s borders, the build up of weaponry and growing sabre-rattling from Moscow, the hope was that the negotiations could help to probe Vladimir Putin’s intentions, and perhaps offer him pathways towards an eventual de-escalation.</p> <p>After several days of dialogue, the mood is glummer. On Thursday, the Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, warned that Europe was the closest to war it had been for three decades. After the Nato discussions, and before the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe talks concluded, Russian’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/russia-says-talks-with-nato-over-ukraine-are-hitting-a-dead-end\" title=\"\">said</a> the parties had reached a dead end.</p> <p>Russian troop flows continued as the talks took place. The head of the International Energy Agency complained that Russia was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/russia-europe-gas-crisis-international-energy-agency-boss\" title=\"\">withholding gas exports</a>, deepening Europe’s energy crisis. On Friday morning, Ukraine said it had experienced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/ukraine-massive-cyber-attack-government-websites-suspected-russian-hackers\" title=\"\">massive overnight cyber-attack</a> on official websites. Shortly afterwards, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-lavrov-press-conference-ukraine/31654291.html\" title=\"\">told reporters</a> that Moscow had “run out of patience”. The US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/us-russia-false-flag-ukraine-attack-claim\" title=\"\">alleged</a> that Moscow has positioned saboteurs in Ukraine ready for a “false flag” operation to use as a pretext for a Russian attack.</p> <p>Washington and Moscow were never going to agree to each other’s headline demands – Russia, that Nato must close its doors to new members in the east (though it knows full well Nato has no plans to let in Ukraine and Georgia, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OlyaOliker/status/1481676416106254341\" title=\"\">cannot say so</a>) and roll back troops and weaponry in central and eastern Europe; the US, that Russia should withdraw from Ukraine’s borders. The US sensibly focused on issues that could reduce security risks and be of interest to Russia: missile agreements and military drills. But these are at best of second order importance to Mr Putin, who appears <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/vladimir-putin-russian-president-ukraine-analysis\" title=\"\">increasingly anxious</a> to force Nato to shrink its sphere of influence, satisfying a long-held Russian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/russias-belief-in-nato-betrayal-and-why-it-matters-today\" title=\"\">grievance</a> over its expansion, and <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/eastern-europe/ukraine/b092-responding-russias-new-military-buildup-near-ukraine\" title=\"\">end the standoff over Ukraine</a> that began when Russia annexed Crimea and sparked the conflict in the Donbas. A 2015 peace deal, which has not prevented ongoing skirmishing, is said to be close to collapse. Russia denies it is planning to invade but has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/21/putin-warns-of-possible-military-response-to-aggressive-nato-russia\" title=\"\">talked</a> of a “military-technical response” to what it calls Nato aggression.</p> <p>None of this means that the talks were a mistake – even if it proves to be the case, as some fear, that Russia participated in them as part of its march towards war. Mr Putin’s record gives no reason to doubt his willingness to go to war, and he paid little price for 2014. But it was right to offer Russia opportunities for de-escalation, even if it shows little interest in taking them. Nor does the depressing end to the week prove that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/what-would-be-russia-military-options-in-ukraine-invasion\" title=\"\">military action</a> – still less a full scale invasion – is inevitable.</p> <p>There is a relatively short period of winter in which an offensive is feasible, and Mr Putin cannot leave his troops in place for ever – though he could leave hardware in position. Western nations are flagging sanctions packages and the fate of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline as a deterrent. Defence assistance for Ukraine – including through bolstering its efforts to fend off cyber-attacks – is necessary, but is unlikely to be sufficient to be gamechanging.

It said: “Ukrainians! … All information about you has become public. Be afraid and expect worse. It’s your past, present and future.”</p> <p>Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential office in Kyiv said, “practically 90%” of the affected websites were back online by mid-afternoon.</p> <p>“The most strategic infrastructure in Ukraine was not be destroyed by this attack.

He said Ukraine was working with the US and the UK to confirm who was behind the assault.</p> <p>Foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said that initial investigations suggested that “hacker groups associated with the Russian secret services” were responsible. The White House, however, could not immediately confirm that.</p> <p>“We don’t have an attribution at this time,” a US official told reporters. “While we continue to assess the impact with the Ukrainians, it seems limited so far, with websites coming back online. We will consult with allies and partners including Ukraine.”</p> <p>In a message to the Guardian, the foreign ministry’s spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, said: “As a result of a massive cyber-attack, the website of the ministry of foreign affairs and other government agencies are temporarily down.”</p> <p>He added: “Our specialists have already started restoring the work of IT systems and the cyber-police has opened an investigation.”</p> <p>Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, condemned the attacks. Borrell said the EU’s political and security committee and cyber units would meet to decide how to respond and to support Kyiv.</p> <p>“We are going to mobilise all our resources to help Ukraine to tackle this. Sadly, we knew it could happen,” he said. He added: “It’s difficult to say [who is behind it]. I can’t blame anybody as I have no proof. But we can imagine.”</p> <p>Stoltenberg said Nato and Ukraine would in the coming days sign an agreement on enhanced cyber cooperation. Kyiv would get access to Nato’s malware information sharing platform, he said.</p> <p>Sweden’s foreign minister, Ann Linde, said the west must stand up to any Russian aggression. “We have to be very firm in our messages to Russia, that if there are attacks against Ukraine, we will be very harsh and very strong and robust in our response,” she said. Sweden stood in solidarity with Kyiv, she added.</p> <p>On Friday, there was more confirmation of Russian forces being moved towards Ukraine from across the country.

It wants Nato to remove troops and equipment from its member states in eastern Europe, and to return deployment to 1997 levels, before Nato expanded.</p> <p>On Friday Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow would not wait indefinitely for a response. “We have run out of patience,” he said at a news conference. “The west has been driven by hubris and has exacerbated tensions in violation of its obligations and common sense.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Moscow said it had carried out a special operation against the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-governments-turn-tables-ransomware-gang-revil-by-pushing-it-offline-2021-10-21/\">ransomware group REvil</a> following a request from the US.

The first winter snow blanketed Kyiv. Many were still celebrating Orthodox Christmas – which falls on 7 January – or had left town for the holidays. Bars and restaurants rang out with Dean Martin’s Let It Snow!, while the fir trees in Independence Square looked like a mini-Narnia.</p> <p>Sure, Russia might invade at any moment. But, as Ukrainians wearily point out, the country has already been at war for eight long years, ever since Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea and kickstarted a brutish conflict in the east of the country, which has claimed nearly 14,000 lives. Friday’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/ukraine-massive-cyber-attack-government-websites-suspected-russian-hackers\" title=\"\">dawn cyber-attack on government websites</a> was merely the latest in a series of hostile acts.</p> <p>What to do in the event of a military operation by Moscow, and whether to stay, flee or fight? The consensus – at least according to surveys – is that a third of the population is ready to take up arms. In the upmarket Podil district, with its art deco mansions, a new piece of graffiti read: “<em>Biy Moskaliv!</em>”(“Beat Up Russians!”)</p> <p>Sitting in a law office just across the road, Serhii Filimonov explains what he intends to do, should the Kremlin attack. “There are about 50 of us. We will meet and decide where we can best fight,” he said. His group is made up of middle-class professionals: IT staff, designers, actors, journalists. Filimonov runs a security business and <a href=\"https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/oleh-sentsov-film-nosorih/31454479.html\" title=\"\">starred in a film shown at Venice</a>.</p> <p>None of this is likely to alarm Russia’s defence ministry, which has sent 100,000 troops to Ukraine’s border. These include the existing front between the Ukrainian army and the Moscow-run separatist territories of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east, as well as Belarus in the north, Crimea in the south and the breakaway Russian enclave of Transnistria in the west.</p> <p>But the Kyiv creatives know how to shoot. All are combat-hardened veterans of the 2014 war. Filimonov took part in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/03/ukraine-soldier-youre-better-clueless-because-truth-horrible-moscow-ilovaysk\" title=\"\">bloody battle for Ilovaysk</a>, when the Russian army trapped Ukrainian forces, and was wounded by an enemy mortar strike. After an operation to remove shrapnel, he returned to the front, serving as a volunteer against Moscow with the Azov battalion.</p> <p>“We have registered weapons. We will defend our homes,” Filimonov said. “Putin wants to go back to the borders of the Russian empire. You can see this in Belarus, Kazakhstan. Here in Ukraine he wants to create a <em>tsarstvo</em><em> – </em>a tsardom. This is a war of civilisations. It’s the west versus Eurasia, democracy against slavery and authoritarianism. We want democracy and freedom.”</p> <p>Most experts agree that Russia’s vastly superior army, air force and navy could quickly seize Ukrainian territory. But Andriy Zagorodnyuk, Kyiv’s former defence minister, says the Kremlin’s conscript-heavy military will immediately face resistance, should it try to occupy towns and cities. Volunteers such as Filimonov and small army groups will launch bloody partisan attacks. “There is definitely no panic. I don’t see any panic at all,” Zagorodnyuk told the <em>Observer</em>. He acknowledged Ukraine’s relative military weakness but he said Kyiv had around 500,000 soldiers including reservists. It was ready for guerrilla war “on a huge scale”, he said.</p> <p>Masi Nayyem, a lawyer who founded the Podil practice, admitted he was looking forward to shooting at Russians again. In 2016 he fought with a paratrooper brigade in Avdiyivka, Ukraine’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/nobody-wants-to-be-putins-slave-on-the-ukraine-frontline-as-tensions-rise\" title=\"\">frontline position</a> outside rebel-held Donetsk. “In peace time you have to be serious, responsible. In war you don’t have any considerations or need to think about consequences. It’s black and white,” he said.</p> <p>Talks between Russia and the US, Nato and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/russia-says-talks-with-nato-over-ukraine-are-hitting-a-dead-end\" title=\"\">ended last week in a dead end</a>. The Kremlin has demanded assurances from the Biden administration that Ukraine and Georgia will never join Nato. In essence it wants to overturn the post-cold war order – restoring central and eastern Europe as a zone of Warsaw Pact-style Russian influence, from which Nato troops and weaponry are banned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7879ec41ad0c33e65998fd0bda5c08b2ebbd927\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7879ec41ad0c33e65998fd0bda5c08b2ebbd927/0_137_3327_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukrainian reservists train near Kiev last December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ukrainian reservists train near Kiev last December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergey Dolzhenko/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beneath the Kremlin’s shrill, tough-man rhetoric lies a mystery. It is unclear why Putin is moving with such strategic haste, demanding that the US and its allies rewrite international security rules in Russia’s favour. His demands are “non-starters”, as the US’s negotiator and deputy secretary of state, Wendy Sherman, put it. Putin’s possible goal, she suggested, was to establish a pretext for war.</p> <p>Andrew Wilson, professor in Ukrainian studies at University College London, said the timing from the Kremlin’s perspective was opportune. Putin has jailed his chief domestic critic, Alexey Navalny, and squashed Navalny’s opposition movement. Russia was awash with cash, thanks to rising energy prices. On the international stage the Kremlin faces off against a US administration it regards as weak and indecisive.</p> <p>What could happen next? “Creating a crisis to create opportunities is what they [the Russians] do,” Wilson said. He added: “I don’t think a full-scale invasion is possibility number one. The Ukrainians have pretty successfully advertised the huge cost of invasion and occupation. But Putin has to have a win of sorts, either on European security or Ukraine itself.”</p> <p>All of which presents observers with a dilemma: how to report on a crisis which does not quite feel like a crisis, and appears largely to exist inside Putin’s head? It is evident that Russia’s president feels emotionally about Ukraine. Last summer he wrote a long essay stating that Ukraine and Russia were “one people”, divided by the whims of Bolshevik map-making and western meddling.</p> <p>“With nothing yet happening on the ground, there’s nothing I can report to tell you something new and impactful,” Nataliya Gumenyuk, a Ukrainian journalist and author admitted, saying it was hard to make sense of a conflict in which Ukraine often appears as a bystander. She added: “We are caught in the position of waiting for the ‘worst scenario’ without a chance to influence the outcome.”</p> <p>Gumenyuk said the Kremlin’s goal was to turn the clock back to the early 1970s, before the Soviet Union signed the Helsinki accords guaranteeing human rights – a mistake, in the eyes of Moscow’s current hawkish leadership. Others have argued that Putin’s preferred geo-political model goes back further, to the imperialist 19th century, when mighty great powers over-rolled lesser ones.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/opinion/russia-ukraine-putin-nato.html\" title=\"\">opinion piece for the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/opinion/russia-ukraine-putin-nato.html\" title=\"\">New York Times</a></em> the eminent Russian political scientist Lila Shevtsova said the current stand-off over Ukraine had little in common with the political deals struck at Yalta in 1945, or at the congress of Vienna in 1815. Back then, the participants stuck to the rules. “[Putin’s] aim, really, is a Hobbesian world order, built on disruption and readiness for surprise breakthroughs,” she wrote.</p> <p>How a surprise breakthrough might morph into war is a topic of conversation inside the Kyiv government of comic-turned-president Volodymyr Zelensky. Little was seen of him last week. Zelensky won a landslide victory in 2019 after campaigning on a platform of peace. Faced with Russian intransigence over the fate of Ukraine’s already occupied territories, he has moved towards Nato and the west.</p> <p>US intelligence agencies say the risk of invasion is “high”. Their Ukrainian counterparts think Moscow may be planning a “staged provocation”. This could take the form of an attack on Russian citizens – at the embassy or consulate perhaps – or against Russian soldiers in Transnistria. The Kremlin would blame the “attack” on far-right Ukrainian nationalists, with the incident used for propaganda and as a <em>casus belli</em>.</p> <p>Alex Kovzhun, a political strategist who advised Ukraine’s former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, said the Kremlin needed to craft a compelling narrative. “They are obsessed with their TV ratings. All of us Ukrainians are extras in their internal TV show. They are the protagonists. From time to time they change the bad guys. Ukraine is not their favourite location.”</p> <p>Kovzhun added: “A fantastic postmodern storytelling device is the wink. In 2014 Putin winked when he said there were no Russian units in Crimea. It’s a conspiracy. He invites all Russian TV viewers to share in this conspiracy. He used the wink in Salisbury. Everybody knew two Russian idiots travelled there to kill Sergei Skripal, as part of a special operation.”</p> <p>It is just possible, of course, that Putin’s brinkmanship is part of an elaborate bluff, the latest in a series of stress tests designed to reveal weaknesses among the west’s ruling class and America. No one – save for the man in the Kremlin – can really know. But Filimonov thinks a storm is coming. “We are convinced something will happen,” he said. “Putin needs Ukraine. An attempt to seize it is inescapable. We will fight until the end.”</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/17/russia-ukraine-attack-german-minister-annalena-baerbock', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-17T13:32:22Z', 'webTitle': 'Russia would pay ‘high price’ for attack on Ukraine, says German minister', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/russia-ukraine-attack-german-minister-annalena-baerbock', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/17/russia-ukraine-attack-german-minister-annalena-baerbock', 'fields': {'body': '<p>The new German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, sought to reassure a nervous Ukraine that she will not allow Germany to compromise on the basic principles of Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty when she meets the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow for the first time on Tuesday.</p> <p>Baerbock, a member of the Green party, said on a visit to Kyiv she was ready for serious dialogue with Russia about mutual security, but was not willing to backtrack “on basic principles such as territorial inviolability, the free choice of alliances and the renunciation of the threat of violence”.</p> <p>She said Moscow, which has massed troops on Ukraine’s borders, would suffer if it launched an attack. “Each further aggressive act will have a high price for Russia, economically, strategically, politically,” she told a news conference with her Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba. “Diplomacy is the only way.”</p> <p>Her visit is being watched warily by European, UK and US administrations for signs that Germany may revert to its traditional role of seeking independent dialogue with Russia in preference to firmness.</p> <p>Baerbock is seen as part of younger generation of German politicians strongly committed to projecting human rights in foreign policy and determined to take Germany away from its historic willingness to compromise with Moscow, but the SPD-led German chancellery is thought less inclined to break with the policy of the former German chancellor Angela Merkel. It will be deeply frustrating for some other western states if Germany continues to act as a drag anchor as Europe and the US have been making strenuous efforts to present a united front inside Nato.</p> <p>Her visit comes after three high-level diplomatic meetings last week ended with Russian troops still on Ukraine’s borders, but no definitive sign whether Putin would risk a military incursion or instead start talks with the US about arms control in Europe, a more limited agenda than his call for a redrawing of the security architecture of Europe.</p> <p>Parts of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Luhansk and Donetsk have been controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014.

It would be tragic if, after having been through the painful process of withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Biden administration is now pulled deeper into the crisis over Ukraine.</p> <p>But the risks are growing by the day.

The very limited results of last week’s talks, combined with the cyber-attack on the Ukrainian government websites and news of possible Russian preparations for a false flag operation in Ukraine all intensify the pressure.</p> <p>Frustration and anger in the face of Putin’s frank disregard for human life is natural and healthy. A war in Ukraine would also erode international law and norms that favor the peaceful resolution of conflicts, with negative repercussions for the United States. But it’s wrong to make the Ukraine crisis into a <a href=\"https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fprotect2.fireeye.com%2Fv1%2Furl%3Fk%3D31323334-501d2dca-3137856f-454455534531-256ef8c3a82b987c%26q%3D1%26e%3Dad95d4d9-1feb-480b-969f-95a832bfc446%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.defenseone.com%252Fideas%252F2022%252F01%252Fus-must-prepare-war-against-russia-over-ukraine%252F360639%252F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cchristopher.chivvis%40ceip.org%7Cf6dc6c4be152419d8d9408d9d92e8f60%7C2f1b2c902dab43fdbb45e43dd6e09cc6%7C0%7C1%7C637779616271067547%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=xv3aWQNtfWdJfczg5YNHAk%2F2XHSXsmNeKreDzgUWBQc%3D&amp;reserved=0\">totemic issue</a> for the whole international order.</p> <p>With tensions already so high, accelerating the deployment of anti-aircraft, anti-armor, or other weapons to Ukraine has more of a chance of hastening Putin’s march toward war then slowing him down. For such deployments to be effective, they would probably need to be accompanied by US military advisers, greatly increasing the risk of direct US-Russia conflict. Ukraine deserves western support, but we shouldn’t forget that isn’t a Nato member.</p> <p>Instead of trying to deter Putin with military measures, the United States should make every effort to keep last week’s diplomacy going. The current negotiating agenda focuses on a follow-on to the moribund treaty on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces and resurrection of elements of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty. While desirable, these alone are almost certainly not enough to keep Russia in the talks.</p> <p>In truth, it’s hard to say what will, but every diplomatic option needs to be on the table to forestall a Russian invasion. Russia’s insistence that Nato formally close its door to all future enlargement is unrealistic, but so are any hopes that Ukraine might someday join the alliance. Staunch resistance of several allies and Ukraine’s internal obstacles to meeting the requirements make this undeniable. Biden should be ready to signal to Putin that he is willing to explore creative solutions that would acknowledge these realities. It would be an extraordinary irony if Ukraine were to lose its independence as a state over the unfillable principle that it has the right to join an alliance that does not really want it.</p> <p>Any inkling of diplomatic accommodation of Russian demands of course risks bringing a firestorm of domestic and foreign criticism down on the president. High-level diplomacy with the Russian autocrat is especially hard given the way the Democrats attacked Trump for his embrace of Putin, a man Biden once called “a killer”. Then there is the risk that Putin rebuffs the offer publicly and invades anyway, leaving the Administration hanging in the wind and seemingly lending weight to the charges of appeasement.</p> <p>But if diplomacy fails, Russia will soon invade, and everyone will lose except perhaps Presidents Putin and Xi. Faced with an invasion, Biden would have no alternative but to act on his threats, sanctioning Russia, and providing assistance to Ukraine. Over time, Nato nations would be forced to spend more on defense, including for land-based military capabilities with little relevance to strategic competition with China. China and Russia would draw closer together, accelerating a troubling trend toward the hardening of geopolitical fault lines, circumstances that recall the run-up to the first world war, and which Biden has expressly said he wants to avoid. None of this would be helpful to Biden’s aim of serving the needs of the American middle class.</p> <ul> <li><p>Christopher S Chivvis is the Director of the American Statecraft Program and a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</p></li> </ul>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/opinion', 'pillarName': 'Opinion'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/19/ukraine-frontline-fear-and-defiance', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-19T14:45:25Z', 'webTitle': 'Fear and defiance on Ukraine’s frontline: ‘We don’t like dictators here’ ', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/ukraine-frontline-fear-and-defiance', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/19/ukraine-frontline-fear-and-defiance', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Yiry Ulshin surveyed a scene of ruin. Before him were the remains of what was once a school. Desks were covered in debris. A photo of the class of 2011 lay in the wreckage.

Why did Russia do this?” Ulshin, a Ukrainian army commander, asked. </p> \\n<p>The abandoned primary school is situated in Shyrokyne, in eastern Ukraine, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2021/dec/16/on-the-ukraine-frontline-only-the-dead-arent-afraid-video\">on the frontline between the Ukrainian army and pro-Russian forces</a>. The village was once a resort. Tourists would stay in its guesthouses, walk along the sandy beach and paddle in the picturesque Sea of Azov.</p> \\n<p>Now it is a ghostly wreck. In 2014 Russia annexed Crimea, down the coast, and kickstarted a violent conflict in the Donbas region. The following year Ukrainian militias <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/14/fighting-erupts-in-eastern-ukraine\">clawed back some of the province’s seaside strip</a> including Shyrokyne, 14 miles east of the port city of Mariupol. “My friend was killed in fighting here,” Ulshin said.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/01/ukraine_map/giv-825gRuWIsUTQgpC/\" data-alt=\"map\"> \\n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/01/ukraine_map/giv-825gRuWIsUTQgpC/\">map</a> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Today the village’s holiday complex resembles a phantasmagoric film set. An alley of pulverised flats leads on to a glass-strewn summer terrace. There is a rusted child’s bicycle, a washing machine and a savagely twisted bonnet from a GAZ-53 truck. The ground is pitted with shell holes. Swimming is not advised: the beach is mined. A seagull floated above it.</p> \\n<p>The separatists did not retreat far, ensconcing themselves just beyond the hillside village of Vodyane, a mile away and visible from the net-covered former sanatorium that serves as the soldiers’ frontline base. Washing was hanging on a line; logs were piled up for fuel. “Two days ago they fired a rocket at one of our cars, out on patrol,” Ulshin said. “It missed.”</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60bfc9fdfa42fbd1b0c2a9d577ea333bb2cdbe34\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60bfc9fdfa42fbd1b0c2a9d577ea333bb2cdbe34/0_579_7736_4642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activists hold posters during a Say NO to Putin rally in Kyiv on 9 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists protest against Russian aggression at a rally in Kyiv on 9 January.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Efrem Lukatsky/AP</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Was anywhere in the village safe? “No,” Ulshin said. “Death happens when you don’t expect it. The Russians [separatists] work very professionally. A sniper shot me in 2018. I lost so much blood, people thought I wasn’t going to make it. But here I am. Ten of my men have been wounded.”</p> \\n<p>Since autumn, Russia has assembled a potential invasion force of 100,000 soldiers on Ukraine’s borders. The latest signals are ominous. The Kremlin says military exercises will take place next month in Belarus, 90 miles north of the capital, Kyiv. According to the Ukrainian government, Russian forces are covertly stationed in rebel mini-fiefdoms in the cities of Donetsk – adjacent to Mariupol – and Luhansk.</p> \\n<p>So far, Putin has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/what-would-be-russia-military-options-in-ukraine-invasion\">kept the world guessing</a> as to what he plans to do. The EU and US have condemned Russian aggression and threatened sanctions. This week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/17/uk-supplying-ukraine-with-anti-tank-weapons-mps-told\">the UK flew defensive anti-tank weapons to Kyiv</a>. The Biden administration is reportedly considering military help. On Wednesday the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/nato-invites-russia-for-fresh-talks-on-europe-amid-ukraine-crisis\">visited Kyiv</a>. None of this is likely to stop a Russian incursion should Putin order one.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \\n <blockquote> \\n  <p>A lot of us are ready to fight. We will resist in every city, in every village. Ukrainians hate Putin</p> \\n </blockquote> \\n</aside> \\n<p>“Look at history. All conflicts have an active phase and a less active one,” Ulshin said. The Kremlin would not seize the whole of Ukraine, an enormous and bloody undertaking, he thought; instead it would pursue hybrid war, with the goal of toppling Ukraine’s Nato-aspiring government and replacing it.</p> \\n<p>Ukraine’s soldiers are motivated, professional and ready to defend their homes. But it is obvious they are badly outgunned. Ulshin said he had received some help from Lithuania in the shape of four lightweight bulletproof plates. In the near distance shots rang out, followed by a percussive boom from an auto-grenade launcher.</p> \\n<p>Ukraine lost much of its navy in 2014, when Russian special forces seized Crimea. Moscow eventually returned the Donbas, an ageing Soviet warship that now sits in Mariupol’s port alongside two small armoured artillery boats, the Ludny and Kremenchuk. This meagre collection is no match for Russia’s mighty Black Sea fleet.</p> \\n<p>“It’s old but reliable,” Cptn Oleksandr Hrigorevskiy said, pointing to the Donbas’s bow machine gun. Stamped on the side was a date, 1954. The Russians trashed the ship’s communication system before handing it back, he said, and many of his former officer colleagues defected. The boat subsequently caught fire. It is now used as a command and repair ship.</p> \\n<p>The deck offers a sweeping view of the Azov Sea bathed in a raspberry light. At 9am each day sailors raise and salute the Ukrainian flag. At night the Russian port of Yeysk twinkles in the distance. The Azov and Black seas are a key commercial route for Russia, linked to a network of rivers and canals.</p> \\n<p>According to Hrigorevskiy, the Kremlin has annexed the Azov Sea by stealth. Under a 2003 agreement, Russia and Ukraine are supposed to share access. But Moscow now controls Crimea’s Kerch Strait, the only way in and out. In 2018 it started impounding Ukrainian civilian vessels, dealing a death blow to Mariupol as a cargo port.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4041b7b77afd00b06327efe03216a67e3112160\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4041b7b77afd00b06327efe03216a67e3112160/0_113_3384_2030/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin on 19 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin on 19 January.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pavel Bednyakov/AP</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Of late, Moscow has declared large chunks of the internal sea off limits to Ukrainian boats, citing the need to carry out “naval exercises”. When the Donbas set off towards Kerch in December, sailing in international waters, Putin’s FSB spy agency accused Kyiv of an act of aggression. “We watched a report on Russian TV. They play psychological games,” Hrigorevskiy said.</p> \\n<p>Mariupol stands in the way of any potential Russian advance from the east. In 2014, Kremlin-backed separatists controlled the city for two months. Since then pro-Kyiv volunteers have moved to the area.</p> \\n<p>Anatoliy Lozar helped to liberate Mariupol, and subsequently married a local woman. He said Russian sentiment was still strong, especially among older residents. “Television plays a big role,” he said. “You can get Russian state channels for free. You have to pay for Ukrainian ones.” Lozar said most people in Mariupol vote for the opposition party of Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Moscow oligarch accused of treason and now under house arrest. </p> \\n<p>Over at Mariupol’s aerodrome, soldiers acknowledged that Moscow was likely to bomb the runway and other strategic military targets, should it attack. “Yes, we can’t defend physical infrastructure. But we’ve learned to spread our forces out, to minimise losses,” Taras Eleyko said. He added: “Putin is a card-sharp. He would need 600,000 troops to occupy Ukraine. He doesn’t have that.”</p> \\n<p>Eleyko was part of a travelling amateur theatre troupe from western Ukraine. The group had arrived at the military airport to entertain troops with a traditional mystery play known as a <em>vertep</em>. This one featured familiar characters such as an angel and devil, as well a crown-wearing Putin – plus Joe Biden, who carried a stars and stripes flag.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1fae37777a05d70f1a28d8ff7560bafc2e878b5\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1fae37777a05d70f1a28d8ff7560bafc2e878b5/0_51_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Ukrainian sniper training in the Donetsk region on 17 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Ukrainian sniper training in the Donetsk region on 17 January.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Kudriavtseva/Reuters</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>The show took place in what was once the departure lounge, beneath a colourful communist-era mosaic.

She wore a skeleton costume and carried a white scythe.</p> \\n<p>‘We’re afraid Russia will invade and capture Ukraine.

If there is a big war, I fear in the first weeks we will have many casualties.”</p> \\n<p>Chebeliuk predicted that a Russian offensive would set off a partisan war. “A lot of us are ready to fight. We will resist in every city, in every village. Ukrainians hate Putin, especially in the west of our country.

I think that it is good for there to be coordination between Europe and the US but it is vital that Europe has its own dialogue with Russia.”</p> <p>Officials in Brussels insist that Russia has not been able to divide the west in recent months as it has amassed more than 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine.</p> <p>But for all the protests of a unified approach, the EU was sidelined from talks held last week between Russia and the US, Nato and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.</p> <p>The Normandy format is a legacy of a meeting of the leaders of Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia during the 2014 D-day celebrations.</p> <p>It subsequently became a vehicle for implementation of the 2015 Minsk agreements designed to end the separatist war in Ukraine’s Donbas region that followed Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.</p> <p>Macron said, however, that the EU had to work out a coordinated approach in its future talks with Russia and address its vulnerabilities with regard to the Kremlin, including energy supply.</p> <p>The EU has threatened severe economic and diplomatic consequences should there be a further military incursion. But the 27 member states are divided as to what should trigger sanctions, with some arguing that cyber-attacks or false-flag operations should be dealt with in the same way as a full-on occupation.</p> <p>Macron said: “We’ve seen migration movements being manipulated. We’ve seen cyber-attacks. We’ve seen hikes in gas prices. And on this front we need to build in collective resilience together.</p> <p>“The security of our continent requires strategic rethinking, strategic rearming of Europe as an area of balance and peace. And when it comes to dialogue with Russia in particular.</p> <p>“This dialogue is something I’ve been standing up for for many years. It’s not just a vague idea … We need this dialogue we need in Europe collectively to set out our own requirements and make certain that they are respected, and we need to be in a position to make that happen.”</p> <p>Beyond the escalating security threat to the east, Macron touched on a range of EU priorities for the French government, including strengthening the rule of law within the bloc, reducing the gender wage gap and giving rights to people who are commissioned with piecemeal work through web platforms. He also proposed including the right to abortion in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p> <p>Citing the issues of Northern Ireland and fishing rights in UK waters, he warned the British government that in order to “remain friends” it “needs to commit to itself in good faith respecting the agreements already concluded with the union”.</p> <p>Macron told critical MEPs that he would not use the EU presidency as a “springboard” for his reelection as French president in three months’ time. However, he challenged those who equated his belief in stronger powers at an EU level with a lack of patriotism.</p> <p>He said: “I will distinguish between those that love their country and culture … and those that want to destroy Europe. I think actually there is a majority here, for example, who believe in Europe but also the cultures and identities of each country but still fight against the barbaric acts of nationalism.”</p> <p>Ahead of the first round of the French presidential election in April, Macron’s political opponents, including on the European parliament benches, sought to use his appearance to criticise his record.</p> <p>Yannick Jadot, the Green MEP and presidential candidate, told Macron he had “sacrificed” Europe’s ambitions on the climate crisis. “You will go down in history as the president of climate inaction.”</p> <p>Jordan Bardella, an MEP from Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally, told the parliament that European immigration policy meant member states and their people could no longer decide “who enters or leaves their territory” so Europe risked “no longer being Europe”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the far-right TV pundit and presidential challenger Éric Zemmour headed to Calais in northern France to deliver a speech on the site of a former makeshift camp where thousands of migrants had once slept rough as they hoped to stow away on lorries to reach England.</p> <p>He said France should immediately deport any migrant entering its territory who hoped to reach the UK. He said that, because of immigration, Macron’s idea of Europe was “a Europe without mind, body or soul, pulling up its own roots, erasing its own history”.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/19/russia-could-act-against-ukraine-at-any-moment-says-us', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-20T00:11:43Z', 'webTitle': ' Joe Biden thinks Russia will attack Ukraine – but will face a ‘stiff price’', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/russia-could-act-against-ukraine-at-any-moment-says-us', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/19/russia-could-act-against-ukraine-at-any-moment-says-us', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Joe Biden has said he thinks Russia will attack Ukraine, warning that Moscow would face a “stiff price”, but he admitted Nato was divided on how to respond if there is only a “minor incursion”.</p> \\n<p>The White House was forced to issue a hasty clarification to that last point, saying that any movement of Russian forces over the border would be treated as invasion.</p> \\n<p>But Biden, in his most extensive remarks on the Ukraine crisis to date, given at an extended press conference on Wednesday, alarmed the government in Kyiv and strayed from the show of determined unity that Nato has sought to project.</p> \\n<p>Asked about Vladimir Putin’s intentions, the US president said: “I’m not so sure he is certain what he’s going to do.

He suggested a major movement of troops into Ukrainian territory would be a red line.</p> \\n<p>“There are differences in Nato as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens,” Biden said. “If there’s Russian forces crossing the border … I think that changes everything.”</p> \\n<p>There was an immediate dismayed reaction from Kyiv on Biden’s choice of words, and his suggestion that a “minor incursion” would divide Nato and draw an uncertain response. One Ukrainian official <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1483938387446935559\">told CNN</a> it “gives the green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure”.</p> \\n<p>A few minutes after Biden finished speaking, his spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, issued a clarification.</p> \\n<p>“President Biden has been clear with the Russian president: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that’s a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our allies,” Psaki said in a written statement.</p> \\n<p>“President Biden also knows from long experience that the Russians have an extensive playbook of aggression short of military action, including cyberattacks and paramilitary tactics. And he affirmed today that those acts of Russian aggression will be met with a decisive, reciprocal and united response.”</p> \\n<p>Earlier in the day the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Russia could take “further aggressive action” against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> “at any moment”, adding that Putin’s military intentions were still unclear as he prepared for talks with his Russian counterpart at the end of the week.</p> \\n<p>Speaking after meeting Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv, Blinken said Russia had amassed “very significant forces” on Ukraine’s borders, including in Belarus where major exercises are due to begin next month. It could double them in “relatively short order”, he said.</p> \\n<p>Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/nato-invites-russia-for-fresh-talks-on-europe-amid-ukraine-crisis\">talks on Friday in Geneva</a> with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, Blinken said he was relentlessly pursuing a peaceful solution to the crisis. But there seem few signs that Moscow and Washington can reach diplomatic agreement in Switzerland.</p> \\n<p>The Kremlin wants Nato forces to withdraw from eastern Europe and to return to 1997 levels of deployment. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Rybakov, said on Wednesday that Moscow would be satisfied with a unilateral US commitment to vote against Nato membership for Ukraine.</p> \\n<p>Blinken said he did not have a “piece of paper” by way of answer to Russia’s latest security demands, but he appeared to rule out a veto promise over Ukraine’s future, saying closing Nato’s doors to new members was an “absolute non-starter”.</p> \\n<p>Asked what Russia might do next, Blinken said: “I can’t read Vladimir Putin’s mind.”</p> \\n<p>But he pointed out that Russia’s president had a long history of aggressive behaviour. This included attacking Georgia in 2008 and annexing Crimea in 2014, and “training, arming and leading” a separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine. Blinken added: “We have to base our actions on the facts.”</p> \\n<p>After Kyiv, Blinken is due to travel to Berlin for talks with German and European allies. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said relations with the US were advancing at “Formula One speed”.</p> \\n<p>He acknowledged Russia was refusing to negotiate with his government directly, saying: “Mr Lavrov is avoiding me.”</p> \\n<p>Russia has brushed off calls to withdraw its troops from the Ukrainian border by saying it has a right to deploy its forces wherever it likes on its own territory.</p> \\n<p>It also has rejected US allegations that it is preparing a pretext to invade Ukraine. Lavrov dismissed the US claim of a Russian “false-flag operation” as “total disinformation”.</p> \\n<p>Speaking at a meeting of the Valdai discussion club, Ryabkov repeated Moscow’s denials it had plans to attack Ukraine.</p> \\n<p>“I am confident that there is no risk of a large-scale war that could break out in Europe or somewhere else. We do not intend to take any aggressive steps,” he said. “We have no intention of attacking, staging an offensive on or invading Ukraine.”</p> \\n<p>Ryabkov said Moscow would not consider an informal moratorium on Ukraine’s entrance into Nato sufficient. </p> \\n<p>“If the US assumes a unilateral legally binding commitment that it will never vote in favour of admitting Ukraine and other countries to Nato, we will be ready to consider this option. It would be an easier path for the US,” he added.</p> \\n<p>Meanwhile, Russia continued its deployment of military assets from its far east to the borders of Ukraine. Open source researchers said on Wednesday they had identified elements of a BM-27 Uragan rocket artillery launcher in Belarus about 200km (125 miles) from Kyiv.</p> \\n<p>The deployment of heavy rocket artillery so close to the Ukrainian capital could further increase fears that the plans for joint exercises could provide cover for a Russian-led advance that could quickly engulf Kyiv and its government.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1483780965868744713\"> \\n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ended negotiations with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecBlinken?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SecBlinken</a>.

The UK’s chief of defence staff, Tony Radakin, said that a Russian invasion could trigger conflict on a scale <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-would-be-like-world-war-two-warns-defence-chief-hkvw75cgc\">“not seen in Europe since world war two”</a>.</p> <p>The textbook triggers are in place: a toxic border, thousands of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/russia-moves-troops-to-belarus-for-joint-exercises-near-ukraine-border\">troops </a>entrenched, alliances uncertain and everywhere reckless and confusing talk of “consequences”. There is bluff on all sides, and boys’ toys galore. But what on earth does it have to do with Britain?</p> <p>I recall visiting Moscow in 1992 after the fall of the Soviet Union, when every Russian expert said the same thing: the west may have won the cold war, but above all don’t humiliate Russia. Don’t do what was done to Germany in 1919 and devastate morale. Moscow’s Boris Yeltsin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/russias-belief-in-nato-betrayal-and-why-it-matters-today\">begged the west </a>not to push Nato to Russia’s borders. It would risk, he said, “the flames of war bursting out across the whole of Europe”.</p> <p>The west blatantly derided the advice. Nato leaders feasted on victory, recruiting members eastwards through Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and the Baltic states. Pleas from Russian moderates were ignored, while London opened its doors to Russia’s stolen wealth. The result was predictable. In 1999, Vladimir Putin took power on a populist, patriotic ticket. To Britain’s former Moscow ambassador, Rodric Braithwaite, Putin was a master of articulating <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2019/10/how-deal-dictator\">“the sense of humiliation</a> Russians felt after the collapse of the Soviet Union”. He exploited Nato’s aggressive expansionism for all it was worth. When in 2008 America’s George W Bush <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/01/nato.georgia\">backed extending Nato membership</a> to Georgia and Ukraine (a move that was vetoed by Germany and France) Putin seized land in both.</p> <p>Ukraine is an independent state but one that, like Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan, has usually maintained peaceful relations within Moscow’s sphere of interest. When Putin was in dispute with Ukraine and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/28/russia-crimea-white-house\">seized its province</a> of Crimea in 2014, the west imposed economic sanctions on Russia that were pointless. Like most sanctions, they made the imposers feel briefly good, while harming the poor, rewarding crooks and entrenching the offending regime in power. Witness Iran, North Korea and now Afghanistan.</p> <p>Putin has never indicated the slightest wish to invade, damage or interrupt trade with Britain or the US. He behaves outrageously towards his critics, at home and abroad, and offends western standards of decency and liberalism. The result is an ageing, emigrating and demoralised Russian population. But that is his country and his choice. We may choose to exert soft power over Moscow, through cultural, educational and economic forces but we cannot police Putin’s borders or stop him mistreating his neighbours. That is not our business.</p> <p>Every European crisis becomes drenched in history. Lord Steel writes in a letter to <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/times-letters-bbc-and-a-future-without-the-licence-fee-0ht00tq2t\">the Times</a> that the situation reminds him of Czechoslovakia in 1938 – or perhaps Poland. Or is this Serbia in 1914? Is Donbas another Cuba, or perhaps Kosovo or Bosnia? Does Putin want another iron curtain? Hitler makes an almost daily appearance. Yes, we can learn from history, but the greatest lesson is that history can be a trap.</p> <p>In his <a href=\"http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181\">2021 essay</a> on the “historical unity of Russia and Ukraine”, Putin left no room for doubt about his vision of a Russian domestic empire, a family of Slav nations – albeit without mentioning Stalin’s Ukrainian atrocities. With Belarus, Ukraine has for centuries formed Moscow’s outer bailey against the ever-turbulent politics of western Europe. But Putin also reiterated his commitment to the Minsk II settlement aimed at ending the fighting in Donbas, brokered with Kyiv in 2015 by France and Germany but never implemented. </p> <p>Analysis of this deal by Anatol Lieven of <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/world/ukraine-donbas-russia-conflict/\">Washington’s Quincy Institute</a> frames it as a perfectly equitable way out of the Donbas conflict. It involves Kyiv granting extensive domestic autonomy to the Russian-speaking regions of eastern Ukraine, the west backing down on Bush’s proposed eastwards expansion of Nato, and Russia pulling its troops back from a border restored to Ukraine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/ukraine-frontline-fear-and-defiance\">Fear and defiance on Ukraine’s frontline: ‘We don’t like dictators here’ </a> </p> </aside>  <p>In practice, the biggest hurdle to the Minsk II settlement was Kyiv’s reluctance to grant autonomy to<strong> </strong>Donbas. Across Europe, the biggest threat to national peace and stability lies in the inability of central governments, of any colour, to tolerate regional decentralisation and diversity. Ask them in Belgrade, Madrid, even London. A problem, too, was the west’s refusal to acknowledge any justice in Moscow’s sense of border insecurity. As is drearily familiar, Europe’s politicians take belligerent stances and then, as Lieven points out, “leaders who do not intend to go to war may stumble into a situation in which they are unable to stop or turn back”.</p> <p>Putin emerges from a deluge of recent biographers as a primeval Russian nationalist, steeped in the politics of oligarchy, kleptomania and violence. But his strategic outlook is not complicated. It is rooted in traditional Russian pride and paranoia. He has no desire to conquer Europe, much as the west’s defence lobby, bruised by Iraq and Afghanistan, may long to believe otherwise.</p> <p>Reports from the frontline indicate that many Ukrainians expect Britain (and the US) to come to their aid, including militarily, should Russia move further into Donbas. Britain’s foreign secretary Liz Truss absurdly <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/liz-truss-tank-estonia-margaret-thatcher_uk_61a60ddfe4b025be1aee877e\">sits on a tank</a> and warns Putin not to make a “<a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-any-incursion-by-russia-would-be-massive-strategic-mistake-warns-foreign-secretary-liz-truss-12510190\">strategic mistake</a>”. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/world/europe/russia-uk-defender-crimea.html\">taunts Putin with destroyers</a> careering up and down the Crimean coast. Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/17/uk-supplying-ukraine-with-anti-tank-weapons-mps-told\">sends Ukraine a few anti-tank missiles</a>. The invitation to Moscow to call Britain’s bluff is glaring.</p> <p>No one is going to stop Putin’s tanks from rumbling into Donbas if he is determined to do so. The west can raise the cost to him with economic sanctions, but they will make no difference, except to the price of gas. For Britain to seek brownie points for Nato by threatening war over this would be beyond madness. Yet in view of the equivocal language of Truss, Wallace, Radakin and others, this reality should be stated in the clearest terms – not least to the Ukrainians.</p> <p>Russia’s border disputes with its neighbours have nothing whatsoever to do with Britain. And they certainly have nothing to do with saving Boris Johnson’s skin.</p> <ul> <li><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/opinion', 'pillarName': 'Opinion'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/20/biden-lays-bare-nato-divisions-over-russia-aggression-in-ukraine', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-20T11:13:15Z', 'webTitle': 'Biden lays bare Nato divide over Russian aggression against Ukraine', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/biden-lays-bare-nato-divisions-over-russia-aggression-in-ukraine', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/20/biden-lays-bare-nato-divisions-over-russia-aggression-in-ukraine', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/russia-could-act-against-ukraine-at-any-moment-says-us\">confirmed at his press conference on Wednesday</a> what has been apparent for weeks – Nato remains divided over how to respond to Russian aggression against Ukraine.</p> <p>His admission of a split was overshadowed by his passing remark that a minor incursion would be treated differently to a full-scale invasion. The White House afterwards clarified that a minor incursion meant cyber-attacks, as opposed to a movement of Russian troops into Ukraine sovereign territory.</p> <p>None of this is academic since Biden said he thought Vladimir Putin would risk an invasion, however much Nato tried to change the Russian president’s calculus with threats.</p> <p>The greatest tension over the correct response is between the US and Germany, hence the visit of the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to Berlin on Thursday before a meeting with Russian officials in Geneva.</p> <p>Some of the differences are manageable. Neither of the two main sides of the German coalition are willing to sell arms to Ukraine, saying it is longstanding German policy, based on its war experience, not to send weapons into a conflict zone. The current vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, caused a storm last year when he suggested, against that policy, that the Greens might provide defensive arms, but he beat a fast retreat. By contrast the US, the UK and Turkey do supply arms.</p> <p>Critics point out that the underlying morality guiding Germany’s approach to arms exports is opaque. According to government figures released on Monday, sales to Egypt boosted Germany’s arms exports to record levels in 2021. Preliminary figures from the Economic Affairs and Climate Action Ministry showed Germany exported arms worth €9.35bn (£7.79bn/$10.65bn) last year – 61% up on 2020. This leaves open the question of why it is acceptable to sell arms to a repressive regime, such as Egypt, but not to a country seeking to avoid repression, such as Ukraine.</p> <p>On the issue of energy dependency, the tensions are deeper. A compromise reached last summer between the US and Angela Merkel, reaffirmed this week by her successor as chancellor, Olaf Scholz, implies that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/nord-stream-2-how-putins-pipeline-paralysed-the-west\">Nord Stream 2</a> pipeline built to carry gas from Russia to Germany will be affected if an invasion happens. </p> <p>In the absence of an invasion, the Greens and the Social Democrats (SPD) have for now parked their differences by waiting to see if the pipeline receives regulatory approval in Germany and the EU. The SPD want it to go ahead and the Greens do not, but the German approach – not just in the SDP, the home of detente – may be shifting. A letter from more than 73 eastern Europe security experts in Die Zeit urged Germany to end its three-decade policy of standing by in the face of Russian aggression.</p> <p>Solely in deference to Germany, Biden has worked hard with Democratic senators to prevent them backing sanctions now, but the issue is still live in US politics, and patience with Germany among Republicans is thin.</p> <p>Separately there has been a dispute about whether Russia can be detached from SWIFT, the international payments system.

The Chonhar frontline, by contrast, is tranquil. A handful of civilians arrive in a white minivan and cross the last section on foot, rolling small cases.</p> \\n<p>Despite this apparent normality Kyiv is taking no chances. Soldiers stand guard in a network of trenches reinforced with wooden pallets. They peer at the enemy through letterbox-style positions, guns at the ready. For now, the only intruder is a ball of tumbleweed. A cold wind blows.</p> \\n<p>The cafe’s tower, reached via a perilous staircase, serves as an observation platform. It is topped with a decorative black finial featuring a Crimea map. On a ground floor wall someone has scrawled: “Putin is a prick”. Nearby, a BTR armoured personnel carrier sat hidden behind a fir tree.</p> \\n<p>“Vladimir Putin dreams of making a land corridor between Russian-occupied territories in the Donbas and Crimea. We won’t let him,” Ivan Arefiev – a military officer – said. He added: “We are ready for whatever happens, including an attack.”</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"713bb39614035f9b118b458f302f1b539a3b3e8c\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/713bb39614035f9b118b458f302f1b539a3b3e8c/0_355_7935_4761/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Ukrainian soldier in a trench at Mariupol, in the Donetsk region of Ukraine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Ukrainian soldier in a trench at Mariupol, in the Donetsk region of Ukraine.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andriy Dubchak/AP</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>There are few obvious signs of a Russian military presence. At night the soldiers say they can hear the roar of enemy tanks as they manoeuvre, concealed behind a small wood. But the stark fact is the Kremlin could advance from here at any time: from land, sea or air.</p> \\n<p>With 100,000 Russian troops now encamped on its borders, Ukraine is surrounded. In the south, Moscow’s armed forces may break out from Crimea and move north and then east along the coast, a flat 250km strip encompassing the Ukrainian ports of Berdyansk and Mariupol.</p> \\n<p>The strategic goal would be to link Crimea to the separatist mini-fiefdoms of Donetsk and Luhansk. Moscow effectively seized these territories in spring 2014, installing and arming local proxies and starting a conflict that has gone on ever since.</p> \\n<p>In the east, Russian tanks may advance across the border towards the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and smash through the “line of contact” between the separatists and the Ukrainian army. In the west, Russian forces are stationed near to Odessa in Transnistria, a breakaway republic in the east of Moldova.</p> \\n<p>The most ominous developments, meanwhile, are playing out in the north. The Kremlin has moved troops, fighter jets and heavy weapons to Belarus, ahead of what it says are large-scale military exercises next month.</p> \\n<p>Tactical battalions from Russia’s far east have arrived, bringing with them Uragan self-propelled multiple rocket launchers and S-400 air missile defence systems. This formidable attack force is within striking distance of Kyiv and its pro-western government, 200km away.</p> \\n<p>So far talks between Russia and the west including a meeting on Friday between US secretary of state <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/20/antony-blinken-us-ukraine-russia-berlin-speech?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=twt_gu&amp;utm_medium&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1642682160\">Antony Blinken</a> and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov have gone nowhere. Russia is demanding a cold war-style zone of influence in eastern Europe and the withdrawal from former Warsaw pact powers of Nato forces.</p> \\n<p>All of which has led the US and its allies to conclude an invasion is imminent – something <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/russia-could-act-against-ukraine-at-any-moment-says-us\">Joe Biden this week acknowledged to be “likely”</a>.</p> \\n<p>Experts in Kyiv say any Russian incursion would meet massive Ukrainian resistance. “There are currently enough Russian forces on the borders to launch a swift attack and inflict significant losses. But there are not enough forces to win,” Serhii Kuzan, chair of the <a href=\"https://uscc.org.ua/en/about/\">Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center</a>, said.</p> \\n<p>Ukraine had 261,000 troops and 400,000 military veterans, as well as surface to air missiles and new antitank weapons delivered this week by the UK, he pointed out. It has mined the coast along the sea of Azov and installed anti-ship missiles. A Russian amphibious landing would incur huge losses, he said.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c727c20e8c36a62eaa79013c8fd60725d59a38e6\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c727c20e8c36a62eaa79013c8fd60725d59a38e6/0_67_2550_1530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukrainian soldiers at a checkpoint close to the line of separation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ukrainian soldiers at a checkpoint close to the line of separation.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andriy Dubchak/AP</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Amid this grim martial backdrop, Chonhar is for the moment a peaceful wildlife haven. No hunting is allowed. Its wetlands are home to growing numbers of ducks, hares, rabbits and pheasants, seen clattering amid reeds and tall yellow feather grass. “When I got here 5am I saw a fox,” Chekman said.</p> \\n<p>For locals, Russia’s 2014 Crimea takeover has been a disaster. Chonhar was once a stop on the railway line to Sevastopol, with thousands of holidaymakers crossing by car in high season every day. Next to the cafe is a crumbling Soviet gateway. One pillar remains, adorned with grapes.</p> \\n<p>“This place is now a <em>tupik</em>, a dead end,” Vyacheslav said, standing at what was once the village’s thriving roadside fish market. With no tourists, and little vehicle traffic of any kind, business was slack, he said.</p> \\n<p>Vyacheslav was selling silvery roach, large smoked white-fish and mullet, which he had caught himself. His neighbour Valery, a coffee seller, said times were better in the Soviet Union – an entity Putin seems determined to bring back. “You could buy <em>kolbasa</em> [sausage] for eight roubles,” Valery said.</p> \\n<p>A Russian land-grab of Kherson province would solve Crimea’s most pressing problem: a lack of water. A Soviet-built 400km long canal network used to connect the Dnipro river with the peninsula, supplying residents and irrigating fields. In 2014 Ukraine built a dam to stop its flow. In 2021 Crimea suffered severe drought.</p> \\n<p>Defending the canal is now a strategic priority for Ukraine. A single Ukrainian soldier was visible last week where the canal begins, outside the city of Khakova. He had a Kalashnikov and an alsatian dog. Snow had blanketed the frozen waterway and its picturesque willows.</p> \\n<p>At the Chonar crossing point soldiers sleep in a cosy barracks warmed by a log stove. They rejected Putin’s recent assertion that Ukraine and Russian are “one people”. “We are moving to Europe and Nato. Russia is stuck in the Soviet past,” Lt Petro Yanchenko said. Why was he fighting? “So my family can live in a free country,” he replied.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"069c14fbe045160d49183952d178d500dd6598a5\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/069c14fbe045160d49183952d178d500dd6598a5/0_0_6449_3870/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Ukrainian soldier walks past an abandoned house at the frontline.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Ukrainian soldier walks past an abandoned house at the frontline.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andriy Dubchak/AP</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Yanchenko said Crimea and the part-Russian occupied Donbas region belonged to Ukraine. He added that Kyiv had unresolved territorial claims of its own. Russia’s southern Kuban area – just across from Crimea’s Kerch strait – was <a href=\"https://euromaidanpress.com/2020/11/19/the-brutal-russification-of-ukrainian-kuban-from-zaporizhian-sich-to-the-kuban-cossack-host/\">once home to Ukrainian Cossacks</a>, he said. “It’s our territory,” he asserted.</p> \\n<p>The prospect of Crimea ever returning to Ukraine seems remote. But Chekman noted that the peninsula had changed hands on numerous occasions. Its bloody history is never far away. Chonhar has a needle-like memorial to Soviet dead from the second world war. On the Russia side is a monument to anti-aircraft gunners.</p> \\n<p>Nazi Germany swept through the village in the summer of 1941, killing some of its Jewish residents and occupying Crimea for two years. The Red army drove the Wehrmacht out and restored Ukraine as a USSR republic. Putin appears to regard Ukraine’s independence and statehood in 1991, and its western aspirations today, as a historic error.</p> \\n<p>But he may find bringing the country back under Moscow’s imperial grip is not as easy as it seems. “Russia can’t do any more than threaten us,” Alex Lunyov – a sergeant in the marine corps – said. “This is our house, our home. Our grandfathers and ancestors are buried here. If the Russians come we will fight. We will kill them like cattle.”</p> \\n<p>Lunyov said the Ukrainian army was tougher, more professional and better trained than in 2014, when superior Russian forces inflicted heavy defeats in the east, including a massacre in the city of Ilovaisk. “Since then we have learned how to fight,” he pointed out, saying Ukraine had right on its side.</p> \\n<p>He grinned. And added with a twinkle: “A warrior’s armour is heavier than a collar of a slave.”</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/22/us-embassy-in-ukraine-requests-staff-evacuation-amid-war-fears', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-22T15:16:08Z', 'webTitle': 'US embassy in Ukraine ‘requests staff evacuation’ amid war fears', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/us-embassy-in-ukraine-requests-staff-evacuation-amid-war-fears', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/22/us-embassy-in-ukraine-requests-staff-evacuation-amid-war-fears', 'fields': {'body': '<p>The US embassy in Ukraine has requested the evacuation of all non-essential staff amid increasing fears of an imminent Russian invasion and the arrival overnight of arms deliveries promised by President Joe Biden, according to a CNN report.</p> <p>US evacuations are likely to start “as early as next week”, the US cable news network said, citing a source close to the Ukrainian government.

Does he hope to restore past Soviet glories or crush Kyiv’s pro-western trajectory? Is it about his historical legacy or his need for a repeat electoral “Crimea bounce”? Such theories carry weight, but they all miss the essential point.</p> <p>Putin is and always has been an unpleasant, smirking, devious, KGB-trained thug whose main aim in life, besides retaining power, is to weaken and divide the western democracies.

Regrettably, he himself has exhibited no such scruples when silencing critics and opponents over the past 20 years. The late Alexander Litvinenko, Anna Politkovskaya and Boris Nemtsov are three among many. So the question now is how to treat the chronic RMS (rogue male syndrome) from which Putin evidently suffers. Just think about it. Almost single-handed, he has whipped up the biggest east-west confrontation of the post-Soviet era.

Putin is certainly enjoying western discomfort. He’s already made significant geopolitical gains. But is he really serious about all-out invasion? Despite much Kremlin tub-thumping, there’s <a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/12/17/how-do-russians-feel-about-a-war-with-ukraine-a75847\" title=\"\">scant enthusiasm among the Russian public for a ground war in Ukraine</a> – no great patriotic, nationalist surge, only fatalistic acceptance.</p> <p>It’s obvious, too, that no western leader wants to lock horns (or tusks) over Ukraine, any more than in Crimea in 2014. EU disunity over what to do, typified by Germany’s fractious coalition and the way Brussels has let itself be bypassed, is embarrassing but telling. For all its tough words, Nato also hangs back. As for US president Joe Biden, he pledged to end wars, not engage in new ones. Last week’s excruciating “minor incursion” gaffe left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/biden-lays-bare-nato-divisions-over-russia-aggression-in-ukraine\" title=\"\">his aides counting marbles</a>.</p> <p>Ukrainians, naturally, are against being invaded again. Their leaders are successfully leveraging the crisis to obtain greater security assistance and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/17/uk-supplying-ukraine-with-anti-tank-weapons-mps-told\" title=\"\">weaponry from the US and Britain</a>. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, wants sanctions on Russia imposed immediately. But like western Europe, Kyiv’s strong preference is clear: no more war.</p> <p>The same goes for Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, understandably worried that, if push comes to shove, Nato’s protective shield may not be all it’s cracked up to be. In Taiwan, they fret that a Ukraine invasion will create a precedent. But <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-russia-china-ukraine-xi-jinping-63dc1765177fd2fb2a94ade690d32c27\" title=\"\">Xi Jinping, China’s president, is a more subtle adversary</a>. He doesn’t want war with the west, either – not yet, anyway.</p> <p>Russia’s worries over Nato’s intentions and future membership for Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia are not baseless. But they are overcooked. If war comes, it will accentuate the pro-western trends in the old “near abroad” Putin so dislikes. As the US secretary of state, <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/antony-blinken-says-russia-risks-crisis-with-global-consequences/a-60490736\" title=\"\">Anthony Blinken, noted in Berlin </a>last week, there is genuine western willingness to address Russian concerns.</p> <p>It’s plain, in sum, that almost no one, Moscow hawks and Donbas militia headbangers aside, wants an escalating conflict. It’s plain, too, that if it happens, Ukraine will go down as one man’s war, provoked, prosecuted and publicly owned by Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin.</p> <p>The west is complicit in this crisis. Its leaders have known what kind of man Putin is since the brutal second Chechen war. He invaded Georgia in 2008 and seized Crimea in 2014. He’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/inquiry-strikes-blow-to-russian-denials-of-syria-chemical-attack\" title=\"\">overseen chemical weapons atrocities in Syria</a>, hostile cyber operations in Europe, pernicious anti-democratic election meddling, and multiple murders and poisonings. Yet they continue, for the most part, to treat him as a normal leader.</p> <p>Whether or not he ultimately attacks Ukraine again, directly or indirectly, Putin is a proven, ongoing global menace. He went rogue years ago. His behaviour grows steadily more threatening. So what kind of elephant trap would snare him? How to tie him down?</p> <p>Start now by declaring Putin an international pariah. Launch multiple universal jurisdiction prosecutions over his alleged complicity in overseas assassinations, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Sanction his cronies. Go after his money. Limit diplomatic contacts. Find alternative energy suppliers. Help democrats such as Alexei Navalny rid Russia of him. In short, freeze him out.</p> <p>The world has been here before, many times. One screwed-up little man must not be allowed to start a war no one wants.

The situation on Ukraine’s land and sea borders, where Moscow has amassed troops and powerful military assets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/we-are-ready-for-whatever-comes-on-the-ukraine-frontline\" title=\"\">remains grave</a>. But alarmist predictions of imminent, large-scale conflict have proved wide of the mark.</p> \\n<p>The dogged insistence of Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, on pursuing diplomatic means to address Russia’s security concerns clearly made an impression on his notoriously intransigent opposite number, Sergei Lavrov. Russia’s foreign minister said the talks had been “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/russia-and-us-to-meet-in-geneva-as-ukraine-war-fears-grow\" title=\"\">constructive and useful</a>” and agreed to continue them this week.</p> \\n<p>This may turn out to be a temporary reprieve. All the noxious factors that precipitated this crisis remain in play. President Vladimir Putin’s overarching aim is to undermine agreed, post-Soviet security structures in Europe and recreate a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/05/observer-view-on-russia-threat-to-ukraine\" title=\"\">sphere of influence</a> beyond Russia’s borders. He is desperate to stop Ukraine becoming a successful, fully independent, pro-western democracy whose example puts his corrupt, oppressive regime to shame.</p> \\n<p>To this end he wants Nato, in effect, to withdraw from countries on Russia’s western periphery that joined the alliance after the Soviet collapse. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/russia-issues-list-demands-tensions-europe-ukraine-nato\" title=\"\">list has now expanded</a> to include Romania and Bulgaria as well as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. He is also demanding written pledges that Nato will never invite Ukraine, Georgia or Moldova to join and that the allies will pull back troops and defensive missile systems from eastern Europe.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \\n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7cd06e8f-5687-4f6b-bfa6-309b0f1ed90e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nP3KC1h1dN8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>The western democracies have stated plainly that they will not accept such blackmail. Yet, sadly, that is where consensus ends. There is no agreement, <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/article/the-eus-unforgivable-failure/\" title=\"\">and much discord</a>, about what to do if Russia does attack Ukraine, either directly by land, sea and air or indirectly, using asymmetric warfare methods, covert ops, special forces and “technical” countermeasures.</p> \\n<p>European leaders jointly bear responsibility for this lamentable state of affairs, which emboldens Putin. The performance of the US president, Joe Biden, has been less than totally impressive. He made a dangerous gaffe last week when he implied a “minor incursion” by Russia might be tolerated. But overall he has been admirably firm in resisting Russian pressure and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/biden-lays-bare-nato-divisions-over-russia-aggression-in-ukraine\" title=\"\">seeking de-escalation</a>.</p> \\n<p>Not so the European democracies, which have no joined-up policy at all. The German coalition is split between the Greens, who, for example, want to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-crisis-germany-faces-tough-decisions-over-gas-pipeline-2022-01-20/\" title=\"\">scrap the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline</a> from Russia, and pro-Moscow Social Democrats. In France, a huge gap is opening up between President Emmanuel Macron’s bold ideas about EU “<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/macron-eu-speech-french-election-campaign-fight/\" title=\"\">strategic autonomy</a>”, propounded again at a chaotic European parliament session in Strasbourg last week, and the reality of EU feuding, impotence and irrelevance.</p> \\n<p>Given he is deeply distrusted and disliked in many EU countries, it is unclear how Boris Johnson’s vow to knock European heads together and take charge of a united front to deter Putin, outlined in extraordinary Downing Street weekend briefings, can work. This sudden lurch into Churchillian war-fighting mode looks suspiciously like another attempt to distract attention from “partygate”. By exploiting international tensions in this way, Johnson and his Thatcher-imitating foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who has been missing in action so far, may only make matters worse.</p> \\n<p>The Ukraine standoff, having reached this extreme pitch, will not be resolved quickly. Even though few people actually want it, a conflict could be triggered accidentally. Hopefully, US diplomatic efforts will succeed – because a bypassed Europe, ignored by Russia and patronised by America, appears unable to help itself. Whether or not Putin ultimately gets his way or his war, Europe has already lost.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/opinion', 'pillarName': 'Opinion'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/23/russian-ships-tanks-and-troops-on-the-move-to-ukraine-as-peace-talks-stall', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-23T08:37:28Z', 'webTitle': 'Russian ships, tanks and troops on the move to Ukraine as peace talks stall', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/russian-ships-tanks-and-troops-on-the-move-to-ukraine-as-peace-talks-stall', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/23/russian-ships-tanks-and-troops-on-the-move-to-ukraine-as-peace-talks-stall', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Russia has sent troops more than 4,000 miles to Ukraine’s borders and announced sweeping naval drills as Moscow expands its preparations for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/russia-could-act-against-ukraine-at-any-moment-says-us\" title=\"\">potential attack on Ukraine</a> as negotiations appear at a deadlock.</p> <p>Six Russian landing ships capable of carrying main battle tanks, troops and other military vehicles travelled through the Channel en route to the Mediterranean last week in a deployment that could bolster an amphibious landing on Ukraine’s southern coast if Vladimir Putin orders an attack. Ukraine’s military intelligence has claimed that Russia is hiring mercenaries and supplying its proxy forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions with fuel, tanks and self-propelled artillery in preparation for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/we-are-ready-for-whatever-comes-on-the-ukraine-frontline\" title=\"\">potential upsurge in fighting</a>.</p> <p>And a large military force, including Iskander short-range ballistic missiles, elite spetsnaz troops and anti-aircraft batteries, has arrived in Belarus from Russia’s eastern military district, an extraordinary deployment that western officials and analysts say could enable Moscow to threaten Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital.</p> <p>The new deployments have worried US officials. “What concerns us is the total picture,” said a senior state department official in a briefing last week. “It is the amassing of 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders combined with moving forces into Belarus over the weekend … these numbers are beyond, of course, what we would expect with regard to a normal exercise.”</p> <p>The new forces in Belarus, the official added, represent an “increased capability for Russia to launch this attack, increased opportunity, increased avenues, increased routes”.</p> <p>The US president, Joe Biden, last week said that Putin himself may not know what he plans to do. But the results are either reckless brinkmanship or preparations for a large-scale military operation.</p> <p>“It gradually dawned on Putin that if he stays on the track of stable and predictable, as Biden indicated, he’s the designated loser,” said Pavel Baev, research professor at the Peace Research Institute Oslo and a Brookings Institution nonresident fellow. “Something needed to be done. He went for this escalation quite sharply.”</p> <p>Diplomatic efforts last week were inconclusive. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, called talks with US secretary of state Antony Blinken <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/jan/21/ukraine-blinken-says-talks-with-russias-lavrov-were-frank-and-substantive-video\" title=\"\">“frank and substantive”</a>.</p> <p>“I can’t say whether we are on the right track or not on the right track.

Some analysts have suggested Russia may want to formally annex the Donbas region or capture territory to connect the Russian mainland with Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/putin-confirms-annexation-crimea-ukrainian-soldier-casualty\" title=\"\">annexed by Russia in 2014</a>.</p> <p>But others see Moscow’s larger aim as compelling the Ukrainian government to submit to Russia’s terms, effectively re-establishing a sphere of influence in eastern Europe. And that ambitious goal could mean that a Russian attack would have to put extraordinary pressure on the Ukrainian government.“If the purpose is to compel Ukraine’s leadership, then a ground invasion only makes sense if it puts Ukraine in a more untenable or threatened position. Neither a land bridge nor an operation in Odessa would likely achieve that result, but an offensive towards Kyiv could,” wrote Rob Lee, a former US marine and a fellow in the Foreign Policy Research Institute’s Eurasia programme, in an <a href=\"https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/01/moscows-compellence-strategy/\" title=\"\">analysis</a>.</p> <p>Ultimately, Russia wants to block Ukraine’s entrance into Nato, stymie cooperation with western powers and reverse Kyiv’s trajectory away from Moscow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab12319aa27b31496c49d19a59fbd4a5c0991b7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab12319aa27b31496c49d19a59fbd4a5c0991b7c/0_92_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Putin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Putin is seeking to reverse Kyiv’s trajectory away from Moscow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sputnik/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To that end, it has sought to put Ukraine in a position that would stretch its defences and threaten a potential hammer blow against Kyiv. Russia has deployed more than 60 battalion tactical groups – more than a third of the military’s total available force – and appears unwilling to halt its buildup on Ukraine’s borders.</p> <p>Russian troops, along with Iskander short-range ballistic missiles, began arriving in Belarus last week after travelling across the country from Russia’s far east.</p> <p>The troops are arriving for joint military exercises set for mid-February and will include Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets and nearly the entire Belarusian armed forces, according to the country’s leader, Alexander Lukashenko.“Don’t get into [a fight] with us,” said Lukashenko in punchy remarks on Friday. “We can’t be defeated.”</p> <p>At the same time, Russia has announced sweeping naval drills that will include every fleet in the country’s navy, numbering more than 140 warships. Along with the six landing craft likely headed for the Mediterranean, a Russian cruiser and destroyer will also be dispatched following the exercises.</p> <p>Nato has also announced its own naval drills, including a US aircraft carrier strike group in the Mediterranean for the next two weeks, meaning that the two rivals will be conducting exercises at the same time amid heightened tensions.</p> <p>Russia appears to be finalising its preparations for a strike on Ukraine. But even if the attack never comes, analysts say that there may never be a return to the status quo before the Russian buildup began last year.“I think it’s clear that even if a war is avoided, I don’t think we’re going to go back to the situation prior to April 2021,” said Angela Stent, director emerita of the Center for Russian, East European and Eurasian studies at Georgetown University and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.</p> <p>During a roundtable discussion, she said that the crisis could lead to the “third reorganisation of Euro-Atlantic security since the 1940s”.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/23/german-navy-chief-quits-after-saying-putin-deserves-respect-over-ukraine', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-23T11:17:12Z', 'webTitle': 'German navy chief quits after saying Putin deserves respect over Ukraine', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/german-navy-chief-quits-after-saying-putin-deserves-respect-over-ukraine', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/23/german-navy-chief-quits-after-saying-putin-deserves-respect-over-ukraine', 'fields': {'body': '<p>The chief of Germany’s navy has resigned after arguing at a livestreamed event that Putin “deserves respect” and Kyiv will never win back annexed Crimea – comments that Ukraine’s ambassador in Berlin said “massively” called into question Germany’s trustworthiness.</p> \\n<p>Vice-admiral Kay-Achim Schönbach, who has led Germany’s naval force and represented it externally since March 2020, made his comments at a talk organised by a thinktank in Delhi on Friday.</p> \\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODmkoGQw1TU\">Taking questions after a short presentation</a>, Schönbach seemed to downplay the possibility of a military conflict with Russia and Ukraine. “Is Russia really interested in having a tiny strip of Ukrainian soil, to integrate into their country?” the 56-year-old said. “No. Putin is putting on pressure because he knows he can do it, he splits the European Union.”</p> \\n<p>What Putin really wanted, Schönbach argued, was respect. “On eye level, he wants respect.

That failed to entirely calm nerves in Kyiv and other European capitals, especially as Biden also raised eyebrows by predicting that Vladimir Putin would “move in” to Ukraine because “he has to do something” and would probably prevail.</p> <p>The analysis of Nato’s weaknesses and Putin’s intentions was no doubt widely shared but Biden had said the quiet part loud, contradicting what his own officials had been saying. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, had just been telling <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/01/18/national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan-interview-qa-biden-doctrine-foreign-policy/\">Foreign Policy</a> that one of the great successes of the Biden administration was “the 30 allies of Nato [were] speaking with one voice in the Russia-Ukraine crisis”.</p> <p>Aides who have shadowed Biden through his long career as senator and vice-president are used to his prolix ways, and his tendency to draw on his deep foreign policy experience to over-explain, but the stakes are immeasurably greater as a president, trying to stare down Putin as Europe stands on the threshold of war.</p> <p>The stumble distracted from some of the foreign policy achievements of Biden’s first year – the mending of transatlantic ties, the bolstering of US support for the embattled government in Kyiv, and the development of a consistent policy towards Moscow – which combined a openness to talks with a readiness to inflict punitive measures and a refusal to be divided from Nato allies.</p> <p>None of those gains were a given in US foreign policy after four years of Donald Trump, a president who frequently put domestic political and business advantage ahead of strategic national interests, particularly when it came to Russia. Mending alliances, returning to multilateralism and restoring predictability to US policy after the volatile Trump era is widely regarded as Biden’s greatest success so far in foreign policy.</p> <p>His claim on taking office that “America is back” was backed up by a quick deal to extend the <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2021-03/news/us-russia-extend-new-start-five-years\">New Start</a> treaty in Russia and thereby salvage the only major arms control agreement to survive Trump. The US rejoined the Paris climate accord and the United Nations Human Rights Council, re-engaged with major powers in nuclear talks with Iran, and convened a virtual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/09/joe-biden-summit-for-democracy\">Summit for Democracy</a> in December.</p> <p>All those steps were in line with a broad strategy which Nathalie Tocci, director of the Rome-based Institute of International Affairs, describes as a Biden doctrine.</p> <p>“I think it’s a strategic reorientation towards competition/conflict with China and, the other side of that coin, strengthening relationships with partners in Europe and in Asia, both bilaterally and multilaterally,” Tocci said. “And relying less on the military instrument in order to pursue US foreign policy goals.”</p> <p>The Ukraine stumble was not the first time that strategy has been impaired by its execution. The withdrawal from Afghanistan was intended to be a decisive break with the past, extricating the US from its longest war so it could focus on its most important geopolitical challenge, the rapid rise of China.</p> <p>The departure turned to chaos when the Afghan army, which the US had spent $83m and 20 years trying to build, collapsed in a few days in the face of a Taliban offensive. The scenes of desperate Afghans trying to cling to departing US planes, some dying in the attempt, are an inescapable part of Biden’s legacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ceb42f3ad5e9a77a0efe016df2261760100ea2d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ceb42f3ad5e9a77a0efe016df2261760100ea2d4/0_55_3773_2266/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taliban fighters atop a Humvee take part in a rally in Kabul in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taliban fighters atop a Humvee take part in a rally in Kabul in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Biden has argued he was boxed in by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/us-taliban-sign-peace-agreement-afghanistan-war\">Doha agreement</a> the Trump administration signed with the Taliban in February 2020, under which the US was due to leave by May 2021.

The status quo, they say, was not sustainable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/23/vladimir-putin-rogue-male-ukraine-war-russia\">Putin, a ‘rogue male’ on the rampage, threatens to start a war no one wants  | Simon Tisdall </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even considering the constraints imposed by the previous administration, the withdrawal was a fiasco. US planners failed to anticipate the speed of the collapse even though a government watchdog, the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pullout-us-government-watchdog-warned-afghan-air-force-collapse-rcna12529\">Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction</a>, had warned in 2021 that without US contractors to service planes and helicopters, the Afghan air force would no longer be able to function, depriving troops on the ground of a key advantage.</p> <p>For Afghans who worked with the US and its allies, and for the country’s women and girls, the departure seemed like a betrayal, raising a serious question mark over the administration’s claims to have restored human rights to the heart of US foreign policy.</p> <p>Its record in that regard was already mixed.</p> <p>On one hand, the administration had taken a firm stand against China’s mass persecution of Muslim Uyghurs, declaring it a genocide. Furthermore, the assembly of a coalition of some 130 countries to establish a global minimum tax was, according to Matt Duss, foreign affairs adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders, “a step toward addressing global economic inequality which is one of the drivers of conflict and authoritarianism”.</p> <p>“It’s an important first step and a courageous one,” Duss said. He also pointed to the sanctions against surveillance companies like the Israeli NSO group, whose software was used by authoritarian regimes to target dissidents.</p> <p>“\\u200b\\u200bThat was a very consequential move, and there has been a massive pressure campaign trying to get them to roll it back, but they’ve stood firm,” he said.</p> <p>However, the steps taken against the Saudi monarchy for the heavy civilian toll from its air war in Yemen and the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi felt well short of what human rights campaigners and progressive Democrats had hoped for. The Biden administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/27/joe-biden-saudi-arabia-arms-weapons-deal\">continued to sell Riyadh</a> substantial quantities of advanced weaponry.</p> <p>“We’ve basically returned to the traditional US approach of supporting human rights in countries that don’t buy our weapons,” Duss said. “I very much hope that changes.”</p> <h2>‘A lot of bad blood’</h2> <p>Another way in which the manner of the US exit from Afghanistan undermined the administration’s wider objectives was by alienating European allies, who felt left out of a decision they were obliged to follow.</p> <p>“The pull-out really caused a lot of bad blood unnecessarily,” Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said. “You can call it the root cause of unhappiness within the alliance.”</p> <p>The formation in September of Aukus, a partnership with the UK and Australia to help the latter acquire nuclear-powered submarines, was another sweeping move in the pivot towards Asia.</p> <p>But the protagonists had omitted to inform France, who discovered on the same day that their contract to sell Australia diesel submarines had been cancelled. Biden was forced to acknowledge the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/29/biden-admits-macron-us-was-clumsy-submarine-deal\">clumsy</a>” way it had been handled, and the rift clouded bilateral relations for months.</p> <p>Putin’s threat to Ukraine has helped rally the transatlantic alliance but as Biden revealed in his own public reflections, there are still serious divisions below the surface, limiting his room for manoeuvre.</p> <p>The president’s freedom of action on other global issues, like making progress in climate action or finding a nuclear compromise with Iran, will be hindered still further if Republicans gain control of Congress in this year’s midterm elections. In that case, the administration’s record until now, mixed as it is, may prove to be the high point of the Biden doctrine.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'politics/2022/jan/23/no-10-casts-boris-johnson-as-head-of-anti-russian-alliance-over-ukraine', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-23T18:22:52Z', 'webTitle': 'No 10 casts Johnson as head of anti-Russian alliance over Ukraine', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/23/no-10-casts-boris-johnson-as-head-of-anti-russian-alliance-over-ukraine', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jan/23/no-10-casts-boris-johnson-as-head-of-anti-russian-alliance-over-ukraine', 'fields': {'body': '<p>The unusual Foreign Office revelation on Saturday night that British intelligence had unmasked a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/confusion-over-uk-claim-that-putin-plans-coup-in-ukraine\">plot to install a Russian puppet government</a> in Ukraine was issued alongside a lengthy release from Downing Street in effect claiming Boris Johnson was now at the helm of an anti-Russian alliance.</p> <p>The release said a deeply engaged Johnson was being briefed daily on the crisis, had ramped up the Whitehall response and was willing to engage directly with Vladimir Putin.

For alongside its call for maximum Nato unity and its insistence that the UK was operating in lockstep with the US, Johnson delivered some pointed barbs against the French and the Germans.</p> <p>The No 10 statement was in diplomatic terms most remarkable for making no attempt to disguise his frustration with his European Nato allies. In a clear reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/macron-says-eu-must-start-own-dialogue-with-russia-over-ukraine\">remarks made by the French president</a>, Emmanuel Macron, the statement said: “The prime minister has been clear to counterparts in recent days that now is not the time in the face of spiralling aggression on the border to start a conversation about Europe’s strategic autonomy or radical changes to the European security architecture.”</p> <p>Macron has recently once again raised the idea of a stronger European defence pillar. No 10 said it would be “frankly naive to assume that Russia could be mollified by changes to the European security architecture – the Kremlin’s behaviour has made that consistently clear”.</p> <p>Sources close to Johnson were described as saying he feared that “some world leaders may not appreciate the deteriorating picture on the Ukrainian border, or fully comprehend the risks posed by a bullying Russia.”</p> <p>No 10 did not name these naive countries but it did take aim at the German coalition government, pointing out that Johnson in a Mansion House speech in November had broken with the previous approach of polite but muted opposition to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/16/germany-pipeline-threat-deter-russia-ukraine-olaf-scholz-nord-stream-2\">Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany</a>, saying it was “a major strategic problem for European security”.</p> <p>Johnson will also have raised eyebrows in European capitals with his announcement that he was setting up calls with G7 leaders to form a sanctions coalition that would hit “Putin-supporting oligarchs”.</p> <p>His announcement came on the day Transparency International released figures showing that the amount of Russian money in London property is higher than previously thought – £1.5bn, as opposed to the previous estimate of £1bn. Efforts are still under way, led by the Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, to set up a public property register in London, but so far the government has dragged its feet on it.</p> <p>Transparency International UK said it had “identified almost 150 land titles ultimately owned by Russian individuals alleged to be involved in corruption or with links to Putin’s regime”. It said: “Of the £1.5bn identified, more than £1bn of this is held by companies based in secrecy havens, the majority of these companies are based in UK crown dependencies and overseas territories like the British Virgin Islands and the Isle of Man. The ownership of these firms has only been revealed due to court cases, document leaks and investigations by journalists.”</p> <p>Few can predict the course of the Ukraine crisis, and no one doubts the huge military and ideological support provided by the UK, but at minimum Johnson has a lot of catching up to do before he is taken seriously as the central player in this conflict in the way that Downing Street projects.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/23/ukraine-taking-uk-claim-of-russian-invasion-plot-seriously-says-adviser', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-23T18:42:37Z', 'webTitle': 'Ukraine taking UK claim of Russian invasion plot seriously, says adviser', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/ukraine-taking-uk-claim-of-russian-invasion-plot-seriously-says-adviser', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/23/ukraine-taking-uk-claim-of-russian-invasion-plot-seriously-says-adviser', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Ukraine is reacting “seriously” to UK Foreign Office allegations that Moscow has plans to invade the country and install a puppet government, a senior government adviser has said, adding that Kyiv is resisting Russian efforts to destabilise its government and economy.</p> <p>The extraordinary Foreign Office claims that Moscow may topple the government and install Yevhen Murayev, a former MP who controls a pro-Russia television station, were met with shock and some scepticism in Ukrainian political and media circles on Sunday.</p> <p>The Foreign Office made the allegations as the UK pledged to take a more aggressive posture over Russia’s buildup of more than 100,000 troops and weaponry on the border with Ukraine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/23/no-10-casts-boris-johnson-as-head-of-anti-russian-alliance-over-ukraine\">No 10 casts Johnson as head of anti-Russian alliance over Ukraine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Murayev himself denied that he was involved in any plot, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/confusion-over-uk-claim-that-putin-plans-coup-in-ukraine\">telling the Observer</a> he had been banned from entering Russia and was in a conflict with a close ally of Vladimir Putin. “It isn’t very logical,” he said.</p> <p>On Sunday he said he was prepared to defend his “honest name” against the British allegations and he posted a picture on Facebook of himself altered to look like James Bond.</p> <p>But an adviser to the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff said the alleged plot matched Russian efforts to promote discord in Ukraine.</p> <p>Mykhailo Podolyak told Reuters that although there was doubt among Ukrainians as to whether Murayev was “too ridiculous a figure” to be the Kremlin’s pick to lead Ukraine, Russia had propped up previously minor figures in leadership positions in annexed Crimea and separatist-held Donbass, and that therefore “one should take this information as seriously as possible”.</p> <p>In separate comments to Agence-France Presse, Podolyak said: “Our state will continue its policy of dismantling any oligarchic or political structures that could be working to destabilise Ukraine” or aid Russia.</p> <p>The Kremlin had for some time followed a formula of selecting individuals in business or politics and then using those people to “promote Russia’s interests”, Podolyak said, and “this British information clearly follows along in this logical chain”.</p> <p>The Foreign Office has not provided any evidence to support the allegations, which came as Boris Johnson’s domestic political troubles deepened.</p> <p>British sources emphasised on Sunday afternoon that the coup plot warning on Saturday followed a UK intelligence assessment, a different formulation from earlier briefings that had suggested it was based on “US-led intelligence”.</p> <p>The UK allegation came days after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/us-russia-ukraine-government-sanctions\">the US alleged</a> that Russian intelligence was recruiting current and former Ukrainian government officials to take over the government in Kyiv and cooperate with a Russian occupying force</p> <p>The accusations have increased tensions as discussions rage about how best to deter Vladimir Putin from launching a new invasion of Ukraine.

Other states have called for pre-emptive sanctions against Russia in order to show the Kremlin that western countries are resolved to strike back in case of an invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>But the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, rejected that idea during a television appearance on Sunday, saying it would not work to deter a potential Russian attack.</p> <p>“When it comes to sanctions, the purpose of those sanctions is to deter Russian aggression.

There, too, I’m confident based on the many consultations I’ve had with European allies and partners that there will be a swift, calibrated and also united response.”</p> <p>Blinken would not say if that response included committing US forces, but told CNN’s State of the Union the alliance was looking at “very practical and important measures”, including military options.</p> <p>“One thing we’ve been clear about, besides the massive economic, financial consequences that would befall Russia if it makes further aggression against Ukraine, is the ongoing, continued build-up of defense capacity in Ukraine and, equally, continuing to build up Nato’s defensive capabilities, including on the so-called eastern flank, the countries near Russia.</p> <p>“A single additional Russian force” going into Ukraine would trigger a response, Blinken said. “We’re looking at every single scenario, preparing for every single one.”</p> <p>His comments came as the state department ordered the families of all American personnel at the US embassy in Ukraine to leave the country amid heightened fears of a Russian invasion.</p> <p>On Sunday the department told the dependents of staffers at the US embassy in Kyiv that they must leave the country.

The country is split. When Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine rebelled, it was aided by Russia. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/28/russia-crimea-white-house\">Moscow seized Crimea</a>. The longstanding ties with Russia were one reason why Nato left Ukraine out of its reckless post-Soviet rush to advance its security boundary as near as it could to the Russian border during the 1990s.</p> <p>All evidence suggests that Vladimir Putin wants a regime in Kyiv favourable to Russian interests, much as Soviet leaders wanted in Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968. The west wisely did not argue or intervene on either of those occasions. Russia’s motives today seem much the same. Putin is determined to oppose the emergence of possible liberal, western-oriented societies in Belarus and Ukraine. He watched the other states in eastern Europe crumble and defect from the Warsaw Pact in 1990. He does not want to be the Russian leader who lost these two great territories to his immediate west.</p> <p>The concept of spheres of interest, regions where the interests of one nation are more important than the interests of another, has always been controversial in diplomacy. There is no UN doctrine of such spheres, but they are potent and all too real. They are relics of ancient empires and modern paranoias. The US regarded Moscow’s placing of missiles in Cuba in 1962, and support for Central American states as an intolerable threat. Likewise, Moscow is not prepared to tolerate US missiles in Ukraine or US troops rolling in to support an anti-Russian regime in Kyiv.</p> <p>Strategists of spheres of influence are left with the facts of geography and of crude balances of power. China has clearly been extending its reach into south-east Asia and the South China Sea. The US can object, but it is hard to see what gains are achieved by the current buildup of military machismo in the western Pacific, including Britain’s ludicrous decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/01/observer-view-royal-navy-south-china-sea\">deploy an aircraft carrier</a> in the South China Sea.</p> <p>The reality is that the west took a calculated gamble in expanding Nato in the 1990s. There was no suggestion of imitating Finland’s careful and pragmatic neutrality towards its Baltic neighbours that lie in Russia’s sphere of influence. Nato had post-Soviet Russia on the floor and simply could not resist the opportunity of kicking the country when it was already down.</p> <p>The way Nato treated Russia almost guaranteed there would be a chauvinist reflex. Moscow’s initial feelers from Boris Yeltsin that it might associate with Nato were rebuffed. Mooted associations with the EU were ridiculed. Everything was done to rub Russia’s nose in its shame. Putin and his present antics were the predictable result.</p> <p>The Russian president has now indicated that he wants the 2015 Minsk II settlement implemented. That settlement is sound. It requires autonomy for Russian-speaking Donbas, an end to Nato expansionism, Russian withdrawal and a reinstatement of Ukraine’s border. Samantha Power, US ambassador to the United Nations at the time of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, remarked that Minsk was the “<a href=\"https://ua.usembassy.gov/remarks-ambassador-samantha-power-u-s-permanent-representative-united-nations-un-security-council-meeting-ukraine/\">only viable way out of this deadly conflict</a>”. Subsequent US administrations have supported that position. Yet no one has applied sufficient diplomatic effort to put it in place. </p> <p>Any reasonable observer would see Minsk as a practical and fair way out of this crisis. It has largely been blocked by a Kyiv regime that has long feared Donbas’s pro-Russian sentiment and resisted its “home rule”. Recognise the autonomy of the Donbas region, Putin says, and he will withdraw. He cannot want to keep 100,000 troops mobilised on the Donbas border indefinitely, any more than he can seriously fear a western army storming east across Ukraine.</p> <p>At that point, the realpolitik of power comes on stage. It is inconceivable that Nato, in the shape of the US and Britain, would confront Russian battle lines in Donbas. Germany and France would have no part in it. Nor do the US and Britain have the necessary troops. They have the threat of missile barrages, but without logistical support these merely sow destruction.</p> <p>Moreover, Britain has no obligation to defend Ukraine. Nor does it have an obligation to deter or confront what appears to be an imminent Russian attack. The country has no alliance with Ukraine. Ukraine is not a member of Nato. And Britain has no significant means of influencing the outcome of a battle on the ground. For these reasons, it should stay well out of the situation.</p> <p>Putin’s current show of strength is that of a thin-skinned dictator flexing before his people and the world such muscle as he can still muster. If he goes ahead and invades Donbas, the world will descend on his head with massive damnation, as well as savage but pointless economic sanctions. We saw that over Crimea.</p> <p>The root of peace in these crises lies in strength, strength to keep everything in proportion and to see a way through. The risk is always that curse of history: when hostilities turn to crisis, war can seem the simplest, most glorious way forward.</p> <ul> <li><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/opinion', 'pillarName': 'Opinion'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/24/uk-pulls-some-embassy-staff-from-ukraine-amid-russian-threat', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-24T09:44:27Z', 'webTitle': 'UK pulls some embassy staff from Ukraine amid Russian threat', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/uk-pulls-some-embassy-staff-from-ukraine-amid-russian-threat', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/24/uk-pulls-some-embassy-staff-from-ukraine-amid-russian-threat', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Some British staff and dependants are being withdrawn from the embassy in Ukraine in response to a growing military threat from Russia, the Foreign Office has said.</p> <p>Officials said there were no specific threats to British diplomats, with about half of the staff in Kyiv reportedly scheduled to come home to the UK.</p> <p>The move follows US officials ordering relatives of embassy staff to leave Ukraine as a Russian invasion could come “at any time”.

It said: “There are reports Russia is planning significant military action in Ukraine.</p> <p>“The security conditions, particularly along Ukraine’s borders, in Russian-occupied Crimea and in Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine, are unpredictable and can deteriorate with little notice. Demonstrations, which have turned violent at times, regularly occur throughout Ukraine, including in Kyiv.”</p> <p>An attack would “severely impact” the embassy’s ability to help Americans leave, it said.</p> <p>Ukraine’s government, by contrast, has urged citizens not to panic. On Monday the foreign ministry expressed irritation with the UK and US decision to draw down their embassies in Kyiv. The move was “premature and overly cautious”, the spokesperson Oleh Nikolenko told <a href=\"https://interfax.com.ua/news/general/793445.html\">Interfax Ukraine</a>.</p> <p>Nikolenko said there had been no radical changes in the security situation.

He said the invasion had started back in 2014, when Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea and kickstarted a violent separatist uprising in the Donbas region in the east.</p> <p>“Did the threat of war appear only now? These risks have existed for more than a year. They haven’t become bigger,” Zelenskiy said. He suggested that the Kremlin was deliberating creating a “stir” in order to undermine the nation’s morale. “They are actively attacking our land and your nerves,” <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2754636698014166&amp;t=3\">he said in a video</a>.</p> <p>Despite these official reassurances, the mood in Kyiv has darkened in recent days. One well-connected former official said his military contacts were insouciant two weeks ago about the prospect of Russian invasion, dismissing it as little more than a fictitious TV scenario.</p> <p>Recently, however, the same government people had been quietly filling up their cars with petrol and stocking up on food supplies, he said.

An about-face would be embarrassing and make the west less likely to listen to his warnings in the future. But he would face little domestic blowback from ordering a drawdown and could claim he had taken the first step to avoid a devastating conflict.</p> \\n<p>Yet that has become less likely as Moscow begins to face serious economic and political consequences from its great gambit.

Except, it hasn’t happened – and it’s not likely to happen, at least in the form that’s most commonly imagined. Russia has used the bright, shiny object of an obvious troop concentration to panic the west into considering seriously its demands for rolling back Nato. But by focusing on the wrong problem, and joining in negotiations on Russia’s terms, the US and Nato have fallen for a massive strategic deception operation.</p> <p>By all accounts Russia’s preparations for conflict are genuine. But then, they have to be. When it conducted a dry run for the current deployments last year, Russia saw how foreign analysts swiftly discounted the likelihood of a major assault because they saw forces had not arrived with essential materiel, such as medical supplies or ammunition, or the support elements necessary to mount and sustain combat operations. This time Russia has made sure they are there, and visible. And Russia is continuing to move troops westwards in order to keep up the pressure on western decision-makers.</p> <p>That’s led to a view that the deployment cannot be just for show, since it is “too big not to be used”. But that misses the point that it already has been used – it is precisely this concentration of Russian troops that has brought the US to the table to talk about what Russia wants. And away from the immediate and explicit demands tied to the troop buildup, Russia has achieved other, secondary, objectives. Issues previously at the front of western minds, such as Russia’s occupation of Crimea and continuing ceasefire violations in eastern Ukraine, have been swept aside by more urgent concerns over imminent escalation.</p> <p>This isn’t even the first time Russia has done this. After the seizure of Crimea in 2014, Russia caused surprise with the speed and effectiveness with which it moved large numbers of its land forces to the border with Ukraine. But the main role of those forces throughout most of 2015 was to sit on the border, augmenting and depleting as required, in order to focus the attention of the west and provide the menace to reinforce Russia’s demands for a <a href=\"https://www.geostrategy.org.uk/britains-world/the-minsk-accords-should-britain-declare-them-dead/\">flawed and unworkable</a> “ceasefire”. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/us-uk-and-europe-totally-united-in-the-face-of-russia-threat-to-ukraine-biden-says\">UK warns of ‘unprecedented sanctions’ against Russia as Biden says west is united on Ukraine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s true there are a number of <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/putins-risky-options-in-ukraine\">well-argued and highly plausible</a> scenarios for land operations against Ukraine. But each of them presents Russia with significant challenges. A limited-scale operation brings <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1485364935702061062\">no benefits Russia doesn’t already have</a>, while a full-on onslaught designed to take and hold Ukrainian territory is considered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/what-would-be-russia-military-options-in-ukraine-invasion\">beyond the reach</a> of the force currently assembled. </p> <p>In the most recent statements from the US, firm responses to Russia are promised in the form of severe economic sanctions and military reinforcement of Europe – but if, and only if, Russia mounts a land invasion of Ukraine. That’s another powerful incentive for Russia to do something different instead.</p> <p>In fact, the the approach the US has taken seems to completely disregard the wide range of options for hostile action by Russia that don’t actually involve invading anywhere. The option of cross-border strikes using air, missile or cyber power remains on the table. But even then, the UK’s public naming of individuals said to be earmarked by Russia as a puppet government for installation in Kyiv <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/22/europe/bulgaria-romania-russia-intl/index.html\">shows</a> that conventional military forces are only part of the story. Subversion, sabotage and deniable operations to disrupt and destabilise the target country are other tempting means for Russia to make its displeasure felt.</p> <p>And Ukraine may not even be the target. If Russia believes any of its own propaganda, President Putin thinks that what he is confronting in Ukraine is not Ukrainians <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/russia-has-sold-the-west-the-dummy-over-ukraine\">but the west</a>. And Russia’s demands are aimed at Nato and the US, not Ukraine itself. What that means is that any Russian action intended to step up the pressure may be directed elsewhere, and non-Nato European states farther afield may be at risk of deniable damage or disruption.</p> <p>Finland is a <a href=\"https://jamestown.org/event/eastern-approaches-total-defense-a-view-from-finland/\">hard target</a>. Sweden has <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2022/01/15/sweden-redeploys-troops-to-the-island-of-gotland-near-russia\">demonstrated</a> its readiness. And Ireland, recently the target of <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/ireland-raises-concerns-with-russia-over-planned-naval-exercises-1.4783844\">unwelcome Russian attention</a>, is anticipating Russian naval exercises in its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) at the beginning of February – Irish parliamentarians have pointed to the sensitive location for the live-fire drills, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ministers-raise-concerns-about-russian-navy-drills-off-irish-coast-5fllkd07w\">saying</a> Russia deliberately chose it for proximity to shipping lanes, flight paths and subsea cables. When considering the full range of Russia’s options, it’s essential to think not only outside the box but also outside Ukraine.</p> <p>None of this means that defensive assistance to Ukraine is wasted. Supplies of essential arms and equipment are reducing the likelihood of a ground incursion still further. And regardless of its intent, for as long as Russia has the capability poised to move on Ukraine, precautionary measures such as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60106416\">evacuating</a> embassy staff from Kyiv are prudent. </p> <p>And there’s always scope for all-out war after a catastrophic error of judgment by Russia. Despite caricatures of Vladimir Putin as a wily strategist anticipating his opponents’ every move by simultaneously playing judo and chess, the ruling elite in Moscow is no more immune to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/world/europe/putin-ukraine-kazakhstan.html\">miscalculations and self-inflicted injuries</a> than others around the world.</p> <p>But for now, officials in Kyiv <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/features-60112868\">point out</a> that responding to Russian threats with “panic” only serves Moscow’s interests. Early concerns that Russia would mount a hostile demonstration in order to force the pace of negotiations have not been borne out.

And probably Belarusian soldiers would have to participate in it and die for this meaningless war.”</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://belsat.eu/en/news/22-01-2022-source-200-trains-with-russian-military-personnel-and-equipment-to-arrive-in-belarus/\">unverified local report</a> had said that the buildup may include nearly 200 trains with Russian troops and equipment (military exercises in 2021 involved just 29 trains), although the Cyberpartisans said they had not sought or found confirmation of that number in the hacked databases yet.</p> <p>To relinquish control over the Belarusian railways’ computer system, the group has also demanded the release of more than 50 political prisoners from Belarusian jails requiring medical assistance. The domestic human rights group Viasna has counted more than 995 political prisoners in Belarus following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/13/new-wave-of-arrests-in-belarus-as-more-than-20-detained-in-two-days\">Lukashenko’s bloody crackdown on protests</a> after elections marred by fraud in 2020.</p> <p>The latest hack highlights the prominent role that cyber-operations against infrastructure could play in an upcoming conflict in the region, and shows how Lukashenko’s domestic battles may follow him into his tightening alliance with the Kremlin. One key factor in the anti-Lukashenko protests that began in 2020 was opposition to plans for greater economic and political integration of Russia and Belarus under a “Union State”.</p> <p>Among Lukashenko’s staunchest opponents are the Cyberpartisans, a group of about 25 anonymous IT experts and other activists who have pulled off an impressive and embarrassing series of hacks against the government since they first appeared after the protests of 2020.</p> <p>That has included a daring raid on the servers of the Belarus Ministry of Interior Affairs, giving them access to data on thousands of serving police officers in a country where many had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/20/hackers-leak-data-on-1000-belarusian-police-officers\">sought to hide their identities</a> while brutally cracking down on civil protests.</p> <p>They have also obtained access to passport databases, secret files belonging to Belarusian KGB spies and security officials, police databases of informants, and prison CCTV networks confirming police brutality and torture. They have released hundreds of thousands of hours of wiretapped telephone conversations, including those of top officials.</p> <p>Recently, the group has expanded into targeting state companies and firms that serve as sources of cash for Lukashenko, using ransomware attacks to demand the release of political prisoners rather than money.</p> <p>“Since it became very dangerous for people to openly protest against the regime, we now became the only force capable of operating in Belarus,” said a member of the group, identified by the Cyrillic letter Ж (Zh). “We show real results of our work both by hacking and attacking government institutions and conducting physical impact operations.”</p> <p>To confirm access to a recent database of hacked records of border crossings, Zh sent a Guardian correspondent a full list of his travel records to Belarus going back to 2016. “We have it for sure,’ wrote Zh. “Just a sec.”</p> <p>That data would also allow the group to identify Belarusian and Russian spies crossing the country’s borders, Zh said, as well as “trips made by Lukashenko and his cronies and close circle, and would help reveal illegal activities and put sanctions on them.</p> <p>“We know now more about his assets, his lovers, and secret criminal schemes” because of the hacks, Zh said. “We think he only now realises how much information we were able to gather and how harmful it is for him.”</p> <p>The series of hacks has clearly shaken the government. The Cyberpartisans and two other pro-democracy groups were named as extremists this summer, and Lukashenko addressed the series of leaks by telling his top officials to write down information by hand instead.</p> <p>“If you cannot … protect information on your computers, then go back to using paper,” Lukashenko told his ministers at a meeting in mid-August. “Write by hand and put it in your desk.”</p> <p>Although members of the group remain anonymous (even to one another), their operations are still dangerous, they say, because they sometimes require insiders on the ground to take risks. To access the Interior Ministry network, “our people entered a regime’s facility and installed bridges that allowed us to connect to the MIA network remotely,” Zh said.</p> <p>Threatening to disrupt Russia’s military buildup near Ukraine is likely to force the government to redouble its efforts to track down the group.</p> <p>We are “concerned for our safety and to be honest, our lives,” wrote Zh. “The Belarusian government tries to infiltrate us but has not succeeded as of yet.”</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/25/ukraines-independence-must-be-supported-by-britain', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-25T18:14:13Z', 'webTitle': 'Ukraine’s independence must be supported by Britain | Letters', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/ukraines-independence-must-be-supported-by-britain', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/25/ukraines-independence-must-be-supported-by-britain', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Simon Jenkins (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/20/britain-russia-ukraine-border-dispute\" title=\"\">Britain should stay well out of Russia’s border dispute with Ukraine, 20 January</a>) claims that Russia’s “border disputes” with Ukraine have “nothing whatsoever to do with Britain” – but it has everything to do with the more than 20,000 diaspora Ukrainians and Britons of Ukrainian descent who live in the UK, of whom I am one.</p> <p>Mr Jenkins appears to be of the opinion that Ukrainian sovereignty is less important than the desire of those who govern Russia not to be humiliated on the international stage. This is incorrect. Ukraine is not and has never been an integral part of Russia: it is an independent nation with a separate language, history and religious and political traditions. It was, for centuries, under the colonial rule of Tsarist Russia (or the Habsburg empire, depending on the region) and then of the Soviet Union, suffered unspeakably at the hands of the Soviet government in the 1930s and was subjected to extreme cultural suppression in the 19th century.</p> <p>It is inexpressibly disappointing and hurtful to see that in 2022 there are Guardian columnists who have apparently bought into 19th-century Russian imperial propaganda.<br><strong>Christopher Jotischky</strong><br><em>Lancaster</em></p> <p>• As an MEP in the 1990s, serving as vice-chair of the joint parliamentary committee with Poland, and attending meetings with representatives of other applicant states to the EU. I discussed with them why they also wished to join Nato, and tried to dissuade them. But they were clear that membership of Nato would protect them from again falling under Russian rule. </p> <p>Ukraine did not at that time apply for EU membership, but sent observers to joint meetings. I felt then that it was not wise to move too far to the east, but rather to build up good relationships with former Soviet states. I chaired a session at a local government conference for applicant states in Warsaw, and observers from Ukraine were keenly interested in developments being worked towards in Poland and other neighbouring states. On another occasion in Strasbourg I addressed a group of Ukrainian farmers about reform of the common agricultural policy; they seemed cheered at what I said about the need for reform. I give these as examples that already in the mid-1990s there were people in Ukraine looking west rather than east to Russia, with a view to developing a more open democratic society. This was not being pushed on them by the EU, which was not behaving triumphantly, but created a funding stream to help former Soviet states, including Russia, to develop democratic institutions.<br><strong>Veronica Hardstaff</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>• Simon Jenkins writes (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/24/autonomy-eastern-ukraine-crisis-nato-russia-minsk\" title=\"\">24 January</a>) of Nato’s post-cold-war expansion eastwards as though it was an invasion and occupation rather than a free choice by independent sovereign nations. That is also the reason why Ukraine seeks to join Nato; it is an independent, sovereign country with a distinct identity that wishes to find its own way in the world. Jenkins’ alternative – a grandiloquent world of “spheres of influence” – would have Ukraine permanently subservient to Russia.</p> <p>This year is the 100th anniversary of Irish independence. For those, like Jenkins, who find it difficult to understand why a country like Ukraine might wish to chart its own course, let him look over the Irish Sea at a close historical parallel. Or look north to Scotland, whose independence disappeared between 1603 and 1707, but whose sense of self, and now desire for self-determination, has not disappeared.

Normally he could rely on Grant Shapps to put up a spirited defence of any government lie, which is why he had been sent out to do the morning media round.</p> <p>But not even the transport secretary had been bothered to put a positive spin on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/25/cake-and-singing-boris-johnson-birthday-not-a-party-say-grant-shapps\">the latest birthday party revelations</a>. He had even made the schoolboy error of calling a party a party, when everyone knew that word was a no-no inside No 10.</p> <p>Nor had the usually reliable Nadine Dorries shown her face on Twitter after being ridiculed for claiming the previous evening that a birthday celebration for the prime minister in the cabinet room, organised by his wife, and attended by the interior designer, Lulu Lytle, clearly constituted a high-level work meeting. </p> <p>In fact, the only two MPs showing any public enthusiasm for him had been the always absurd Jacob Rees-Mogg and Michael Fabricant. Which was a mixed blessing as he haemorrhaged support every time they opened their mouths.</p> <p>Then had come the appearance of the Metropolitan police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, before a committee of the Greater London assembly. There she had announced that, after Sue Gray had forwarded some of the evidence she had gathered, a police investigation into some of the parties at No 10 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/25/met-police-investigating-downing-street-parties-cressida-dick-says\">would be a good idea after all</a>.</p> <p>Dick had offered Boris Johnson some encouragement. For a start she had said she would only be investigating parties for which there was already plenty of evidence. Far be it from the Met to actually go to the effort of digging up any new evidence for itself. That would be a waste of police time. And she had seemed reassuringly slow on the uptake about the failure of the police stationed inside Downing Street to wonder what all the noise was and why so much booze had been smuggled into the building. It also appeared to have only just occurred to her that there might be CCTV footage of some of the parties. No, not parties. Work events.</p> <p>Even so, a police investigation wasn’t ideal. Big Dog sighed and poured himself a drink even though it was only just past midday. On the plus side, it might delay things for a few weeks or even months. That was always good news when your only gameplan for the past few weeks had been to find ever more creative ways of trying to hang on to your job till the end of the day.</p> <p>The downside was Sue Gray must have found clear evidence that he – and others – had broken the lockdown laws and the shit was sure to hit the fan sooner or later.</p> <p>His more immediate worry, though, was to find a Cabinet Office minister stupid enough to answer Labour’s urgent question on the latest party allegations and the police investigation. “Don’t worry, prime minister,” said Steve Barclay, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. “I’ve got just the man. It’s Mike Ellis, the paymaster general. He’s already made himself look abject by doing two previous UQs on your parties …”</p> <p>“Please don’t call them parties,” said Big Dog. “It makes me nervous.”</p> <p>So it was that Oily Mike found himself up against Angela Rayner in the Commons for the third time in a matter of weeks. Labour’s deputy leader went in studs up. What part of the prime minister stuffing his face with a Colin the Caterpillar cake, which his wife had just happened to bring down – along with darling Lulu – from the upstairs flat to the cabinet room, where 30 of his staff had just happened to gather to sing Happy Birthday, did everyone not understand was against the rules that the government had itself imposed on the rest of the country? You hardly needed a police investigation for that, but hell, now that there was one we had better see it through. And in the meantime why didn’t Big Dog just resign?</p> <p>Oily Mike was momentarily taken off guard. What should he call the prime minister? The Accused? The Perp? The Defendant? No, that was it. The Suspect. MPs shouldn’t be so quick to pre-judge the Suspect. It was quite normal for the Suspect to drop in for a quick cup of tea with his wife. </p> <p>And the 30 guests were all waiting to debrief him on an important fraudulent Covid test-and-trace contract. And they were only singing Happy Birthday to wash their hands. And as it was a surprise party there was no way you could expect the Suspect to remember having been there. Otherwise it wouldn’t have been a surprise. As for the cake, the Suspect had a long history of thinking he could both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/22/no-boris-johnson-you-cant-have-your-brexit-cake-and-eat-it-too\">have it and eat it</a>. </p> <p>On previous occasions, very few Tories had come to the chamber to make idiots of themselves. But this time there was a hardcore of about 20 Boris loyalists. Edward Leigh raged that we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/25/us-europe-russia-gas-supplies-energy\">were on the brink of war</a> and the PM was about to be brought down by a piece of cake. Theresa Villiers was adamant that the Suspect should have an exemption because he had helped to organise the vaccination programme.</p> <p>Giles Watling moaned that all criminality committed by the Suspect was a vexatious waste of time, while Graham Stuart thought he could detect terror in the opposition benches. In the government benches maybe. Where do Tory selection panels find such idiots? Stuart Anderson reckoned the charges were destabilising the country and should be dropped, while Mark Jenkinson detected a media plot. To discover the truth. Richard Bacon thought the crimes were so minor they should just be forgotten and that we should have a 10-day celebration for the life and works of St Suspect.</p> <p>Back in Downing Street, the Suspect thought he had things nailed down for now. Maybe the Met would take so long to report back that everyone would forget he was a liar who had broken his own rules. That he could bring the country down to his level by implicating it in his nihilism and deception. That somehow we had got the government we deserved. People so disengaged they’d let anything go. Then came the unwelcome news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/25/boris-johnson-will-cooperate-with-police-but-does-not-believe-he-broke-law\">Sue Gray’s report would be published this week</a>.

We’re in discussions about that,” he added. However, over the weekend Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, had expressed doubts about the idea.</p> \\n<p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said Russia should be hit with “widespread and hard-hitting sanctions” that he said must include cutting its access to the international financial system. He also called on Johnson to prevent Britain being used to launder Russian money: “If we take our obligations to global security seriously we cannot go on allowing ourselves to be the world’s laundromat for illicit finance.”</p> \\n<p>Other participants on the evening video call were the leaders of Italy, Poland, the EU and Nato. Germany relies on Russia for about a third of its gas supplies, while Johnson said the UK imported about 3%.</p> \\n<p>The plan, Johnson said, was to impose “coordinated and severe economic sanctions heavier than anything we have done before against Russia” – and that efforts were going on in “finalising these measures as swiftly as possible in order to maximise their deterrent effect”.</p> \\n<p>Sanctions would target prominent individuals and Russian companies, Johnson added in a later answer to Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat.</p> \\n<p>Britain would also be willing to deploy more troops to eastern Europe if Russia were to invade. “We would look to contribute to any new Nato deployments,” the prime minister said.</p> \\n<p>On Monday, the US said it would put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/nato-reinforces-eastern-borders-as-ukraine-tensions-mount\">8,500 troops on high alert</a> to deploy to Europe if necessary, while France said it was willing to send forces to Romania.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \\n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9ccaf766-bf48-4337-87f3-aa831f42603d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N6jFGcyu6Zo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>In response, Russia said it was watching with great concern.

James Heappey, a defence minister, writing <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17429984/ukraine-needs-our-help-british-freedom-democracy/\">in the Sun</a>, said: “As I write, we are becoming aware of a significant number of individuals that are assessed to be associated with Russian military advance-force operations and currently located in Ukraine.”</p> \\n<p>UK defence sources said the warning was based on intelligence, and was in addition to a warning made by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Saturday of a Kremlin plot to install a pro-Moscow government in Ukraine.</p> \\n<p>Advance-force operations is a US military term and covers any activity, from reconnaissance and surveillance to information warfare, aimed at softening a local population ahead of a potential attack.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'commentisfree/2022/jan/25/the-guardian-view-on-the-threat-to-ukraine-high-and-rising', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'commentisfree', 'sectionName': 'Opinion', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-25T19:16:59Z', 'webTitle': 'The Guardian view on the threat to Ukraine: high and rising | Editorial', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/25/the-guardian-view-on-the-threat-to-ukraine-high-and-rising', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/25/the-guardian-view-on-the-threat-to-ukraine-high-and-rising', 'fields': {'body': '<p>The US president’s need to state on Monday that there is “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/us-uk-and-europe-totally-united-in-the-face-of-russia-threat-to-ukraine-biden-says\" title=\"\">total unanimity</a>” over how to deal with the Ukraine crisis, like the video call with European leaders which preceded it, was itself evidence of ongoing differences among western allies. There is no dispute about the threat: more than 100,000 Russian troops are now massed near Ukraine’s borders. The US has put 8,500 troops on standby to deploy to Europe to reinforce allies there, while Nato has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/nato-reinforces-eastern-borders-as-ukraine-tensions-mount\" title=\"\">reinforced its eastern borders</a> with warships and fighter jets. A senior <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/25/us-europe-russia-gas-supplies-energy\" title=\"\">US official briefed</a> on Tuesday that in the event of an invasion, sanctions will “start at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there”.</p> <p>In addition to the clear deterrent message, talks continue: Dmitry Kozak, the Kremlin’s deputy chief of staff, will meet French, German and Ukrainian officials in Paris on Wednesday, in the “Normandy format”. Set against that, Russia paid little price for the annexation of Crimea and fomenting the separatist uprising in the Donbas region in 2014. There is a credible case that Russia is set on <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2022/01/putins-wager-in-russias-standoff-with-the-west/\" title=\"\">a major military</a> offensive – not merely pursuing coercive diplomacy – and that it is in Moscow’s interests to act before Kyiv receives further arms shipments. Above all, there is at present <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/rising-costs-of-ukraine-gamble-could-force-russias-hand\" title=\"\">no visible off-ramp</a> for Vladimir Putin. The very thing he says Russia must counter – Nato’s presence in eastern Europe – is growing because of his own actions. He might take an exit; it’s harder to see him beating a retreat.</p> <p>So the risks are high and rising. But an attack on Ukraine is not inevitable. French officials have indicated that they regard recent US and UK briefing as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mij_Europe/status/1485622501862428684\" title=\"\">alarmist</a>; Kyiv itself is notably more cautious.

But it also suggests that “hybrid invasion” is already being implemented, citing the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/ukraine-says-evidence-points-to-russia-being-behind-cyber-attack\" title=\"\">cyber-attack</a>. Moscow may believe that such methods, along with cross-border missile strikes, sabotage and political meddling, might be enough to effect a change of government. (The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1485568283818569728\" title=\"\">EU offer</a> of €1.2bn in emergency financial assistance is designed to reduce pressure on Kyiv.)</p> <p>What price would Russia pay? Its markets have already tanked; and it appears to have amassed a cash stockpile in preparation for sanctions.

The Biden administration also insists that US and European financial sanctions plans are converging, and that the US is preparing export controls on western technology which would cripple Putin’s efforts to diversify his economy.</p> <p><strong> </strong>One of the main alternative gas suppliers is Qatar, and it was announced on Tuesday that the emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani would visit the White House at the end of the month with the “stability of global energy supplies” on the agenda.

And so that would lead to an atrophying of Russia’s productive capacity over time.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, the flow of arms to Ukraine has accelerated.

So as far as we don’t have these, we cannot say if it’s going to be a yes or no. We are going to wait for it,” the official said. A joint German-Estonia delivery of field hospitals, planned last summer, is due to go ahead in the next few weeks.</p> <p>Latvia and Lithuania are supplying Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine.

It is a question that politicians and diplomats are increasingly grappling with amid fears that Germany and, to a lesser extent, France are in danger of dividing from the US and the UK, not only over how to respond to any future Russian act of aggression in Ukraine, but also in their assessment of the imminence of the threat.</p> <p>Every effort is being made to minimise the differences within the Nato alliance, including through regular calls such as the one led by Joe Biden on Monday, but they may be impossible to avoid since they reflect not just different short-term assessments on intelligence, but a deep fissure going back decades about what Germany and France, as opposed to the Anglosphere, regard as the best way to handle Russia.</p> <p>France, looking at the same intelligence provided by the CIA, does not see an imminent invasion, or a gathering of forces equipped to invade in the next three weeks – an assessment shared by the best Ukrainian defence analysts.</p> <p>In Britain, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has been openly critical of Germany for leaving itself so dependent on Russia for energy, and Berlin’s recent refusal to allow Estonia to send German-manufactured arms to Ukraine. The idea of Germany providing weapons to be used against Russia for the first time since the second world war is anathema. Speaking in Berlin on Tuesday, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, defended the decision, saying it was rooted “in the whole development of the past years and decades”.</p> <p>In Poland, the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said in a Facebook post that he remained concerned by the block on Estonia.</p> <p>In the US, the German question is increasingly riling Republicans, leading to commentary in the Wall Street Journal with the headline “Is Germany a Reliable American Ally? Nein.”</p> <p>The tensions reflect two different interpretations of how, even now, Russia can be prevented from becoming a force hostile to the west, interpretations that have dominated politics after the cold war.</p> <p>The differing assessments in Berlin, Washington, Paris and London of how to construct something stable out of the rubble of post-Soviet Russia have always been in flux, with different capitals taking different views at different points.</p> <p>The US under Bill Clinton was as reluctant as anyone to let the four Visegrád countries – the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia – into Nato and made his belief about the risks absolutely clear at the organisation’s summit in January 1994, saying the Atlantic Alliance could not “afford to draw a new line between east and west that would create a self-fulfilling prophecy of future confrontation”. </p> <p>Tony Blair also had to be disabused that Britain could lure Putin into the western camp, and was an enthusiastic supporter of Russia joining the G8. Boris Johnson visited Moscow as foreign secretary in 2017 and, despite the Salisbury poisoning, has been extraordinarily lax about Russian money in London.</p> <p>France too has blown hot and cold in the wake of Russia’s occupation of Crimea in March 2014. It was only after sustained American pressure that François Hollande cancelled a £1bn contract signed by his predecessor as French president to sell to Russia mistral-class helicopter gunships bound for the annexed Black Sea ports in Crimea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"037d179684da6686addf631f70748089dcfb41d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/037d179684da6686addf631f70748089dcfb41d4/0_179_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At a summit in Paris in December 2019, from left to right: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy; the then German chancellor, Angela Merkel; the French president, Emmanuel Macron; and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At a summit in Paris in December 2019, from left to right: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy; the then German chancellor, Angela Merkel; the French president, Emmanuel Macron; and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Emmanuel Macron invited Putin to Versailles alongside an exhibition about Peter the Great in May 2017. Faced by Trump’s isolationism, Macron, in a major speech in 2019, called for an end to the “frozen conflicts” with Russia. In June last year, in conjunction with Angela Merkel, he blindsided other EU leaders by offering Putin a summit. In Berlin on Tuesday, the French president said he was still planning to talk to the Russian leader this week, but only about de-escalation.</p> <p>However, the central player in Europe’s relations with Russia is Germany, as it has been since unification.</p> <p>Quite why Germany takes such a stubbornly forgiving, or optimistic approach to Putin fills libraries, and the most recent offering titled Germany’s Russia Problem, written by John Lough, details the full extent of the networks – commercial, political, cultural and intellectual – between German and Russian elites. It also explains how Putin plays on German war guilt and refuses to repay German forgiveness.</p> <p>The examples Lough raises include how in the wake of Russia’s intervention in Georgia in the summer of 2008, the then German Social Democrat (SPD) foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, warned Europe against sanctions that he said would shut doors to rooms it wanted to enter later.</p> <p>Although Merkel’s response to the invasion of Ukraine in 2014 was firm, Steinmeier, sure that the SPD understood Russia better than Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, went to Moscow and proposed an economic partnership with Russia. At the same time, three former chancellors of Germany – Helmut Schmidt, Gerhard Schröder and Helmut Kohl – all warned Merkel not to isolate Moscow. Within a week of the invasion, the chief executive of Siemens was in Moscow. As the diplomatic situation worsened, a group of senior German former officials and politicians sent an emotional letter calling for a return to the policy of detente. </p> <p>This German-Russian relationship, a recent Chatham House paper argues, has been shaped by two factors. First, <em>Ospolitik</em>, which refers to the “change through rapprochement” foreign policy strategy towards the Soviet Union and its satellite states that was pursued in the 1970s by the Social Democrat chancellor Willy Brandt, and that tried to overcome hard lines by focusing on joint interests. The policy is still considered by many to be the way forward.</p> <p>Second, the mutual dependence deal between the two countries that dates from the 1970s, when the Soviet Union and Germany agreed to exchange natural gas from the USSR for German pipes and steel. It is premised on the belief expressed by Schmidt that “those who trade with each other do not shoot each other”. By 2018 Germany accounted for 37% of Gazprom sales, and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline had been agreed. German exports to Russia rose fivefold between 2000 and 2011.</p> <p>That remains the dominant thinking inside parts of the SPD. The current economics minister, Robert Habeck, whose ministry is responsible for sanctions, is opposed to cutting off Russian access to the Swift payments system. He told Der Spiegel: “We should think about new areas of business that can help lead both sides out of the confrontational role.”</p> <p>However, in recent weeks the compromises inherent in <em>Ostpolitik</em> have come under challenge from a younger generation. Michael Roth, the SPD chair of the foreign affairs committee, argued his party had to escape the shadow of Brandt, adding “we cannot dream the world to be better than it is”. Other ministers have insisted that energy, including the future of Nord Stream 2, cannot be removed from the list of potential sanctions, as it was in 2014.</p> <p>All this leaves Scholz in a different position with his US interlocutors, none of it made easier by his alliance with a Green foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, who wishes to inject values into German foreign policy. The SPD, to avoid a public split, is now going to have a formal party debate about its approach to Russia.</p> <p>One diplomat pointed to the relevance of a remark by Alexander Solzhenitsyn just as the Soviet Union disintegrated, who warned about how perilous it might prove to manage the breakup of the empire. “The clock of communism has stopped striking. But its concrete building has not yet come crashing down,” he wrote. For that reason, the task ahead was not yet about “freeing ourselves”, but instead “to try to save ourselves from being crushed by its rubble”.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/26/biden-threatens-putin-with-personal-sanctions-if-russia-invades-ukraine', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-26T05:04:16Z', 'webTitle': 'Biden threatens Putin with personal sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/biden-threatens-putin-with-personal-sanctions-if-russia-invades-ukraine', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/26/biden-threatens-putin-with-personal-sanctions-if-russia-invades-ukraine', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Joe Biden has said he will consider personal sanctions against Vladimir Putin if Russia invades Ukraine, as western leaders step up military preparations and make plans to shield Europe from Russian gas being cut off.</p> \\n<p>The rare sanctions threat came as Nato placed forces on standby and reinforced eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets in response to Russia’s troop buildup near its border with Ukraine.</p> \\n<p>If Russia attacked, Biden said, it would be the “largest invasion since world war two” and would “change the world”.

These include completing the formation of battalion tactical groups including tank and airborne, setting up and testing a system of wartime administration, and deploying and staffing mobile hospitals.</p> \\n<p>“If Russia was conducting preparations for a large-scale invasion, it would have been much more noticeable,” Zagorodnyuk said, <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/national/center-for-defense-strategies-how-probable-is-large-scale-war-in-ukraine-analysis/\">in a paper</a> written with colleagues from his Kyiv thinktank, the Centre for Defence Strategies.</p> \\n<p>The analysis is supported by others. Konrad Muzyka, an open source intelligence specialist and president of Rochan Consulting, <a href=\"https://rochan-consulting.com/tracking-russian-deployments-near-ukraine-autumn-winter-2021-22/\">estimates that 66-67 Russian battalion tactical groups</a>, the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army, are in place near the border, including 11 battalions that have moved to Belarus.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/01/russia-militarybuildupmap/giv-8253sSDJawzsbzi/\" data-alt=\"Russian deployments map\"> \\n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/01/russia-militarybuildupmap/giv-8253sSDJawzsbzi/\">Russian deployments map</a> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Nevertheless, the US has suggested a full invasion would require at least 100 battalion, and western analysts familiar with the difficulties in holding Iraq have suggested twice that number or more would be needed to fight any counterinsurgency.</p> \\n<p>That larger force could be ready “if they maintain the current pace, in two to three weeks”, Muzyka said, particularly if airborne troops were brought up closer to the border. But Muzyka is sceptical that the battalions are full strength, with an average of 800 personnel. “Satellite imagery shows that there are too few tents,” he added.</p> \\n<p>If the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, wanted to target Kyiv with a lightning attack, the most direct route would be from Belarus, although any attack on the capital with more than 3 million people would risk large numbers of civilian casualties.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a778223562e27d5af076b8149c53fccb0253ed8\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a778223562e27d5af076b8149c53fccb0253ed8/0_477_8550_5130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russian troops at a training ground in Brest, Belarus on 22 January 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A satellite image of a training ground in Brest, Belarus on 22 January 2022.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP/Maxar Technologies</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>It would also be larger in scale than anything that Putin, or indeed Russia, has attempted since the second world war. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare analyst with the Rusi thinktank, believes it would stretch Russian logistics to their limit. “I question their ability to coordinate on this scale,” he said.</p> \\n<p>Supply is a particular issue, Reynolds added. “Russian units tend to hold a large stock of supplies and ammunition, using them until they run out. It makes them dangerous at first, but as they push deeper into hostile territory, their effectiveness drops quickly,” he said. Fresh units have to come forward and take over, because there is no immediate supply capability.</p> \\n<p>On the other hand, moving forces to Belarus, under the cover of the Allied Resolve joint exercises, also lengthens the territory Ukrainian forces have to defend and create openings for Russian tanks elsewhere. “They don’t have the manpower to cover it all,” Muzyka said.</p> \\n<p>“It isn’t difficult to get to Kyiv. The problem is to hold territory. To control it Russia will need a lot of troops,” said Gen Sergey Krivonos, the former deputy secretary in Ukraine’s national security and defence council.</p> \\n<p>He added: “Russian soldiers have been fed a lot of propaganda that doesn’t correspond to reality. They would quickly discover the population is deeply hostile.

Putin already effectively controls these areas and may take steps to recognise them legally or even annex them.</p> \\n<p>“It would be extremely hard for Russian troops to seize major Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv, Kharkiv or Odessa. There would be enormous resistance,” one former senior Ukrainian government official said. The person added: “A takeover of Mariupol would be easier. You could do it in two days and provoke a political crisis in Kyiv.”</p> \\n<p>A potential window for any offensive in the Donbas would be after 4 February, when Putin is due to attend the opening of the winter olympics in Beijing and to meet the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The military exercises in Belarus are due to finish on 20 February, the most obvious moment for an offensive operation.</p> \\n<p>Any push to seize Mariupol could be carried out under a DNR flag, allowing the Kremlin deniability.

It takes its name from the Normandy landings in the second world war. The first meeting took place in Normandy on the margins of the ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the allied landings.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/ukraine-and-russia-to-hold-paris-talks-in-latest-effort-to-ease-tensions\">Ukraine and Russia to hold Paris talks in latest effort to ease tensions</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<h2>What has the format achieved?</h2> \\n<p>Not much. The Minsk protocol – a 2014 agreement reached in the Belarusian capital that sought to end the war in Ukraine – was mediated by France and Germany under the Normandy format. But it failed to stop the fighting, and a new package of measures – known as Minsk II – was signed in February 2015, after a fraught 16 hours of negotiations. This also did not end the fighting, though the Normandy format parties agreed that it was the basis for any future resolution to the conflict. Russia’s insistence that it is not a party to the conflict, and therefore is not bound by the terms of the Minsk agreements, has impeded progress.</p> \\n<h2>What was the gist of the Minsk protocols?</h2> \\n<p>The protocols were seen as complicated and fragile attempts to bring peace to eastern Ukraine, but at their heart they tried to reconcile Ukraine’s demand for full sovereignty over its territory with Russia’s insistence that the Russian-speaking people of eastern Ukraine required autonomy. They called for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the battle zone, amnesties on both sides and exchanges of prisoners and hostages.</p> \\n<h2>What was done to end the impasse?</h2> \\n<p>Two schemes – the Morel plan and the Steinmeier formula – were floated in 2015 and 2016. Both proposed a “special status” law for the Donbas region that would come into force on the day of elections, if they were deemed free and fair by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Neither proposal was accepted by Kyiv, since Russian troops would remain during the elections.</p> \\n<h2>What happened in 2019?</h2> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/focused-russian-attack-on-ukraine-seen-as-more-likely-than-full-scale-invasion\">Focused Russian attack on Ukraine seen as more likely than full-scale invasion</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>After a three-year pause, leaders of the Normandy format met in Paris in December 2019. It was the first meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who had been elected as president of Ukraine in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/21/zelenskiy-wins-second-round-of-ukraines-presidential-election-exit-poll\">landslide victory in April</a>.

It is also hoping to return to the European market on a bigger scale as its own production levels rise, but wants to see an end to a European Commission anti-trust investigation.</p> <p>One source familiar with the talks said: “It looks as if they will have something to announce next week. There have been talks going on for a fortnight or more. It would be painful for Qatar but doable.”</p> <p>British sources, who are involved in separate talks with Qatar, believe Doha can help bail Europe out even though Germany, which is dependent on Russian natural gas, has no liquified gas import terminal. The bulk of Qatar’s gas is sold in Asian markets on long-term contracts, but sources said there was some flexibility, albeit nowhere near enough to replace a full Russian cut-off.</p> <p>The emir is due to meet Biden on Monday in Washington and the discussion will focus on how Qatar can help Europe from being plunged into darkness and cold if a conflict over Ukraine breaks out. Relations between the two countries are at an all-time high due to Qatar’s help with the US Afghan airlift, and a further promise of help from Doha on gas might tip the scales as Vladimir Putin decides if an invasion would be worthwhile.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has lavished praise on Qatar in recent months, and the only political tension has come over the pressure Qatar has put on the US to do more to release humanitarian funds to help Afghanistan famine.</p> <p>Qatar is the largest global supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG) alongside Australia. Two-thirds of its sales in the Asian market are under long-term deals, sometimes 20 years.

By contrast Asia is purchasing 5m tonnes from Qatar.</p> <p>In 2010 Qatar was broadly exporting equal amounts of gas to Europe and Asia. Some of this switch is down to Qatar’s hostility to a European Commission anti-trust investigation launched in 2018 looking at the way Qatar was selling long-term contracts into the European market. Qatar is looking for signs this investigation will wind down.</p> <p>Putin has always insisted that he will never use gas as a geopolitical weapon, and there is no guarantee Russia would try to plunge Germany into the dark if heavy western sanctions are imposed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/25/us-europe-russia-gas-supplies-energy\">US finalizing plans to divert gas to Europe if Russia cuts off supply</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A report from the Centre for American progress – a thinktank close to the Biden administration, warned this week: “In a fight over Ukraine, Russia would without a doubt be prepared to cut off gas supplies to Europe in winter.

Gas market prices have already surpassed record highs and threaten to saddle European households with a cost of living crisis.</p> <p>Russia is Europe’s largest supplier of gas, of which a third flows through Ukraine’s gas pipelines to countries across the continent. Russian gas flows have been a quarter lower than usual over the past year, but European leaders now fear that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could spell an energy catastrophe if gas exports are cut.</p> <p>White House officials said this week that the Biden administration is preparing to finalise a deal to “ensure Europe is able to make it through the winter and spring” by brokering a deal for major gas producing countries to send liquified natural gas (LNG) by tanker to Europe. It is not a plan without challenges.</p> <h2><strong>Where could Europe’s emergency gas supplies come from?</strong></h2> <p>US officials have described the search for spare gas cargoes as “global”.</p> <p>But the talks are likely to focus on Qatar, one of the world’s biggest producers of gas and the second largest exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG) behind Australia. Qatar is a strong western ally in the Middle East and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/06/british-gas-centrica-deal-imports-qatar\">has supplied LNG to the UK</a> and other European countries for years, shipped super-chilled via tankers. Libya may also be able to help given its strong gas production and close proximity to the continent.</p> <p>The US itself could play a direct role in bolstering Europe’s gas supplies too. A record number of LNG cargoes left the US destined for European ports over the last month, and the US has a strong long-term incentive to encourage Europe to give up its reliance on Russia – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/nord-stream-2-how-putins-pipeline-paralysed-the-west\">and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project</a> – in favour of its own shale gas reserves.</p> <h2><strong>How much emergency gas does Europe need?</strong></h2> <p>The scale of Europe’s gas supply challenge will depend on how far tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalate.</p> <p>Russia sends an estimated 230m cubic metres of gas to Europe every day, of which around a third travels west via Ukraine. But market experts are divided over whether Russia would be likely to disrupt all gas exports to Europe, or only those which rely on Ukraine’s gas pipelines. Others are sceptical over whether the Kremlin would tighten Russia’s gas taps at all.</p> <p>“If Russia weaponised its energy exports how much energy would they disrupt? It’s hard to scenario plan this,” said Helima Croft, the global head of commodities at RBC Capital. But the question is not whether the US could create a backstop for Russian gas supplies but whether it could source gas to help mitigate any disruption, she said.</p> <h2><strong>Is there enough spare gas available to fill a gap?</strong></h2> <p>The global gas supply crunch which emerged as economies began to rebound following the Covid-19 slump means there is little spare gas to go around, according to analyst Xi Nan from Rystad Energy.</p> <p>The US has said that its conversations are “really broad, with a lot of companies and countries around the world” so that it wouldn’t need “to ask any one individual company or country to surge exports by significant volumes, but rather smaller volumes from a multitude of sources”.</p> <p>“The question,” said Croft, “is whether the US can find any slack in the system”.</p> <p>Qatar currently produces 77m tonnes a year (Mtpa) of LNG, but has contracted around 97Mtpa to buyers in Asia, Europe, Kuwait and major energy companies which can choose where they send each cargo. The US has also committed its 80m tonnes of LNG production to buyers in Asia, Europe and so-called “portfolio players”.</p> <p>But there is a possibility that some contracted cargoes earmarked for Asia could be diverted to Europe instead thanks to mild winter temperatures in the region which has reduced gas demand, said Croft.</p> <p>She added that it would take “delicate” discussions between major gas producers and their Asia buyers to negotiate some gas supply flexibility.</p> <h2><strong>Has anything like this been done before?</strong></h2> <p>There are plenty of examples of emergency supply measures in the global oil market, but not for gas.</p> <p>During Libya’s civil war Saudi Arabia agreed to increase its oil exports into the global market to make up a shortfall in Libyan crude <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/feb/24/oil-surges-libya-middle-east-fears\">which drove oil prices to $120 a barrel</a>. More recently Saudi Arabia brokered a deal with members of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec\">Opec oil cartel</a> and its allies to make an unprecedented cut in oil production during the Covid-19 pandemic to avoid oil prices crashing to zero.</p> <p>The gas market lacks the same global cooperation, which has made responding to the global supply crisis more difficult.</p> <p>“Mohammed bin Salman [the Saudi crown prince] sees himself as the central bank for oil. There is no equivalent in the gas market,” said Croft. “Even if Qatar wanted to help they’re not sitting on the kind of dry powder that the Saudis could access through their oil reserves.”</p> <p>Perhaps unprecedented times will call for unprecedented measures.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/27/five-dead-in-ukraine-after-national-guardsman-opens-fire-at-military-factory', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-27T10:48:13Z', 'webTitle': 'Five dead in Ukraine after national guardsman opens fire at military factory ', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/five-dead-in-ukraine-after-national-guardsman-opens-fire-at-military-factory', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/27/five-dead-in-ukraine-after-national-guardsman-opens-fire-at-military-factory', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Ukrainian police have detained a national guard soldier who is suspected of shooting security guards at a military factory for unknown reasons, killing five people and injuring five others, the interior minister has said.</p> <p>The shooting took place in the early hours of Thursday in Dnipro at the Pivdenmash missile factory during the issuance of weapons to the guards, the ministry said in a statement.

Angela Merkel, who stepped down as German chancellor in 2021, was an enthusiastic backer as it promised to supply cheap fuel to 26m German homes. But she admitted in 2018 it could not be viewed as an “just economic project” but was also a political one that threatened the integrity of Ukraine by bypassing it as a transit country.</p> \\n<p>Longstanding fears that it could give Vladimir Putin more leverage over Germany and other European countries have been amplified significantly by the Ukraine standoff.</p> \\n<p>The pipeline’s construction was completed in September but its owner, the Russian gas company Gazprom, is waiting for final legal permission from German regulators to open the valves and send gas westwards. The federal Network Agency has been accused of dragging its heels over the certification process, though there are some who believe this is a deliberate tactic and it has earned support from some US officials.</p> \\n<p>In contrast to his foreign minister, Scholz had until recently been adamant that the pipeline should not face sanctions, referring to it as a “private business initiative” that had nothing to do with the Ukraine crisis. His shift puts him at odds with some in his Social Democratic party who have backed the pipeline as good for German industry and for maintaining a relationship with Moscow.</p> \\n<p>The prospect of Russia cutting off supplies in the event of a conflict has led the Biden administration to begin talks with gas producing nations across the world to secure supplies for Europe.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/27/energy-crisis-where-could-europes-gas-come-from-if-russia-cuts-exports\">Energy crisis: where could Europe’s gas come from if Russia cuts exports?</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>A senior US official said this week that “contingency” plans were being drawn up, and the White House said that Joe Biden would host the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, on Sunday, with their agenda including “ensuring the stability of global energy supplies”.</p> \\n<p>When asked about reports that industry had little or no capacity to provide the required supplies, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said on Wednesday that the US faced logistical challenges, especially around moving natural gas.</p> \\n<p>“That’s part of our discussions with a lot of companies and countries,” Psaki said. “But again, these conversations are ongoing and we don’t intend to fail.”</p> \\n<p>On Thursday, Australia’s resources minister, Keith Pitt, refused to confirm whether Australian officials were in active discussions with the Europeans about gas supply.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/nord-stream-2-how-putins-pipeline-paralysed-the-west\">Nord Stream 2: how Putin’s pipeline paralysed the west </a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>He said Australia had been one of the most reliable suppliers of liquefied natural gas throughout the pandemic. “We will of course continue to meet our existing contracts but where there is a shortfall Australia will always look to support our friends,” Pitt told Sky News Australia.</p> \\n<p>Whether any shortfalls would provide Australian exporters with a long-term opportunity or just become a short-term fix was “a matter for exporters to determine”, he said.</p> \\n<p>Baerbock defended Germany’s decision to send 5000 military helmets to Ukraine, which has been widely ridiculed, including by the mayor of Kiev, Vitali Klitschko, who called it “an absolute joke” and has led to accusations Germany is not offering the country adequate support.”This followed a specific request from Ukraine,” she said, adding that Germany was also involved in the refurbishment of a protective bunker near Odessa and in the training of Ukrainian soldiers. But she stressed that Germany would stand by its refusal to deliver lethal weapons, saying that “progress in the negotiating process is the priority of this government”. She said she “did not want to close doors that that have just started to open albeit tentatively but that might lead to a deescalation,” referring to the talks in the so-called ‘Normandy Format’ which had taken place between Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France on Wednesday.</p> \\n<p>Klitschko, a former boxer, said the delivery of helmets had left him “speechless”. He told the tabloid Bild: “What will German send next to support us? Pillows?” Since 2014 when Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, it has always refused the request for weapons, but has provided its military with bullet proof vests, helmets and communication equipment. Its reluctance to deliver lethal weapons is mainly linked to acute awareness of the murderous havoc Germany wrought in the region during the second world war, guilt about which regional leaders, especially Vladimir Putin, have been keen to play on.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/27/historical-parallels-between-ukraine-and-ireland', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-27T17:29:32Z', 'webTitle': 'Historical parallels between Ukraine and Ireland | Letter', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/historical-parallels-between-ukraine-and-ireland', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/27/historical-parallels-between-ukraine-and-ireland', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Simon Diggins (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/ukraines-independence-must-be-supported-by-britain\" title=\"\">Letters, 25 January</a>) urges that “those, like Jenkins, who find it difficult to understand why a country like Ukraine might wish to chart its own course, let him look over the Irish Sea at a close historical parallel”.

are monitoring the situation closely and it is vital that organisations follow the guidance to ensure they are all resilient,” said Paul Chichester, the director of operations at the NCSC.</p>

cyber-attack on Ukraine government websites earlier this month warned the public to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/ukraine-massive-cyber-attack-government-websites-suspected-russian-hackers\">“be afraid and expect the worst”,</a> which Ukraine said was orchestrated by Russia.</p> <p>“Over several years, we have observed a pattern of malicious Russian behaviour in cyberspace,” Chichester said. “Last week’s incidents in Ukraine bear the hallmarks of similar Russian activity we have observed before.”</p> <p>The guidance, which is primarily aimed at larger organisations, comes after the NCSC warned businesses in the UK’s critical national infrastructure – such as energy, water supply, transportation and telecommunications – about specific vulnerabilities Russian hackers have been known to exploit.</p> <p>Ukraine was subjected to a crippling Russian cyber-attack in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/15/uk-blames-russia-notpetya-cyber-attack-ukraine\">dubbed the NotPetya attack</a>, which wiped clean computers in the country but spilled over into systems around the world. It gained access to computers by hacking a widely used piece of tax reporting software in Ukraine, which also affected foreign companies based there and spilled over to more than 60 countries.</p> <p>The attack was nominally a piece of “ransomware” – where affected targets are asked to pay a bitcoin ransom to unlock their hard drives – but there was in fact no way of decrypting the affected files, making it what is known as a “wiper” attack in industry jargon.</p> <p>Stuart McKenzie, a senior vice-president at US cybersecurity firm Mandiant, said that Russia would have planned any cyber offensive linked to a Ukraine conflict well in advance: “Russia is very strategic,” he said. “It will have been strategically planned over a number of years.”</p> <p>McKenzie said it was unlikely that a NotPetya-style attack would hit the UK. “The possibility of a wiper attack across the whole of the UK is incredibly unlikely. It is much more likely to be a strategic attack against limited targets.” However, he said that the NotPetya attack appeared to show a lack of regard for collateral damage outside the targeted country. The malware caused an estimated $10bn of damage around the world, with the Danish shipping company Maersk among those affected, after reporting costs of up to $300m related to the attack.</p> <p>He said: “I absolutely believe Russia will have strong strategic plans for what they are going to do but they don’t know what the unintended consequences will be.”</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/28/on-frontline-in-ukraine-a-photo-essay', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-28T13:00:01Z', 'webTitle': 'Too quiet for comfort: on the frontline in Ukraine – a photo essay', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/on-frontline-in-ukraine-a-photo-essay', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/28/on-frontline-in-ukraine-a-photo-essay', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Since 2014, the French photographer Guillaume Herbaut has been going to Ukraine several times a year to cover the war in a country divided between those turned toward Europe and those drawn to Russia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a964a6bf3e7cde90342b3632db2a4b7a6d24441\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a964a6bf3e7cde90342b3632db2a4b7a6d24441/0_80_2000_1497/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Ukrainian soldier, Roma, 23, walks in trenches on the frontline near the village of Opytne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Ukrainian soldier, Roma, 23, walks in trenches on the frontline near the village of Opytne, opposite the Donetsk airport occupied by Russian-backed separatist forces.

First, demand the maximum, do not meekly ask but demand. Second, present ultimatums, and third, do not give one inch of ground because there will always be someone in the west that will offer you something maybe half that you did not previously have. It is so characteristic of how they operate.</p> \\n<p>“We are already discussing what we can offer to de-escalate, and if we do that the west will fall into their trap. Nato has not caused this crisis and is not planning to attack anybody. Nato cannot do anything on its side to de-escalate. We should not take any expensive steps so they end up with something they did not have before.”</p> \\n<p>Kallas said that did not mean she opposed dialogue, and said she was happy to see talks about transparency on military exercises, even if she was “very doubtful that Russia will keep its side”.</p> \\n<p>But she saw no sign of concessions being made by Nato in its discussions with Russia. “The level of consultation on the Nato side has been excellent.

It would be terrible,” Milley said. “And it’s not necessary.”</p> \\n<p>In a call with Macron lasting longer than an hour, Putin said the US and Nato had not taken into account Moscow’s “fundamental concerns” about the expansion of Nato and deployment of strike missiles near the Russian border.</p> \\n<p>Washington and European capitals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/ukraine-and-russia-to-hold-paris-talks-in-latest-effort-to-ease-tensions\">rejected Russia’s demands to veto Ukraine’s Nato membership</a>, but set out proposals on other ways to improve security on the continent in the unpublished documents.</p> \\n<p>“The key question was ignored,” Putin was reported to have said, according to the Kremlin statement. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and Russia’s relationship with Nato, the Russian president went on to say, were based on the principle that “no one should strengthen their security at the expense of other countries”.</p> \\n<p>The Russian leader also promised to “carefully study” the US and Nato written responses and continue a “Russian-French dialogue on the entire range of European security questions”.</p> \\n<p>Putin told the French leader Russia would continue talks in the so-called Normandy format that brings together representatives from France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia, following talks earlier this week between the quartet of countries.</p> \\n<p>Putin told Macron that the French president was “the only one who he could have such serious discussions with”, according to the French presidency source.</p> \\n<p>There was “disagreement, but agreement in the necessity for dialogue and that the Europeans and France are part of the ongoing dialogue”, said the French official. “Dialogue is difficult and there were no solutions from this call.”</p> \\n<p>The French president has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/eu-must-have-frank-exacting-dialogue-with-russia-emmanuel-macron-says\">long called for dialogue with Russia</a>, sometimes angering other EU member states that have preferred a more distanced approach.</p> \\n<p>EU divisions rose to the surface after Latvia’s defence minister, Artis Pabriks, launched a no-holds-barred attack on the German government for what he called its “immoral” refusal to allow Estonia to ship guns of German origin to Ukraine.

Biden “reaffirmed the readiness of the United States along with its allies and partners to respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine”, a White House statement said.</p> \\n<p>Zelenskiy said he had discussed with Biden international attempts to find a peaceful way out of the crisis. “Discussed recent diplomatic efforts on de-escalation and agreed on joint actions for the future,” Zelenskiy said on Twitter on Thursday evening. He thanked Biden for the ongoing military assistance in the form of weapons.</p> \\n<p>Russia has denied it will invade but has said the US’s written response, delivered on Wednesday, did not meet its security demands.

A mosaic on one wall glorifies the Russian soldiers who fought in Georgia in 2008 and Syria in 2015, as well as the “little green men” who annexed Crimea in 2014.</p> <p>But like others there, Rozhkov said he could not see what could motivate Russia to launch an attack on Ukraine today – despite Vladimir Putin’s public ultimatums to the west and the tanks, missiles and other weapons continuing to make their way to the Ukrainian border.</p> <p>“When Russia has gone to war, it’s gone to war for a reason,” he said. “And there is no reason for this bloodshed, there’s nothing worth it in today’s world. What would [people] be fighting for? … And how can you fight a war without people?”</p> <p>Despite warnings from the US that an attack could be imminent, one would have been hard pressed walking around Moscow to guess that something extraordinary was afoot.</p> <p>“Leaders need to talk tough, this is just hysteria,” said Konstantin Danilin, 36, who had brought his two daughters to go tubing at Park Patriot, an amusement park just outside Moscow opened by the Russian military. “Putin is aggressive: he takes risks, it’s possible he makes mistakes. But this is all just a negotiation.”</p> <p>Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and support for the subsequent war in Donbas led to a mass mobilisation of Russian society. Pro-government and anti-war marches were held, and families and friends fell into bitter disputes about the conflict. Putin’s popularity rating rode the wave of patriotism to an all-time high. Russian volunteers, mercenaries and soldiers fought and died in the ensuing conflict.</p> <p>Now, as Russia approaches a perhaps even more fateful war, it feels as though the public has barely taken note, despite the warning signs coming from both sides.</p> <p>Denis Volkov, of the Levada Centre, an independent polling agency, said: “When this topic comes up in groups in the last two or three months, people say: ‘Oy, as soon as I hear the word [Ukraine], I just change the channel. I don’t even want to know what’s going on there. Ukraine again, war again, I don’t even want to get into it.’”</p> <p>Levada found in December that a majority of Russians did not believe there would be a larger war in Ukraine. In the same poll, two-thirds of respondents blamed the US, Nato or Ukraine for the escalating tensions. “Nobody wants [war] but they’re internally they’ve been prepared for this situation,” Volkov said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/on-frontline-in-ukraine-a-photo-essay\">Too quiet for comfort: on the frontline in Ukraine – a photo essay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some pundits have pointed towards the lack of a public frenzy in Russia as a sign that the government is not preparing people for a war, although Russia’s continued involvement in the Ukrainian and Syrian conflicts has also taken place with little fanfare.</p> <p>Volkov said the lack of enthusiasm for and attention paid to the conflict might also present the Kremlin with an opportunity.</p> <p>“It’s far more important that people are ready to accept whatever happens,” he said. “The majority will not protest. And that means the government’s hands are free … It’s apathy and how people will view Russia’s place in this conflict as justified that are important.”</p> <p>Tikhon Dzyadko, the editor-in-chief of the independent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/09/tv-rain-russia-only-independent-television-channel\">TV Rain</a> channel, said he had noticed heightened concern among his circle of friends, many of whom had protested against the outbreak of war in 2014, that a new conflict was coming.</p> <p>But it was understandable why the public reaction could be muted, he said. First, the war has been going on in Ukraine for eight years and Russians have slowly grown used to it. And second, Russian society is so beaten down by the government’s repressive atmosphere that it is hard to imagine any protest taking place right now.</p> <p>On the other side, there is little in the Kremlin’s motivations to galvanise public opinion about the conflict.</p> <p>“Nobody understands why there’s been an escalation. And nobody understands who needs this,” he said. “The absolute majority of people I know don’t want this. It’s not some kind of sacred war against an aggressor that has attacked your country. It’s the realisation of some indescribable geopolitical interests, which may lead to the deaths of people.”</p> <p>There are signs too that even in elite business circles, which have benefited from access to the Kremlin, many people have grown unhappy with the situation. “While nobody wants war, don’t expect big business to stand up and voice their opposition,” an investment banker <a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/01/25/as-markets-crash-and-war-fears-grow-russias-business-elite-suffers-in-silence-a76142\">told the Moscow Times</a> this week, speaking anonymously. “We have become passengers. The business community will only discuss war in their kitchens. Everybody will stay quiet in public.”</p> <p>Perhaps most surprising is the relative silence of Putin, who has largely vanished from the airwaves at a moment when so much depends on his coming decision. The Russian leader has barely addressed the Ukraine crisis since the new year, leaving TV anchors, pundits and Russian diplomats involved in negotiations to lead the nightly newscasts that inform the majority of the public.</p> <p>These shows have had a clear message, noted Volkov, by increasingly portraying the west as unhinged and Russia as the voice of reason. In a monologue this week on state television, the leading pro-Kremlin host Dmitry Kiselyov said: “They keep harping at us – you’re about to attack Ukraine. This isn’t about Ukraine. It’s about something much larger.”</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/jan/29/us-warns-russia-conflict-with-ukraine-would-be-horrific-as-tensions-simmer', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-29T06:15:55Z', 'webTitle': 'US warns Russia conflict with Ukraine would be ‘horrific’ as tensions simmer', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/us-warns-russia-conflict-with-ukraine-would-be-horrific-as-tensions-simmer', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/29/us-warns-russia-conflict-with-ukraine-would-be-horrific-as-tensions-simmer', 'fields': {'body': '<p>The US has warned a Russian invasion of Ukraine would be “horrific” for both sides, while calling for a diplomatic solution as tensions over Moscow’s military buildup on the border of the country continued to simmer.</p> \\n<p>Speaking at the Pentagon on Friday, top US officials urged a focus on diplomacy while saying that Russia now had enough troops and equipment in place to threaten the whole of Ukraine.</p> \\n<p>Any such conflict, warned the top US general, Mark Milley, would be “horrific” for both sides.</p> \\n<p>“If that was unleashed on Ukraine, it would be significant, very significant, and it would result in a significant amount of casualties,” Milley said.</p> \\n<p>“It would be horrific, it will be terrible,” the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff added.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/boris-johnson-to-visit-ukraine-region-and-hold-call-with-putin-next-week\">Boris Johnson to visit Ukraine region and hold call with Putin next week</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>Speaking alongside Milley, US defense secretary Lloyd Austin said the buildup of Russian forces along Ukraine’s border has reached the point where Putin now has a complete range of military options, including actions short of a full-scale invasion.</p> \\n<p>But Austin said war in Ukraine could still be avoided.</p> \\n<p>“Conflict is not inevitable.

After <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-sees-some-room-dialogue-after-us-security-response-2022-01-27/\" title=\"\">Russia agreed last week to keep talking</a>, Ukraine’s citizens have reason to hope the crisis will turn out to be a comparably vacuous non-event – a peculiarly Putin-esque contribution to the theatre of the absurd.</p> <p>The border standoff, which commenced in earnest in November, has lasted so long that the tea leaf-reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/russia-could-act-against-ukraine-at-any-moment-says-us\" title=\"\">Biden reckons Russia “has to do something”</a>. This penetrating Mystic Meg analysis is not necessarily correct.

Biden anticipates a D-day-scale Russian operation. But many analysts expect any attack to be fast, covert and asymmetrical, using special forces, sabotage and cyberwarfare, as in the Donbas in 2014.</p> <p>While this slightly surreal waiting game continues, it’s possible, and instructive to assess what damage has already been done – and which individuals and countries are winning or losing so far in Ukraine’s phoney war.</p> <p>For example, Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s brand-new foreign minister and co-leader of the Greens, has had a good war to date. Ignoring chauvinist sneers about her inexperience and gender, <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-sergey-lavrov-germany-annalena-baerbock/\" title=\"\">she faced down Sergei Lavrov</a>, her grisly Russian counterpart, when they met recently in Moscow.</p> <p>In contrast, her boss, Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz, is having a miserable time of it.

Scholz insists that “all options are on the table” when it comes to potential sanctions in the event of a Russian incursion into Ukraine, but his government has been slow to go into specifics, even arguing it is strategically wiser to remain vague.</p> <p>“We must not rule anything out when it comes to sanctions, including Swift [the global banking payments system] and Nord Stream 2,” said Nils Schmid, the foreign policy spokesperson of Scholz’s centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD).</p> <p>“If push comes to shove, then Nord Stream 2 will probably be unsustainable,” Schmid told the <em>Observer</em>. “It’s crucial that Putin cannot calculate in advance what the consequences of his actions will be.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"601bdeea4e1dd8f0b58108c12338741ca256c081\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/601bdeea4e1dd8f0b58108c12338741ca256c081/0_25_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The logo of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project on a pipe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The recently completed but as yet unapproved Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The logic of this stance is not just questioned abroad but also domestically. “Threatening sanctions does not work if the other side can tell you are afraid to spell out what they are,” said Norbert Röttgen, a member of the Bundestag’s foreign policy committee for the conservative Christian Democratic Union. “It has to be clear that authorising Nord Stream 2 is out of the question if there is a war.</p> <p>“We are on the cusp of the most dramatic situation since the end of the second world war: a war in Europe that would change the geopolitical balance on our continent,” Röttgen told the <em>Observer</em>. “Chancellor Scholz needs to make it clear he understands the historic significance of this moment, or he risks gambling away Germany’s reputation as a reliable partner of the west.”</p> <p>As Scholz’s Social Democrats convene on Monday for an internal debate on its stance on Russia, Röttgen urged the party to take a stand against those who use German history as a cover “for personal financial gain and an appeasement policy that turns aggressors into victims”. The belief that Germany, whose military forays in the Nazi era cost millions of Russian lives, cannot act as aggressively towards the Kremlin as other European nations is not a minority view. It runs across the German party spectrum and is widely shared among the population.</p> <p>However, the SPD’s Schmid says: “You have to take into consideration that Germany, alongside France, has the role of a mediator between Russia and Ukraine in the Normandy format [the four-way contact group set up after the conflict in Donbas]. We cannot supply weapons to one of the two parties we are mediating between.”</p> <p>Even the Green party, heralded by some as human rights hawks who would radically reposition Germany’s stance on China and Russia after claiming the foreign ministry under the new government, reaffirms this position. “The German government has not provided any arms shipments to Ukraine for almost a decade,” said Agnieszka Brugger, a Green member of the parliament’s defence committee.</p> <p>“A change in policy would not make any significant short-term military difference on the ground but may be a big risk for the very difficult ongoing diplomatic talks,” Brugger said. “European and Nato unity in our support for Ukraine is crucial to demonstrate a strong stance towards Russia, and we should not let the different ways we show our support for our allies get in between us.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a552f939bf084f973d69de96867fced82d2c62fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a552f939bf084f973d69de96867fced82d2c62fd/0_123_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russian mechanized infantry holds drills in the Rostov region\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian mechanised infantry forces carry out exercises in the Rostov region on Ukraine’s border on 27 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergey Pivovarov/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No party in the Bundestag has used Germany’s historic crimes as a cover for expanding ties with Russia as much as Scholz’s, however. As Germany’s oldest party, the SPD has a tendency to reach back into the history books, and few of the party’s politicians talk about Russia without citing <em>Ostpolitik</em>, the “change through rapprochement” foreign policy strategy towards the Soviet Union and its satellite states pursued by its former chancellor Willy Brandt.</p> <p>Yet the SPD’s attitude to Russia doesn’t necessarily run as deep as it likes to convince itself. In an essay for the <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine</em> last week, the historian Gerd Koenen argued that a foreign policy of “latent equidistance between Washington and Moscow” was rooted in the centre-left’s experience at the start of the millennium, when an SPD-led German government refused to join America’s war in Iraq.</p> <p>That stint in power resulted in the SPD splitting over domestic policy, with Chancellor Schröder pursuing a New Labourite third way while finance minister Oskar Lafontaine peeled off to co-found the leftwing Die Linke (The Left). But in their pro-Russian sympathies the two camp leaders remain united.</p> <p>Schröder, who on Friday insisted that Russia had no intention to invade Ukraine and accused Kyiv of “sabre rattling”, joined the state-controlled Russian giant Gazprom’s North European Gas Pipeline company, later renamed Nord Stream AG, as chairman within months of losing the 2005 election. The Baltic Sea pipeline between Russia and north-east Germany, which bypasses Baltic and east central Europe, was green-lit in the interim period before Angela Merkel took office, but continued under her tenure.</p> <p>At Nord Stream AG, Schröder’s chief executive is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/russia-putin-german-right-hand-man-matthias-warnig\" title=\"\">Matthias Warnig,</a> a former high-ranking Stasi officer who once spied on West German industry for East Germany’s secret police under the aliases “Ökonom” (“Economist”) and “Arthur” and ascended to Putin’s inner circle after the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a144dcf3d3bb178390023b4ba56d1721190c6de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a144dcf3d3bb178390023b4ba56d1721190c6de/0_106_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers at the\\xa0construction site\\xa0of the Nord\\xa0Stream\\xa02 gas pipeline in Russia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Work on the Nord&nbsp;Stream&nbsp;2 gas pipeline in the Leningrad region.

A German subsidiary of Nord Stream 2 called Gas for Europe, founded last week in an apparent attempt to complete the controversial pipeline’s certification process, has registered as its supervisory board chairman Dietrich Walter Haller, who worked at the chancellory under Schröder from 2003 to 2005. On Thursday night, the German foreign office announced it would seek to ban Haller from the role, since it was in conflict with his recent activity as a top diplomat.</p> <p>Lars Klingbeil, the Social Democrats’ co-chair, used to work in the Hanover constituency office of Schröder, whom he declined to desribe as a “lobbyist” when pressed in an interview with <em>Der Spiegel</em> last week. Klingbeil is also a trustee of “German-Russia – The new generation”, a networking association founded in 2011 by the Russian ambassador to Berlin.</p> <p>Scholz, who was SPD general secretary under Schröder, has brushed against these networks. But his rise to power is not of their making, and it remains possible that he can detach himself from them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/german-intelligence-chief-bruno-kahl-russia-has-not-decided-whether-to-attack-ukraine\">Putin accuses Nato of ignoring Russia’s concerns as Ukraine crisis simmers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/nato-allies-policy-russia-ukraine-analysis\" title=\"\">the Schröder generation’s approach to Russia</a> was shaped by Brandt, Scholz has cited as his political idol Brandt’s successor, Helmut Schmidt, who prodded Nato in 1979 to adopt its so-called dual-track resolution: a strategy of military armament and threat coupled with an openness to dialogue.</p> <p>Schmidt’s confrontational course made him enemies within his own party, but in an interview with <em>Süddeutsche Zeitung</em> last week, Scholz seemed to signal that he favoured this strand of his party’s foreign policy tradition: “If you cite Brandt and Schmidt, then territorial integrity and states’ right to self-determination is an inextricable part of that,” he said.</p> <p>Schmid said: “Both Brandt and Schmidt were committed transatlanticists: that’s something that’s misremembered by some people in Germany, including some in my own party.

As Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Friday, high tensions with Russia are not new “We have been in the situation for eight years,” he said.</p> <p>The analysis in Ukraine diverges from the west’s assessment of the crisis as primarily a military one. The belief in Kyiv is that Vladimir Putin’s goal is the long-term destabilisation of Ukraine, and that the Russian leader may have other objectives than invasion.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Liz Truss, the British foreign secretary, warned eight days ago of a possible Kremlin coup plot in Ukraine, possibly in tandem with a military attack, involving five former Ukrainian politicians. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/confusion-over-uk-claim-that-putin-plans-coup-in-ukraine\">four already live in exile in Moscow</a>, meaning their links to Russia are not a secret.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, warned that Russian “military advance force operations” – mostly thought to be conducted by GRU military intelligence – had already begun in Ukraine.</p> <p>Wallace was understood to be largely referring to pro-Russian disinformation activity. Kyiv has also noted their presence, not just in Ukraine but in the Moscow-backed separatist territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, and Russian territory on the border. </p> <p>British intelligence officials then warned in briefings that emerged on Thursday that<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russia-ready-to-mount-complete-takeover-of-ukraine-in-two-weeks-west-fears-8x3tcfw7z\"> Russia was “two to three weeks away”</a> from assembling a 150,000-plus invasion force. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/focused-russian-attack-on-ukraine-seen-as-more-likely-than-full-scale-invasion\">That matches existing predictions of independent analysts</a> relying on satellite imagery and other open-source, public domain material.</p> <p>The ratcheting-up has helped propel the Ukraine story on to British newspaper front pages at a time when the news in Westminster has been dominated by whether Boris Johnson can survive the “partygate” scandal. However, it would be simplistic to say it is entirely cynical.</p> <p>The concern is genuine in the security community, which is still recovering from the criticism that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/swift-taliban-takeover-proves-us-and-uk-analysis-badly-wrong\">it failed to predict how fast the Taliban would overrun Afghanistan</a> last summer. This time it will be possible to say the public have been given fair warning if an attack were to happen. Johnson said on Monday there was “a plan for a lightning war”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the British warnings are being reflected in Washington. On Friday, US intelligence warned that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-russia-moves-blood-supplies-near-ukraine-adding-us-concern-officials-2022-01-28/\">“blood supplies”</a> and other concrete indicators of an invasion were being moved up to the border, although Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said this was part of Russia’s “psychological war”.</p> <p>Mixed messaging followed a phone call last Thursday between Joe Biden and Zelenskiy. A Ukrainian official claimed the US president had said a Russian attack would be imminent once the ground froze in February, prompting a rapid White House rebuttal.</p> <p>What Biden had said, US officials insisted, was that an invasion in February was “a distinct possibility” – a serious enough warning nonetheless. That is a position that Kviv does not dispute, given in its estimate that about 119,000 Russian soldiers are camped out near Ukraine’s border.</p> <p>Nevertheless, senior officials in Kyiv believe that the latest signals from Moscow suggest the Kremlin may be moving away from a military confrontation next month. </p> <p>Speaking at a wreath-laying ceremony on Sunday, Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s security council, was dismissive. “Today, they’re saying that Russia is threatening Ukraine. This is absolutely ridiculous. There is no threat,” he said.</p> <p>“We do not want war. We don’t need it at all. Those who are pushing towards it, especially those from the west, they are pursuing some self-serving false goals of their own,” he said, adding that a war against Ukraine “does not suit us”.</p> <p>According to Kyiv officials, the Kremlin sent 95,000 troops to Ukraine’s borders last April. This time an additional 25,000 have been deployed – an increase, but not sufficient numbers to seize the capital, in what would be a massive and bloody operation to capture a city of over 3 million people. Officials have also suggested that Covid infections have swept through some of the Russian battalions, rendering them less effective. </p> <p> Either way, the picture may not become clear until March, when an invasion would become logistically difficult. However, Ukrainian officials say another crisis could then take place this autumn, following two previous military buildups, in the spring and autumn of 2021.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/30/ukraine-putin-russia-phoney-war-surreal-theatre\">Waiting for Putin: Russia’s phoney war is playing out as surreal theatre</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kyiv believes Putin is “cautious” and argues that his aggressive diplomacy has already brought results, forcing the US and its allies to take Moscow’s security proposals for eastern Europe seriously.</p> <p>These include a permanent veto on Ukraine and Georgia’s Nato membership and a demand that Nato pull back to its levels of deployment in 1997, when Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltic states had not yet become member countries.

He is also expected to visit Ukraine with the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, early this week, and the levelling-up white paper is scheduled for publication on Wednesday.</p> <p>Whitehall sources said they also expected developments this week on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/30/handling-cost-of-living-crisis-key-to-tory-government-future-johnson-told\">help for families struggling</a> with the cost of energy bills, after the prime minister and the chancellor definitively ruled out cancelling the national insurance rise and cutting VAT on energy bills.</p> <p>Johnson could receive the long-awaited report on lockdown breaches in No 10 as soon as Monday, after which he is expected to give an immediate statement to MPs.</p> <p>Scotland Yard’s special inquiries team will this week scour evidence of lockdown-breaking by Johnson’s aides sent to them by the Gray inquiry. Detectives received the information from the Cabinet Office on Friday and police chiefs have been stung by fierce and widespread criticism after pressing for Gray’s report to give only “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/28/met-asked-for-minimal-reference-to-probe-of-no-10-events-in-sue-gray-report\">minimal reference” to the gatherings under investigation</a>. </p> <p>Those are believed to be the most clear-cut breaches of the lockdown rules, and probably the most politically dangerous for Johnson. The police request caused widespread fury in Westminster and the report’s contents are expected to be significantly weakened.</p> <p>The Met was unable to say on Sunday when it will start to write to those identified by Gray as having potentially breached lockdown rules. They will be asked if they have a reasonable excuse and then police will decide whether they should face a fine. Cabinet Office sources said on Sunday night that they were still in discussion with the Met.</p> <p>Opposition parties have been discussing what can be done to force the publication of a full version of the report, which is now only likely after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/25/no-10-parties-police-will-uncover-evidence-not-in-gray-report-say-ex-staffers\">police inquiry</a> has been completed.</p> <p>Johnson, who spent the weekend at his Chequers residence, is said to have been struck by MPs’ criticism that the government has been unable to communicate the benefits of Brexit.</p> <p>On Sunday night he unveiled plans for a new law – called the “Brexit freedoms” bill – intended to make it easier to amend or remove some of the bridging law kept on the statute book after Brexit. No 10 said that, as it stands, much of that regulation would require primary legislation to remove it, and the new bill could sidestep that process.</p> <p>Critics said Johnson must make clear whether he intends to target employment protections, and pointed out that businesses and government have already faced billions of pounds of costs as a result of additional red tape due to Brexit itself.</p> <p>Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for business, said: “This odd announcement raises questions about what kind of environmental rules, data protections and workers rights this government may look to water down. This bizarre press release leaves ministers with serious questions to answer.”</p> <p>A Labour source said: “The key question for the government is which of the proposed changes in regulation depend on the passage of this bill, and if the answer is none, what other changes are they planning that do? Until they can explain all that, we have to ask what the point of this bill is.”</p> <p>Downing Street said it would release a public catalogue of all retained EU laws to determine if they are beneficial to the UK.</p> <p>In a statement announcing the new bill, two years after Britain’s exit from the bloc, Johnson said: “Getting Brexit done two years ago today was a truly historic moment and the start of an exciting new chapter for our country. The plans we have set out today will further unleash the benefits of Brexit and ensure that businesses can spend more of their money investing, innovating and creating jobs.</p> <p>“Our new Brexit freedoms bill will end the special status of EU law in our legal framework and ensure that we can more easily amend or remove outdated EU law in future.”</p> <p>The government will also publish a riposte to critics who claim little advantage of Brexit has been taken, with a document titled The Benefits of Brexit: How the UK is Taking Advantage of Leaving the EU.</p> <p>It will claim that reforms have led to a more agile digital and AI sector and a less burdensome data rights regime compared with the EU’s GDPR. It will also claim that there have been benefits in changing clinical trials, strengthening environmental protections and establishing a domestic subsidy regime.</p> <p>With hopes rising in No 10 that Johnson can swerve a no confidence vote, the prime minister is also understood to have told staff he hopes to save his chief of staff, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/16/operation-save-big-dog-who-is-in-line-of-fire-no-10-boris-johnson-partygate\">Dan Rosenfield</a>, or move him to another role.</p> <p>Gray’s report will criticise the culture in No 10 and make a series of recommendations on changes to the organisation, according to those who have given evidence, but Rosenfield has not been implicated publicly in any egregious breaches.</p> <p>No 10 is braced for further damaging revelations in the press once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/30/met-police-redacted-version-sue-gray-report\">Gray’s slimmed-down report</a> is published.

But during his time as prime minister over the last 12 years he has cultivated warm relations with Putin, at the same time as his relations with Brussels have become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/07/eu-urged-suspend-funds-hungary-breaches-rule-of-law-viktor-orban\">ever more fractious.</a></p> <p>Nathalie Loiseau, the chair of the European parliament’s subcommittee on security and defence, said it was clear Putin was trying to divide Europe. “I sincerely hope that Viktor Orbán is aware of what is at stake, and that he sticks to the EU’s message of unity,” she said at a press conference late last week, according to Hungarian news outlets.</p> <p>The UK’s defence minister Ben Wallace struck a more positive note on a visit to Budapest on Monday, expressing support for Orbán’s trip. “We need to de-escalate this and stand up for the right for sovereignty of Ukraine,” Wallace said at a joint press conference with his Hungarian counterpart Tibor Benko.</p> <p>Péter Szijjártó, Hungary’s foreign minister, said last week the agenda for Orbán’s visit would include Hungarian gas purchases from Russia, production of Russia’s Sputnik Covid vaccine in Hungary and discussions on a long-delayed nuclear plant Russia is building in the country.</p> <p>While France and Germany have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/30/olaf-scholz-germany-ukraine-strategy-ghosts\">notably less hawkish</a> on Russia than the US and Britain, they have loudly condemned the Kremlin’s aggressive military manoeuvres. Orbán, on the other hand, has remained pointedly quiet about the military build-up on Ukraine’s borders, except to say he is “in favour of peace and de-escalation”, in a statement released after a gathering of European far-right leaders in Madrid over the weekend, hosted by Spains’s Vox party.</p> <p>Szijjártó has painted the current Ukraine stand-off as a dispute between Russia and the west in which Hungary wants to take no part, despite the fact that it is a Nato member. “Nobody can request such a thing from us,” Szijjártó told a pro-government newspaper, commenting on demands that Budapest should cool relations with Moscow.</p> <p>Hungary was the first European country to purchase Sputnik, which has not yet been licensed for use by the European Medicines Agency. Budapest has also regularly pushed back against closer cooperation between Ukraine and Nato, ostensibly over concerns about the treatment of the Hungarian minority in the country.</p> <p>In a sign of just how rosy the relationship is with the Kremlin, at a time when most European capitals describe relations as at a worrying low point, last November Putin awarded Szijjártó the Order of Friendship at a ceremony in Moscow.</p> <p>András Simonyi, a former Hungarian ambassador to the US who is now a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that previously there were many people in the Hungarian foreign ministry who were deeply suspicious of Orbán’s friendly behaviour towards Russia, but over the years this has changed, as critics were gradually replaced with loyalists.</p> <p>“Hungary does not have a foreign policy, Viktor Orbán has a foreign policy. Everyone in Orbán’s government is just a staffer, and this is especially true for foreign policy,” he said.</p> <p>Orbán’s recent support for the Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has also raised eyebrows across Europe, and has widely been seen as a favour to Russia. Dodik has in recent months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/29/bosnian-serb-leader-putin-and-china-will-help-if-west-imposes-sanctions\">intensified secessionist rhetoric</a> around the Republika Srpska entity inside Bosnia, to the alarm of much of the international community.</p> <p>Orbán flew to the Republika Srpska capital, Banja Luka, in November to meet Dodik, without stopping over in Sarajevo. He has promised to veto any EU sanctions against Dodik.</p> <p>“There isn’t any EU member state doing anything even slightly similar: it’s a systemic abandonment of the EU foreign policy alliance,” said Péter Krekó, who runs the Political Capital thinktank in Budapest.</p> <p>Alongside his clashes with Europe, Orbán also has poor relations with the Biden administration. Hungary was the only EU nation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/09/can-bidens-democracy-summit-deliver-china-russia-critics\">not invited to Biden’s recent democracy summit</a>.

Ahead of the visit, Johnson said: “It is the right of every Ukrainian to determine how they are governed. As a friend and a democratic partner, the UK will continue to uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty in the face of those who seek to destroy it.</p> <p>“We urge Russia to step back and engage in dialogue to find a diplomatic resolution and avoid further bloodshed.”</p> <p>Johnson’s efforts to take a leading role in the crisis were dealt a blow when he had to cancel his scheduled call with Putin so he could answer questions in the Commons about the Gray report into parties in Downing Street.</p> <p>No 10 tried to reschedule the call, but Moscow said it was not possible, leaving Johnson to say he would speak to the Russian president as soon as a time could be agreed.</p> <p>The Biden administration has drawn up a list of potential sanctions targets among Russian oligarchs and their families, who Washington deems to be in the Kremlin’s orbit or “complicit in the Kremlin’s destabilising behaviour,” according to a US official quoted by Reuters news agency.</p> <p>“Putin’s cronies will no longer be able to use their spouses or other family members as proxies to evade sanctions”, the official said. “Sanctions would cut them off from the international financial system and ensure that they and their family members will no longer be able to enjoy the perks of parking their money in the west and attending elite western universities.”</p> <p>US officials would not provide names, but said sanctions targets were vulnerable because of their investments and residencies in the west.</p> <p>Truss, giving a statement to MPs on Monday, also refused to name any individual Russians at risk of being sanctioned, saying the aim was to create the maximum anxiety among Putin’s allies.</p> <p>Truss said the new legislation, which will be in place by 10 February, would be the “toughest sanction regime against Russia we have ever had”, and would give the UK “the power to sanction a broader range of individuals and businesses”.</p> <p>She said the package meant the UK “can target anyone providing strategic support close to Vladimir Putin”.</p> <p>Labour criticised the package for failing to speed up the long-promised structural measures to tackle money laundering in the UK, including measures first announced by David Cameron in 2014 and 2015.</p> <p>David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “The proposals need to be part of a coherent policy.</p> <p>“For years, Labour has raised the alarm about the role of dirty money in keeping Putin in power. Warning after warning, report after report, the government has been asleep at the wheel. London is the destination of choice for the world’s kleptocrats. We are the home to the services and the enablers that help corrupt elites to hide their ill-gotten wealth.”</p> <p>Russia described the transatlantic measures as extremely alarming and likely to damage the business climate in the UK.</p> <p>The net of those potentially subject to sanctions in the UK is being widened in the event of an invasion by making Russians and companies supportive of Putin liable to travel bans and asset freezes. Previously, only individuals regarded as guilty of destabilising the sovereignty of Ukraine could be sanctioned, although the UK can and has sanctioned Russians for human rights abuses and corruption.</p> <p>Currently, 180 Russian individuals and 48 entities are subject to UK sanctions, more than half linked to the destabilisation of Ukraine.</p> <p>Truss, who is due in Moscow for talks in the next fortnight but will not be travelling to Ukraine this week after testing positive for Covid on Monday, told MPs the proposals meant the UK would be able to act in lockstep with the US. “Whether you support Russia’s aggressive actions against Ukraine, or you’re of wider significance to the Kremlin, we will have the power to sanction you,” she said. “Nothing is off the table and there will be nowhere to hide.</p> <p>“This will amount to the toughest sanctions regime against Russia we have had in place yet, and mark the biggest change in our approach since leaving the European Union.”</p> <p>The reference to nothing being off the table was designed to show that the government has not abandoned other structural measures. These include reforms of Companies House, a register of properties held by overseas citizens and a public register of beneficial ownership in the British overseas territories – measures that have been repeatedly promised but held back as a result of opposition from the City of London. Some of the stiffest opposition is coming from Gulf states and not Russia.</p> <p>An economic crime bill containing many of the measures looks likely to be delayed, a move that has infuriated the government’s own anti-corruption tsar, John Penrose. In the House of Lords on Monday, ministers were challenged about their personal links to firms operating in tax shelters.</p> <p>John Heathershaw, co-author of a recent Chatham House report on “Britain’s kleptocracy problem”, said: “The use of sanctions here appears to be as an ad hoc and preventive measure – essentially as a form of deterrence. The reason such measures are necessary is that there is already a great deal of money in the UK from Russia which has been welcomed by UK banks, estate agents, football clubs and companies with minimal checks on the sources of wealth and beneficial ownership. The problems that led to the UK welcoming suspicious Russian wealth are structural British problems.” </p> <p>Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described Truss’s package as an “extremely alarming” statement that “undermines investment attractiveness and the United Kingdom’s attractiveness as such”. “It’s not often you see or hear such direct threats to attack a business,” he told reporters.</p> <p>He added that Moscow would “proceed from its own interests when formulating retaliatory measures”. “An attack by one particular country on Russian business of course implies retaliatory measures,” he said.</p> <p>The Russian ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, stressed that the UK was now pursuing an “aggressive line” in Europe regarding Ukraine. He said the exaggeration of the “Russian threat” was being stoked by Britain’s domestic problems.</p> <p>Russia last week expanded its blacklist of EU and member states’ personnel on a no-fly list who Russia said “were personally involved in promoting anti-Russian policy”. </p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'politics/2022/jan/31/liz-truss-tests-positive-for-covid-after-speaking-in-packed-commons', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-01-31T21:22:55Z', 'webTitle': 'Liz Truss tests positive for Covid after speaking in packed Commons', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/liz-truss-tests-positive-for-covid-after-speaking-in-packed-commons', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jan/31/liz-truss-tests-positive-for-covid-after-speaking-in-packed-commons', 'fields': {'body': '<p>Liz Truss has tested positive for Covid, shortly after sitting in a packed House of Commons without wearing a mask.</p> <p>Writing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/trussliz/status/1488243196509495299\">on Twitter</a> on Monday evening, the foreign secretary said: “I tested positive for Covid this evening.

Meanwhile on Monday, Vladimir Putin talked to Emmanuel Macron in the second phone conversation between the Russian and French leaders since Friday.</p> <p>“The two leaders agreed to continue contacts by telephone and to promptly consider the possibility of meeting in person,” the Kremlin said in a statement.</p> <p>Monday’s security council session did nothing to narrow the wide divide between Russia and the west, but did provide a test of diplomatic strength on the world stage. Nebenzya began the meeting by deriding western claims of a planned Russian attack as “hysterics” and blamed Ukraine for not abiding by the Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which were supposed to end the conflict between the Kyiv government and the Russian-backed separatists in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.</p> <p>Nebenzya, Russia’s permanent representative at the UN, also blamed western nations for “actively pumping Ukraine full of weapons” which he said would be used against civilians in the east of the country and were “in violation of the Minsk agreements”.</p> <p>He ended his address to the security council with a warning.</p> <p>“If our western partners push Kyiv to sabotage the Minsk agreements, something that Ukraine is ... willingly doing, then that might end in the absolute worst way for Ukraine,” Nebenzya said. “And not because somebody has destroyed it, but because it would have destroyed itself and Russia has absolutely nothing to do with this.”</p> <p>The US had called for an emergency debate on Ukraine as part of a diplomatic campaign to fend off what Washington and its allies say is a planned Russian invasion of Ukraine. As part of that campaign, the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/liz-truss-vows-nowhere-to-hide-for-putin-allies-if-ukraine-invaded\"> US and the UK both announced</a> that pro-Putin Russian oligarchs would be targeted if an attack goes ahead.</p> <p>Russia had sought to stop a security council debate on Ukraine until after it took over the council presidency on Tuesday. But only China supported its opposition, with Gabon, India and Kenya abstaining, leaving the US with more than the nine votes required to proceed with an open session on the crisis.</p> <p>In her remarks, the US envoy, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said that even as the issue was being debated in New York, Russia continued to add to the more than 100,000 troops already massed around Ukraine’s borders, and within days would have 30,000 inside Belarus alone.</p> <p>“Russia has already used more than 2,000 rail cars to move troops and weaponry from across Russia to the Ukrainian border,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Russia has also moved nearly 5,000 troops into Belarus, with short-range ballistic missiles, special forces and anti-aircraft batteries. We’ve seen evidence that Russia intends to expand that presence to more than 30,000 troops near the Belarus-Ukraine border, less than two hours north of Kyiv, by early February.”</p> <p>Speaking towards the end of the session, the Ukrainian envoy, Sergiy Kyslytsya, described the Russian build-up of troops and military hardware around his country’s borders and did not echo President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s complaints that the West was exaggerating the threat.</p> <p>Kyslytsya said there were now 112,000 Russian troops massed around Ukraine’s borders and in Crimea, with another 18,000 deployed at sea off the country’s coast.</p> <p>He pointed to the sophistication of the weapons being gathered in Belarus, including Iskander missiles, Pantsir anti-aircraft systems and advanced Sukhoi-35 jet fighters.</p> <p>Kyslytsya also said Russia was bolstering paramilitary separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, which he estimated as 35,000-strong, including 3,000 Russian troops “in command posts and in other critical combat positions”.</p> <p>In naval exercises in the Black Sea which started last week, the Ukrainian envoy said the Russians had deployed frigates, missile ships, assault landing ships and minesweepers.</p> <p>Another six warships from Russia’s northern fleet were reported to have entered the Mediterranean on Monday. According to the Italian newspaper la Repubblica, the vessels are carrying 60 tanks and more than 1,500 soldiers.

First, Vladimir Putin wishes to reimpose Russian control over Ukraine, whatever the price. His political dream of restoring the Soviet sphere of influence is echoed in a wishlist of “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/russia-issues-list-demands-tensions-europe-ukraine-nato\">security guarantees</a>” presented to western governments by Russia in December 2021. Nato, he maintains, should return to the pre-1997 state of affairs; Russia, apparently, need not.</p> <p>Second, whatever Putin decides in the current crisis, there are real fears in central and eastern Europe that settled borders are now under threat. These fears are grounded in reason. What seemed unrealistic in the immediate post-cold war years is now again a real possibility. Questions about our collective safety and security have returned, along with memories of a traumatic and not so remote past.</p> <p>More precisely, we are talking about more than one fear. Central and eastern European angst is existential in nature. In the 1980s, the Czech-French writer Milan Kundera wrote that small nations are constantly anxious about their existence, because their independence is repeatedly questioned.</p> <p>As doubt is cast even over their presence on the map, they experience their sovereignty<strong> </strong>in a fragile, nervous way. The Russian military menace to Ukraine reawakens old traumas and, paradoxically, not only those generated from the east.</p> <p>Another angst is, to put it bluntly, that the west will again abandon us. Historical precedent for western inaction is used in the current discourse to support doing nothing. The Guardian columnist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/24/autonomy-eastern-ukraine-crisis-nato-russia-minsk\">Simon Jenkins, for example, noted,</a> as he argued against Nato military intervention in Ukraine, that the west “wisely” did not intervene in Hungary in 1956 or in Czechoslovakia in 1968.</p> <p>For central and eastern Europeans, drawing such parallels proves that the Russians are not the only ones who persist with framing today’s events in terms of the cold war.</p> <p>The Ukraine crisis can be interpreted profoundly differently depending on which side of the old iron curtain you sit. This difference of perspective provokes its own misinterpretations and distrust. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/uk-pulls-some-embassy-staff-from-ukraine-amid-russian-threat\">evacuation of embassy staff</a> from Kyiv may be understood as a “prudent precautionary measure” from the UK perspective; but for people in central and eastern Europe, it can have quite a different meaning.</p> <p>It suggests a readiness to withdraw that reawakens for us the trauma of being forced to be a part of the Soviet bloc. The instability of US foreign policy in recent years is another source of anxiety for central and eastern European countries, not least because the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan has forced many US allies to reconsider their strategic security priorities. </p> <p>But why should one listen to eastern Europeans’ anxieties, anyway, especially given the ambiguity their governments demonstrate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/brussels-launches-legal-action-over-polish-rulings-against-eu-law\">towards the EU</a> and the rule of law?</p> <p>It is worth remembering that the governments of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/24/revolt-against-liberalism-eastern-europe-poland-hungary-nativist-politics\">Poland and Hungary</a> have electoral legitimacy but don’t fully represent their polarised societies, not to mention the entire region.</p> <p>Yet, in Warsaw, Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn, the mood is full of anxiety. Nervous questions are asked: are western governments reliable allies? Why not defend Ukraine with full conviction? Why not rethink the geopolitical context of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/nord-stream-2-how-putins-pipeline-paralysed-the-west\">Nord Stream 2</a> pipeline if upholding “European” values means anything?</p> <p>Many citizens of central and eastern Europe have clear memories of living under Moscow’s rule. For them, 30 years of independence is not long enough to banish the worry that we are trapped in a cycle of ever-repeating history.</p> <p>A cold war framing of the Ukraine crisis undermines, imperceptibly perhaps, democratic legitimacy in the whole region. Thinking in terms of spheres of influence takes us back to a time when the Soviet Union’s satellite countries were unable to freely decide which military alliance or political regime they aspired to belong to.</p> <p>What should be remembered today is that, during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/04/ukraine-crisis-protesters-kiev-euromaidan-independence-square\">Euromaidan</a> crisis in 2013 and 2014, there were Ukrainians ready to sacrifice their lives to join Europe. The EU and Nato were founded to prevent history from repeating itself: if the west is really committed to democratic values, it should defend Ukraine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/us-troops-eastern-europe-joe-biden\">US to heighten troop presence in eastern Europe, says Biden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Western countries should not accept a return to the outdated logic of spheres of influence.

Further geopolitical instability would affect central and eastern Europe militarily, economically and in terms of migration. There is also a risk that this geopolitical distress could reinforce the region’s turn towards nationalism. Fear, as Cardinal de Retz famously remarked, is the passion that weakens judgment most.

As a friend and a democratic partner, the UK will continue to uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty in the face of those who seek to destroy it.</p> <p>“We urge Russia to step back and engage in dialogue to find a diplomatic resolution and avoid further bloodshed.”</p> <p>The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is in discussions with Nato about what further British military support can be offered to support the bloc’s eastern flank. He visited Hungary on Monday, one of the countries in the European Union closest to Putin. Its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, was due to meet the Russian president on Tuesday and Hungary has so far ruled out the deployment of more Nato troops inside its country and appeared lukewarm about imposing further sanctions on Russia. </p> <p>Johnson is due to meet Zelenskiy at the president’s official residence, the impressive neo-classical turquoise Mariinsky palace in Kyiv, overlooking the Dnipro River and next to Ukraine’s parliament.</p> <p>They are scheduled to have a joint press conference at 7pm local time (5pm GMT).</p> <p>The meeting takes place amid differences between the US and UK and Zelenskiy’s government over the nature of the Russian military threat. According to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/focused-russian-attack-on-ukraine-seen-as-more-likely-than-full-scale-invasion\">latest Ukrainian estimates</a>, the Kremlin has assembled 135,000 troops on the border, up 8-10,000 from last week.</p> <p>The Kremlin has said it will hold military exercises in Belarus, beginning 10 February, featuring tactical battalions and heavy weaponry within striking distance of Kyiv. The Biden administration has said it is “distinctly possible” a Russian invasion is imminent.</p> <p>Zelenskiy, however, has dismissed this scenario. He points out his country has been at war with Moscow since 2014, with low-intensity fighting taking place every day in the Donbas region between the Ukrainian army and Russian-backed separatists.</p> <p>Speaking on Friday, Zelenskiy said invasion panic was “unbalanced and unreasonable”. It had damaged the Ukrainian economy, with investor confidence and the national currency badly hit, he said. Referring to the UK’s withdrawal of diplomats from Kyiv, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/ukraine-plays-down-threat-of-russian-invasion-volodymyr-zelenskiy\">told the Guardian</a>: “The captains should not leave the ship. I don’t think we have a Titanic here.” </p> <p>Ukrainian officials agree that Putin can order an invasion at any time. But they see the Kremlin’s menacing troop build up as part of a long-scale destabilisation plan, which may yet see Moscow step back from the brink, only to escalate again in the autumn.</p> <p>The Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oleksiireznikov/status/1483180645283151874\">welcomed Downing Street’s delivery of anti-tank weapons </a>and a $1.7bn (£1.26bn) agreement with London <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oleksiireznikov/status/1486743706824847360\">to refit the Ukrainian navy.</a> The weapons arrived in Kyiv last week by military transport.</p> <p>The shoulder-fired system, known as NLAW, has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CZEuE1foUQX/\">even become a popular meme</a>.</p> <p>One Kyiv blogger, Alexs Joda, posted an image on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CZEuE1foUQX/\">Instagram of the weapon with the union flag, the Beatles and the words: “All you need is NLAW”.</a> Others have <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/radzivilyuk/posts/10224327188320557\">thanked “the British people”</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/01/boris-johnson-pressure-publish-gray-report-raab\">Boris Johnson under fresh pressure to publish full Gray report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We don’t care about the Downing Street parties.

He’s trying to confront Putin. That’s what makes him a great leader.

To see such pressures being exerted on a state that has resolutely set itself on a path to integration with the liberal democratic order is unspeakable. Like any European country, Ukraine must be free to organise its governance and security alliances as it sees fit.</p> <p>A Europe split into 19th-century “spheres of influence” is not one in which small independent countries would prosper. The wealthier and more equal the nations of Europe become, the more equitable the relations between them should be. Indeed, the great steps that the likes of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have taken in the past 30 years are testament to the invigorating effects of independence in Europe.</p> <p>However, my agreement with the prime minister on these principles did not last long: question after question from the floor of the House of Commons brought him back to the issue of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/17/party-donations-british-politics-funding-pandora-amendments-elections-bill\">Russian funding in the Conservative party</a>, and the continuing existence of “Londongrad”-style influence operations in the UK. Meanwhile, as long as the fortunes of Russia’s elites are based abroad, threats of economic sanctions are limp and ineffective.</p> <p>It has been two and a half years since the publication of <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmfaff/932/932.pdf\">parliament’s “Russia report”</a>, which laid bare the extent of links between the Kremlin and Russian-backed financial interests – and the resulting endless flows of illicit cash through the City of London. The UK’s allies are beginning to take note of the intractability of the problem. A report from the Center for American Progress – a thinktank close to the Biden administration – stated last week that “uprooting Kremlin-linked oligarchs will be a challenge given the close ties between Russian money and the United Kingdom’s ruling Conservative party, the press, and its real estate and financial industry”.</p> <p>After all, clear mechanisms to crack down on these practices exist. My government has long called for Westminster to legislate on the improper use of <a href=\"https://www.transparency.org.uk/tackling-abuse-scottish-limited-partnerships-needs-uk-wide-money-laundering-reform\">Scottish limited partnerships</a> – just one favourite instrument of financial exploitation – to ensure that they are no longer used to facilitate the sort of financial corruption that has benefited authoritarians and their wealthy cronies for far too long.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/us-to-target-putins-inner-circle-with-sanctions-in-event-of-ukraine-invasion\">US to target Putin’s inner circle with sanctions in event of Ukraine invasion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Corruption and lack of transparency are a drag on liberal democracy, and authoritarians have become adept at using these scandals as a way of saying to people ground down by them that all forms of government are the same, and all politicians are as bad as each other.</p> <p>And so I can only call on the prime minister to finally take action. He must recognise that his government and his party have enabled this situation, and he must acknowledge that the most resolute action he can take is at home, to rebuild his government’s tattered reputation. To quote the author and journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/oliverbullough\">Oliver Bullough</a> from his book, Moneyland, which documented so much about the London “laundromat”: “Without trust, liberal democracy cannot function.” And as Bullough wrote more recently about the situation in Ukraine: “No one is more to blame than us for the fact that Russia’s richest can treat war like a spectator sport.”</p> <p>And while during such periods the temptation is to focus on individuals in power, this can lead us to forget the role of the competing factions within the Russian security state and the pressures they are exerting on the situation, and it may lead some to forget the pressure this is putting on 40 million Ukrainians – our fellow European citizens – as they go about their daily lives.</p> <p>In some ways, this is a reality many have been dealing with since 2014, especially those in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine. As we deal with the effects of our own cost of living crisis, with a spike in food and energy prices, it is worth remembering that Ukrainians have been facing this for some time, and as a direct consequence of the Russian government’s actions.</p> <p>So while Ukrainians must and will defend themselves from aggression if attempts at diplomacy fail, we cannot be blind to the circumstances that have led to the current crisis, and that includes the situation where wealth with direct links to the Putin regime has been allowed to proliferate here in the UK with often the scantest regard paid to its provenance or to the influence it seeks to exert on our democracy.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nicola Sturgeon is first minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National party</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/opinion', 'pillarName': 'Opinion'}, {'id': 'world/2022/feb/01/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-would-be-a-disaster-says-boris-johnson-in-kyiv', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-02-01T19:18:53Z', 'webTitle': 'Russian invasion of Ukraine would be a disaster, says Boris Johnson in Kyiv', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/01/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-would-be-a-disaster-says-boris-johnson-in-kyiv', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/feb/01/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-would-be-a-disaster-says-boris-johnson-in-kyiv', 'fields': {'body': '<p>A Russian invasion of Ukraine would end in a humanitarian, political and military disaster for Russia and the world, Boris Johnson has warned as he stood alongside the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv, saying the UK would be judged by the level of help it gave to Ukraine.</p> \\n<p>On a flying visit to the Ukrainian capital, he denied the US and the UK were exaggerating the scale of the Russian threat, saying they were not trying to “big up” the intelligence. “The grim reality” was that Russian troops were “massing on Ukraine’s border.

Joe Biden has said that he believes Putin has not decided whether or not to launch an attack but that he expects that he will “move in”.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, spoke with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in an effort to defuse the crisis earlier on Tuesday.</p> <p>“If Putin doesn’t intend war or regime change, this is the time to pull back,” Blinken told Lavrov, according to a senior state department official.</p> <p>“The sense here is still that we don’t know that Putin has made a decision about what he’s going to do. So until President Putin makes that decision, we need to continue to prepare for these different outcomes,” the official told reporters.</p> <p>The state department spokesperson, Ned Price, said that the next step in the diplomatic exchange between Washington and Moscow would be a formal Russian response to a US “non-paper” setting out US positions on European security.</p> <p>“When President Putin has had a chance to review it and approve it, it will be coming to the United States,” Price said. “We understand that once that takes place, the Russians too are willing to engage in continued dialogue.”</p> <p>Price insisted the US “non-paper” did not ignore Russian concerns.</p> <p>“It did address the points that have been raised by the Russian Federation. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the Russians will agree with the way in which they were addressed,” he said. He repeated the US and Nato position that the inviolability of borders and the sovereign right of Ukraine and other countries to decide on their own national security arrangements were “non-starters”.</p> <p>On those issues, he added “there is no trade space”.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Putin railed against deliveries of lethal aid to Ukraine, saying he believed that the country was being “packed full of weapons”.</p> <p>Earlier, Poland announced it would provide shells, mortars and surface-to-air missiles that would boost Ukraine’s defence against low-flying attack aircraft. The US, Britain and other European countries have stepped up deliveries of anti-tank weapons, ammunition and other military aid to Ukraine to ward off a potential invasion.</p> <p>The Russian leader imagined a situation where Ukraine joined Nato and then sought to retake Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. “That’s sovereign Russian territory,” Putin said. “So now we have to start a war against the Nato alliance?”</p> <p>“Did anyone think about this?” he asked hypothetically. “I don’t think so.”</p> <p>“In this sense, Ukraine itself is just an instrument to achieve this goal,” he said. “This can be done in different ways, by drawing us into some kind of armed conflict.”</p> <p>He rejected US arguments that every country has the right to choose their own alliances, saying that one state must not be allowed to increase its security to the detriment of another state, namely Russia.</p> <p>On Tuesday evening, Putin said that the US had not given “adequate consideration” of Russia’s “three key demands”, including a halt to Nato expansion, a refusal to place missile systems on Russia’s borders and remove Nato troops and infrastructure from central and east European countries that joined the alliance after 1997.</p> <p>The Kremlin is putting together a response to a formal statement of the US position, which would have to be approved by Putin before being delivered to the state department, US officials said.</p> <p>During a telephone call on Tuesday, Blinken told Lavrov that the US was ready for a “substantive exchange with Russia on mutual security concerns” but demanded an “immediate Russian de-escalation and the withdrawal of troops and equipment from Ukraine’s borders”. He also threatened “swift and severe consequences” if Russia launched a “further invasion of Ukraine”.</p> <p>According to the Russian foreign ministry, Lavrov told Blinken that “instead of escalating aggressive rhetoric and pumping up the Ukrainian armed forces with various types of weapons, to use US influence on the Ukrainian authorities to force them to fully implement the Minsk agreements,” a 2015 peace agreement that appears close to collapse.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, US officials said that the Russians appeared to be prepared to consider the US offer for negotiations on confidence-building measures such as limits on missile deployments and military exercises. “They did agree that the ideas on both sides that have been exchanged formed the basis for serious discussion,” one official said. “Why else would they continue to have this engagement?”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-01/u-s-dangles-offer-to-russia-on-missile-checks-at-key-bases?srnd=premium&amp;sref=fqqmZ8gi\">Bloomberg News reported</a> on Tuesday that one of the US offers was to allow Russians to verify there are no offensive missiles such as Tomahawks at Nato missile defence bases in Poland and Romania.

It would be applicable to any company (and its owners) with ties to the Russian state and of economic significance to it – extending well beyond the existing sanctions regime, which covers only those linked to the destabilisation of Ukraine.</p> <p>The Kremlin says that it does not want war, but with more than 100,000 troops near the borders of Ukraine, and more arriving in Belarus, fear is growing of a major land offensive or – as Kyiv suspects – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/30/analysis-ukraine-russia-vladimir-putin-uk-us-intelligence\" title=\"\">longer-term destabilisation</a> and a continuing hybrid assault using cyber-attacks, sabotage and other means. While diplomacy continues, there is no sign of progress. Vladimir Putin says that Russia’s proposals have been ignored. The US succeeded in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/russia-ukraine-united-nations-security-council\" title=\"\">forcing a UN security council debate</a>, with Moscow responding by warning that Ukraine may “destroy itself” if it undermines existing peace agreements. On Tuesday, Boris Johnson flew to Kyiv to show support, Monday’s attempt to play international statesman having been hobbled when he had to cancel a phone call with the Russian president to address MPs about the Sue Gray report. Standing next to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, he warned that a Russian invasion would be a disaster.</p> <p>These matters could hardly be more serious. Yet Ms Truss’s ringing declaration that the UK would get tough on Russian money earned laughter from MPs. “Londongrad” is notorious as a destination and conduit for the assets of the super-rich around Mr Putin, to the frustration of the US and others. The Center for American Progress <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/how-the-united-states-should-respond-if-russia-invades-ukraine/\" title=\"\">warned</a> last week that “uprooting Kremlin-linked oligarchs will be a challenge, given the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/17/labour-challenges-tories-over-checks-on-russia-linked-donations\" title=\"\">close ties</a> between Russian money and the United Kingdom’s ruling Conservative party, the press, and its real estate and financial industry”.</p> <p>Writing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/01/nicola-sturgeon-johnson-tackle-russian-oligarchs-influence-uk\" title=\"\">in the Guardian</a>, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, warned that government inaction on Russian wealth had contributed to Mr Putin’s sense of impunity. Even after the Salisbury poisoning, when the rhetoric sharpened, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/dec/08/uks-anti-money-laundering-measures-need-complete-reset-says-report\" title=\"\">little changed in reality</a>. There is increasing anger, including among Conservatives, that there is still no sign of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/26/ministers-criticised-for-not-tackling-londons-reputation-as-money-laundering-hub\" title=\"\">economic crime bill</a>, which would include long-promised measures such as reform of Companies House, a register of properties held by overseas citizens and a public register of beneficial ownership in the British overseas territories. All these are necessary and desirable, and not only with regard to Russia.</p> <p>Legislation, however, is not enough. Unexplained wealth orders have proved much harder to use than had been hoped. It is unclear how widely or well new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/apr/26/uk-imposes-sanctions-on-russians-anti-corruption-regulations\" title=\"\">anti-corruption regulations</a> will be used when there seems to be so little interest in a clean-up at senior political levels. Still less is it clear that targeting Russian money will help protect Ukraine. The optimistic take is that it at least gives those around Mr Putin an incentive to encourage moderation. But London is not the only destination for Russian cash, however convenient and attractive, and Mr Putin is unlikely to feel bound by the priorities of oligarchs who have prospered richly from his reign. The real reason to crack down on tainted money from Moscow and elsewhere is because it is the right thing to do – and should have been done long ago.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/opinion', 'pillarName': 'Opinion'}, {'id': 'politics/2022/feb/02/ukraine-crisis-a-test-that-britain-and-johnson-dare-not-fail', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-02-02T06:00:16Z', 'webTitle': 'Ukraine crisis a test that Britain – and Johnson – dare not fail', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/ukraine-crisis-a-test-that-britain-and-johnson-dare-not-fail', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/feb/02/ukraine-crisis-a-test-that-britain-and-johnson-dare-not-fail', 'fields': {'body': '<p>The Russian threat to Ukraine may be the first major foreign policy crisis since Brexit in which the UK can play to its strengths, and show that Britain with its military muscle is not turning into the global irrelevance that many had predicted. That at least is the hope in parts of Whitehall.</p> <p>The two other big post-Brexit foreign policy moments – the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the announcement of the Aukus security partnership in the Indo-Pacific – did not exactly see Britain in the cockpit in the same way. The UK departed from Afghanistan under US duress and then executed that withdrawal so chaotically that it cost Dominic Raab his foreign secretaryship. Aukus was largely a US-Australian deal, even if puts the UK in a potentially leading role in the Indo-Pacific in future.</p> <p>But the Ukraine crisis is a different test, and one that the UK’s extensive diplomatic network dare not fail if it is to prove that outside the EU bloc, the UK has acquired a new foreign policy agility.</p> <p>At a personal level, Boris Johnson also hopes Ukraine will be his <em>deus ex machina</em>, a moment to prove to his sceptical backbenchers that he can show statesmanship and, more cynically, to shame the media into ending its “trivial obsessions” with “partygate”. As a result many of the recent Downing Street briefings prepared for the Sunday papers have had a somewhat desperate quality to them, portraying Johnson as being at the centre of grave, fast-moving world events.</p> <p>This contrasts with the harsher reality of scheduled calls to Vladimir Putin being cancelled because Johnson was detained by MPs asking him if they were fools to have complied with the Covid rules that he had set.</p> <p>The Russian president was never likely to see Johnson as an important interlocutor in the same league as the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Putin can also detect weakness in his opponents, and as soon as he sees a man is down, his first instinct is to kick as hard as he can. The call has now been rescheduled, but it is an embarrassing episode.</p> <p>It was also a bad stroke of luck that Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, was struck by Covid just before she headed on a diplomatic tour of eastern Europe.</p> <p>But that is not the whole picture or a fair description of how active the UK has been throughout the crisis.</p> <p>Britain has a clear-eyed sense of the issues at stake – the defence of the security architecture stuck in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, all set out in the widely praised article by the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, debunking Putin’s claims about Ukraine’s historic origins.</p> <p>The UK also has a deep, long-standing military connection with Ukraine – confirmed last year in a new strategic partnership upon which it is now building through the provision of next generation anti-tank weapons. Through Chatham House there has been a steady flow of exchanges with Ukraine’s leading figures, covering energy, civil society and banking, going back a decade.</p> <p>The UK now hopes that military alliance with Ukraine can be extended by drawing in another close British ally, Poland – an idea enthusiastically endorsed by the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. It may even prove to be a way of drawing Ukraine closer to an informal security alliance with Nato partners without actually joining Nato itself – something which is off the table for the foreseeable future anyway. It would represent a balance to the Weimar Triangle, the much older alliance between Germany, France and Poland. All that helps to make Johnson a priority in Kyiv as European premiers jostle to fly into Ukraine.</p> <p>But there is a bigger prize for the UK. If it plays its cards right, It can re-establish itself as the undisputed No 1 ally of the US.</p> <p>UK intelligence services are working in lockstep with Washington, for instance over claims of a Russian inspired coup. Some reports suggest the US handed the UK the intelligence evidence to allow Truss to unmask the alleged plotters. Equally, British and US assessment of the high likelihood of an invasion is largely pitched at the same level. Britain’s leading cyber-experts have been flying to Washington to discuss what counter-measures can be prepared.</p> <p>Johnson has not been averse to reminding Washington of the UK’s reliability by chastising his former EU rivals France and Germany. Doubtless echoing what his diplomats were hearing in Washington, Johnson has warned Macron not to seek to exploit the crisis to promote his project of European strategic autonomy.</p> <p>Germany, he and Truss now repeatedly say, is too dependent on Russian gas, an analysis shared on a bipartisan basis by many in the US Congress.</p> <p>For a variety of historic and geographical reasons Germany was always going to end up the outlier in this crisis, but none of this is helped by a new coalition government still bedding in. It has even led the UK Foreign Office to lobby Washington to ask for an expansion of the Normandy format, from which the UK and the US are currently excluded. As the key forum in which the status of eastern Ukraine is discussed with Russia, Britain deeply regrets its self-exclusion.</p> <p>Above all, UK diplomats, along with the Ministry of Defence are trying to make themselves useful by using its influence in its network of former allies inside the EU, including in the Baltic states and eastern Europe.</p> <p>The Baltic states need no persuading about the Russian threat, and are privately, and sometimes in public, frustrated with Germany’s refusal to let them give Ukraine weaponry of German origin. More UK troops will go to Estonia if Nato requests.</p> <p>But Wallace is also putting in the air miles touring the EU countries where the UK message on the Russian threat faces a tougher reception: Slovakia, Hungary and Croatia.</p> <p>On Monday, Wallace – currently top of a cabinet league table monthly members’ poll on the ConservativeHome website – made little progress in Budapest with the Hungarian defence secretary who, at a joint press conference, said he opposed sanctions on Russia or more Nato troops in his country. On Tuesday, Wallace popped up in Croatia. Johnson has also been on the phone to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey, a Nato member and potential wild card.</p> <p>There is of course one problem with all this frenetic activity and with the policy towards Moscow: Britain’s lax approach to Russian oligarchs based in the UK. It is now out there as a drag anchor on everything the UK seeks to do internationally about Russia.</p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, was correct on Monday when he said that report and after report has been published highlighting this problem, and yet the government has refused to act. None of the measures announced this week by the Foreign Office will be implemented unless an invasion occurs, so the basic problem remains untouched. With Joe Biden making the fight against corruption one of his big themes, it was inevitable that Washington was going to lose patience with the UK’s sloth.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/feb/02/kremlin-call-boris-johnson-ukraine-diplomacy-effort-utterly-confused-protect-russian-invasion', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-02-02T12:47:21Z', 'webTitle': 'Kremlin calls Boris Johnson’s Ukraine diplomacy efforts ‘utterly confused’', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/kremlin-call-boris-johnson-ukraine-diplomacy-effort-utterly-confused-protect-russian-invasion', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/feb/02/kremlin-call-boris-johnson-ukraine-diplomacy-effort-utterly-confused-protect-russian-invasion', 'fields': {'body': '<p>The Kremlin moved to belittle Boris Johnson on Wednesday, describing him as “utterly confused” and calling British diplomacy a waste of time.</p> \\n<p>The concerted effort to ridicule Britain’s efforts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/01/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-would-be-a-disaster-says-boris-johnson-in-kyiv\">put itself at the helm</a> of the fight to protect Ukraine came the day after the UK prime minister flew to Kyiv to warn that a Russian invasion would be a humanitarian, political and military disaster for Moscow.</p> \\n<p>British efforts to arrange a phone call between Johnson and Vladimir Putin were put in flux after a previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/01/boris-johnson-rebuffed-in-bid-to-play-key-role-in-ukraine-diplomacy\">scheduled call on Monday had to be cancelled</a> by the British because Johnson had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/jan/31/uk-politics-live-omicron-nhs-workers-coronavirus-vaccines-no-10-sue-gray-report\">answer questions from MPs</a> about alleged Covid rule-breaking parties in Downing Street.</p> \\n<p>The Kremlin said on Wednesday it would provide details if and when Putin spoke to Johnson by phone, and Putin was ready to talk to anyone, including the “utterly confused”.

Is he only bluffing to win concessions, or does he really plan to launch an attack?</p> <p>Trying to answer that question, US and Ukrainian officials have weighed all the evidence and come up with the same answer: maybe.</p> <p>But Washington and Kyiv have chosen to accent that “maybe” in different ways.</p> <p>For the US, the prospect of possible conflict has been a chance to rally reluctant allies, particularly France and Germany, to make genuine commitments to Ukraine’s security.</p> <p>“Within the US government, there is a tendency to be a little bit coming down on the side of more alarm,” said Steven Pifer, a former US ambassador to Ukraine who was part of a delegation of former US ambassadors and military generals that travelled to Kyiv earlier this week.</p> <p>“The US is trying to martial allies and partners in Europe to do what they can to indicate to the Kremlin that the cost of an attack on Ukraine will be very significant … the goal here is to maximise pressure on the Kremlin,” said Pifer, speaking at a roundtable event in Kyiv.</p> <p>For Zelenskiy’s team, long-requested supplies of defensive weapons from Britain, the US and other countries are very welcome, as are numerous high-level visits to Kyiv and declarations of support. But the president fears that the repeated talk of an imminent war risks scaring off investors and adding to a sense of panic that will push the struggling Ukrainian economy to breaking point.</p> <p>“The weapons are very helpful, but we can’t feed weapons to our pensioners. If everyone thinks there will be war tomorrow, the economy will be in real trouble,” said a high-ranking government official.</p> <p>One factor which has particularly irked the Ukrainians is the decision by the US and Britain to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/uk-pulls-some-embassy-staff-from-ukraine-amid-russian-threat\">remove some non-essential staff and dependents</a> from their embassies and advise their citizens to leave the country.</p> <p>Images of the chaotic evacuation of Kabul after the city fell to the Taliban were lurking in the minds of decision makers as they pulled out staff, said a diplomatic source.

In one example, he said Nato asks Russia to withdraw forces from Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, “where Moscow either doesn’t accept it has troops or believes they are on steady legal grounds”.</p> <p>He said that the US non-paper did suggest some new areas for discussion, like the mutual non-deployment of offensive missiles and permanent forces in Ukraine.</p> <p>“This will find approval in Moscow,” Baklitsky said. He added that the US proposal also “leaves open the possibility that there could be some agreement on strategic bombers not flying too close to each other[’s] territory.”</p> <p>The US and Nato proposals avoid any discussion of Russia’s controversial demands of a Nato withdrawal from eastern Europe and a pledge never to consider Ukraine’s membership in the security alliance.</p> <p>“The United States is willing to discuss conditions-based reciprocal transparency measures and reciprocal commitments by both the United States and Russia to refrain from deploying offensive ground-launched missile systems and permanent forces with a combat mission in the territory of Ukraine,” the document read, according to a leaked version in the Spanish newspaper, El País, confirmed as authentic by the Pentagon. </p> <p>The document suggested confidence-building measures on military exercises and arms control in Europe, as well as deconfliction efforts to avoid an accidental military clash.</p> <p>It also carried careful demands for the Russian side to draw down its forces near Ukraine. Russia has moved more than an estimated 125,000 troops within striking distance of the Ukrainian border, including nearly half of its available battalion tactical groups and support units.</p> <p>“Further Russian increases to force posture or further aggression against Ukraine will force the United States and our allies to strengthen our defensive posture,” the document also read, adding that progress could only be achieved in an “environment of de-escalation”.</p> <p>Russia is still preparing a formal response to the western proposals.

One of Erdoğan’s sons-in-law has a stake in the private sector firm that produces the drones.</p> <p>Iliya Kuva from the Ukrainian Institute of the Future said: “The drones have a pretty huge psychological and political impact on Ukrainian public opinion since Turkey is seen as the country that provides weapons that are modern and good enough to maintain a military balance with Russian forces in the east.”</p> <p>The offer of drones was part of a wider broadening of ties between the two countries including a long-negotiated free-trade deal.</p> <p>On the other hand, Ukrainian politicians have been angered by TurkStream, a gas pipeline inaugurated in 2020. The pipeline takes gas from Russia to Turkey via the Black Sea in a manner that weakens Ukraine’s role as a transit country for Russian gas, in the same way that Nord Stream 2 will if Germany declares it has passed regulatory hurdles.</p> <p>In a bid to reassure Moscow before Erdoğan’s visit, the Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, stressed Ankara’s commitment to the 1936 Montreux Convention, the treaty that strictly restricts Nato forces’ access to the Black Sea through the Bosphorus.</p> <p>The convention regulates maritime traffic through Turkey’s Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits – the link between the Mediterranean and Black seas.<br>Its status is not academic in the event of a conflict.

Turkey’s turbulent relations with Moscow in Libya and Syria show two countries often in direct conflict but not eager to see relations break down, let alone spill into direct military action.</p> <p>Turkey has been supportive of the Tatar community in Russian-occupied Crimea, but did not join sanctions against Russia in the wake of the 2014 invasion. Turkic Muslim Tatars were a majority until Stalin forced them out and millions resettled in Turkey.

Earlier this week, the state news agency Xinhua in a long article <a href=\"http://www.qstheory.cn/qshyjx/2022-02/02/c_1128322873.htm\">extolled the friendship</a> between the two countries.</p> <p>“China-Russia leaders’ ‘Winter Olympics appointment’ opens a new chapter in the bilateral relations,” the headline declared. The article has since been republished by other major state-owned websites in the last few days.</p> <p>The Xi-Putin meeting will be closely watched in Washington as well as other major western capitals. Inevitably, according to analysts, the issue of Ukraine will loom large. In 2014, in a show of defiance against fierce western criticism over the annexation of Crimea, Putin turned to Xi to look for an alternative. Beijing showed its support by signing a $400bn, 30-year gas deal.</p> <p>As the crisis in Ukraine brews, Russia is once again facing international pressure and is seeking foreign allies in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/30/analysis-ukraine-russia-vladimir-putin-uk-us-intelligence\">standoff with the west</a>. In the current situation, Russia “needs China much more than the other way around”, said Alexander Gabuev, the chair of the Russia in the Asia-Pacific Program at the Carnegie Moscow Centre, during a roundtable discussion on Wednesday.</p> <p>Describing the mood in Moscow, Gabuev said: “China is very pragmatic and has a lot of leverage … China’s bargaining position is strengthened day by day, so it’s better to sign a deal with China now rather than tomorrow.”</p> <p>Putin will enter the meeting with Xi looking to do just that. The Kremlin is embarking on the rare foreign visit with a docket of 15 contracts and agreements it wants to sign with the Chinese leadership, including a joint statement that will “reflect the common views of Russia and China on key global issues, including security issues”.</p> <p>It appears the Kremlin will seek formal Chinese support in its conflict with Nato countries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93f55dd08375b45d9f9493fed56c785cfb6faf8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93f55dd08375b45d9f9493fed56c785cfb6faf8b/0_172_5153_3092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Putin in a videoconference with Xi Jinping in December\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Putin in a videoconference with Xi Jinping in December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikhail Metzel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Beijing supports Russia’s demands on security guarantees, China shares the stance that security of one country cannot be ensured by means of damaging another country’s security,” said the Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, adding they were calling for the “creation of efficient mechanisms of ensuring security in Europe through negotiations”.</p> <p>In an article published in the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Putin also noted joint efforts to expand payments in national currencies and create “mechanisms to offset the negative impact of unilateral sanctions”. US lawmakers have threatened to impose the “mother of all sanctions” if Russia launches a new invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>Putin will be accompanied by a handful of top diplomatic and energy officials, including his foreign and energy ministers and the Rosneft chief executive, Igor Sechin. That indicates that economic and energy cooperation are likely to be a focus of the talks on Friday.</p> <p>Ushakov said the two sides would also discuss plans for the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, which would allow Russia to redirect gas away from Europe via its controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/nord-stream-2-how-putins-pipeline-paralysed-the-west\">Nord Stream 2 pipeline</a> and sell it instead on the Chinese market. However, even if the two sides do strike an agreement, the pipeline would take years to build.</p> <p>The summit will mark Putin’s third trip abroad since the outbreak of coronavirus in late 2019. The two leaders are expected to hold talks on the morning of 4 February and then have a private lunch that “will help them have a maximally open discussion about the most important international and bilateral issues”, Ushakov said.</p> <p>Last month, Beijing announced that the bilateral trade between China and Russia reached nearly $147bn last year – more than twice the figure of $68bn back in 2015 after western sanctions. Last week, senior diplomats from both countries agreed to step up coordination on Asian affairs, in the latest move that signalled even closer ties amid western pressures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea8ba0ed4ee4006c8a17e67f8951fdd4c301ca10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea8ba0ed4ee4006c8a17e67f8951fdd4c301ca10/0_0_8048_4831/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A map shows the course of Nord Stream 2 on the exterior of a building close to the receiving station for the pipeline near Lubmin, Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A map shows the course of Nord Stream 2 on the exterior of a building close to the receiving station for the pipeline near Lubmin, Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Both Xi and Putin will underscore (yet again) that their relationship is the best it’s been in history and that the two countries continue to deepen strategic and economic ties, with the subtext being that no amount of US-led efforts to derail their leadership or strategic interests will succeed,” said Shullman.</p> <p>Prof Sharyl Cross, the director of the Kozmetsky Center at St Edward’s University in Austin, Texas, agreed. “The two leaders will emphasise their burgeoning bilateral security and economic ties and common perspectives on a range of global security issues presenting a challenge to American global influence and the liberal international order,” she said, adding that Xi and Putin were likely to also include discussion of the role of Nato in Europe.</p> <p>Cross said both Moscow and Beijing would stand to benefit from division among democratic nations and the transatlantic security alliance in responding to the Ukraine conflict. “The United States and its allies should be thinking about how to avoid driving these two major powers closer and ways simultaneous challenges on the part of both Russia and China in different regions (Europe and Asia) might be managed,” she said.</p> <p>But Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, downplayed the significance of the forthcoming meeting. He said he did not expect anything new to come out of it.</p> <p>“China has said what it has said about recent events. Beijing’s statements can be seen as very much pro-Russia, but with some major reservations,” he said. “For example, China has never committed to any military involvement in case of a war. And likewise, despite Putin’s previous support for Beijing’s position on Taiwan, he had never committed to be involved militarily in case of a major conflict [between China and the US], either.”</p> <p>For Shi, the type of foreign dignitaries that descended in Beijing this week is, instead, more telling about the current state of affairs on the eve of the 50th anniversary of Nixon’s visit to Beijing. These leaders range from Putin to Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, to the president of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.</p> <p>“From those who diplomatically boycotted the Winter Games and those who came to Beijing, we can see some indication that the world is indeed heading towards the direction of bi-polarisation.”</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/feb/03/why-does-russia-focus-on-indivisible-security-in-ukraine-standoff', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-02-03T15:03:22Z', 'webTitle': 'Why does Russia focus on ‘indivisible security’ in Ukraine standoff?', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/why-does-russia-focus-on-indivisible-security-in-ukraine-standoff', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/feb/03/why-does-russia-focus-on-indivisible-security-in-ukraine-standoff', 'fields': {'body': '<h2>What does ‘indivisible security’ mean and where did it originate?</h2> <p>At its most crude, it means security should be seen as a collective concept so if the actions of one state threaten the security of another, the principle of indivisible security is breached. Therefore no state should strengthen its security at the expense of another.</p> <p>The principle was first set out in the 1975 Helsinki Act, but also appears in the 1990 Charter for a New Europe and in the 1997 Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security – all treaties signed by the west and Russia.</p> <h2>What has it got to do with the Ukraine standoff?</h2> <p>In Russia’s eyes, indivisible security lies at the heart of the Ukraine crisis because it thinks Nato’s expansion threatens its own security. The term provides the strategic underpinning for the Russian demand that Nato withdraw from central and eastern Europe. It has featured in all major Russian strategic documents since 1990.</p> <p>The subject was brought up by Vladimir Putin in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/boris-johnson-warns-vladimir-putin-against-tragic-ukraine-invasion-uk-russia\">phone call</a> with Boris Johnson on Wednesday, and appears in the two drafttreaty documents published by Russia in mid-December. It was also the focus of a written message sent by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on 28 January to Nato.</p> <h2>What is the practical application in Russia’s eyes?</h2> <p>Russia argues that Nato runs an open-door policy on expansion because only it and applicant states decide if applications should be accepted. The views of the states remaining outside the bloc are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/01/ukraine-crisis-putin-accuses-us-of-ignoring-russian-security-concerns\">legitimate</a>, says Russia, and need to be taken into account.</p> <h2>Has the west bought into this concept?</h2> <p>Russia says yes. It relies mostly on two <a href=\"https://www.osce.org/\">Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe</a> (OSCE) documents to promote its version of indivisible security: the European Security Charter, signed in Istanbul in November 1999, and the Astana Declaration of December 2010. The US is a signatory to both documents. The Istanbul charter says countries should be free to choose their own security arrangements and alliances, but adds the rider that they “will not strengthen their security at the expense of the security of other states”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/xi-putin-summit-russia-inches-closer-china-new-cold-war-looms\">Xi-Putin summit: Russia inches closer to China as ‘new cold war’ looms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Russian government has accused the US state department of selectively picking out from a “package of interconnected commitments” only those elements that serve its purpose. The underlying principle, according to Russia, is that if some countries coexist in a particular region, they are supposed to have common security interests. Consequently, they need inclusive international platforms to communicate.</p> <h2>What does the west say by reply?</h2> <p>It says the Istanbul document explicitly affirmed the inherent right of nation states to choose their security alliances. It did not provide a right of veto to Russia.</p> <p>It points out that the OSCE documents to which Russia signed, including the 1990 Paris Charter, also presumed an adherence to human rights and democracy. The west says it is an abuse of the indivisible security concept, and a violation of the spirit of the Helsinki Final Act if Russia insists on decoupling security issues from human rights.</p> <h2>Does this matter?</h2> <p>Yes, and no. In wars, <em>casus belli</em> matter as much as tank formations. They can in theory also matter in international law. If the two sides could come to a collective understanding of its practical application, it might help.</p> <p>On the other hand, this is only the language through which a dispute about power and values is conducted.

In Belarus they have collective farms.”</p> <p>In the event of an invasion, Russian tanks would advance through Polissya, a primordial natural area of swamps, forests, grasses and lakes.

Forty miles south of Novi Yarylovychi is Chernihiv, an ancient city that was once part of the original Slavic dynasty known as Kievan Rus’.</p> <p>History is never far away. Novi Yarylovychi’s war memorial features a gold-painted Soviet soldier holding a helmet in one hand and a laurel crown in the other.

He recently agreed to give Russia <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/belarusalert/while-the-world-watches-ukraine-putin-is-quietly-occupying-belarus/\">nearly unlimited use of four airbases</a>, a surface-to-air missile base, and approximately 30 storage sites on Belarusian territory. Russian forces now face off against Nato on a new eastern European front, encompassing the states of Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.</p> <p>Few believe Russia will remove its troops from Belarus once this month’s exercises are over. They look to be a permanent presence along the 600-mile border with Ukraine and a new potential attack vector. Russian forces are also stationed in Crimea, in the breakaway republic of Transnistria next to Moldova, and – covertly, Kyiv says – in separatist-held territories in the east.</p> <p>Back in Novi Yarylovychi, Gorban said traffic had fallen dramatically since the start of the pandemic. About 1,000 people a day used the crossing, he said, compared with 10,000 a day in the pre-Covid era. For now, the vehicles that cross drag building materials and logs rather than missiles and artillery pieces.</p> <p>“Putin is wrong. Ukraine and Russia are separate countries,” Gorban said, surveying a scene, for now, of calm. He added: “We were founded first. It was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Dolgorukiy\">Kyiv prince</a> who went to Russia and established Moscow. Back then it was just a few bogs.”</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'world/2022/feb/03/ukraine-russia-fake-attack-video-us-claims', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-02-03T19:29:51Z', 'webTitle': 'Russia plans ‘very graphic’ fake video as pretext for Ukraine invasion, US claims', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/ukraine-russia-fake-attack-video-us-claims', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/feb/03/ukraine-russia-fake-attack-video-us-claims', 'fields': {'body': '<p>US officials claim they have evidence of a Russian plan to make a “very graphic” fake video of a Ukrainian attack as a pretext for an invasion.</p> <p>The alleged plot would involve using corpses, footage of blown-up buildings, fake Ukrainian military hardware, Turkish-made drones and actors playing the part of Russian-speaking mourners.</p> <p>“We don’t know definitively that this is the route they are going to take, but we know that this is an option under consideration,” the deputy national security adviser, Jonathan Finer, told MSNBC, adding that the video “would involve actors playing mourners for people who are killed in an event that they would have created themselves”.</p> <p>Finer added: “That would involve the deployment of corpses to represent bodies purportedly killed, of people purportedly killed in an incident like this.”</p> <p>The Pentagon spokesman, John Kirby, said the video would have purported to show a Ukrainian attack on Russian territory or Russian-speaking people in eastern Ukraine and would be “very graphic”. He added that the US believed that the plan had the backing of the Kremlin.</p> <p>“Our experience is that very little of this nature is not approved at the highest levels of the Russian government,” Kirby said.</p> <p>US officials said the video would show Turkish-made Bayraktar drones taking part in the fabricated attack as a way of implicating Nato.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/ukraine-western-talk-of-imminent-attack-putin\">Don’t panic: why Ukraine doesn’t like western talk of imminent attack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The claims are being made in the midst of a war of nerves between Russia and the US and its allies, in which diplomatic exchanges and intelligence briefings are playing out alongside a relentless Russian military buildup around Ukraine’s borders, and US and allied threats of devastating punitive economic measures if an attack goes ahead.</p> <p>Administration officials said the plan was to use the video as evidence of Ukrainian “genocide” against Russian speakers to justify Russian military intervention. By going public, the US hoped to stall or slow down Moscow’s plans.</p> <p>Finer said it would “make it much more difficult for them after the fact to claim that they had to do whatever they decided to do”.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/us/politics/russia-ukraine-invasion-pretext.html\">New York Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/02/03/russia-ukraine-staged-attack/\">Washington Post</a> first published versions of the account given by administration officials, noting that the officials did not provide evidence for the US claims.</p> <p>Britain said it agreed with the US assessment, having conducted its own analysis of the intelligence reports. The two countries routinely share intelligence as part of the wider Five Eyes network – and London has been as ready as Washington to highlight what both see as an acute Russian threat to Ukraine.</p> <p>Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said the disclosures were “clear and shocking evidence of Russia’s unprovoked aggression and underhand activity to destabilise Ukraine”. She added: “The UK and our allies will continue to expose Russian subterfuge and propaganda and call it out for what it is.”</p> <p>The US and UK have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/us-russia-ukraine-government-sanctions\">alleged that Russia has deployed operatives inside Ukraine</a> to stage false-flag attacks and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/confusion-over-uk-claim-that-putin-plans-coup-in-ukraine\">recruited Ukrainians to take over a puppet government</a> that would collaborate with Russian occupation forces.</p> <p>James Roscoe, a British diplomat at the United Nations said: “Russia says it will never invade Ukraine. Unless it is provoked. So ‘just in case’ it is provoked it has massed over 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border.</p> <p>“But how is it that they are able to anticipation that provocation?” Roscoe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmsroscoe/status/1489304213935075329\">asked on Twitter</a>. “Perhaps because they are planning to stage that provocation?”</p> <p>While massing troops around Ukraine, Russian officials have made repeated claims, without evidence, that Kyiv was planning to attack Russia or Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine rather than the other way round.</p> <p>Last week, a Moscow-backed separatist leader in eastern Ukraine, Denis Pushilin, <a href=\"https://iz.ru/1282531/robert-lanskii/bumerang-dezinformatcii-bolno-bet-po-samoi-ukraine\">repeated a frequent Russian claim</a> that Ukraine had plans to launch a chemical attack on the breakaway region.</p> <p>Thursday’s claims were the latest in a series of US briefings on American intelligence assessments, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/ukraine-western-talk-of-imminent-attack-putin\">some of which have irritated Ukraine’s leadership and been rebuffed by officials in Kyiv.</a></p> <p>Last weekend, Reuters and CNN cited senior US officials claiming Russia had moved blood supplies close to the border, indicating a potential imminent military attack. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, denounced the blood supply claim, calling it a provocation designed “to spread panic and fear in our society”.</p> <p>On Thursday, Maliar told the Guardian she had checked that claim with Ukrainian intelligence agencies, which had their own sources.</p> <p>“It simply wasn’t true. We found no information to back this up, we did not see any blood supplies moved to the front or even in the civilian hospitals around the front,” she said, in an interview at a military airfield at Boryspil, outside Kyiv.</p> <p>“It’s really important to look at the sources. These sources were anonymous, and I don’t think it’s right to use anonymous sources that cannot be checked,” she said.</p>'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}]}}\n"
