To date, as part of active operations since the beginning of September, about 2,000 [square] kilometers of our territory have already been liberated,” he said in a video address late on Saturday. Earlier in the day, The Russian Ministry of Defense acknowledged the withdrawal of its troops from multiple locations across Ukraine’s Kharkov region. Over the past three days, soldiers stationed in the area have been “re-deployed” to territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the ministry claimed. “In order to achieve the goals of the special military operation, a decision was made to regroup troops in the areas of Balakleya and Izyum in order to build up efforts in the Donetsk direction,” the Russian military said in a statement. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-09-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/562572-russia-humanitarian-aid-lebanon-ukraine/,Lebanon to get food aid from Russia,"Russia has approved Lebanon’s request for humanitarian aid, Lebanese ambassador Chawki Bou Nassar confirmed on Friday during a meeting with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov. Moscow will send cereals, foodstuffs, oil derivatives, and other much-needed supplies, as requested by Lebanese Prime Minister-designate Najib Mikati in May. Discussions on resuming direct flights between the two countries were also progressing, Nassar said, though Western sanctions on Russian carriers and attendant restrictions on surrounding airspace mean any potential routes must meet strict requirements. The aid package is separate from another package that Russian ambassador Alexander Rudakov said had been approved by Moscow to deliver to Lebanon. That proposal would supply 40,000 tons of wheat on a monthly basis through the end of 2022, but it has only received “preliminary approval” from Lebanon. US ambassador Dorothy Shea last month sought to one-up Russia and other countries like China and Iran that have offered to help Beirut with its multilayered economic crisis, instead offering a $29.5-million donation from USAID. While Lebanon previously imported about two thirds of its wheat from Ukraine, the war has seen a sizable portion of that country’s grain exports rerouted to Europe as barter for foreign aid dollars Kiev can never hope to repay. Even before the conflict escalated in February, over 2.2 million Lebanese were facing hunger, by some estimates. PM Mikati urged the UN to provide food aid in March, pointing to a constellation of crises, including an economic collapse that reduced the Lebanese currency to a tenth of its pre-2019 value, the explosion of Beirut’s main grain storage facility in 2020, and the presence of millions of Syrian and Palestinian refugees. Even if importers are able to find substitutes for the Ukrainian grain no longer bound for Beirut, many Lebanese won’t be able to afford them, trade syndicate president Hani Bohsali told UPI in March. Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund to unlock a promised $3 billion in aid remain “ongoing,” according to Nassar, who said he expected the replacement of Mikati's caretaker government with permanent leadership would bring “confidence” to the talks. The IMF is reportedly frustrated with Hezbollah and other political factions holding out hope that offshore oil and gas fields could be the country’s financial salvation and is calling instead for the imposition of a standard debt repayment plan, fueled by the usual slate of austerity measures."
2022-09-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/562564-assault-russian-national-guard/,National guard soldier dead after attack in Russian region,"A Russian national guard service member has died of his injuries in hospital after he and his colleague were attacked by unknown assailants on Friday. Taking to Telegram on Saturday, Russia’s Investigative Committee revealed that a criminal probe had been launched into the assault. “According to the information at hand, yesterday in the Sudzhansky district of Kursk region unknown individuals attacked Rosgvardia personnel,” the officials said. They also confirmed the death of one of the national guard soldiers. The area where the assault took place is located some ten kilometers away from the Russian-Ukrainian border. Earlier, several Russian Telegram channels specializing in news coverage had offered conflicting versions of events. According to Mash, the national guard service members tried to stop a suspicious-looking van at a checkpoint. The vehicle’s occupants, however, opened fire on the law enforcement personnel. Baza, in turn, alleged that the Rosgvardia service members had located several armed men in a forest, with a shootout ensuing in which one of the law enforcement personnel was injured. The assailants managed to flee the scene. On Saturday morning, Kursk region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt posted a video message on his own Telegram channel, informing his subscribers that the authorities are still searching for the perpetrators. The region, which is adjacent to Ukraine, is currently on a heightened terror alert following repeated shelling from across the border and several sabotage attempts."
2022-09-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/562527-alfa-fridman-ukraine-donation-sanctions/,Russian tycoon offers $1 billion to Ukraine – WSJ,"Russian Alfa Bank co-founder Mikhail Fridman has offered to transfer $1 billion of his personal wealth, currently frozen under UK sanctions, to its Ukrainian subsidiary in order to help rebuild the country, according to the Wall Street Journal. Sources told the newspaper on Wednesday that the move was aimed at persuading London to drop the sanctions. “The bank would like, as one of the biggest private banks in Ukraine … to be an active player in recovering the Ukrainian economy after the war,” the supervisory board chair of the Alfa branch in Ukraine, Roman Shpek, told the outlet, explaining the funds could be used to help Kiev rebuild in areas like infrastructure, healthcare, and food and energy security. The company initially proposed the transfer in June to the National Bank of Ukraine, whose approval would be required before the matter could pass to the EU. Brussels would ultimately be responsible for allowing the funds to leave Europe, and Alfa’s Ukrainian subsidiary petitioned the Council of Europe on Fridman’s behalf last week. Fridman, who was born in the Soviet city of Lviv in western Ukraine, resigned as a director of Alfa’s parent company in March, days after the EU and UK sanctions came down. While he has not been personally sanctioned by the US, Alfa Bank is blacklisted by the Treasury Department, meaning other companies must cut ties with it or risk being sanctioned themselves, and UK entities have distanced themselves from him due to the personal sanctions there. Unnamed individuals familiar with the matter told the WSJ that Alfa’s proposal was an effort to convince London to lift the sanctions on Fridman’s assets, though he has denied making any such “quid pro quo” offer. The British Foreign Office responded that the UK “does not condone any sanctions avoidance.” Shpek insisted the donation was “a really important economic project,” stressing that the prospect of future sanctions relief had nothing to do with it."
2022-09-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/562519-iaea-zaporozhye-nuclear-plant/,Situation at nuclear plant 'precarious’ – UN,"Attacks on the Russia-controlled Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant must stop, Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has warned, warning of a looming “nuclear accident” at the site. In a statement on Friday, Grossi said a “serious situation” had developed at the plant, located in southern Ukraine, overnight when the power in the town where it's located was knocked out by shelling. “The power infrastructure feeding the city of Energodar, home to the NPP’s operators and their families, has been destroyed by shelling of the switchyard at the city’s thermal power plant,” Grossi explained, adding that the city was ultimately left with “no running water, no power, no sewage.” Given the “increased and continued shelling” of the nuclear facility, “there is little likelihood of re-establishing reliable offsite power,” the official warned. “The power plant has no offsite power. And we have seen that once infrastructure is repaired, it is damaged once again,” Grossi added, without assigning blame for the attacks to either Russia or Ukraine. “This is completely unacceptable. It cannot stand. I therefore urgently call for the immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area,” he said, reiterating his call for the creation of a “safety zone” around the plant. This dramatic development demonstrates the absolute imperative to establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone now. This is the only way to ensure that we do not face a nuclear accident. Seized by Russian forces early in the conflict, the nuclear power plant and the surrounding environs have repeatedly come under missile and artillery attacks in recent weeks. While Russia has placed the blame for the shelling squarely on Kiev, Ukraine and some Western officials continue to accuse Moscow of shelling the facility controlled by its own troops. Russia previously rejected a proposal by Kiev and its Western allies to withdraw the troops providing security around the Zaporozhye facility, insisting that Ukraine would only use this as an opportunity to seize the plant, rather than ensure its actual safety. The Russian Defense Ministry has claimed Kiev has repeatedly sent in saboteur teams to capture the facility amid the recent IAEA visit to the site."
2022-09-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/562508-putin-grain-poor-nations/,Russia makes grain promise to poorest nations,"Russia is set to ramp up grain exports, seeking to supply some 30 million tons this year, President Vladimir Putin has announced. The supplies will prioritize less well off and food-insecure nations. “We believe it to be right to ramp up deliveries to the poorest countries,” Putin said during a meeting of the Security Council on Friday. “In total, by the end of this year, we will supply some 30 million tons of grain and are ready to increase this volume to 50 million tons or more, because, thank God, we have a good harvest this year,” he added. Moscow is also ready to supply fertilizers to the poorest nations free of charge, the Russian president said. “Our producers – if I remember correctly, we’re talking about potash fertilizers – are ready to deliver them free of charge to developing nations that urgently need them,” Putin said, instructing the Russian Foreign Ministry to work on the plan. The president also touched upon the UN-brokered grain deal with Ukraine, reiterating his allegations that the goods have primarily been exported to the EU rather than the developing countries in Africa that need the food supply the most. “Of the 87 ships that left the Ukrainian ports with grain, 32 remained in Turkey. And I think that this is absolutely natural, because Turkey, the host country of this entire process, certainly has the right to do that,” Putin said. Another 30 vessels were sent to EU nations, while only two ships went to “the poorest countries for UN food programs,” namely to Yemen and Djibouti, Putin said. The vessels only carried around 60,000 tons of grain on board, constituting only around 3% of grain exported by Ukraine under the deal."
2022-09-09,https://www.rt.com/news/562517-american-general-ukraine-victory-crimea/,Ukraine will retake Crimea in a year – ex-US general,"Ukraine could “restore full sovereignty” within a year, retaking all of its lost territory including Crimea, retired US General Ben Hodges told Newsweek on Thursday at the Tbilisi International Conference of the McCain Institute in Georgia. Hodges is now a lobbyist at the Centre for European Policy Analysis, a pressure group funded by NATO and US arms manufacturers. Western support for Kiev has resulted in a financial bonanza for these companies. “The Ukrainians saved their country,” Hodges gushed, declaring that “half a year after the start of the full-scale Russian invasion…the supposed second-best army in the world is now the second-best army in Ukraine,” with Russia’s “ability to conduct further offensive operations…all but exhausted.” Now, Hodges said, it was up to the US and NATO to step in and make sure the war is won, starting with a full-throated proclamation of support for Kiev. Washington should stop publicizing the cost of the military aid it sends overseas, he continued, suggesting the deliveries be framed in terms of the percentage of “what is needed for Ukraine to defeat Russia and regain their territory.” The retired general did not elaborate on how those numbers could be calculated. The administration of US President Joe Biden has poured over $44 billion into the war effort since February. While Ukraine and its Western backers have declared the Kherson counteroffensive a rousing success, boasting of recapturing several villages, Kiev has banned journalists from the front lines, making these claims difficult to verify. Russia has argued the initiative “failed miserably,” pointing to the loss of over 1,200 Ukrainian servicemen in a single day of fighting. Ukrainian MP Alexey Goncharenko echoed Hodges’ optimism in comments to Newsweek, declaring “next year will be the decisive year of the war” and that “with the help of the free world, Ukraine has an opportunity to win.” That will require a lot more weapons, he clarified, mentioning aircraft, air defense systems, and rockets superior to the HIMARS. Crimea became part of Russia in the wake of a 2014 referendum following the US-backed overthrow of the democratically-elected government of Viktor Yanukovich in Kiev. Ukraine and NATO consider it illegally annexed territory, and the US has reportedly given Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky the go-ahead to attack the peninsula. The Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk declared their independence that same year and were recognized as independent states by the Kremlin this past February. Zelensky has vowed to retake all three regions, promising on Sunday that “Ukraine will return” to Donbass, Kharkov, Zhaporozhye, Kherson, and “definitely to Crimea.”"
2022-09-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/562505-russia-welcomes-all-tourists/,Kremlin responds to EU ditching visa deal,"Russia is interested in welcoming tourists from all over the world, even from “unfriendly nations,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said during a conference call on Friday. Peskov was asked to clarify President Vladimir Putin’s comments on Wednesday that Moscow would not be introducing any visa restrictions on foreign citizens in retaliation for similar measures imposed by the EU. “The main point that the president was trying to get across was that we will continue to do what suits our interests,” the spokesperson explained, adding that introducing mirror countermeasures against the West is not always in Russia’s interests. “Of course, illegal, criminal and raider attitudes towards our businesses will be met with reciprocal steps, but these measures will be reasonable and carefully calculated,” Peskov said, noting that Russia welcomes those who are willing to invest in the country. He added that Russia remains just as inviting to foreign tourists, including those from countries that Moscow considers “unfriendly.” “After all, people need to see our country and they need to understand that what they are shown and told about Russia in their home countries is a lie,” the Kremlin spokesperson stated, noting that the only way to explain this to people is by inviting them to Russia to see the country for themselves. Nevertheless, Peskov warned that any “inappropriate behavior” towards Russian diplomats or representatives of Russian foreign delegations would be met with mirror responses in accordance with the reciprocal rule of diplomacy. The Kremlin’s comments come as the European Council officially announced on Friday that it would be scrapping the so-called Visa Facilitation Deal between Russia and the EU, citing Moscow’s ongoing military operation in Ukraine. The agreement had simplified visa application procedures for Russian citizens. Starting Monday, however, Russians will have to pay visa application fees of €80, instead of the previous €35, and will have to provide significantly more documentation, endure longer processing times and be subject to much stricter rules for the issuance of multiple-entry visas. Meanwhile, countries such as Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have announced they would be closing their borders to all Russian tourists, even those with a valid Schengen visa. The only exceptions will be made for those traveling to see relatives or for humanitarian reasons."
2022-09-09,https://www.rt.com/news/562507-stoltenberg-ukraine-nato-support/,NATO chief warns Ukraine could collapse,"Ukraine is heading for a tough winter, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned on Thursday, urging Kiev to continue fighting against Russia. Otherwise, the country may “cease to exist” as an independent nation, he said. “If President [Vladimir] Putin and Russia stop fighting, then we will have peace. If Ukraine stops fighting, then Ukraine will cease to exist as an independent nation,” Stoltenberg told the AP on the sidelines of a US-led meeting in Ramstein, Germany that brought together foreign supporters of Ukraine. Stoltenberg avoided giving any time frame for how long the conflict might last but said it would end at some point with negotiations. So far, however, there has been “no sign” of Moscow giving up its objectives in Ukraine, the NATO chief said. Russia’s ultimate goal in the conflict is “taking control of Ukraine,” he claimed. “We need at least to be prepared for this winter,” Stoltenberg said, adding that the West must “continue to provide support,” including appropriate winter uniforms, generators and tents, among other things. “Winter’s coming, and winter’s going to be hard on the battlefield in Ukraine. We know that the size of the Ukrainian army is now roughly three times as big as what it was last winter,” Stoltenberg added. However, the NATO boss claimed the “war in Ukraine is approaching a pivotal moment,” asserting that the ongoing Russian offensive had “stalled” in Donbass and elsewhere. “We see that the Ukrainians have been able to fight back, to strike back and regain some territory,” he said. Moscow has repeatedly urged the US and other Western nations to stop “pumping” Ukraine with weapons and other military hardware. Top Russian officials insist that the continuous support of Kiev will only prolong the bloodshed without changing the ultimate outcome of the conflict. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-09-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/562501-estonia-ban-russians-schengen/,Estonian MEP complains to EU about entry ban for Russians,"Estonian MEP Yana Toom has accused her own nation’s government along with those of Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland of violating the EU’s ‘free travel’ rules by imposing a “blanket ban” on Russian citizens holding valid Schengen visas issued by other EU members. The restrictions, which were announced by the four nations earlier this week, “constitute a breach of the Schengen Border Code and seriously undermine the European legal order,” Toom wrote in a Thursday letter to Josep Borrell, the EU’s chief for foreign policy and security. The Estonian lawmaker shared the document on her social media on Friday. The Schengen ‘free travel’ rules, which apply to most EU nations and four non-EU states, allow individual members to bar holders of visas issued by other participants from their territory. But such decisions must be taken on a case-by-case basis and for a limited number of reasons, the Estonian official argued, so a general policy against Russian citizens violated them. Toom asked Borrell when the European Commission was going to send a formal letter of notice to the four nations. The Baltic countries and Poland said they would no longer allow entry to Russian tourists holding Schengen visas starting September 19. The blanket ban makes an exception for travel on humanitarian grounds. The four nations argued that Russian citizens generally posed a threat to their national security. The Baltic states had previously stopped issuing tourist and business visas to Russian citizens. Toom has served as an MEP from Estonia since 2014 and is a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. As she published her letter to Borrell, she remarked that there was a backlash against her position in the Estonian media, with critics branding her as pro-Russian."
2022-09-09,https://www.rt.com/news/562499-kremlin-putin-wont-attend-queen-funeral/,Kremlin comments on Queen’s funeral and legacy,"Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be among the dignitaries attending the funeral of Britain’s late Queen Elizabeth II, the Kremlin said. She passed away at the age of 96 on Thursday afternoon. Asked by journalists on Friday whether Putin would visit Britain to pay his last respects, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said this is “not being considered.” Nevertheless, he stated that the British monarch was “held in high regard in Russia, just like in the whole world, for her wisdom and international authority.” Peskov added that qualities such as these are “in short supply in the international arena” these days. The spokesperson declined to say if anyone will represent Russia at the funeral. “It hasn’t been announced so far what the protocol practice will be like,” Peskov said, adding that Moscow will wait for a decision from the British royal family and the country’s government. On Thursday, Putin sent his condolences to the Queen’s eldest son, the 73-year-old former Prince of Wales, who succeeded Elizabeth to become King Charles III following her death. “I ask you to convey words of sincere sympathy and support to the members of the royal family and all the people of Great Britain,” Putin said. Queen Elizabeth died at her Scottish residence, Balmoral Castle, at the age of 96 on Thursday after being placed under medical supervision by her doctors hours earlier. With her reign of 70 years, Elizabeth is the longest-serving British monarch in history."
2022-09-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/562477-moldova-minister-firewood-website/,Minister resigns after failing to reach firewood deadline,"Moldova’s environment minister has resigned a day after the prime minister criticized her for not meeting a launch deadline for a website that should help people buy firewood for winter heating. Iuliana Cantaragiu stepped down from her position on Thursday. In a statement on Facebook, she touted her record of reforms in the Environment Ministry and thanked people she worked with for their service. Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita accepted her resignation. The prime minister criticized Cantaragiu during a government meeting on her failure to launch a service to help Moldovans buy firewood for the winter season. The web portal lemne.md and a phone hotline were supposed to be launched on September 1. Cantaragiu blamed unidentified “partners” involved in the development of the website for the delay and said it would be ready in two weeks. The prime minister observed that by that time the service would not be necessary. “Things must be done on time so that the information is useful. A volunteer could create the website in a day,” Gavrilita noted, as quoted by the local media. The minister was asked about the exchange during a press conference on the same day, with the media speculating that her resignation was looming. She said that falling behind the deadline was “absolutely normal” because “there are things outside of our control.” In early August, the national forestry agency Moldsilva warned that Moldova could face a shortage of firewood due to increased demand amid the global energy crisis. The Environment Ministry said the portal would help prevent price gouging. The proposal exposed the government to some mockery from citizens, who wondered if creating a website, the name of which means 'firewood' in Moldovan, was the best use of public funds."
2022-09-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/562468-putin-saur-mogila-monument/,Putin salutes restoration of WWII monument in Donbass,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday praised the newly completed restoration of Saur-Mogila, a memorial to the 1943 Soviet liberation of Donbass from Nazi Germany. The monument had been damaged by Ukrainian shelling during the 2014 battles with the militia of the Donetsk People’s Republic. “It is gratifying to know that this majestic complex has been restored with the utmost care,” Putin said in a video message recorded at the Kremlin, noting that its original obelisk and bas-relief have been complemented with an addition commemorating the “modern generation of heroes.” Our hearts bleed when we see some countries demolish monuments to Soviet soldiers who gave their lives in the service of the freedom of their people, mock history, and cynically let down their own fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers. For Russia, this is unthinkable. Putin added that Saur-Mogila is “hallowed grounds” for Russia, on the same level as Sapun Ridge outside Sevastopol and the monument to the defenders of Stalingrad at Mamayev Kurgan. “The reconstructed memorial to the defenders of Donbass, the courage of our soldiers, officers and militias is a warning to all who have renounced their ancestors and forgotten the lessons of history,” the Russian president concluded. Saur-Mogila is a dominant height on the Donets Ridge, rising to almost 300 meters above sea level. Soviet troops broke the German fortifications there in August 1943, as a massive tank battle raged near Kursk in the north. The city of Donetsk – then known as Stalino – was liberated on September 8. The monument built in the 1960s commemorated that victory. The entire memorial was heavily damaged in August 2014, during the weeks of fighting between the Ukrainian “punitive expedition” and the Donetsk People’s Republic militia. The DPR and neighboring Lugansk had declared independence from Ukraine following a US-backed coup in Kiev in February and the installation of a government that included neo-Nazis. The obelisk collapsed on August 21, 2014 after extended Ukrainian shelling, but the hill remained in DPR hands. Ten days later, the surrender of Ukrainian troops encircled at nearby Ilovaisk resulted in the first Minsk ceasefire."
2022-09-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/562469-putin-queen-elizabeth-condolences/,Putin sends condolences upon Queen Elizabeth’s death,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has sent his condolences over Queen Elizabeth’s death to the new British monarch, the Kremlin press service said in a brief statement on Thursday. “The most important events in the modern history of the United Kingdom are inseparably linked to the name of Her Majesty. For many decades, Elizabeth II rightfully enjoyed the love and respect of her subjects, as well as authority on the world stage,” Putin said, wishing Charles III “courage and perseverance” in the face of this “heavy and irreparable loss.” “I ask you to convey the words of sincere sympathy and support to the members of the royal family and all the people of Great Britain,” the Russian president added. Queen Elizabeth died at her Scottish residence, Balmoral Castle, at the age of 96 earlier in the day. She was the longest-serving monarch in British history with 70 years on the throne. The Queen had been placed under “medical supervision” shortly before her death, while senior royals rushed to the retreat to spend the final hours with her. The Queen was succeeded by her eldest son, 73-year-old former Prince Charles, who has opted to keep the name Charles III for his official title."

The attack left at least three civilians dead and six gravely wounded, according to the head of the Russian-controlled military-civilian administration, Vladimir Leontyev. “Six people were taken in critical condition to the hospital, they have serious chest injuries and traumatic limb amputation, they are alive,” Leontyev told Sputnik News.Images from the scene show that a projectile hit the four-story building directly on the roof, flattening an entire section. In recent weeks, Novaya Kakhovka, Kherson, and the nearby Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant have been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian shelling in a bid to dislodge the Russian troops controlling the locations, and to disrupt logistics by disabling bridges over the Dnepr River. Moscow has repeatedly warned that the attacks, particularly those targeting the Zaporozhye facility, threaten a Chernobyl-style nuclear disaster for the whole of Europe and beyond. Kiev, along with some Western officials and media, however, have claimed that Russian forces themselves have been shelling the nuclear plant, despite the fact it is already under their control. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-09-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/562456-ramstein-austin-pentagon-ukraine-arms/,Pentagon unveils new Ukraine weapons package,"Artillery ammunition, armored vehicles, and remote-launched mines make up the bulk of the new package of US military aid to Ukraine, which Washington values at $675 million, according to a list published by the US Department of Defense on Thursday. This is the 20th “drawdown” of equipment for Ukraine from US military stocks since August 2021 – months before the conflict escalated. According to the Pentagon, Kiev will receive ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and High-speed Anti-radiation missiles (HARM) – without specifying the quantities of either – as well as 36,000 105mm artillery rounds and four howitzers of the same caliber. In addition to 100 armored Humvee cars, Ukraine will get 1.5 million bullets, 5,000 anti-tank rockets, 50 armored ambulances, and 1,000 rounds of the 155mm Remote Anti-Armor Mine (RAAM) Systems, as well as some night vision devices, the Pentagon said. Speaking at the meeting of the “Ukraine Defense Contact Group” in Ramstein, Germany, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin boasted that Kiev has so far received 126 of the M777 howitzers since April, and a total of 26 multiple-launch rocket systems – including the US-made HIMARS – capable of firing long-range missiles. Austin claimed the weapons have “demonstrably” helped Ukraine in the conflict, but said it was time for NATO to “sustain Ukraine’s brave defenders for the long haul” by “moving urgently to innovate and to push all of our defense industrial bases” so they could supply Kiev on “the hard road ahead.” Of other countries that have chipped in, Austin singled out the UK for sending 2.3 billion pounds in military aid, and Poland for “serving as the linchpin of our efforts to support the Ukrainians,” including “generous donations” of tanks and artillery. By the Pentagon’s own admission, the US has committed “more than $17.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine” since 2014, and another $14.5 billion since February. Just this week, the US State Department pledged another $2 billion for long-term investments in military industry, half to Ukraine and half to 18 of its neighbors.

2022-09-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/562428-belarus-military-exercises-defense/,Belarus begins exercises near Poland,"Amid heightened tensions with the West, Belarus has commenced military exercises, which will train troops to repel potential invaders, the Ministry of Defense announced on Thursday. “The exercise will allow to practice combat (special) operations meant to liberate the territory temporarily occupied by the adversary,” the ministry’s statement read. The drills will also allow soldiers to hone skills in “restoring control over the state border,” train close air support, implementation of martial law and fighting against an adversary’s commandos or illegal armed groups. The exercise is expected to last until September 14 and will take place in the Brest region bordering Poland and Ukraine, as well as in the Vitebsk and Minsk regions. Belarus also invited international observers to attend in order to demonstrate “maximum transparency” and the “desire to improve regional stability.” Belarus started planning the maneuvers after President Alexander Lukashenko claimed in July that NATO was preparing for a war in Eastern Europe, citing increased activity by the military alliance. “It seems the newly-minted ‘crusaders' from the North Atlantic Alliance suddenly decided that the time is ripe for another ‘Drang nach Osten,’ he said at the time, referring to a German idea of conquering lands in the East. In August, amid the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Lukashenko called Kiev a threat to Belarus’ national security, accusing the Ukrainian leadership of stoking regional tensions and embracing policies “directed against its own people.” The drills come on the heels of the Vostok 2022 international military exercises hosted by Russia, in which Belarusian troops also took part."

The scheme failed.,"If at first you don’t succeed, then try, try again. This seems to be the mantra of the Ukrainian government as it seeks to blackmail the international community into helping it evict Russia from the territory encompassing Europe's largest Nuclear Power Plant. “The world is once again on the brink of a nuclear disaster,” Kiev's Energy Secretary German Galushchenko declared in a message posted to Facebook on Monday, September 5. “The last line connecting it with the energy system of Ukraine…separated due to the fire that occurred as a result of shelling. Any repair of the lines is impossible now – there are combat operations around the station.” Galushchenko’s warning came as the bulk of an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission, dispatched late last week to inspect the safety of the Zaporozhye facility, and personally led by Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, departed the nuclear power plant. Kiev is insisting that the international community oversee the “demilitarization” of the Zaporozhye plant and surrounding environs. The removal of Russian forces, the Ukrainians contend, and their replacement with international “peacekeepers,” is the only way to ensure nuclear safety. Left unsaid is the fact that all the damage caused to the nuclear power plant is the result of Ukrainian military action, including the deliberate targeting of the nuclear reactors and their support buildings by Ukrainian artillery. The irony of the Ukrainian action is that IAEA Director General Grossi has now seen first-hand that the threat to the plant comes not from Russia, as Kiev wants to portray, but from Ukraine itself. More damning is that Grossi likewise is cognizant of the reality that Ukraine has been using the IAEA not as a guarantor of nuclear security, but rather a facilitator of Ukrainian policy, including military action that appeared to use the presence of IAEA inspectors at Zaporozhye as cover. By all appearances, Grossi undertook his mission to the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant in good faith. Since the attacks on the facility started in early August, he has been voicing his concerns and calling on forces on both sides to exercise the “utmost restraint” and avoid jeopardizing the safety of the plant “at all costs.” These calls were echoed by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. In mid-August, at an emergency session of the UN Security Council requested by Russia, Grossi called on Moscow and Kiev allow international experts to visit the power plant, and said he’d lead the mission himself. The United States, while backing his call, also demanded that a demilitarized zone be established in conjunction with any such visit, and said that any refusal by Russia to allow that was tantamount to nuclear blackmail. Russia refused to consider any requests to “demilitarize” the facility. It did, however, encourage the dispatch of the IAEA team, with one caveat – that it include ballistics specialists who would be able to evaluate the damage done to the plant with an eye toward determining the source of the attacks. Such professionals were included in the mission. On August 29, Grossi’s team travelled to Kiev, where the next day they met with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. Zelensky told Grossi that Ukraine believed it was critical for the IAEA to press home its demands for a demilitarized zone, which would enable Ukraine to take control of the plant. On September 1, Grossi and his team set off for the Zaporozhye facility. Prior to their arrival, they were stopped by Ukrainian officials, who warned Grossi that military activity in and around the facility had picked up that morning. According to Russian military sources, the Ukrainian army had attempted to seize the power plant in a commando raid that was thwarted by Russian forces. As Grossi’s 14-man team arrived at the power plant, the sound of nearby combat could be readily heard. The deteriorating security situation at the facility prompted Grossi to withdraw the bulk of his team later that day. A six-person sub-team was tasked with remaining on-site for a few days longer, after which four inspectors would depart, leaving behind a two-person element, who would provide a permanent presence, on a rotational basis, at the facility. Afterwards, Grossi stated that the mission had been valuable. “We knew a lot before too, but of course it is being inspected now. We are trying to do a thorough assessment of the current situation.” As to the security of the plant, Grossi noted that “[t]he physical integrity of the facility has been violated not once, but multiple times. This is by no means acceptable.” In addition to their personal observations, the team was presented with a petition signed by 20,000 residents from Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporozhye region demanding that the IAEA condemn the attacks on the nuclear power plant, which the signatories said were conducted solely by the Ukrainian forces. This was not the result either the Ukrainian government or its Western backers could have envisioned when they were pushing for the mission’s dispatch in mid- to late-August. The IAEA mission, it seems, was not aware that there was going to be a Ukrainian military operation designed to capture the site while the inspectors were en route. There can be no doubt, however, that the Ukrainian government was aware that this was going to happen, even as Zelensky met with Grossi and his team the day before. It is also highly likely that Zelensky’s backers, especially the United States, United Kingdom, and France, were aware of the pending military operation, if not its timing. Needless to say, using an international inspection team as cover for a military operation is a violation of everything the United Nations Charter stands for. While the goal of the operation appears to have been to capture the site, and then invite the IAEA inspectors to remain there permanently, prompting the need for the dispatch of an international peacekeeping force, this was not achieved. Worse still for Ukraine and its partners, the team has now been exposed to the duplicity of the Ukrainian government and, by extension, its Western backers in the United Nations, as well as to the reality that Russia had been telling the truth the entire time about the safety and security of the plant. There is no doubt that the ballistic experts accompanying Grossi’s team were able to gather more than enough forensic data to prove conclusively who was responsible for the ongoing attacks on Zaporozhye. On Tuesday, September 6, Director General Grossi submitted the findings of his mission as part of a larger periodic report on the IAEA’s work in Ukraine since the initiation of Russia’s special military operation. The report is technical in nature, focusing on the safety of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. This is the IAEA’s bread and butter, and based upon the contents of the report, the team accurately reflected what it observed while on the ground in Zaporozhye. A second, unspoken and ultimately more sensitive aspect of the report is the political ramifications of the mission. While accurately reporting the frequency and damage done by repeated artillery strikes on the territory of the plant, Grossi did not provide any conclusions about the origin of the shelling, despite being able to do so based on the data collected by his team. UN organizations, unless specifically mandated to do so, rarely provide attribution when it comes to who did what to whom. Instead, the report concluded that the safety and security of the nuclear power plant and its operators has been put at risk because of the ongoing military action, and encouraged all parties involved to cease such activity. The report likewise avoids any reference to the efforts of the Russian military to keep the team safe from attack while they were visiting the plant, thereby avoiding any indirect acknowledgement that the threat to Zaporozhye came from Ukraine, not Russia. What the team did do is speak of “an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means,” which could be achieved by the immediate establishment of a “nuclear safety and security protection zone.” Grossi declared that the “IAEA is ready to start immediately the consultations leading to the urgent establishment of such a nuclear safety and security protection zone at the ZNPP [Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant].” Grossi could have prepared a report that sought the UN Security Council’s condemnation of the perpetrators of the egregious actions observed by the IAEA team – evidence of ongoing Ukrainian artillery attacks, and the use of Grossi’s team as operational cover for a physical attack on the plant while the mission was underway. Grossi is part of the UN system, however, and in any event the Council cannot police itself; when three of the five permanent members are involved in facilitating the Ukrainian malfeasance, then the Council is paralyzed by its own moral corruption. Regardless, Grossi’s trip is a political defeat for Ukraine and its supporters, which had placed so much hope and effort (including the lives of soldiers who perished in the September 1 assault on Zaporozhye) in using the IAEA inspection as a facilitator for larger objectives, such as the dispatch of international peacekeepers to occupy the plant and its immediate environs. In a crass display of hubris-laced audacity, Ukraine has called for a new IAEA inspection mission to be accompanied by a UN peacekeeping force. “We need to draw conclusions from this mission {Grossi’s} on the ground,” Peter Kotin, the head of Energoatom, declared on September 5, 2022 – well prior to Grossi’s report being published. “These conclusions should resolve the whole situation by ending Russian control. If the mission does not produce that, then we must have some viable outcome.” Kotin proposed increasing the number of agency inspectors at the station, adding that “the presence of other international organizations, such as United Nations peacekeeping forces or other international missions from the European Union, will help provide an independent view of what is going on there, and ultimately remove the Russians from the station.” The chances of that happening are near zero. But the fact that Ukraine continues to push for this outcome virtually guarantees that the relentless shelling of the Zaporozhye plant will continue until such time as the Ukrainian military is pushed back, out of artillery range, or else Ukraine capitulates. In any event, the world will continue to be subjected to nuclear blackmail daily. The perpetrator of this global crime, however, isn’t Russia, but rather Ukraine, along with its Western supporters in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and elsewhere."
2022-09-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/562421-latvia-protest-russian-language/,Russian speakers protest ‘language genocide’ in Latvia,"Members of Latvia’s Russian-speaking community staged a peaceful protest in the country’s capital of Riga on Wednesday evening against a looming ban on teaching in Russian in educational institutions. Last month, the Education, Culture and Science Commission of the Latvian parliament, called the Saeima, supported amendments to education laws that would provide for a phased three-year transition to teaching only in Latvian, the state language, in kindergartens and schools. The transition period would commence next September. On Thursday, the bill is expected to be considered by the Saeima in its second reading. If it passes, it will progress for a third reading in both the commission and the parliament. Russian is officially considered a foreign language in Latvia despite the fact that, according to official statistics obtained by Sputnik, about 40% of the population identifies it as their native language. “In the context of the senseless fight against everything Russian declared by the government, the survival of the Russian language and culture in Latvia depends only on you and me. Therefore, today we will all say ‘NO’ to the destruction of the Russian language in schools!” the Latvian Russian Union political party, the organizer of the protest, said in a Facebook post. According to the news agency Leta, about 100 people took part in the protest, which was held in front of the parliament building. The demonstrators were seen holding posters with calls to end the “language genocide.” The speakers broached not only the country’s language policies but also the destruction of Soviet memorials, as well as the severing of ties between the Latvian Orthodox Church and the Moscow Patriarchate. Commenting in June on the proposed legislation in Latvia, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warned the country’s authorities that such a policy might turn out badly for them. In her view, “mocking common sense, historical memory and everything that is sacred to their own citizens” signals inevitable “crisis changes.”"
2022-09-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/562349-moscow-is-aiming-ukraine/,"Dmitry Trenin: Six months into the conflict, what exactly does Russia hope to achieve in Ukraine?","Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin referred to Ukraine as an “anti-Russian enclave” which has to be removed. He also said that the Russian soldiers taking part in the military operation there were fighting for their “own country.” These statements carry important implications. Over the last six-plus months, the mantra of the Russian officialdom has been that all aims of the offensive will be reached. On purpose, however, the specific objectives, such as how far Moscow’s forces plan move into Ukraine, have never been spelled out. This cannot but raise speculation about what the Kremlin is actually hoping to achieve. The only person who can authoritatively answer that question, however, is the president, and second-guessing him makes no sense. Yet, two things cannot escape close attention. One is the radicalization of Moscow’s position on Ukraine as a result of both Western policies and Kiev’s actions; two is the widening gap between the minimum result of the military campaign that Russia can be satisfied with, and the maximum amount of what the US and its allies can accept. For about six years after the second Minsk Agreement was signed in 2015, the Kremlin tried hard to get that accord implemented. It would have ensured the autonomous status of Donbass within Ukraine and given the region influence on national politics and policies, including in the issue of the country’s geopolitical and geo-economic orientation. From the very start, however, Kiev was unwilling to cooperate on the deal’s implementation, seeing it as a win for Moscow. Washington, in pursuit of a policy to contain Russia, encouraged such an obstructionist stance, while Berlin and Paris, formally the guarantors of the agreement (alongside Russia), had no leverage in Kiev and ended up embracing the Ukrainian position. Vladimir Zelensky’s election to Ukraine’s presidency in 2019 initially appeared to be an opening for peace, and President Putin made a serious effort to get the Minsk agreement off the ground. Kiev, however, soon backtracked and took an even more hardline position than before. Nevertheless, until mid-2021 the Kremlin continued to see as its goals in Ukraine a resolution of the Donbass issue essentially on the basis of Minsk, and the eventual de facto recognition of Crimea’s Russian status. In June of last year, Vladimir Putin, however, published a long article on Russian-Ukrainian relations which made it clear that he viewed the current situation as a major security, political, and identity issue for his country; recognized his personal responsibility; and was resolved to do something to strategically correct it. The article did not give away Putin’s game plan, but it laid out his basic thinking on Ukraine. Last December, Moscow passed on to Washington a package of proposals, which amounted to a list of security guarantees for Russia. These included Ukraine’s formal neutrality between Russia and NATO (“no Ukraine in NATO”); and no deployment of US and other NATO weapons and military bases in Ukraine, as well as a ban on military exercises on Ukrainian territory (“no NATO in Ukraine”). While the US agreed to discuss some military technical issues dealt with in the Russian paper it rejected Moscow’s key demands related to Ukraine and NATO. Putin had to take no for an answer. Just before the launch of its military operation, Moscow recognized the two Donbass republics and told Kiev to vacate the parts of Donetsk and Lugansk then under Ukrainian control – or face the consequences. Kiev refused, and hostilities began. Russia’s official reason for unleashing force was defending the two newly recognized republics which had asked for military assistance. Shortly after the start of hostilities Russia and Ukraine began peace talks. In late March 2022 at a meeting in Istanbul, Moscow demanded that Zelensky’s government recognize the sovereignty of the two Donbass republics within their constitutional borders, as well as Russia’s own sovereignty over Crimea, which was formally incorporated into the Russian Federation in 2014, plus accept a neutral and demilitarized status for territory controlled by Kiev. At that point, Moscow still recognized the current Ukrainian authorities and was prepared to deal with them directly. For its part, Kiev initially appeared ready to accept Moscow’s demands (which were criticized by many within Russia as overly concessionary to Ukraine), but then quickly reverted to a hardline stance. Moscow has always suspected that this U-turn, as on previous occasions, was the result of US behind-the-scenes influence, often aided by the British and other allies. From the spring of 2022, as the fighting continued, Moscow expanded its aims. These now included the “de-Nazification” of Ukraine, meaning not only the removal of ultra-nationalist and anti-Russian elements from the Ukrainian government (increasingly characterized by Russian officials now as the “Kiev regime”), but the extirpation of their underlying ideology (based around the World War Two Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera) and its influence in society, including in education, the media, culture and other spheres. Next to this, Moscow added something that Putin called, in his trademark caustic way, the “de-Communization” of Ukraine, meaning ridding that country, whose leadership was rejecting its Soviet past, of the Russian-populated or Russian-speaking territories that had been awarded to the Soviet Ukrainian republic of the USSR by the Communist leaders in Moscow, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev. These include, besides Donbass, the entire southeast of Ukraine, from Kharkov to Odessa. This change of policy led to dropping the early signals about Russia honoring Ukraine’s statehood outside Donbass, and to establishing Russian military government bodies in the territory seized by the Russian forces. Immediately following that, a drive started to de facto integrate these territories with Moscow. By the early fall of 2022, all of Kherson, much of Zaporozhye and part of Kharkov oblasts were being drawn into the Russian economic system; started to use the Russian ruble; adopted the Russian education system; and their population was offered a fast-track way to Russian citizenship. As the fighting in Ukraine quickly became a proxy war between Russia and the US-led West, Russia’s views on Ukraine’s future radicalized further. While a quick cessation of hostilities and a peace settlement on Russian terms in the spring would have left Ukraine, minus Donbass, demilitarized and outside NATO, but otherwise under the present leadership with its virulently anti-Russian ideology and reliance on the West, the new thinking, as Putin’s remarks in Kaliningrad suggest, tends to regard any Ukrainian state that is not fully and securely cleansed of ultranationalist ideology and its agents as a clear and present danger; in fact, a ticking bomb right on Russia’s borders not far from its capital. Under these circumstances, in view of all the losses and hardships sustained, it would not suffice that Russia wins control of what was once known as Novorossiya, the northern coast of the Black Sea all the way to Transnistria. This would mean that Ukraine would be completely cut off from the sea, and Russia would gain – via referenda, it is assumed – a large swath of territory and millions of new citizens. To reach that objective, of course, the Russian forces still need to seize Nikolaev and Odessa in the south, as well as Kharkov in the east. A logical next step would be to expand Russian control to all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper River, as well as the city of Kiev that lies mostly on the right bank. If this were to happen, the Ukrainian state would shrink to the central and western regions of the country. Neither of these outcomes, however, deals with the fundamental problem that Putin has highlighted, that is to say, of Russia having to live side-by-side with a state that will constantly seek revenge and will be used by the United States, which arms and directs it, in its effort to threaten and weaken Russia. This is the main reason behind the argument for taking over the entire territory of Ukraine to the Polish border. However, integrating central and western Ukraine into Russia would be exceedingly difficult, while trying to build a Ukrainian buffer state controlled by Russia would be a major drain on resources, as well as a constant headache. No wonder that some in Moscow would not mind if Poland were to absorb western Ukraine within some form of a common political entity which, Russia’s foreign intelligence claims, is being surreptitiously created. Ukraine’s future will not be dictated, of course, by someone’s wishes, but by the actual developments on the battlefield. Fighting there will continue for some time, and the final outcome is not in sight. Even when the active phase of the conflict comes to an end, it is unlikely to be followed up by a peace settlement. For different reasons, each side regards the conflict as existential – and much wider than Ukraine. This means that what Russia aims for has to be won and then held firmly."
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562398-melitopol-blast-ukraine-referendum/,Bombing targets pro-Russian civilians in Ukraine city,"The offices of the nongovernmental organization ‘Together With Russia’ in Melitopol were bombed on Wednesday evening, the group said on social media. Though the building was damaged, there were no reports of injuries or deaths. ‘Together With Russia’ accused the Ukrainian government of a “terrorist act” after its headquarters on Lomonosov Street were damaged in the explosion. The group distributes humanitarian aid to residents of the Russian-controlled territories in Ukraine’s Zaporozhye Region and advocates for unification with Russia. “The leadership of the terrorist state refuses to abandon the tactic of terrorizing civilians, even though it has failed to work,” the group said in a statement. “All Ukraine can do is fire at civilians at night.” Melitopol is a community of around 150,000 residents in the central Zaporozhye Region. Nearby Berdyansk, also under Russian control, was targeted by drones and artillery on Wednesday. The city’s head of the military-civilian administration was seriously injured in a car bombing on Tuesday. Pro-Russian activists say this is a campaign of terror aimed at intimidating the residents, which overwhelmingly favor rule by the Russian Federation. A poll administered by a Crimean researcher last week showed 83% of the residents were willing to take part in a referendum on joining Russia, and 86% of them would vote in favor. Ukraine has not commented on the latest attack so far. Earlier, the country’s Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk, who is also in charge of the “reintegration of temporarily occupied territories,” said on Saturday that the percentage of people willing to take part in such plebiscites was “tiny, not even two percent.” Those who do take part, Vereschuk told the Ukrainian media, can be convicted for “collaboration” and punished with up to 12 years in prison and confiscation of their property. Kiev has already threatened penalties of up to 15 years in prison to those applying for Russian citizenship and even accepting humanitarian aid from Russia."
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562396-military-governor-alive-blast-ukraine/,Medical chief denies reports of military governor’s death in Ukraine,"Artyom Bardin, the head of the Russian-controlled military-civilian administration in the southern Ukrainian city of Berdyansk, is still alive, a medical chief with the Berdyansk Healthcare Department, Nikolay Miroshnichenko, has confirmed. Bardin was reported dead on Monday after his car was blown up in what the local authorities called a terrorist attack. Bardin was hospitalized in serious condition and the local authorities confirmed his death to journalists later on Monday. Miroshnichenko denied these reports by saying that the military governor is still alive as of Tuesday evening. The official also described the governor’s condition as “serious but stable.”The governor’s car was rocked by an explosion as it was parked near the city administration office. Three other civilian vehicles were damaged in the blast, Russian media outlets reported. Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Zaporozhye Region administration, blamed the attack on the “terrorists of the Zelensky regime,” referring to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. No suspects have been officially identified so far. The city of Berdyansk was seized by Russian forces early in the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev and has remained under Russian control ever since. Monday's attack was not the first one in the city. In late August, the deputy commander of the local traffic police, Aleksandr Kolesnikov, was killed in a similar incident. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that would never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562391-zaporozhye-shelling-ukraine-russia/,"Ukraine bombs nuclear plant, resulting in power cuts – reports","Artillery of the Ukrainian armed forces attacked the area of Energodar and the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant more than a dozen times over the past day, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Wednesday. Three rounds struck inside the NPP, causing damage but no radiation leaks so far. The shelling happened after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visited the facility and issued a report calling for the shelling to stop. “Regardless of the presence of IAEA representatives, the Kiev regime continues its provocations at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, with the goal of creating the threat of a man-made disaster,” the defense ministry in Moscow said, noting that 15 artillery attacks against the city of Energodar and the territory of the ZNPP have been observed over the past 24 hours. Zaporozhye is Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. Along with the nearby city of Energodar, it has been under Russian control since March. Artillery, drone, and rocket attacks began in July, however, damaging cooling systems, power lines, and other facilities. Ukraine has accused Russia of staging false-flag attacks on the plant, but last week admitted its forces have shelled Energodar. Of the 20 rounds fired by Ukrainian artillery from Marganets, due north of Energodar, three struck the nuclear power plant in the areas of reactors one and two, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Wednesday. The shelling reportedly interrupted power supply to Energodar. “Any military activity – such as shelling – within, or in the vicinity of, a nuclear facility has the potential to cause an unacceptable radiological consequence,” the IAEA said in its report on Tuesday. Shelling should be “stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities,” the UN nuclear watchdog demanded, proposing the creation of a “safety zone” around the ZNPP as the way to do this. Russia has rejected the idea of withdrawing troops that provide security for the NPP, saying that Ukraine would use this to seize the facility – as it tried to do during the IAEA visit last week, led by the agency’s Director General Rafael Grossi personally. Grossi has told CNN he wasn’t calling for “demilitarization” but something “more modest.” Moscow’s envoy to the UN bodies in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, told reporters he would ask the IAEA head to elaborate on the idea when they meet later this week."
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562387-putin-borrell-fascist-state/,EU's top diplomat would have backed fascists in 1930s Spain – Putin,"The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, would have likely backed the fascist coup in Spain in the 1930s, Russian President Vladimir Putin said while speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok on Wednesday. The Russian leader’s statement came in response to Borrell describing Russia as a “fascist” state. “He’s just grinding his tongue, he is a great specialist in that area,” said Putin, noting that Borrell’s recent calls for a military victory over Moscow on the battlefield are “strange” coming from the EU’s top diplomat. Putin went on to question whose side Borrell would have taken if he had lived in Spain in the 1930s and seen the signs for General Franco’s coup. “Would he take up arms and whose side would he be on? The democratically elected government of Spain or the putschists?” Putin asked. “In my opinion, he would be on the side of the putschists, because today he supports just the same putschists in Ukraine,” he added, noting that the primary source of Kiev’s power today is the Western-backed armed coup in 2014. “He supports them, and he would have been on the side of the Nazis back then for sure. That’s who is on the side of the Nazis,” Putin proclaimed. The Russian president went on to say that Moscow has long pointed out the neo-Nazi elements of the Kiev regime, but has often heard the response that many countries, including Russia, have neo-Nazis as well. “Yes, we have them. But neither Russia nor any other civilized country promotes Nazis or radical nationalists to the status of national heroes. That’s the difference. And Ukraine is doing precisely that,” he said. Putin stated that if Borrell had any idea who the likes of Bandera and Shukhevich actually were – Nazis that executed Russians, Jews, and Poles – he would have understood that real fascism is prospering in Ukraine and not Russia. “He should be given an opportunity to look reality in the eye and then we can listen to him. If he has even a drop of conscience, he must draw the right conclusions,” the Russian president said. Borrell’s comments about Russia also drew a response from former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, who stated that the EU commissioner’s “disgusting remarks” about Russia being a fascist state should never be forgotten and that the diplomat should be permanently listed as a “non-handshaking creature without the right to pardon.”"
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562365-putin-zaporozhye-npp-report/,Putin comments on UN nuclear watchdog’s report,"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) can’t openly state that the attacks on the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) are being carried out by Kiev, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok on Wednesday, the Russian leader praised the agency as being a responsible international organization with a very professional leader, and stated that he trusts the IAEA’s latest report on the ZNPP. However, Putin noted that the agency is under pressure from the US and other Western nations, and therefore cannot directly accuse Kiev of attacking the nuclear plant. “But this is obvious. We control the station, our servicemen are stationed there. What, are we attacking ourselves?” Putin said, calling the notion completely absurd and adding that the area around the power plant is littered with the remains of HIMARS rockets and other Western munitions. Putin also addressed the IAEA’s request that Russia remove its military equipment from the premises of the ZNPP. He insisted that there is no such equipment at the plant and explained that the only forces stationed there are the Russian National Guard, which is protecting the perimeter and the premises of the station itself. “We can even call journalists there tomorrow, including European and American journalists, to see for themselves,” Putin said, noting that it is obvious the strikes on the power plant and the city of Energodar are coming from across the reservoir where Kiev’s forces are located. Putin further explained that Russia’s military equipment, which is engaged in counter-battery combat, is not located anywhere near the station and has in fact been moved quite far beyond the perimeter of the facility. The Russian leader also expressed his bewilderment at Kiev’s attempts to create a nuclear catastrophe by attacking the power plant, stating that “the Ukrainian side is creating threats to undermine nuclear security.” “Why they do this, I honestly don’t really understand. Just to draw more attention to their situation and create an additional crisis?” He also revealed that Kiev’s operatives have attempted to carry out terrorist attacks on Russian territory, targeting high-voltage power lines connected to Russian nuclear power facilities. “They purposefully work in this direction. What for? What is the point of creating a nuclear threat for the whole of Europe? I do not really understand, but they are doing this.” Putin’s comments come after the IAEA released a report on Tuesday regarding the state of the Russian-controlled Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine. The agency demanded that all attacks on the facility “be stopped immediately” and called for a cessation of any military activity within or in the vicinity of the plant. The report did not identify those responsible for shelling the plant."
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562367-putin-speech-vladivostok-highlights/,Deceiving West and 'detached' elites: Highlights of Putin’s speech at Eastern Economic Forum,"President Vladimir Putin delivered a lengthy speech at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, in Russia’s Far East. Among other things, he commented on the unfolding crisis in the global economy, which he attributed to the shortsightedness of Western elites. According to Putin, they are trying to cling to global power while it slips from their hands. Here are some of the key points Putin made in his address. Western dominance is dwindling The world is facing serious economic challenges, and unlike the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the current turmoil is the result of conscious decisions made by Western nations, Putin said. The West caught “sanctions fever” as it sought to impose its will on other nations.According to the president, though this is nothing new, the current situation is marked by special circumstances – the US is losing its dominance in the global economy and politics, a “tectonic shift” that Western elites are not willing to acknowledge. Elites are ‘lashing out’ “Western nations want to preserve the old world order, which benefits only them, to make everyone follow the ‘rules’ they invented themselves and which they regularly break or change to their benefit,” Putin said.Resistance from other nations “makes Western elites to ‘lash out’ and take shortsighted cavalier decisions affecting world security, politics, and economics” he added. Western leaders are ‘detached’ from their people The policies adopted by the leaders of the US and its allies run counter to the public’s interests, which they are supposed to protect – this shows the Western elites are “detached from their own people,” according to Putin.EU governments are a good example – they decided to decouple their economies from Russia, denying their businesses affordable energy and access to the Russian market, which makes them unable to compete, he said. Putin predicted that American companies would lead the charge to capture the market shares of businesses based in the EU as a result. “When [the Americans] pursue their interests, they don’t limit themselves or shy away from anything.” The West deceives poor nations The global economic crisis will hurt vulnerable nations worst of all, according to the president – for many people, it’s a life-and-death situation, as impoverished countries will have no ability to buy crucial products.Meanwhile, Western nations pretend they want to help while only doing what is in their own interests, as exemplified by the Ukraine grain export deal, according to Putin. Russia agreed to help ships loaded with grain to leave Ukrainian ports under an arrangement mediated by Turkey and the UN in July. However, most of the ships have gone to EU nations rather than struggling countries, the president said. “Just two ships out of 87 were loaded [in Ukraine] under the UN Food Program, which works to provide assistance to needy countries… just 3% that were sent to developing nations.”According to Putin, Western nations have decades and even centuries of experience in plundering colonies, and are using the same approach today. In order to prevent humanitarian disasters, Russia suggests limiting the destinations for Ukrainian grain to change the situation. Russia is weathering the sanctions Russia is dealing with the damage caused by the West’s “economic, financial and technological aggression” relatively well, Putin said. He noted that the country’s financial system had been stabilized, inflation is going down, and unemployment is at record lows.Some companies were indeed hurt, especially those whose business depended on Europe in some way, he said. The Russian government has mechanisms in place to support them. Asian nations want cooperation Most of the nations in the Asia-Pacific Region (APAC) reject “the destructive logic of sanctions” and seek to foster business ties and economic growth for the benefit of their people, Putin said. Russia appreciates players that share its attitude to national sovereignty. The abundance of countries like this in APAC is “its great competitive advantage” and a source of long-term development. Russia did not start the conflict in Ukraine When asked by the host for comments on how the crisis in Ukraine has affected Russia, he reiterated Moscow’s position that the conflict was forced upon it.“We did not start anything in terms of military action. We are trying to end it. Military action was started in 2014, following an armed coup in Ukraine by those who did not want normal development and sought to subjugate their own people, carrying out one military action after another, and subjecting Donbass citizens to genocide for eight years.” Russia decided to use military force eight years later. Doing so was a moral obligation to the people of Donbass, who Moscow could not protect through peaceful means, Putin said. In the end, Russia will emerge from the conflict stronger domestically and internationally, he added."
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562353-putin-operation-russia-sovereignty/,Ukraine operation has been 'beneficial' for Russia – Putin,"Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine and its global effects have only benefited Russia, President Vladimir Putin claimed on Wednesday while speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. When asked about what Russia has gained and lost as a result of the military campaign launched in late February, Putin stated that Russia has not and will not lose anything. Instead, it has only strengthened its sovereignty, he claimed. “Yes, there is a certain polarization going on both in the world and within the country, but I believe this will only work to our benefit. Because everything unnecessary, harmful and preventing us from moving forward will be rejected,” Putin said, adding that Russia will inevitably “pick up the pace of development,” which he says can only be based on sovereignty. “All our steps are aimed at strengthening our sovereignty,” the Russian leader proclaimed. He went on to point out that he doesn’t consider Russia’s activities in Ukraine to be the beginning of the military action, but rather that the operation is Moscow’s attempt to end the hostilities in the region. “The military actions began in 2014 after the coup in Ukraine, when those who did not want peaceful development and sought to suppress their own people conducted one military operation after another and conducted genocide against the people of Donbas for eight years,” said Putin. Russia decided to carry out a mirror response after all attempts at a peaceful resolution to the conflict failed, he said, adding that Russia’s actions were “deliberate” and aimed at helping those who live in Donbas. “This is our duty and we will fulfill it to the end,” Putin stated, adding that “ultimately, this will lead to the strengthening of our country, both from within and from a foreign policy standpoint.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562342-russia-ukraine-grain-deal-exports/,Moscow sounds alarm over Ukrainian grain deal,"The grain deal with Ukraine which was supposed to allow Russia to deliver fertilizers and food products to global markets has failed to do so, Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s permanent representative to the UN, claimed on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters, Nebenzia revealed that not a single Russian vessel with grain has managed to leave port, despite an earlier UN- and Turkey-brokered agreement that unblocked Ukrainian grain shipments via the Black Sea in exchange for lifting restrictions on Russian exports of the product. The diplomat hinted that Russia could refuse to extend the deal, given that the provisions on its exports are not being fulfilled. “The agreement was concluded for four months. In other words, it ends in November. In a normal [situation], the deal should be extended. Given the results, or rather the lack of results, I do not rule out anything.” “We want to see the implementation of the Russian part of the agreement. So far, this hasn’t happened,” Nebenzia said. His comments echo earlier remarks from Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said on Tuesday that Western countries had not fulfilled their promise to lift secondary restrictions on Russian grain and fertilizers, impeding their access to the global market. The deal to unblock grain exports via the Black Sea was signed at UN-brokered talks in Istanbul in late July, aiming to maintain safe transit routes. In late August, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said there “are no problems” with Ukrainian grain shipments, adding that dozens of vessels have been able to pass through. Wheat deliveries from Ukraine, a major producer, were disrupted after Russia launched its military operation in the neighboring state in late February. The two sides traded accusations over who was responsible for the stoppage of cargo traffic out of the Ukrainian ports. Since August 1, however, when shipments from the ports resumed, they have delivered around 2 million tons of food products to global markets."
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562338-zakharova-truss-crisis-democracy/,Truss becoming PM signals ‘crisis of democracy’ in UK – Moscow,"The selection of Liz Truss as prime minister signals a “crisis of democracy” in the UK, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday. Asked by TASS whether Truss will be a disaster for Britain, Zakharova replied that if “shop owners are decorating the window in this way, then they believe this is the best item they have in stock today.” Sometimes, the spokeswoman claimed, countries with large populations and long-standing democratic traditions make you wonder if they really do not have anyone that can “adequately, professionally, and intelligently represent the various branches of government.” Perhaps the problem is in the crisis of British democracy, because this ‘result’ has nothing to do with the direct choice of the British people, since the system of indirect elections dominates the Anglo-Saxon duo. Truss, formerly the foreign secretary in Boris Johnson’s Conservative government, officially became prime minister on Tuesday. The day before, she was revealed as the winner of the Tory leadership election. She received 81,326 voters, while her competitor, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, was backed by 60,399. A YouGov poll published on the same day showed that half of the people in the UK are ‘disappointed’ about Truss taking over as prime minister, with one-third ‘very disappointed.’ Even among members of the ruling party, 54% do not have much confidence in Truss’ ability to tackle the cost-of-living crisis, and around one-third are ‘disappointed’ that she will lead the government. Truss’ visit to Russia in February – amid tensions in Ukraine in the run-up to the launch of Moscow’s military operation – was remembered by many for a gaffe made by the then-foreign secretary. Truss confused the Russian regions of Voronezh and Rostov with Ukrainian regions, and told her counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, that London would never recognize Russia’s sovereignty over these areas. According to reports, she was then allegedly corrected by Deborah Bronnert, the UK ambassador. Lavrov described the meeting with the foreign secretary as talking “to a deaf person.” Zakharova later mocked what she called the “mind-blowing stupidity” of Truss."
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562345-putin-western-sanctions-fever/,Western ‘sanctions fever’ hurts the world – Putin,"Western nations are hurting everyone, including their own people, in an attempt to preserve global dominance that is slipping from their hands, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. The unfolding global economic crisis was triggered by “Western elites, who would not, or even cannot acknowledge objective facts” about global changes, he said during a speech at an economic event in Russia on Wednesday. Leaders in the US and their allies are seeking to preserve “the world order that benefits only them, forcing everyone to live under the rules, which they invented and which they regularly break and constantly change depending on the situation,” he added. Facing opposition from nations that don’t want to bend to their will, the US and its allies “lash out” and take shortsighted decisions that hurt not only the dissenters, but also their own nations, Putin stated, noting a “growing detachment” of Western elites from the common people. The Russian president cited surging inflation in the EU as the most telling example, noting that standards of living in the bloc were being sacrificed to American interests. “The EU authorities are denying European businesses accessible raw materials, energy and markets” by the decision to decouple from Russia, Putin said. It will be no surprise when the market shares of European businesses, both in the continent and globally, will be taken by their American patrons. When they pursue their interests, they don’t limit themselves or shy away from anything. Meanwhile Russia, the target of Western “sanctions fever” and other forms of unfair competition, is doing relatively well, Putin said. The country enjoys a relatively low level of inflation that is going down, record-low unemployment and other factors of macroeconomic stability, he commented. Sure, Russian businesses that depended on the EU were hurt, but overall, the country managed to deal with the Western “aggression”, Putin said. The Russian president was speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. The annual event is aimed at fostering closer ties in the region and is held for the seventh time this year."
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562332-west-deceived-poor-nations-grain-putin/,West deceived poor nations with Ukraine grain deal – Putin,"Western nations lied when they claimed Ukraine needed access to sea shipping to alleviate surging food prices and the risk of famine in poor countries, Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted. Most of the cargoes that came out of Ukraine under a Turkey- and UN-brokered deal with Russia went to the EU, Putin stated in a speech at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia on Wednesday. He added that he terms of the arrangement should probably be changed. Putin made the remarks in reference to the arrangement allowing civilian ships to enter and leave Ukrainian Black Sea ports to deliver grain cargoes. The scheme was put into action in late July, with Turkey hosting a center that coordinates the deliveries. The Russian leader noted that the deal was touted as a way to curb the surging global prices and help the most struggling nations. In practice, almost all of the grain shipped from Ukraine went to wealthy EU nations, he said. Many European nations acted in decades and centuries past as colonizers, and they act in the same way today. They simply deceived developing nations once again. And they keep up the deceit. With an attitude like this, problems with food availability will only grow worse, Putin warned. On August 30, the UN Food Program reported that it had sent a second shipment with food assistance from Ukraine. The ship was carrying 37,000 metric tons of wheat grain to Yemen. Putin stressed that just two ships out of more than 80 that left Ukraine were actually traveling on hunger relief missions. Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Western nations of failing to remove secondary restrictions on the export of food and fertilizers from Russia after the Ukraine deal was reached. The UN, which co-signed the agreement with Turkey, pledged to use its clout to have the restrictions lifted. The economic forum hosted by Russia is an annual event focused on regional cooperation in Asia. Putin was taking part in a plenary session on the second day of the event, along with officials from Armenia, China, Myanmar, and Mongolia."
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562079-ukraine-military-coup/,"Alexander Nepogodin: As the media speculates about plots to oust Zelensky, how secure is Ukraine's Western-backed leader?","As fighting rages on in Ukraine, President Vladimir Zelensky seems determined to consolidate power. It's part of a process that began long before Russia launched its military offensive in February. The Western-backed leader has suppressed criticism and clamped down on the opposition; beyond that, he is purging the political arena of allegedly ‘disloyal’ people who, until recently, had appeared to be close associates and allies. For example not long ago, Prosecutor-General Irina Venediktova and the head of Ukraine’s Security Service Ivan Bakanov, a childhood friend of Zelensky, were both fired from their posts. However, it appears that the president remains deeply vulnerable to political intrigues within the country’s elites. In light of recent developments, both Western and Ukrainian media often claim Kiev's military is dissatisfied with the situation in the country. Journalists have even named a possible post-conflict successor to the ‘Ukrainian Churchill,’ as Zelensky is sometimes called – namely, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, General Valery Zaluzhny. Zelensky himself dismisses these claims as speculation, an attempt to promote hostile narratives and ‘rock the boat.’ Here, RT explores the reasons behind the escalating tensions between Zelensky and Zaluzhny, and explains why Ukraine appears to be drifting toward dictatorship. There's a rumor circulating in the media that Zelensky is willing to remove Zaluzhny. The Telegraph portal speculates that he will probably be replaced by Commander of the Ground Forces Alexander Syrsky. Meanwhile, Zaluzhny, whose popularity with the Ukrainian people is growing rapidly, is likely to be appointed minister of defense, the story goes. Formally, this would be a promotion for the incumbent commander-in-chief, but in reality it means losing control and influence over the army, because, according to Ukrainian law, the minister of defense must be a civilian. Another possible, widely publicized, scenario is that the current Minister of Defense, Aleksey Reznikov, will head the government while Zaluzhny takes over defense and the present Chief of Defense Intelligence, Kirill Budanov, will replace Zaluzhny as commander-in-chief. The Telegraph suggests the motive behind such potential machinations is jealousy. “It’s not about ratings. Zelensky and Zaluzhny have perfectly fine relations, but you see, the victory can only be ‘fathered’ by one man,” a Ukrainian MP told the news portal. Zaluzhny reportedly doesn’t welcome any such changes but despite this, rotations in the country’s military leadership could take place as early as this month. A conflict between the Ukrainian president and his military commanders has become a topic for discussion in Russia as well. In response to projections in several Western media outlets about conflict-resolution scenarios, the Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Security Council Dmitry Medvedev shared his own vision of the situation. He believes there is but a “one and a half scenario” – “a military coup in Ukraine followed by recognition of the special operation’s results.” Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has recently joined the chorus of voices discussing a possible conflict between Zelensky and Ukraine’s top military commanders led by Zaluzhny. “Ukraine is being carved up, and a conflict is brewing between the president and the military. They are the only ones who can slam their fists on the table and say, ‘Let’s reach agreement, otherwise Ukraine will be wiped off from the face of the earth.’ The outcome is close. The president can’t say a word there any longer, nothing depends on the president in Ukraine now, but on the military,” Lukashenko said. Both Zelensky and Zaluzhny deny the existence of any conflict between them. Ukraine’s administration asserts that these rumors are nothing more than hostile propaganda, deliberately spread to sow dissent within the country’s top military apparatus. Zelensky himself has publicly stated that Zaluzhny and the team are doing their job well. “No, I have no plans to reassign him to a different position (...). We’ve got a team. Is the team doing its job well? As you can see, we are still holding strong. So, yes, they are doing a good job. And once we are victorious, I’ll be the first to praise them,” said Zelensky in response to a question from the media. The press interpreted these statements in their own way: rumors quickly began to spread that Zelensky had refused to replace Zaluzhny, fearing a blow to his own reputation. Many believe that the Ukrainian President's Office wants to suppress the narrative about Zaluzhny becoming a viable opponent to Zelensky, an ‘inconvenient’ ally. Essentially, Zelensky wants to create a scenario in which his top military man could be removed from the political scene: it is much harder to fire Zaluzhny when his name is all over the internet. Ironically, it could be social media that ‘insures’ the commander-in-chief against a potential discharge. Curiously, speculation about the conflict between Zelensky and Zaluzhny is blamed not on external, but domestic forces. Back in early August, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) uncovered a clandestine ‘bot farm’ involved in domestic propaganda, which the media linked to affiliates of former President Pyotr Poroshenko. One of its media campaigns was said to be aimed at “spreading information about a conflict between the leadership of the Office of the President of Ukraine and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine”. It was alleged that there was also a campaign to discredit the First Lady. In light of these findings, an adviser to Zelensky, Aleksey Arestovich, accused the opposition, and specifically the European Solidarity party run by Poroshenko, of pursuing its own political ambitions that would “drag Ukraine again into a political crisis that will lead to a military defeat.” According to Arestovich, media operations run by the ‘bot farmers’ slowed down weapons deliveries to Ukraine and promoted the narrative of a brewing conflict between Zelensky and Zaluzhny. “The people in the opposition fail to realize that this sort of work could cost more for Ukraine than direct attacks by Russian troops. A lack of unity between the government and the army, between the government and the people, is a sure path toward statelessness and defeat (...). This is a purely domestic hoax, circulated in the media since April or so. Russian propaganda has picked up these fakes and spun them to their advantage. They benefit from advancing this narrative,” he said. Whatever the case, as open hostilities continue in Ukraine, Valery Zaluzhny finds his popularity steadily growing, and not only among Ukrainians. Recently, major stories have been published in Western media glorifying the man, calling him ‘the iron general’; they also predict that he could take over as president after Zelensky. The German newspaper Bild, for example, published an article saying that “the general gives Ukraine hope” and is a hero not only for the soldiers, but also for a large part of the population. “Observers believe that the acclaimed general will replace current President Vladimir Zelensky once the war is over,” writes Bild. The newspaper also hints at potential tensions between the president and the general, noting that “incumbent President Zelensky is not particularly happy about the speculations that he may one day leave the presidential residence.” Bild is not the only Western media outlet to have praised Zaluzhny. Earlier, the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza published an extensive piece about the general, calling him “the first ataman (meaning ‘chieftain’) of Ukraine.” Essentially, the newspaper bestowed on him the title once held by Semyon Petliura – head of the Directorate of the Ukrainian People’s Republic in 1919-1920 and an ally to the Poles. “If Michelangelo were to carve a figure of General Zaluzhny based on his publications on the Internet, the result would be a mix between David and Moses,” the newspaper writes, noting that ordinary Ukrainians view the general as a celebrity figure. While glorifying Zaluzhny, Western media started to pillory Zelensky. A series of articles were published bashing the president. The German newspaper Die Welt, The New York Times, Sky News Australia all accused Ukraine’s president of being uncooperative in the international arena, of abetting corruption within Ukraine, exhausting the country's armed forces, and launching a ‘draconian’ mobilization effort. Amid all this, Zaluzhny became more and more concerned with his own political image. As Bild published its complimentary article about the general, he released a lengthy video message to his compatriots in celebration of Ukraine’s Independence Day – at the same time as Zelensky published his own address to the nation. The video consisted of Zaluzhny’s quotes interspersed with lines from Ukraine’s servicemen. “How do you know you are truly independent?” asks Zaluzhny. “Our independence was gifted to us. Real independence is earned in blood,” answers a soldier in the video. “Those who fight for it know what it tastes like. It tastes of earth, of blood and death that permeates the air,” Zaluzhny says. The soldiers in the video talk about the importance of unity for the sake of victory; they talk about strength, resilience and of their willingness to defend their homeland. As rumors spread about the removal of Zaluzhny, Ukrainian media has become flooded with reports of an imminent reshuffle in the government. High-ranking sources of the popular Strana.ua (banned by Zelensky) claim that, although the Office of the President of Ukraine has not yet finalized the list of new appointments, they are expecting some high-profile resignations: there is a strong possibility that some ministers will be fired and even [Prime Minister] Denis Shmigal’s government will be dissolved. Back in late July, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Alexei Danilov announced that firing Venediktova and Bakanov was just the beginning. “I’ve heard some names, but I prefer to work with actual documents. Most likely, these were not the only people to be removed, and we will see some more developments soon,” Danilov commented. Removing Bakanov and Venediktova was the most high-profile sacking since the start of the military operation. Zelensky said his decision was motivated by the large number of traitors in the SBU and the prosecutor-general’s office. According to the president, more than sixty SBU agents remained in territories occupied by Russian troops and started working against Ukraine’s interests. Overall, local law enforcers are investigating hundreds of cases of alleged treason and collaborationism. One of the loudest investigations is against the former head of the SBU Crimea Office, based in Kherson, which Ukraine lost control of back in March. Local government spokesman Aleksandr Samoilenko accused the branch of treason, saying its officers had betrayed Ukraine by revealing a network of minefields to Russia and providing assistance to its air force. Similar charges were brought against former SBU internal security chief General Andrey Naumov, who fled Ukraine but was detained in Serbia in June. Bakanov and Zelensky were partners in a television production studio, Kvartal 95. He later headed Zelensky’s electoral staff and was the leader of his party Servant of the People. Venediktova had been Zelensky’s ally well before his presidency and also headed Ukraine’s State Bureau of Investigation. However, it seems that even close personal connections to the president could not help the two avoid the boot. At the same time, the SBU launched a criminal investigation into former deputy secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Major General Sergey Krivonos, recently criticized by Zelensky for commenting on the military leadership. Notably, Krivonos is a somewhat popular figure in Ukraine. Back in 2019, he registered as candidate for the presidency, but he later withdrew in favor of Poroshenko. Krivonos believes the persecution against him was ordered by Zelensky, on account of the major-general’s popularity, especially with the military. “The top leadership of the SBU were frank about it when they told me: Supreme Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Zelensky issued an illegal order to revoke my enlistment into the military so as to prevent Valery Zaluzhny from appointing me to senior positions. Zelensky views me as a rival. Before the war, I was dismissed from the army over my criticism of Zelensky’s inaction in the defense sphere and the failure of the Office of the President and the Ministry of Defense to prepare Ukraine for Russian aggression,” Krivonos claimed. He said that in the early days of Russia’s military operation, Zaluzhny had verbally instructed him to defend Kiev’s Zhuliany airport and then issued a personal order confirming Krivonos’s authority to do so. But in late March, it turned out that the order to enlist Krivonos had been canceled. “I found out from the army leadership that this was done by order of Commander-in-Chief Zelensky. My sources told me plainly: ‘The people at the top believe that victory is at hand, and that after the war there should be only one war hero – the Supreme Commander. He thinks you will get in his way,’” Krivonos said. However, so far, Zelensky’s popularity, having now firmly established his image as the ‘Ukrainian Churchill,’ continues to remain high: more than 90% of Ukrainians trust him. Moreover, the country’s population is not against bolstering authoritarian tendencies. According to a survey from the Kiev International Institute of Sociology (KIIS), 58% of Ukrainians believe that having a strong leader is more important for the country than democracy. Only 14% of respondents think democracy is still more important. At the same time, 62% of respondents say that, in the current situation, even constructive criticism of the Ukrainian government should not be allowed, and all parties and political forces should unite to support Zelensky. All this provides Zelensky with great opportunities for consolidating power – a trend that began long before the outbreak of hostilities. The process of tightening the screws began back in 2020, when pressure was brought to bear on political opponents, and continued with bans on media outlets outside of the government's control, including pro-Russian ones. This was accompanied by a campaign against shadow economic elites and organized crime gangs, as well as various kinds of smugglers. Then Zelensky began to mop up potential internal challengers. This is evidenced, for example, by the resignation of Ukraine’s Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov, in the fall of 2021. In parallel, all of Zelensky’s key opponents in government have had problems with law enforcement agencies. These include Yulia Tymoshenko, Pyotr Poroshenko, Vitali Klitschko, Viktor Medvedchuk, and Anatoly Shariy. In October of 2021, Dmitry Razumkov was removed from his post as Speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada. There were strategic motives behind this move from the very beginning, namely, eliminating competitors for Zelensky’s second term. Razumkov could have become a potential ‘new Zelensky,’ or might at least have split the current team during new presidential elections. It was Razumkov who had long been second inside the party in power, in terms of ratings and position in the political system. Personal relationships also play a part in this situation. During the last year before his dismissal, Razumkov refrained from supporting the decisions of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (NSDC), the president’s advisory agency, and, instead, came out with his own initiatives on key issues: The Constitutional Court of Ukraine, land reform, illegal enrichment, and de-oligarchization. In other words, Razumkov had his own position and proposals, and they were often the ones that passed through parliament, and not ones Zelensky wanted to accept. This ended up spoiling their relationship. The campaign against the opposition has led to significant changes in Ukraine’s political processes, with the center of power shifting towards the executive branch and even the law enforcement sector. In particular, most decision-making authority has moved to one specific body – the NSDC – whose composition Zelensky personally determines and whose decisions are put into effect by his decree. And thanks to the law ‘On Sanctions,’ which allows economic restrictions to be imposed on any Ukrainian considered a threat to ‘national security,’ the NSDC’s powers have become nearly limitless. All accounts and assets of a person falling under such sanctions are blocked, and it becomes impossible for them to conduct financial activities. If we add to this the draft law ‘On Media,’ according to which even unregistered media outlets that distribute objectionable information are subject to blocking, a curious picture emerges. Zelensky is rigidly and uncompromisingly centralizing power, and decisions bypass the existing – albeit not ideal, but functioning – legal system. And in this sense, the answer to the question of what changes may occur in Ukraine’s top echelons of power during Russia’s military operation is unambiguous. Anything is possible. After all, as the history of Zelensky’s relations with his inner circle demonstrates, the Ukrainian president believes that he is the sole power in the country – he is the team, and others are just his assistants. All this resulted in an internal political crisis back in 2021. The fact that the West’s honeymoon with Zelensky appears to be nearly over also increases the likelihood that a large-scale crisis looms on the horizon, at a crucial moment for Ukraine as an independent country. There has been more and more criticism of Zelensky as of late, and the search for new heroes has become more active. Another power struggle likely lies ahead."
2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/562326-nebenzia-rogov-zaporozhye-iaea/,Russia responds to UN nuclear plant report,"It is regrettable that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) failed to identify the culprit for the shelling of the Zaporozhye power plant, while its proposal to demilitarize the facility is “not serious,” Russia’s permanent representative to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, said on Tuesday. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi personally led a team of inspectors to the Russian-held facility last week, and witnessed an artillery attack firsthand. However, the IAEA report on the visit, published earlier on Tuesday, made no mention of who was shelling the Zaporozhye NPP, even though the Ukrainian General Staff has publicly admitted to targeting nearby Energodar. “I cannot make that determination,” Grossi told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. “We do not have the means to do that. As you know, you would need to be looking or monitoring the military operation in the region and all its vastness, which is not only beyond the mandate of the IAEA, but would require enormous capabilities.” Nebenzia, who has previously provided evidence of Ukrainian culpability to the UN, said the watchdog’s reluctance was regrettable. He also noted that Kiev made a “monstrous attempt” to capture the power plant during the IAEA team’s visit. Grossi’s proposal to demilitarize Zaporozhye is “not serious,” Nebenzia told journalists in New York, explaining that Russian troops are providing security to the plant and withdrawing them would allow Ukraine to seize it. “It is not militarized, anyway,” the Russian envoy to the UN said, adding that “there is no artillery there, only trucks used to transport the guards” who protect the facility. The IAEA report mentioned this as well. UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres has called on both Kiev and Moscow to “not engage in military activities” in and around the nuclear power plant. Grossi told CNN he wasn’t calling for “demilitarization” but something “more modest,” calling it a “nuclear safety and security protection zone” that would get a “commitment from all sides to avoid any aiming at the plant, any shelling at the plant.” Russian troops secured Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in early March, and it functioned normally until mid-July, when Moscow says Ukrainian forces began attacking it with drones and US-supplied artillery. Kiev had claimed that Russia was staging false-flag attacks to make Ukraine look bad, while stationing heavy weapons inside the facility. The IAEA “abdicated its duty” and “turned a blind eye” to the Ukrainian shelling, even after being presented with exhaustive evidence of Kiev’s culpability, Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Zaporozhye civilian-military administration, told RIA Novosti."
2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/562324-military-governor-killed-blast-ukraine/,Military governor killed in blast in southeastern Ukraine,"Artyom Bardin, the head of the Russian-controlled military-civilian administration in the southern Ukrainian city of Berdyansk, died on Tuesday after being severely injured in a car blast. His vehicle had been blown up earlier that day in an attack local authorities blamed on Ukrainian “infiltrators.” The city of Berdyansk was seized by Russian forces early in the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev and has remained under Russian control ever since. A powerful explosion hit Bardin’s car as it was parked near the local administration office. Three other civilian vehicles were damaged in the blast, Russian media outlets reported. Photos that surfaced on social media showed the official’s car burnt to ashes. Who was behind the attack is still unclear. The local authorities had previously said that they were still searching for a Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance unit. Bardin was reportedly the only person injured in the blast. The man was hospitalized in serious condition and his death was later confirmed by the local administration. “According to our information, he succumbed to his wounds,” Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Zaporozhye Region administration, told journalists. ⚡️Раненый при взрыве машины в центре Бердянска ""комендант города"" Артем Бардин госпитализирован в тяжелом состоянии в больницу... pic.twitter.com/UqKbeKiuwF Rogov also said that the local authorities considered the incident a terrorist attack perpetrated by the “terrorists of the Zelensky regime,” referring to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. It is not the first such case in the Russian-controlled southern Ukrainian region. In late August, the deputy commander of local traffic police in Berdyansk, Alexander Kolesnikov, was killed in a similar incident. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that would never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."

She is feeling fine after the flight. We hope the animal will recover,” Radionova wrote on Telegram. The injured animal was spotted on Dikson Island in Krasnoyarsk Region on Monday. According to local worker Dmitry Kalashnikov, the incident occurred on September 3. The bear got too close to a man who fired his gun in self-defense. According to Radionova, the wounded animal was sedated and airlifted by helicopter from the village to an airport in Norilsk. Veterinarians in Moscow examined the animal and found multiple gunshot wounds, presumably from homemade buckshot. The polar bear is currently being treated with antibiotics and painkillers, and is being prepared for surgery. This is the second time a polar bear has approached people in Dikson in the past two months. In late July, a polar bear that had a metal can stuck in its mouth was rescued from near death by Moscow veterinarians. The can was successfully removed and the animal was released into the wild."
2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/562312-moscow-promise-west-breaking/,Moscow accuses West of breaking ‘grain deal’ pledge,"Western countries have not fulfilled their promise to lift sanctions on Russian grain and fertilizers to allow them to reach world markets, the country’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, explained on Tuesday. The commitment was part of a deal brokered by the UN and Turkey and signed in Istanbul in July to unblock Ukraine’s grain exports and ease a looming global food crisis. Lavrov stressed that “artificially inflated” Western claims that Russian actions in Ukraine had undermined the stability of the global food market are “absolutely not the case.” “On the contrary, our Western colleagues are not doing what we were promised by the UN secretary general, namely, they are not making a decision to remove logistical sanctions that prevent free access of Russian grain and fertilizers to world markets,” the minister pointed out at a joint press conference with his Thai counterpart, Don Pramudwinai. Lavrov added that Russia continues to work with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and his team to ensure the organization fulfills its obligations under the Istanbul agreements. Wheat deliveries from Ukraine, a major producer, were disrupted after Russia launched its military operation in the neighboring state in late February. The two sides traded accusations over who was responsible for the stoppage of cargo traffic out of Ukrainian ports. Since August 1, however, when shipments from the ports resumed, 92 vessels have departed, bringing more than 2 million tons of food goods to global markets."
2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/562314-iaea-zaporozhye-nuclear-shelling/,UN team issues report on under-fire Ukrainian nuclear site,"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has called for an end to all military activity around the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant and insisted that shelling in the area must stop. The agency’s report on the situation in Ukraine, published on Tuesday, stopped short of identifying the culprits targeting the Russian-held facility. “Any military activity – such as shelling – within, or in the vicinity of, a nuclear facility has the potential to cause an unacceptable radiological consequence,” the IAEA report said, adding that the “seven pillars” of nuclear safety “have all been compromised at the site.” “The IAEA recommends that shelling on site and in its vicinity should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities, for the safety of the operating staff and to maintain the physical integrity to support safe and secure operation,” the agency said, adding that this would require “agreement by all relevant parties to the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP.” Zaporozhye is Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. Along with the nearby city of Energodar, it has been under Russian control since March. Artillery, drone, and rocket attacks began in July, however, damaging cooling systems, power lines, and other facilities. The Russian military has named the specific Ukrainian artillery units carrying out the attacks and provided their locations to the UN. Kiev has accused Moscow of using the plant as a base for heavy artillery and equipment, but also denied responsibility for the shelling, calling it a Russian false-flag operation to make Ukraine look bad. Last week, however, the Ukrainian General Staff admitted to targeting Energodar and claimed that all Russian “military equipment” had been relocated from the ZNPP ahead of the IAEA’s visit. The inspectors contradicted this, saying they had observed Russian “military personnel, vehicles and equipment at various places at the ZNPP,” providing security. Kiev and its Western backers had previously demanded the establishment of a 30-kilometer demilitarized zone around the Zaporozhye NPP, but Moscow rejected this as unacceptable, pointing to continued Ukrainian artillery attacks on the site. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi personally led the mission to Zaporozhye, dubbed ISAMZ, on September 2. The facility came under artillery attack during the visit, while Ukrainian commandos attempted to seize the plant after crossing the Kakhovka Reservoir by boat, according to the Russian Defense Ministry."
2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/562308-zaporozhye-npp-fuel-oil-leak/,Water supply to Zaporozhye nuclear site contaminated – authorities,"The latest round of shelling by Ukrainian forces at the Russian-controlled areas around the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power plant have caused a fuel oil leak, the head of the administration of Energodar Alexander Volga said on Tuesday. The official explained that Ukrainian strikes targeting a thermal power plant in the city of Energodar hit a fuel oil tank, which leaked into a channel supplying water to the Zaporozhye NPP. He stated that specialists are now working in the area to stop the leak. Energodar officials also said that Kiev’s forces continue to carry out strikes on the plant despite the presence of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors at the facility. The UN’s nuclear watchdog visited the Zaporozhye NPP last week to conduct an inspection of the plant and assess its condition. After being shown the facility and conducting interviews with both Russian and Ukrainian personnel on the ground, the delegation left the facility on Monday leaving behind two of its members. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said the agency would “establish a continued presence” at the plant. While Grossi has publicly confirmed that the power plant had been damaged as a result of shelling, he has so far refrained from assigning blame to any one side. A report by the agency is expected to be published on Tuesday. Moscow has repeatedly accused Kiev’s forces of attacking the plant, warning that further shelling could trigger a nuclear catastrophe on par with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Kiev, however, denies targeting the plant and insists that it is Russian forces that are shelling the area while stationing military hardware there."
2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/562302-putin-donbass-visit-peskov/,Kremlin explains when Putin could visit Donbass,"Russian President Vladimir Putin will certainly pay a visit to Donbass, but the date for such a trip hasn’t been set yet, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov has said. “As for the president's trip [to the People’s Republics of Donetsk (DPR) and Lugansk (LPR)], I have no doubts that when the right time comes such a visit will take place,” Peskov told the newspaper Izvestia on Tuesday. He also said that Moscow has “vast plans” in terms of rebuilding Donbass, which has ended up being the main battlefield in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. “You can see that construction is underway, and new facilities are being commissioned. Vigorous efforts are being undertaken in order to restore all essential utility systems. Those are water pipelines, energy supply, social facilities. Hard work is underway, and many many thousands of people are involved in it,” the spokesman pointed out. The most high-ranking officials from Moscow to visit Donbass so far have been Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, who inspected the Russian troops in both the DPR and LPR in July, and parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, who traveled to Lugansk the same month with a group of MPs. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/562290-vostok-exercise-main-goal/,Goal of Russia-hosted multinational drills revealed,"The main objective of the Russia-hosted international Vostok 2022 exercise is to prepare the participating nations for deploying troops in a possible regional peacekeeping operation, a top Russian general has said. The war games have involved over 50,000 servicemen, including more than 2,000 visiting troops. A total of 15 nations are taking part in the drills, which are being held between September 1 and 7 in Russia’s Far East. The exercise includes general staff training for military commanders and maneuvers in the field for troops. Nine of the foreign participants have sent soldiers to train alongside the Russian forces. The main goal of the high-profile event is “to create a coalition force that would plan and implement a special military operation aimed at ensuring peace and security in the region,” Major General Vladimir Omelyanovich said on Tuesday, according to a video released by Zvezda TV, the official media outlet of the Russian Defense Ministry. Gen. Omelyanovich, who served as the head of the general staff of the coalition force, complimented all members for doing their jobs in a timely and professional manner. “Despite quite difficult weather conditions, all military contingents taking part in the strategic exercise acted laudably and completed their tasks in full,” the senior official told journalists against the backdrop of a downpour of cold rain. Vostok 2022 is part of a series of exercises that the Russian military stages each year in various parts of the country. This year’s event involved a large number of foreign participants. The guest list included Azerbaijan, Algeria, Armenia, Belarus, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Syria, Myanmar, and Tajikistan. Myanmar was added to the list after the exercise was launched last week."
2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/news/562285-total-hybrid-war-ryabkov/,Total war declared against Russia – Moscow,"A total war has been declared against Russia, and it’s being waged in hybrid forms in all areas, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has claimed. “The seriousness of the current period shouldn’t be underestimated,” Ryabkov warned in an interview with the magazine International Affairs on Tuesday. “A total war has been declared against us. It’s being waged in hybrid forms, in all areas,” the diplomat said, apparently referring to the lavish military and financial aid provided to Ukraine by the US, EU and other countries amid its conflict with Russia, as well as the harsh sanctions imposed on Moscow by the West. “The degree of animosity of our opponents – of our enemies – is enormous, extraordinary,” Ryabkov pointed out. Moscow has warned on many occasions that foreign help to Kiev only escalates the fighting in Ukraine and puts Russia on a collision course with the US-led NATO bloc. However, the deputy FM offered the reminder that “Russia has always, throughout its history, proved that it passes the most difficult trials with honor and emerges from them even stronger.” According to Ryabkov, “this will be case this time as well.”"
2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/news/562281-kremlin-biden-sponsor-terrorism/,Kremlin comments on Biden’s reluctance to blacklist Russia,"Moscow welcomes US President Joe Biden’s opposition to designating Russia a state sponsor of terrorism, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday. “Of course, it’s a good thing that the US president said 'no',” Peskov told the business outlet RBK, referring to Biden’s response to a question he was asked while speaking to reporters at the White House about whether he believes Russia should be branded a state sponsor of terrorism. “The very fact that this question was asked is horrendous,” he said, adding that the existence of such an issue is “very difficult to wrap one’s mind around.”The official, however, cautioned that such a statement from the US leader could not be viewed as a signal of Washington embracing a softer stance on Russia amid the ongoing Ukraine conflict. Nor would he link Biden’s statement to the recent visit of inspectors from the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency to the Russian-controlled Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. Two US senators – Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) – had previously urged Biden to endorse such a move in order to ramp up pressure on Moscow. The status would entail, among other things, certain controls over exports of dual-use items, and a number of financial restrictions. Only four countries are currently designated as state sponsors of terrorism: North Korea, Iran, Cuba, and Syria. Moscow has warned that such a step would mark “a point of no return” in relations between the two countries. In August, Aleksandr Darichev, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s North American Department, signaled that the label would entail “the most serious collateral damage for bilateral relations, up to downgrading of their level and even severance of all ties.” The US State Department is also apparently against the idea. In August, Politico reported that the agency quietly approached congressional offices, warning that the designation could derail the Ukrainian grain deal and impact Washington’s remaining economic ties with Moscow."
2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/562276-bastion-exercise-kuril-islands/,Russia showcases freshly-deployed anti-ship missiles (VIDEO),"Russia’s Bastion anti-ship missile system has now been used in a live-fire exercise on the Far Eastern island of Matua, the Defense Ministry has reported. The system was tested during recent drills on an island chain that has long been the center of a territorial dispute with Japan. Matua is part of the Kuril Archipelago, a group of islands stretching from Russia’s Kamchatka to the Japanese island of Hokkaido. Last December, the Russian Defense Ministry reported boosting anti-ship defenses in the area with Bastion launchers stationed on Matua. Tuesday’s training exercise was the first time they were reported to have been used. According to the synopsis of the exercise released by the Defense Ministry, the launchers were moved into attack positions to fire at a simulated foreign warship that had violated Russian territorial waters in an attempt to land troops on one of the Kuril Islands. Once the ship moved “into a critical range,” it was engaged with an Oniks missile, which Bastion launchers carry. The Matua drill was part of the multilateral Vostok 2022 strategic military exercise. Asian powerhouses India and China are among the participants of the Russia-hosted military maneuvers. Japan contests Russian territorial claims to the four Kuril Islands that are located closest to its territory. The dispute, which stems from World War II, is the reason why Russia and Japan never signed a peace treaty. Moscow has previously ruled out relinquishing the islands to Japan, with one of the considerations being that Tokyo could militarize them. The long-running diplomatic spat was exacerbated this year after Japan joined the US in imposing anti-Russian sanctions over its operation in Ukraine. This week, Moscow scrapped a 1999 agreement with Tokyo that had allowed Japanese citizens to visit two of the disputed islands under a simplified procedure. The Russian Foreign Ministry also reported a full suspension of talks on the status of the islands and on projects to develop them economically together with Japan."
2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/562275-johnson-final-speech-putin/,Scandal-plagued Boris Johnson hits out at Russia,"Boris Johnson, in his final speech as UK prime minister on Tuesday morning, likened himself to a “booster rocket,” and warned Russian President Vladimir Putin not to “blackmail” the British people – while offering “the most fervent support” to the incoming government of Liz Truss. Johnson, who led his party to a landslide election victory in 2019, stepped down as Conservative leader on July 7 after more than 50 members of Parliament resigned from his government within 48 hours. It followed a series of high-profile scandals. Already on shaky ground over the parties held at Downing Street in violation of Covid-19 rules, the prime minister had no other option but to resign after it was revealed that he had appointed as his deputy chief whip an MP with a known record of alleged sexual misconduct. Speaking before a crowd of journalists and officials, Johnson listed what he considers to be the main achievements of his tenure, including supplying weapons to Ukraine, which he said: “may very well have helped change the course of the biggest European war for 80 years.” “We have and will continue to have that economic strength to give people the cash they need to get through this energy crisis that has been caused by Putin’s vicious war,” he added. Moscow has argued that the skyrocketing energy prices were caused by the sanctions on Russia and other policies of Western leaders, rather than the military operation in Ukraine. Johnson promised that the “compassionate Conservative government” of his successor will take all possible measures to get the country through the crisis, adding: “And if Putin thinks that he can succeed by blackmailing or bullying the British people, then he is utterly deluded.” Thank you Boris. pic.twitter.com/iNZxWK0u7N The outgoing prime minister, who will formally offer his resignation to Queen Elizabeth later today, hinted at the forced nature of his resignation, but offered “the most fervent support” to Truss’ government, while calling on fellow Tories to do the same – giving the example of his dog Dilyn and Downing Street cat Larry. “And I’ll just say to my party: if Dilyn and Larry can put behind them their occasional difficulties, then so can the Conservative Party,” Johnson said. Regarding future plans, Johnson said he is “like one of those booster rockets that has fulfilled its function.” The speech was followed by a storm of applause which continued until Johnson and his wife Carrie left Downing Street by car."
2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/562272-putin-zelensky-peskov-ukraine/,Moscow reveals conditions for Putin-Zelensky talks,"Before there can be any face-to-face meeting between Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky firm agreements, that the Russian and Ukrainian leaders will sign, must be in place, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. “As for the Putin-Zelensky talks, nothing has changed here. Nobody needs a meeting for the sake of a meeting,” Peskov pointed out in an interview with Izvestia newspaper on Tuesday. For Putin and Zelensky to get together or “for the very idea of such a meeting to be on the agenda, a lot of work needs to be done and the foundation for those agreements that can be formalized at the highest level needs to be laid,” he said. “There’s no talk about it at the moment,” the Kremlin spokesman clarified, referring to the meeting of the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. Peskov spoke on the same issue on Sunday, telling the Rossiya 1 TV channel that Moscow was ready to talk with Zelensky only “on how our demands are going to be fulfilled” by Kiev. As for Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, it’s “running its course; all of its goals will be achieved,” he assured. Zelensky has been making contradicting statements on a meeting with Putin, first saying that he wanted to discuss the fate of the conflict directly with the Russian president and then insisting that no talks with Moscow were possible.

2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/562217-gorby-report/,'My grandmother used to pray to him on TV': Russia's muted farewell to Mikhail Gorbachev,"Mikhail Gorbachev, the first and last president of the Soviet Union, died at the age of 91 last week. On Saturday, his farewell ceremony was held in Moscow. One of the last political giants of the last century, Gorbachev was a symbol of his era, but reaction to his death revealed the controversial nature of his legacy. He was given only some elements of a state funeral, and Hungary's prime minister was the sole Western leader to attend his farewell. Even in the Russian capital of around 20 million people, only a few hundred went to say goodbye in person. RT explains how an uncomfortable symbol of a long gone era was sent on his final journey. Many passed by the open casket containing Gorbachev’s body: Hundreds of ordinary Russians, individual celebrities from the country’s politics and culture, and ambassadors from EU states and the US. Gorbachev’s supporters, long since departed from politics, did not view his physical departure as a disaster – but symbolically, his farewell was still an opportunity to recall the end of the Soviet Union and the beginning of the new Russian state. Hundreds of people stood in line to say goodbye to Gorbachev. Perhaps, some of the excitement was due to the fact that the most recent funeral of someone of his stature was held as many as 15 years ago. Then, at the age of 76 and in the same Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow, the first president of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, died. However, it can hardly be said that the majority of post-Soviet Russians view Mikhail Gorbachev positively. Local government from Gorbachev’s home region of Stavropol, where he served as head for almost ten years, did not find it necessary to commemorate their compatriot on a large scale. Only in the village of Privolnoye, Gorbachev's birthplace, was a mourning portrait placed in the local administration building. Those gathered in the center of the capital on that weekend morning repeated to journalists and each other that they were uniting around common Perestroika values, remembering their lost youth, or an alternative future “according to Gorbachev,” which had not come to pass. Of course, the figure of the last general secretary himself was also important – primarily symbolically. The general mood of those who came to say goodbye to Gorbachev seemed to be calm; it would be a stretch to call it gloomy. Gorbachev had long been absent from political life in the country, and his sympathizers had stopped counting on any return. Thirty years ago, however, hopes were still alive and well. In the early 1990s, Gorbachev hinted at unexpected scenarios in his biography: “Charles de Gaulle returned to rule the country when he was 68. And I am only 61.” In 1996, he ran for president – and received less than 1% of the vote. The farewell ceremony was held in the Hall of Columns. The building was erected in the first half of the 18th century for Prince V.M. Dolgoruky-Krymsky. After October 1917, noble balls and concerts by Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Richard Strauss, and Franz Liszt were replaced by New Year’s parties for Soviet children and the World Congress of Soviet Friends. After the collapse of the Soviet state, the House of the Unions “had new directions of activity, corresponding to the course of democratic transformations in the Russian Federation.” Among the building's modern functions were funeral ceremonies. From the early hours of Saturday, September 3, people began lining up to say goodbye to Mikhail Gorbachev. The Moscow authorities introduced security measures and restricted pedestrian movement along some central city streets. To see the general secretary for the last time, a visitor had to wait their turn in the street, then go up the stairs of the former Noble Assembly House and walk among the three-tiered chandeliers and high columns of the solemnly decorated Column Hall. Slowly, one by one, people bade farewell to the politician – with and without flowers. His face could be seen a few yards from the symbolic fence. Those born after Gorbachev stepped down as president and those who experienced the ups and downs of Gorbachev’s rule in their teens also came to bid farewell. A 23-year-old political science student named Ivan said Gorbachev “did all the democratic stuff and stepped aside."" “I think on the whole it turned out pretty well. There were problems, and my parents told me a lot about them, and they told me today too, when I was going to say goodbye. They didn't discourage me, of course, I explained to them that it wasn't a demonstration or anything like that. But we disagreed with them on this subject. I have great respect for Gorbachev, first of all, for open borders, for freedom. Without him, we wouldn't have had it. And I travelled around the world with my parents thanks to his views, his steps. That is why I am here.” Alexei, a 50-year-old lawyer, spoke about the religious significance of Gorbachev to his family: “My grandmother used to pray to him on TV. And my great-grandmother used to cry on every anniversary of Stalin's death. In front of the same TV, by the way. They both didn't live to see it [the Soviet collapse], but I'm grateful to Gorbachev, of course. For what? I've lived and seen everything. I've been to a lot of places. It's that simple. We took this course at the time.” Ivan, Alexey and many others in the crowd would later learn that the US, German, British, and French ambassadors to Russia – John Sullivan, Geza Andreas von Geir, Deborah Bronnert, and Pierre Levy, respectively – also walked past the open casket of the last general secretary. The next day, Sullivan ended his tenure and left Moscow, apparently due to the death of a close family member. Saying goodbye to Gorbachev was apparently the last significant ceremony of the diplomat's Moscow tenure. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban also laid flowers. Orban personally offered his condolences to Gorbachev’s family and later wrote that the politician was “needed by Central Europe to free itself from communism peacefully, without loss of life or bloodshed.” Orban was the only head of state at the ceremony. Neither Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Poland, nor any other country that gained independence as a result of Gorbachev's foreign policy, found it necessary to pay tribute to the man who stood at the origins of their freedom. Perhaps their current disagreements with Russia are far more important to them than Gorbachev's role in their history. Nor did leaders or representatives from post-Soviet states – from the Baltic and the Transcaucasus to Belarus and Central Asia, not to mention Ukraine – attend the funeral. These countries often speak negatively of the Soviet period, but they do not speak well of Gorbachev either. Of the foreigners, Germans were most interested in saying goodbye to Gorbachev – the last Soviet general secretary was personally responsible for the reunification of West and East Germany into a single state. There were many journalists at the ceremony from the country. In good Russian with a distinctive accent, they asked those attending what the last general secretary meant to them personally. Just two months before Gorbachev’s death, a letter to the Soviet president from Dresden was published on his foundation’s website. “I am writing to you to express my heartfelt gratitude for everything you have done for me, for the people of Germany and for the world.” The author of these words, Thomas Bottrich, born in the GDR in 1955, later “participated in church peace initiatives and in the 1980s wrote letters to Helmut Kohl and Erich Honecker, urging them to support the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Germany.” Bottrich was at first opposed to Kohl’s desire to unite Germany quickly, but he soon changed his mind. Gorbachev’s daughter Irina, who organized the funeral, also lives in Germany with her children. Sociologist Igor Chubais was born in Soviet-occupied East Berlin in 1947 and came to the funeral ceremony; Igor is the elder brother of the reformer, former finance minister, and former head of the Russian presidential administration, Anatoly Chubais, living in exile since the start of the conflict in Ukraine. Elena, a middle-aged Czech translator who attended the ceremony, says she essentially owes her profession to Gorbachev: “It so happened that when I entered MGIMO [a higher education institution that has trained staff for the Soviet and then Russian Foreign Ministry since the 1944], they didn’t ask us who wanted to learn what language. I was allocated Czech. Well, at that time it was quite prestigious and it was really possible to go there. Before the collapse [of the USSR] I visited three or four times. I studied the country’s history, regional studies, the history of our relations with them, everything as it should be. And we had different periods – something they loved us for, something they can remember us for. And they remembered me personally. Now there is hell in the sense of Russophobia – although you probably know about Theresienstadt [a Nazi concentration camp established in the Czech Republic in 1941], so they must understand once and for all that you must not behave this way. Nevertheless, Gorbachev somehow managed to reconcile us to the Czech Republic, at least temporarily. This is partly the reason why I translated a lot of things and achieved a lot in my narrow field. And I say thank you for that. I will lay flowers for him. Here’s the reason.” The Czechs themselves do not remember this rapprochement of their country with Russia – there were no representatives from Prague at the ceremony. Not far away, behind rows of reporters and cameramen, a woman in a wheelchair, the same age as Gorbachev, was hiding. Suzanne Massie, 91-years-old and a former adviser to the 40th president of the United States, Ronald Reagan, she is a longtime student of Russian history and no stranger to the personal and political relationships between the two leaders of the 1980s. Massie told RIA Novosti that Gorbachev “revealed to us [Americans] the Russians.” Less than a year ago, Massie herself became a Russian citizen. The procedure for burying state officials in Russia is regulated by several laws. Presidents of Russia and their Soviet equivalent should be buried with different honors. But if you look at it from the point of view that the Russian Federation is officially the legal successor of the USSR, there is technically no difference between Boris Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev. In 2007, Yeltsin was bade farewell in the country’s main church, the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. It was open for a whole day so that everyone who wished to say goodbye to the former president could do so –some 25,000 people. National mourning was declared, and the current president, Vladimir Putin, attended the funeral in person. There was nothing of the sort at Mikhail Gorbachev’s farewell. His farewell and funeral were far more modest than those of Evgeny Zinichev, the head of EMERCOM, who died last year, or even the opera singer Dmitry Hvorostovsky, who passed away in 2018. Perhaps this was again due to the ambiguous legacy of the first and last president of the USSR. There was no sign of President Putin at Gorbachev’s farewell – the Kremlin attributed this to his busy schedule. Nevertheless, Putin did find an opportunity to say goodbye to the Soviet president: Last Thursday, he stopped by the Central Clinical Hospital and laid flowers at his coffin before traveling to Kaliningrad Region. In Putin’s absence, the highest-ranking Russian politician who attended Gorbachev’s farewell service was former President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council. At 11am on Saturday, Medvedev wrote on Telegram that Gorbachev’s funeral would take place that very day, but his post was not about him or about the “root causes of the collapse” of the USSR. Medvedev said: “For all the difference in assessments of the behaviour of the top leaders of the USSR and Russia at the time, it should be noted that they had the good sense not to allow the giant nuclear arsenal of the Union to be divided up by the newly formed national states. The consequences could have been swift and disastrous for our small earthly world. The entire strategic nuclear arsenal then remained in our country. And we maintain it at a very high level. And this is the best guarantee for the preservation of Great Russia.” The ceremony was also attended by figures from Russian culture, journalism, and the clergy. They included Alla Pugacheva, People’s Artist of the USSR, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and journalist Dmitry Muratov, and Father Alexey Uminsky, Rector of the Holy Trinity Church in Khokhly. It cannot be said that these people are not ""in favor"" with the current Russian authorities, but society is extremely ambivalent about them, especially since the start of the military operation in Ukraine. The streets outside the House of Unions on the weekend morning seemed empty. Muscovites, strolling by the luxury clothing shops came across the event. In private conversations, they shared their bewilderment. Not everyone seemed to be aware of the reason for the crowds. An exception to this were two well-informed men: An older man in a leather jacket and a younger man wearing a hoodie with a Z emblem and a sign reading ‘We do not abandon our own’. The former stubbornly argues to the latter that Gorbachev did more good than harm. Among the arguments are the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in 1989, the prohibition of alcohol, and Glasnost and Perestroika, which have entered the English language along with the earlier ‘sputnik’ and ‘pogrom’. The man in the hoodie agrees that the anti-booze campaign was positive, but in response to the other points, he shakes his head. At around 1pm, the megaphones start announcing that entry into the Hall of Columns would cease, but some latecomers with bouquets were still allowed in. At about 2pm, the ceremony came to an end. Gorbachev’s body was taken to Novodevichy Cemetery. There, he was buried next to Raisa Maximovna, the former first lady, who has often been compared to her contemporary, Nancy Reagan. People gradually leave the scene, and there are no obstacles to walking around the center of Moscow. Nor are there any reminders of the farewell ceremony that has just concluded."
2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/562267-kalibr-strike-naval-target/,WATCH Kalibr missile hitting ship at 300km during large-scale drills in Russia,"A Kalibr cruise missile has hit a floating target at a distance of over 300km, the Defense Ministry reported on Tuesday, calling the achievement a first for the Russian navy. According to the ministry, the missile was fired from the Gremyashchiy, a multipurpose corvette and the lead ship of its class. It traveled a complex path to avoid natural obstacles while staying at a low altitude before hitting the target in the Sea of Okhotsk. The Russian military released footage of the exercise, including the moment the missile hit the decommissioned ship that was used as a target. The live-fire exercise was part of the Vostok 2022 multinational military drill currently underway in the Russian Far East. Last week, the Gremyashchiy took part in joint maneuvers with warships from China. The two nations also trained in anti-submarine warfare in the Sea of Japan. The Kalibr is the workhorse missile system for the Russian Navy. It can be launched from submarines or ships and is normally used to hit ground targets, but some types have guidance systems designed for attacking enemy vessels. Targets in the sea tend to drift and are harder to hit from a longer distance. The Russian military previously reported successful Kalibr strikes on naval targets at more modest ranges."

Putin arrived at the Sergeevsky range in Primorsky Region on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists as he explained the Russian leader’s itinerary. After holding a closed-door meeting with Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov, the president plans to observe the ongoing military maneuvers, Peskov added. Vostok 2022 is part of a series of strategic military training exercises held by Russia each year. It is hosted by one of its military districts on a rotating basis. This year, the Eastern Military District welcomed 13 foreign nations, which sent troops and observers to Russia. Over 2,000 foreign troops joined 50,000 Russian soldiers and officers for the drills, the Defense Ministry told journalists. The countries taking part include Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, India, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan."

The Sun rises in the east, but Japan isn’t the easternmost piece of land on the map, the Russian leader noted. “Our neighbors the Japanese and the country of Japan are called the ‘land of the rising Sun,’ but east of Japan, I think, there’s [Russia’s] Kamchatka or [the island of] Sakhalin; then there is New Zealand – that’s even further to the east, and to the east of New Zealand there is Chukotka,” said Putin. Chukotka, which is the northeasternmost region of Russia, is only separated from the American continent by a 60km strait, he pointed out. “In this sense, the land of the rising sun is Russia,” Putin concluded."
2022-09-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/562220-ukrainian-ambassador-kazakhstan-emotional/,Ukrainian envoy apologizes for ‘kill Russians’ interview,"The Ukrainian ambassador to Kazakhstan has apologized to his host nation after an interview, in which he justified killing “as many Russians as possible”, the Kazakh Foreign Ministry said on Monday. Pyotr Vrublevsky’s apology was reported by a spokesman for the ministry, who described the remark as “unacceptable” and said a formal complaint had been issued to the Ukrainian diplomat. “He apologized and stated that he was speaking while experiencing serious emotional tension, because there is a war in his home country,” the spokesman, Aibek Smadiyarov, said during a briefing, as cited by local media. He added that Vrublevsky was on a break from work at the moment. The Ukrainian envoy sparked controversy after being interviewed by a local blogger last month. When asked about the situation in his country, he said: “What can I say… We are trying to kill as many [Russians] as possible. The more Russians we kill now, the fewer our children will have to. That’s it.” The remark elicited anger in Kazakhstan, which has a significant ethnic Russian minority. The Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan (APK), a presidential advisory body, accused Vrublevsky of hate speech and questioned his capacity to serve as a diplomat. The Ukrainian diplomatic corps has included some controversial individuals over the years. In 2018, Kiev recalled its consul in Hamburg, Vasily Marushchinets, after he was accused of sharing anti-Semetic messages on social media. He was also photographed celebrating his 60th birthday with a cake featuring the title of Hitler’s book Mein Kampf, according to leaked images. The current Ukrainian envoy in Germany, Andrey Melnik, has also courted controversy on several occasions, including in late June, when he denied war crimes committed by Ukrainian nationalist forces during World War II, claiming there was no evidence for them. Kiev recalled the diplomat after the interview sparked an outcry from Israel and Poland, but Melnik remains acting ambassador."

The Moscow City Court found him guilty on Monday and the sentence was handed down during the same session. The trial was mostly held behind closed doors. Safronov worked for the Russian newspapers Kommersant and Vedomosti before becoming an adviser to the head of Roscosmos. He was arrested in July 2020 and charged with two counts of state treason for cooperation with the intelligence agencies of Germany and the Czech Republic. Prosecutors alleged that he was recruited as an intel asset on behalf of the US. The leaked materials in question detailed Russian ties in military and space affairs with nations in Africa and the Middle East, according to media reports. Safronov denied any wrongdoing. His defense claimed that he rejected an earlier plea deal, which would have seen him receive a 12-year sentence. They said they will appeal the latest court ruling. Safronov has also been fined 500,000 rubles ($8,300). The former journalist is expected to serve his term in a high security prison. The time he has already spent in pre-trial custody will be deducted from his sentence. After serving roughly 14 years he will be eligible to apply for parole. The ruling is one of the harshest in a treason trial in Russia’s modern history."
2022-09-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/562214-ukraine-zelensky-legalize-porn-petition/,Ukraine mulls legalizing porn,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has ordered a review into legalizing pornography and erotica. The move comes in response to a petition that collected the required 25,000 signatures for the issue to be considered by authorities. Commenting on the initiative on Friday, Zelensky signaled that he had tasked Prime Minister Denis Shmigal “to process the issue raised in the electronic petition… and inform its author about the results of consideration.” Zelensky noted that the national Constitution grants Ukrainian citizens the right to freedom of thought, speech and expression. However, this provision is limited, among other things, by a law on the Protection of Public Morality, which prohibits production and distribution of explicit materials. The author of the petition, Taras Syromskyi, said that Ukrainian legislation in this area has many gaps which “give room for its interpretation” particularly regarding how eroticism is actually defined. “The legislation does not explain well where eroticism is in art, and where eroticism is porn,” he writes. The author also said banning porn could also promote corruption. At the same time, the legalization of porn presents “an ideal opportunity to bring money to the Ukrainian budget,” he said. Zelensky’s response to the petition comes after he urged the prime minister to consider legalizing same-sex marriage following another petition last month. He noted at the time, however, that the Constitutional provisions on marriage could not currently be changed due to the martial law announced on February 24, the same day Russia began its military offensive in the country."
2022-09-05,https://www.rt.com/news/562211-kabul-embassy-afghanistan-blast/,Details of slain Russian embassy workers revealed,"Moscow's Investigative Committee has confirmed that two Russian nationals were among those killed by a suicide bomber outside Russia’s mission in the Afghan capital, Kabul, on Monday. An assistant secretary and a security guard lost their lives in the attack, according to officials. The blast, which occurred not far from the entrance to the embassy, killed up to 25 people, according to broadcaster Al Jazeera. Most of the victims were reportedly Afghans queuing for visas. “According to preliminary data, the assistant secretary and a security guard of the embassy were killed as a result of the attack,” the Investigative Committee said in a Telegram post. A criminal case has been launched over the death of the Russian mission’s staff in the capital of Afghanistan, it added. Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has said that security at the mission in Kabul has been tightened after the explosion, expressing hope that “those who perpetrated that attack, those who executed this attack will be held responsible in the nearest future.”"
2022-09-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/562213-novaya-gazeta-metia-license/,Russian court revokes license of long-running liberal newspaper,"The media license of Novaya Gazeta, one of the oldest liberal papers in Russia, has been revoked by a Moscow court. The outlet suspended its print version in late March, saying it would not resume circulation while Russia conducts its military operation in Ukraine. On Monday, the Basmanny district court in the Russian capital granted a request by media regulator Roskomnadzor to revoke the paper’s license. The watchdog’s case against the publication was based on its failure to file paperwork after a change of ownership in 2006. The newspaper argued that the reshuffle was not significant enough to warrant a mandatory submission of its new corporate charter, as required by Russian law. Novaya Gazeta was originally fully owned by its newsroom, but in 2006, it sold a 49% stake to former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and then-lawmaker Aleksandr Lebedev, best known as part-owner of prominent British newspapers the Evening Standard and The Independent. The two men pledged to invest their personal wealth into the paper’s operation. The deal was widely believed to be motivated by politics rather than business interests, when it was announced, as both Gorbachev and Lebedev were outspoken supporters of the opposition media in Russia. The newspaper suspended circulation in late March following two notices of violation sent by Roskomnadzor over the paper’s refusal to use the “foreign agent” label for organizations branded as such by the government. Novaya Gazeta had previously criticized the Russian labeling rules for foreign agents, calling them an assault on journalism. In March, the paper declared its intention to publish online only, as long as the Russian military campaign in Ukraine continues. Part of the newsroom has since split to start a new Europe-based project, which shares the name of the newspaper, but is formally not connected to it. Dmitry Muratov, Novaya’s editor-in-chief, who has been part of the project since its creation in 1993, was co-awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his “efforts to safeguard freedom of expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting peace”."

The attack outside the Russian mission happened earlier on Monday. The explosion is believed to have claimed the lives of two dozen people. “Speaking about the situation in the region, the terrorist threat hasn’t dissipated, including from Afghanistan,” Lavrov noted during talks with his Tajik counterpart Sirojiddin Muhriddin in Moscow. Tajikistan and Afghanistan are neighbors, sharing a border that is almost 1,400km long. “And this morning… there was a terrorist attack. An unknown militant used an explosive device near the entrance to the consulate of our embassy [in Kabul]. Two of our comrades died,” he said. Security has been tightened at the embassy in Kabul in the wake of the deadly blast, with “intelligence officers of Afghanistan also helping,” according to the Russian foreign minister. “Let’s hope that those who perpetrated that attack, those who executed this attack will be held responsible in the nearest future,” he added. Lavrov then asked for a minute of silence for the slain embassy workers, with members of both delegations standing to honor them. Russia’s Investigative Committee said that, according to preliminary data, the killed embassy staff were an assistant secretary and a security guard. Russia has been among the few nations to maintain a diplomatic mission in Kabul since the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan a year ago."
2022-09-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/562197-us-eu-storm-peskov/,"Huge global storm is starting, Moscow warns","The world is about to experience major turbulence as a result of illogical moves by Western nations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. “Most likely, a huge global storm is starting,” Peskov warned in an interview with Tass on Monday. “In many ways, there are objective reasons for that, but there are also subjective reasons for this beginning storm, which are linked to absolutely illogical and often absurd decisions and actions of the authorities in the US, Europe, the EU and individual European countries,” he said. The sanctions imposed by the US, the EU and some other nations on Russia over its military operation in Ukraine have backfired causing a spike in energy prices and record inflation across the West. In this situation, Russia “still manages to maintain macroeconomic stability. Very intense, thoughtful and consistent work is being carried out in order to achieve that,” Peskov noted. “As restrictions are being artificially introduced in the West, [Russia’s] trade and economic relations are understandably starting to focus more on the East,” he added. However, the Kremlin press secretary, who was speaking at the launch of the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, insisted that “it was completely unfair to say that we have turned to the East just now… the Asia-Pacific region has always been a very important component for trade and economic relations, and energy dialogue, and other areas.”"
2022-09-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/562168-55-years-since-rehabilitation-of-crimean-tatars/,"From Stalin's wrath to Khrushchev's gift to Ukraine: Crimea's Tatar minority has faced death, misery and deportation","Crimean Tatars play an important role in the story of the peninsula's reabsorption by Russia. One of Ukraine's main propaganda tools is to accuse Russia of violating their rights. At the same time, Turkey is also a factor – through its cultural ties with what it sees as the ""brotherly"" Turkic people. However, the Tatars themselves seem to be split into two camps after the events of 2014, when their home area returned to Moscow's control. One of the main reasons why at least some Crimean Tatars seem to contest the legitimacy of the reunification goes back to the 1940s when, during the Soviet Union’s involvement in World War II, a decision was made by the Georgian-born Joseph Stalin to deport them to Central Asia by force. RT looks back at these tragic events. The formation of the Crimean Tatars as an ethic group occurred between the 13th and 17th centuries, uniting Cumans, also known as Polovtsy, a Turkic nomadic people who appeared in the area during the tenth century, with others who had inhabited the peninsula since ancient times and gradually underwent Tatarization. Following the disintegration of the Mongolian Golden Horde, a large Chingisid-founded empire that at its peak extended from Siberia and Central Asia to parts of Eastern Europe, a number of smaller khanates were formed. The Crimeans frequently mounted raids into the Danubian principalities, Poland–Lithuania, and Muscovy to enslave people. This trade, as well as the ransom business, were the backbone of the khanate’s economy. In the 18th century, after a series of successful anti-slavery and military campaigns, as well as through diplomacy, the Russian Empire incorporated Crimea. While some of the local upper class entered into an arrangement with the new rulers, others chose to leave the peninsula and join the Ottoman Empire across the sea. After the formation of Soviet Union in 1921, the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created as part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Hitler had a special place for Crimea in his future plans for the Third Reich after the expected victory in World War Two. The peninsula was to be vacated of its current inhabitants for the arrival of an Aryan population. Despite the fact that this project wasn't implemented, Crimea remained under Nazi occupation for a sum total of almost two years, and that had been hard enough. Nazis excelled in the art of ruling the occupied territories by actively applying the “divide and conquer” principle to the local ethnic groups and nations. Thus, they relied on Ukrainian collaborators to do all their dirty work in Belarus, and used Cossacks to crush the uprising in Warsaw in 1944. In Crimea, their allies were the so-called ‘Tatar national committees,’ organized by German intelligence organs in order to influence the local population, spread propaganda and recruit volunteers who were often used to infiltrate the rear of the Red Army with spies and saboteurs. It can’t be said to have been exactly a win-win deal, though. Nazi Germany wasn’t really interested in supporting the hopes of Crimean Tatars to carve out an ethnic Crimean Tatar mini-state on the peninsula, and the German authorities on site made it abundantly clear. Thus, while some of the Crimean Tatar collaborators were used to infiltrate the rear of the Red Army and police the occupied territories, others were tasked with promoting the Nazi ideology. Some were so eager to oblige that they even filed proposals with their Nazi bosses to exterminate all Russians on the peninsula. Red Army commanders and partisans kept records of all crimes committed by the Crimean Tatar collaborators against the civilian population and prisoners of war during the occupation. Sometimes the situation was so absurd that Germans had to intervene and protect the civilians and POWs from their overzealous helpers. “On July 4, I was taken captive. We were escorted by some Tatar traitors. They kept beating the medics with clubs. After a while in a Sevastopol prison, we were forced to march through the Belbek Valley that had been mined. Many POWs from the Red Army and Navy were killed. Then they crammed us into tiny prison cells in Bakhchysarai. Three days later, we had to march to Simferopol. We were escorted by Germans and a number of Crimean Tatar traitors. I saw one Tatar cut off a seaman’s head,” a Red Fleet seaman, Yanchenko, described the cruelty of some Crimean Tatar collaborators in his letter dated 1942. Most of them, however, were less bloodthirsty and chose to collaborate more for reasons of trying to survive and to obtain money and land deals under the Nazi rule. By assessments, up to 20,000 Crimean Tatars could have been recruited in 1942 for prisoner control and counterinsurgency operations, as well as for other ‘volunteer’ jobs. They were also a formidable force in the Crimean Mountains, as they knew the land very well, and many partisan detachments fighting on the Red Army’s side suffered at their hand. The number of Crimean Tatars in the Red Army was only slightly larger than in the collaborationist detachments, and they were represented quite modestly in the partisan detachments in Crimea. However, in 1943, a mass desertion of collaborators began, as they switched to the side of the partisans. Nevertheless, many stayed with Hitler until the end. Several battalions of collaborators were defeated in the spring of 1944. Those who managed to retreat with the Germans subsequently formed the Tatar Mountain Jaeger brigade of the SS. In the spring of 1944, the Russians defeated the German 17th Army and liberated Crimea. At that point, the country’s leadership was faced with ‘the Tatar question.’ In May of 1944, another Georgian Lavrenty Beria – the chief of the USSR’s political police, the NKVD – reported to Stalin that more than 5,000 collaborators (not only Tatars) had been arrested in Crimea and about 6,000 firearms had been seized on the peninsula. Beria stressed that a “significant part” of the Tatar population had collaborated with the Nazis. It was Beria who proposed evicting the Tatars from Crimea and sending them to Uzbekistan for use in agriculture. Literally the next day, on May 11, 1944, the USSR State Defense Committee adopted a resolution to forcibly evict the Tatars. They were allowed to take personal belongings, clothes, household equipment and food with them, but their land, cattle, and other property were seized by the state. NKVD units carried out the operation within three days. Some 180,000 people were loaded into 67 trains and sent to Central Asia. At the same time, the military seized about 12,000 more weapons, including mortar launchers and machine guns. Frontline soldiers who had taken part in the Crimean Soviet underground and their families managed to avoid deportation on request, as well as some women who had married men of other nationalities. However, these literally amounted to several hundred people. The living conditions at the point of arrival were extremely difficult. Apart from natural mortality, modern researchers believe that at least 13% died in the fall of 1948. It is worth noting that a significant portion of these people fell victim to the last mass famine to afflict the USSR, which occurred immediately after the war. However, for the Crimean Tatars the situation was complicated by the seizure of their property, the difficult living conditions in the new place, and an unfamiliar climate. Although the authorities allocated building materials, land, and loans for construction, people were forced to settle in Uzbekistan essentially from scratch. In the coming years, the Tatars were branded with the status of ‘special settlers,’ which included a significant loss of rights – most importantly, the right to leave their area of residence. The situation did not change for a long time, even after Stalin’s death. The turning point was the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR ‘On Citizens of Tatar Nationality Who Previously Lived in Crimea.’ In particular, it stated: “The facts attesting to the active cooperation with the German invaders of a certain part of the Tatars living in the Crimea were unreasonably attributed to the entire Tatar population of Crimea. These sweeping accusations against all citizens of Tatar nationality who lived in Crimea should be dropped, especially since a new generation of people has entered society’s workforce and political life.” Then there was an instruction to cancel the orders containing accusations against the Tatars. However, legal nuances contained in the same decree, in fact, limited their ability to move back to Crimea. The mass return began only in 1990, shortly before the collapse of the USSR. Since the Soviet Union was already in its death throes, and the Tatar question was a third-rate issue for the authorities of both Russia and Ukraine, a new problem arose when Tatars took it upon themselves to seize land plots on returning to Crimea. From their point of view, they were simply reappropriating what they had lost in 1944. The Crimean Tatars are one of the numerous peoples whose fate took a dramatic turn in the 20th century. Again in the 1950s when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, himself raised in Eastern Ukraine, handed over the territory to Kiev, apparently without consulting anyone. However, in the late USSR era, their situation stabilized and the fate of the Tatars generally coincided with that of the rest of Crimea’s inhabitants. By the time, Crimea rejoined Russia the bulk of the peninsula’s population was made up of ethnic Russians (Russians living in Crimea, but not Russian citizens), whose mass rejection of the Western-backed Kiev 'Maidan' coup set the stage for its return ""home."" Tatar activists were initially active on the side of Ukraine, and the first victims of clashes in Crimea were two Russians who died when pro-Moscow and pro-Kiev Tatar rallies collided. As a result of the events of 2014, the Tatar community split. The pro-Ukrainian part is represented by the ‘Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People,’ an organization that claims to represent the group. In fact, it is rather a virtual entity capable of fielding a total of several hundred activists, which is not even currently located in Crimea. Its attempt to form a combat wing in the form of a pro-Ukrainian volunteer battalion yielded zilch. In reality, the influence of the ‘Mejlis’ consists mainly in calling for the destruction of Crimea’s infrastructure, in particular, the bridge between the peninsula and the rest of Russia. The organization’s activities have been banned in the Russian Federation. Moscow has learned from the mistakes of the Soviet Union and has demonstrated much more flexibility in its ethnic and language policies regarding Crimea than was seen back then. The ethnic-cultural autonomy of the Crimean Tatars is recognized within Russia, and the region’s official languages include Russian, Ukrainian, and Crimean Tatar."

Kiev’s ambassador to Australia called the image “utterly offensive” and accused the author of creating “false equivalency between the victim and the aggressor.” Artist Peter Seaton, who goes by the nickname CTO, covered his work called ‘Peace before Pieces’ on Kings Way in Melbourne just days after finishing it. He did so on Sunday night after an intense campaign by pro-Kiev activists, who accused him of ignorance. Ukrainian Ambassador to Australia Vasily Miroshnichenko was among the public figures who lashed out at CTO. In his initial reaction on social media last Saturday, he blasted the artist for failing to consult “the Ukrainian community in Melbourne” about his creative process, calling for the mural’s removal. Over the weekend, the diplomat shared some altered versions of the mural on social media. One, which was made by an Australia-based anti-Beijing cartoonist from Hong Kong, showed the Russian soldier stabbing the Ukrainian one in the back. Another depicted the soldiers as a Nazi and a Jewish person marked for extermination. 1. Here, I fix the disgraceful and offensive mural in Melbourne with the true face of Russia’s brutality and war crimes from its invasion in Ukraine.@olgarithmic@AmbVasylpic.twitter.com/5Y899ermIy CTO apologized to people offended by his mural, but rejected the ambassador’s claim that his message was of false equivalence. He said he believed that all humans were united on a fundamental level and could overcome their differences, which made them commit acts of violence against each other. His work “doesn’t say you have to love the Russians. No. It’s just that love is fundamental within us,” he said, explaining the meaning of the image. “And anything that takes us away from love is not acting in our best interests in the long run. I really stand by that.” Miroshnichenko remarked that CTO had been “swift” to remove the work from Melbourne. It was swift! https://t.co/qnIkUdLshK"
2022-09-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/562187-afghanistan-embassy-kabul-blast/,Two Russian embassy workers killed in 'suicide bombing',"Two Russian embassy workers were among many people killed on Monday in an explosion outside the country’s diplomatic mission in the Afghan capital, Kabul, Russia's Foreign Ministry has said. A suicide bomber detonated his vest around the corner from the main gate of the Russian embassy, apparently targeting locals queuing for visas, according to local media. The death toll has reached 25, with many more injured, according to Al Jazeera. The blast occurred when an embassy employee went outside to people waiting in line, a source told RIA-Novosti news agency. Reuters earlier reported that compound guards were able to spot the suicide bomber and fired shots at him. Russia’s Investigative Committee said that, according to preliminary data, the slain embassy workers were an assistant secretary and a security guard. Speaking after the incident, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said security has been tightened at the mission in Kabul, with additional Afghan intelligence and counterintelligence forces deployed. ““Let’s hope that those who perpetrated that attack, those who executed this attack will be held responsible in the nearest future,” Lavrov added. Russia is among the few nations to have maintained an embassy in Kabul since the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan a year ago. Despite not officially recognizing the Taliban government, Moscow has been in talks with the group on a deal to supply gasoline and other commodities to the country, which has been slapped with harsh international sanctions."
2022-09-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/562179-iaea-nuclear-plant-departure/,IAEA mission leaves Zaporozhye nuclear plant – media,"A delegation from the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has left the Russian-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant (NPP) in Ukraine, TASS reported on Monday. Renat Karchaa, a Russian nuclear expert who accompanied the mission, says two of its members will remain at the facility. Last week, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, who also inspected the plant, claimed that the agency would “establish a continued presence” there. According to the Russia 24 TV channel, the IAEA will publish its findings on Tuesday. “All their conclusions will be reflected in the report, which, as preliminary information suggests, is planned for release for tomorrow, when Rafael Grossi will deliver his remarks,” the outlet said. The mission left the facility earlier than expected. Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-controlled military-civilian administration, told RIA that IAEA experts would continue working at the facility throughout Monday, before leaving on Tuesday, saying that they may even extend their mission. At the time, he said that the delegation “has been provided with all possible assistance. We are interested in an objective and balanced assessment of the situation at the NPP”. The main goal of the IAEA mission at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant was to assess the state of the facility and speak to both Russian and Ukrainian personnel on the ground. During the inspection, Grossi confirmed that the plant, which has been under Russian control since March, had sustained some damage. However, he refrained from assigning blame. Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of attacking the plant, while warning that further shelling could trigger a disaster on a par with Chernobyl. Kiev insists, however, that it is Russia’s forces who are shelling the area while stationing military hardware there. On Thursday, according to the Russian Defense Ministry, Ukraine launched a raid in an apparent bid to capture the station prior to the arrival of the IAEA delegation, but the attack was thwarted. Later, according to the ministry, Moscow prevented another raid by Kiev’s special forces and foreign mercenaries, who tried to land on the coast of the Kakhovka reservoir not far from Energodar, the city where the nuclear plant is located."
2022-09-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/562174-kremlin-putin-telegram-channels/,Kremlin reveals if Putin reads Telegram,"Russian President Vladimir Putin does not follow any Telegram channels personally, but his regular intelligence briefings may sometimes include a review of noteworthy posts, particularly from military correspondents, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov has said. “Putin doesn’t read Telegram channels, but receives reviews,” Peskov told Tass on Sunday, noting that the head of state needs to have full access to all available information and intelligence, in addition to official reports and bulletins. Unlike the majority of world leaders, the Russian president has almost no online presence, apart from a handful of official Kremlin accounts, including a Telegram channel, as he doesn't have free time to waste on posting, scrolling and clicking, his spokesman previously explained. Last year Peskov also said Putin would never set up a personal social media account and delegate the job to an adviser, because “he considers it wrong” for someone else to manage a public profile on his behalf. In fact, Putin doesn’t even have a cellphone to post or follow anyone, because, as Peskov once noted, “using a smartphone means voluntary exhibitionism” and a “total information transparency,” which is unimaginable for any world leader. Putin himself said that while he can always borrow an aide's phone if needed, he prefers to use an old-style government line to instantly get in touch with anyone. While former US president Barack Obama was once touted as the “first social media president,” his successor Donald Trump took it to a whole new level, attributing a large part of his election victory to social media. Trump is estimated to have tweeted more than 25,000 times during his presidency, before tech giants banned him for allegedly inciting the January 6 Capitol riot."
2022-09-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/562172-moscow-accuse-estonian-incite-violence/,Russia accuses Estonia's FM of inciting ‘violence’,"The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned on Sunday what it called the “heinous logic” of Estonia's top diplomat, Urmas Reinsalu, accusing him of inciting violence in Russia. The Baltic nation’s foreign minister earlier told the local Postimees newspaper that if some Russians had “taken cobblestones into their hands,” the situation in Russia would have been different. “Has Mr. Reinsalu gone insane?” the Russian Foreign Ministry’s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, wrote in a Telegram post. “What is he calling for? Violence?” Zakharova described the minister’s words as “the heinous logic of an Estonian ignoramus” and accused him of advocating “unacceptable methods.” The Foreign Ministry spokeswoman also warned that by making such statements, Western officials are “destroying” one of the pillars of their own statehood, the “infeasibility of physical altercations and violence.” Reinsalu's remarks came before the EU foreign ministers’ meeting in Prague, where they were expected to discuss travel restrictions for Russians. Estonia was one of the most vocal advocates of a total ban on Schengen visas for Russians, except for certain “humanitarian” reasons. Speaking to Postimees in late August, Reinsalu said such a ban would have a “moral nature,” and “exert pressure on the Russian society.” The Estonian foreign minister called the Russian military operation in Ukraine “not just Putin’s war but that of the Russian nation, which includes not just the government and the territory but the population as well.” “There must always be someone, who would take a stone in his hand,” the minister argued, adding that “if just one percent of the Russian population had taken cobblestones in their hands, it would have caused some changes.” Sanctions should send a “signal” to the Russians that “their life cannot go on as normal,” Reinsalu added. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked. The US and its allies in Europe and elsewhere reacted to the February developments by sending arms to Kiev and slapping Moscow with unprecedented sanctions targeting its finance and banking sectors as well as aviation and space industries and later oil exports. Kiev and the Baltic States as well as some Eastern European nations also demanded a Schengen visa ban for Russians, but the measure was opposed by other EU members including Germany, France and Greece. Eventually, the bloc agreed to suspend the 2007 visa facilitation agreement instead of banning visas completely."
2022-09-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/562170-moscow-focus-talks-kiev/,Moscow reveals focus of possible talks with Kiev,"Moscow remains ready to engage in talks with Kiev, Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov has confirmed. However, fulfilling Russia’s demands would be the only topic on the agenda, he said on a TV show on Sunday. When asked whether Russia has anything it could discuss with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, Peskov said: “Yes, of course, [we can talk] about how our demands will be met.” Zelensky has recently threatened to abandon the very idea of talking to Moscow on a number of occasions. In late August, he cited a potential public “tribunal” for members of the infamous Azov regiment in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) as one of the red lines that would make any talks impossible. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked. The two sides haven’t sat down at the negotiating table since talks in Istanbul in late March. Moscow was initially optimistic about the prospects for a peace deal but later accused Kiev of torpedoing the talks. Russian officials subsequently warned that their demands would be more extensive if talks were to resume. The Kremlin then signaled its readiness to strike a peace deal with Kiev in early August. Peskov said at the time that the two nations were close to settling their differences in a way that was acceptable to Russia back in spring. He also said Russia would still achieve the goals of its military operation even if Kiev refuses to end the conflict in a diplomatic way. In mid-August, Ukraine ruled out any negotiations with Russia, arguing that talks would not serve Kiev’s goals. “The opportunity to win this war is much more important than any situational pause,” Zelensky’s aide, Mikhail Podoliak, said at the time."
2022-09-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/562154-europe-moscow-asia-pivot/,"Timofey Bordachev: Russia is a European country, but the West's hybrid war has forced it to turn to Asia","For Russia, with its unique geopolitical position, it is fundamentally difficult to determine the geographical priorities of its external relations. All the more so because the country's enormous natural wealth and ability to fully support itself with resources make it unnecessary in principle to consider external relations as a vitally important part of its own development strategy. There is no dispute that all of Moscow's foreign policy declarations over the last two decades have contained a ritual indication that the goal of foreign policy is to ensure the country's economic development. However, in practice, the foundations on which the Russian state structure stands mean the sincerity of these assurances should be taken with a pinch of salt. In reality, Russia – like its main geostrategic adversary the US – is one of only two countries in the world that can survive, at least in the basic senses, by relying entirely on its domestic resources. Despite assurances about the importance of foreign economic relations, Moscow sets the true priorities of its foreign policy based not on which opportunities the external environment can provide, but rather on the dangers it can pose to its ability to manage this bounty. The result is a foreign policy oriented towards repelling threats in the first instance, and seizing opportunities in the second. And it has to be admitted that it is this insurmountable problem that has confronted many of Russia’s diplomatic undertakings throughout recent years, foremost among which is the pivot to the East, a strategy formulated a decade ago by domestic thinkers and backed up by statements at the highest level. The purely materialistic nature of this policy initially had great difficulty interacting with the Russian foreign policy tradition and, more importantly, the system of prioritisation. Attempts to convince elites of the need to intensify relations with Asian countries on the basis that this would bring substantial material benefits, faced an objective obstacle – there was no need to try hard in the western direction. This was because material benefits from there came easily, by comparison, relying on the links established over hundreds of years with other major European players. As a result, as of 2019, about 80% of investments in Russia’s Far East were of domestic origin. This region, which is larger than the European Union, has only about 7 million people and is politically centred on the cities of Vladivostok and Khabarovsk. Perhaps because of its economic limitations, the eastward pivot strategy in concrete terms has not progressed beyond establishing truly strong ties with China, with which Russia has now begun to address the really crucial issues of the international order. In all other respects the Eastern pivot has remained an important rhetorical but weakly realised field for the Russian state. Over the past ten years, however, Moscow has significantly expanded its presence in various Asian international formats, increased its level of participation in various intergovernmental forums, and begun to think more about the East and understand its place in its own foreign policy system. In turn, ties with China are also difficult to see solely as a product of intensified interactions on the Asian front in the last ten years. The relationship between Moscow and Beijing is strategic in nature, with a shared vision of a more equitable international order that is not dominated by a narrow group of states. Also, Russia and China share responsibility for the stability of a vast part of Eurasia. Bilateral trade and economic relations are developing with the understanding that at some point the two states will indeed have to jointly oppose attempts by the US and its allies to regain control of the global economy and politics. While acknowledging that this is the closest interpretation of the nature, content and results of Russia's turn to the East, we cannot ignore the potential impact on policy of the ongoing political and military conflict in Europe. Moreover, since its first weeks, most observers have argued that a de facto break with the West would inevitably lead to a strengthening of Russia's ties with non-Western states, of which the Asian countries are the most important in terms of economy and development. Against the backdrop of massive economic warfare measures launched against Moscow by Western countries in 2022, it is Asia that has emerged as the most important buyer of traditional Russian exports, a source of technological products and a priority trade and economic partner. Many have even said that developing ties with China and the rest of Asia should ""replace"" Russia’s traditional partnerships in the West. In other words, the conflict – in fact, hybrid warfare – between Russia and the US along with its European allies, could be seen as a condition that would make the pivot to the East no longer a choice but a necessity, forcing Moscow to take it truly seriously. This is a rather new situation and discussion for Russia, as it has never in its history had to address the dependence of internal sustainability on interaction with one or another of its external partners. The extent to which this is actually the case remains to be seen. But several assumptions can already be made that are directly related to the significance of Russia's relations with Asia in the coming years. First, relations with China and (especially) other Asian states are not the way to solve existential problems, even taking into account that cooperation with partners outside Europe in the field of energy will be an important factor in the future sustainability of Russian budget revenues, and maintaining Russia's presence in the global economy, from which the US and its allies are trying to exclude it. This is all the more likely given that countries such as Japan and South Korea are much less likely to be pressured by the US not to trade with Russia, compared to their European equivalents. Given the growing confrontation with China, it is not in Washington's interest to weaken its Asian allies or to make them too dependent on American aid. Secondly, the key tasks of national development will have to be solved by Russia itself, without the kind of reliance on external sources of technology we have seen previously, let alone finance. The coming era will require a much greater degree of de facto sovereignty and, in a sense, a capacity for limited autarky. For all the importance of links outside the West, therefore, Russia cannot consider simply reorienting itself from one direction to another while retaining its historically established strategy of dependence on external sources of development. To give an example, it will have to start building its own long-haul aircraft again, instead of relying on finished products from Boeing and Airbus. Thirdly, it should be taken into account that even the most active ties in Asia cannot supplant relations with the states of the Islamic world, neighbouring countries and even within Europe, where also not everyone is determined to erect walls on its eastern border. Russia's geopolitical position cannot be changed by a single military-political conflict in one direction. Not to mention that from a historical and cultural point of view, it will always be difficult for Russia to build engagement in Asia similar in scale and spirit to that in the South and the West. To summarise, in the current context, relations with Asian countries are becoming a necessity rather than a choice. However, this doesn’t mean choosing a complete change in the most important aspects of national foreign and foreign economic policy. Rather, it has an important tactical value and, with due diligence on our part, could further lead to a more significant Russian presence in world affairs, the centre of which is increasingly shifting to the east."
2022-09-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/562163-west-russia-strike-deal-kremlin/,West and Russia will eventually strike a deal – Kremlin,"The crisis between Russia and the West will inevitably be resolved at the negotiating table, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. He warned, however, that Moscow will be ready to defend its interests when that moment arrives. Western nations “have made too many mistakes and will have to pay for them,” he said on the Rossiya 1 TV Channel. “Any confrontation is followed by détente and any crisis situation is resolved at the negotiating table… this is what will happen this time as well,” the spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said, adding that it’s unlikely to occur “soon.” When such talks materialise, Moscow will not hesitate to defend its interests, Peskov added. Russia has acquired “priceless experience” of dealing with the West in recent years and will use it to “conduct dialogue… in such a way that our interests are by no means hurt.” The Kremlin official listed what he sees as Western errors, citing Germany’s “horrible” decision to send weapons to Ukraine for use against Russian soldiers. He also criticized European nations for supporting a government that allows “Nazis” to openly demonstrate their symbols and stage torchlit processions, calling it “no less horrible.” Peskov also blamed the energy crisis in Europe on “absurd” decisions by European politicians, who have refused to service equipment sold by Western firms to Gazprom. The Russian state energy giant “spent decades” earning its reputation of a reliable natural gas supplier, and has so far done nothing to tarnish it, the Kremlin spokesman claimed. “This is not Gazprom’s fault, this is fault of those politicians, who have taken the decision on sanctions,” he said, referring to the Russian company’s recent decision to indefinitely suspend gas transit through its Nord Stream pipeline, due to technical issues. Since the start of Russia’s offensive against Ukraine in late February, gas prices have climbed to record highs in Europe, driving up overall inflation. Moscow has cited technical issues caused by Western sanctions as the reason for the gradual decline in gas deliveries. The EU, in turn, has accused Russia of using energy exports as a weapon."
2022-09-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/562162-medvedev-germany-acting-enemy-russia/,Germany acting like ‘enemy’ of Russia – Medvedev,"Berlin has no right to criticize Moscow over its decision to suspend gas exports through the Nord Stream pipeline, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has said. He added that Germany itself is acting like Russia’s “enemy.” Germany “has imposed sanctions against Russia and its citizens,” Medvedev wrote in a Telegram post on Sunday, adding that Berlin also “supplies Ukraine with lethal arms used against our armed forces.” Such actions amount to nothing less than a “hybrid war,” the ex-president said. The comment came in response to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who had earlier said Berlin no longer sees Moscow as a reliable oil and gas supplier. “Russia is no longer a reliable energy partner,” the chancellor told a news conference as he announced additional measures worth €65 billion ($64.7 billion) aimed at protecting German consumers and businesses from soaring inflation caused by the energy crisis. Berlin’s move came as Russian state energy giant Gazprom announced it would indefinitely suspend gas transit through the Nord Stream pipeline, citing technical issues caused by Western sanctions. The EU has accused Russia of weaponizing its energy exports. Germany has supported Kiev since the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine in late February. It has sent Stinger anti-aircraft missile systems, Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled howitzers, and Gepard anti-aircraft gun tanks to Ukraine, along with a range of other weapons."

Sullivan had previously served as deputy secretary of state and retained the position of ambassador after the departure of Donald Trump. In June, he admitted that relations between Moscow and Washington had hit an all-time low amid the Russian military offensive in Ukraine. This has made any productive cooperation between the countries unlikely, the envoy said. Last year, Sullivan spent a few months away from Moscow following Washington’s announcement of a new package of anti-Russia sanctions and the Kremlin’s decision to recall its ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov. The US ambassador returned to Russia after a June meeting between the countries’ presidents."

Pro-Russian authorities in the Zaporozhye, Kharkov and Kherson Regions, as well the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, previously spoke of potentially holding referendums on uniting with Russia, but so far no dates have been set. “It's all a farce and a circus. But for our citizens who will take part in this, there is actually an article of the Criminal Code,” Kiev’s deputy prime minister said. ""If collaboration is proven, or, for example, participation in the referendum or incitement to participate in the referendum, then people can receive up to 12 years with confiscation (of assets),"" she warned. Vereshchuk urged Ukrainians who remain in Russia-controlled territories to evacuate or avoid voting in any plebiscites, as “no pressure, no violent incitement, etc., can later justify the fact that a person went to the referendum.” When asked, how many people potentially might take part in voting, Vereshchuk claimed the percentage is “tiny… not even 2%.” Commenting on the Ukrainian official’s statements, Grigory Karasin, the head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian State Duma, wrote on Telegram: “That's democracy in Kiev! It is strange that their citizens are not threatened with execution!” The Ukrainian government previously warned that citizens who attempt to become Russian citizens could be punished with up to 15 years in prison."

Wealth is only justified when the person who owns it “is ready to give a significant part of his funds to those who are in need, who suffer,” Patriarch Kirill said during his Sunday service at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow. In this case, “the God will be helping him to increase his material possessions,” while the people won’t envy those riches and won’t see their owner as “an enemy,” he insisted. “May God grant that our [Russian] rich people, who were born in an Orthodox country and many of whom have links with the Church, always understand this,” the Patriarch said. But if a person with a lot of money is unable to help those who need it, then “this is the way to hell and there’s nothing else to say here,” Kirill explained. He cited words of Jesus from the Bible, who said that “it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.” “If a rich person is unable to see the suffering of a fellow human being and doesn’t help, it’s clearly a path away from God, away from Christ and his kingdom. The more money one has, the more responsibility rests on his shoulders for his earthly existence,” the church leader told worshippers."
2022-09-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/562148-kiev-spreading-propaganda-fear/,Kiev spreading ‘propaganda by fear’ – French ex-presidential candidate,"A former French presidential candidate has accused Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky of using ‘war propaganda’ as a tool to obstruct the peace process. Veteran politician Segolene Royal also called on the UN and media associations to fight against such tactics. Royal’s suggestion, that some of the “war crimes” Kiev blames on Russian troops were part of ‘propaganda,’ has made her a target for widespread criticism. Speaking to BFMTV earlier this week, Royal said that “everyone knows that there is war propaganda by fear.” As an example, she cited the alleged shelling of a maternity hospital in Mariupol – the story which made headlines in Western media in early March. Zelensky blamed Russia for the incident that, as local authorities claimed, killed three people, including a child. The Russian military denied targeting the medical facility and insisted the whole thing was a “completely staged provocation” by the Ukrainian side. “You can imagine that if there had been any victim, any baby with blood, in the age of cell phones we would have seen [their photos],” Royal stressed. The authenticity of the photos presented by Kiev as proof of the claimed Russian attack were questioned by many online. Marianna Vyshemirskaya, one of the pregnant women featured in the images that appeared on the front pages of many major outlets, later claimed that there had been no Russian airstrike on the hospital. She insisted that she told AP journalists about this, but they decided not to mention it in their reportage. Royal, who used to be a long-term partner of France’s former president Francois Hollande, also commented on the events of April in the town of Bucha near Kiev, after which Zelensky claimed that negotiations with Russia became impossible. Ukrainian authorities accused the Russian forces of multiple atrocities against civilians in the town, including the rape of children. Moscow firmly denied the allegations of war crimes, insisting it was “yet another provocation” by Kiev. “The stories of child rape for seven hours under the eyes of the parents: but it’s monstrous to go and spread things like that only to interrupt the peace process,” the veteran French politician stated, without elaborating She also claimed that Zelensky used accounts of alleged torture of Ukrainian soldiers by Russian troops – which Moscow also vehemently denies – not only to impede any peace process but also to “remobilize” troops. She argued that as “there’s been enough horror of war and casualties” and that “Ukrainian propaganda” should be stopped “under the aegis of the UN and media organizations.” After BFMTV tweeted a fragment of her interview with a caption “Segolene Royal questions certain war crimes in Ukraine,” the politician responded that this was “false,” as she’d “never denied war crimes.” On Saturday, Royal published the final part of her remarks which, as she said, was cut by the television network. In this fragment she says that “there is a form of one-upmanship in the description of the horror, to encourage arms deliveries and to refrain from setting up negotiation and peace processes.” “To plead for peace is to act for the end of the suffering of the Ukrainian people and of Russian aggression,” she wrote in a caption to the video. Royal’s interview was condemned by some politicians as well as by many social media users. The Stand With Ukraine group representing the victims and the families of victims of “Russian aggression” even announced that it was considering filing a complaint against Royal in order to defend “the honor of disappeared.” Meanwhile, the president of the party The Patriots, Florian Philippot, criticized “the aggressive and crazy reactions” to Royal’s remarks and said that she “has every right, and an intellectual duty” to question war propaganda."
2022-09-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/562144-putin-g20-indonesia-bali/,Moscow speaks out on potential Putin G20 trip,"Multiple factors, including security, will decide whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to Indonesia for the G20 summit in November, Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov has said. Indonesian President Joko Widodo insisted last month that both Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping had promised him that they would personally attend the gathering of leaders from the world’s biggest economies, which will be held on the resort island of Bali. However, Peskov clarified on Sunday that the Kremlin had yet to make a decision regarding Putin’s attendance at the summit in two-and-a-half months’ time. The spokesman was asked by Rossiya 1 channel if it could be dangerous for the Russian leader to travel to Indonesia in light of the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev, in which the West has overwhelmingly supported the Ukrainian side. “In deciding on the format of our participation... all factors will be taken into account, including security factors, of course,” he replied. However, Peskov confirmed that “there is an invitation at the highest level [for Putin to attend], for which we are grateful to the host country of the upcoming summit.” Moscow confirmed Putin’s participation in the summit in Bali in July, but said it wasn’t yet clear whether he would attend in person or via video link. If Widodo’s claims are confirmed, the summit in Bali would be the first time that Putin, Xi and US President Joe Biden had met face-to-face since the launch of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine in late February. Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky has also been invited to the event by Indonesia, despite his country not being in the G20. Biden and some other Western politicians earlier called for Putin to be banned from the summit, but Widodo has resisted this pressure and insisted that the Russian leader must come to Bali."
2022-09-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/562075-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant/,Can the UN's mission to Europe's largest nuclear power plant prevent a Chernobyl-style catastrophe?,"A mighty explosion rattles a small town, whose residents wake up to scenes of a fire raging in the distance. Thousands of people flee their homes in what will soon become a new exclusion zone. Radioactive clouds spread across several European countries as precipitation poisons their lands, making large cities uninhabitable. And no, nobody pushed the nuclear button. All it could take to cause a major disaster, of this sort, is continued fighting on the ground around Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in a Ukrainian town. RT explains the dangers of shelling the Zaporozhye NPP and considers the likelihood of a new Chernobyl. Russian forces took control of the Zaporozhye plant back in March 2022. A major fire broke out nearby in the same month, after which the plant was shelled several times, but it was only the beginning. Recently, the volume of alarming news about the facility has been growing. Russia claims that the Ukrainians are deliberately targeting the hazardous site. The last attack attempt was made by Ukrainian troops on Thursday when representatives of the IAEA mission were at the station, Moscow insists. Over 40 motor boats, divided into two groups and carrying more than 250 Ukrainian special operations troops and foreign mercenaries, reportedly tried to land on the coast of the Kakhovka reservoir not far from Energodar, where the nuclear power plant is located. The assailants were quickly spotted and targeted by Russia’s Su-30 jets and Ka-52 attack helicopters. Those strikes sank some 20 boats, while the rest turned and retreated. The remaining Ukrainian troops were than targeted by Russian artillery as they tried to come ashore, the Defence Ministry in Moscow said. As a result of the attack, only one reactor out of six was operational for most of the day, officials have explained. The first four reactors were forced to shut down even earlier. On August 25, Energoatom reported an unprecedented complete cutoff of the NPP from the Ukrainian grid. The military-civilian administration of Zaporozhye Region explained that it was caused by the emergency protection system, which automatically disconnected the main units. “A strike by Ukraine’s forces on high-voltage power lines in the area of the Zaporozhye NPPresulted in a fire in the security zone of the 750 kV power line. The fire caused a short circuit. The emergency protection system turned off two power units followed by a power outage in the whole of the Zaporozhye Region,” Yevgeny Balitsky, the head of the Zaporozhye administration, wrote. He says the units which were shut down last week are currently working at 60% and 80% of their capacity respectively. At the same time, the Zaporozhye plant remains a part of Ukraine’s power grid and is run by Ukrainian staff. It supplies electricity to nearby regions through three 750 kV lines and one 330kV line. Apparently aware of the questionable logic behind accusing Russia of shelling its own positions, the Americans and their western allies have so far refrained for laying the blame squarely on Moscow. Bonnie Jenkins, the US Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security, said she could not give any confirmation as to where the shelling was coming from. But, she added, “we would not be in this situation if Russia would simply withdraw and give the site back to Ukraine.” A joint statement by 42 countries called on Moscow to do so in mid-August. What the international community has been able to achieve so far is to agree on dispatching an emergency IAEA mission, which arrived at the Zaporozhye NPP on September 1. The team includes experts from Poland, Lithuania, Serbia, China, France, Italy, Jordan, Mexico, Albania, and North Macedonia. Given fears that fighting in the area – which has damaged power lines and caused fires – could lead to disaster, the mission intends to inspect the condition of the NPP and measure radiation levels, the Wall Street Journal reports. They have also brought critical spare parts for the plant. Nuclear energy expert Valentin Gibalov says the IAEA’s main objective is to conduct an inventory of radioactive and nuclear materials, as the agency lacks the power to influence the fighting, let alone stop it completely. “They are coming to count new fuel assemblies at the power plant, take a look at the control systems, etc. They can say what they think, of course, suggest a safer way to move forward, but IAEA representatives can’t stop the military action,” he told RT. Indeed, the source of the problem is not going away. The Russian Defense Ministry claims Kiev continues to stage provocations in order to create the threat of a major nuclear disaster in Zaporozhye. Ukraine responds with accusations of Russian actions. Mikhail Podoliak, an adviser to the head of the Office of the President, has alleged that Russian troops targeted the corridors used by the IAEA mission to get to the power plant. The decision to build the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant was passed by the Council of Ministers of the USSR in 1977. It has 6 VVER pressurized water reactors, generating a total of about 6,000 MW, which makes it the most powerful in Europe. The first of its six reactors was put into operation in late 1984, less than 18 months before the infamous Chernobyl disaster. According to Valentin Gibalov, the 40-year-old plant is considerably more vulnerable to external threats than a modern facility. But even today, 100% guaranteed protection from military strikes would be unrealistic, he says. “It’s true that the possibility of a terrorist attack is considered when nuclear power plants are designed today, but one almost never expects the facility to be resilient to artillery fire or aerial bombs, and the military can always find ways to inflict substantial damage on any plant. Massive attacks on the ZNPP could result in a Fukushima-sized nuclear emergency. “This mainly applies to the two units which remain online. The reactors which are in ‘cold shutdown’ are less disaster-prone, but some leakage can still occur if the containment building is damaged or the energy supply or cooling systems are completely disabled. This, however, would require a deliberate large-scale attack,” Gibalov says. Sergey Mukhametov, an assistant professor at Moscow State University’s Faculty of Geography, says a nuclear power plant is, hypothetically, supposed to to capable of withstanding the impact of a plane crash. “The Fukushima plant easily survived a major earthquake. It was then hit by a tsunami wave higher than the level it had been designed for, but even that wasn’t critical. What caused the meltdown was seawater flooding the emergency generators powering the pumps and the resultant loss of reactor core cooling. That led to overheating and the release of radioactivity. “However, a nuclear power plant will inevitably be crippled by sustained shelling. It is a sophisticated facility, which could be compromised by disabling the cooling systems, for instance. It requires other resources as well. The reactors must obviously be shut down in a safe manner, but it’s a highly complex process. On top of that, many cities rely on the ZNPP, which is the largest in Europe, for power. Not Kiev itself, but we’re talking about almost half of Ukraine, which this [Ukrainian] government is apparently no longer interested in,” he said. Vladimir Rogov, a member of the military-civilian administration of the Zaporozhye Region, reported on August 29 that a Ukrainian strike had penetrated the roof of Special Unit 1, which, according to Rogov, is used to store fresh fuel for the reactors. Valentin Gibalov says such incidents do not pose an immediate threat. “A special unit of a nuclear power plant is a place where medium- and low-activity radioactive waste accumulates in the course of work, such as contaminated clothes or wastewater left after equipment deactivation. Just a hole in the roof is no big deal. If youdestroy the whole unit, you will end up with a local contamination which may affect the neighboring area, but nothing more than that,” he explained. He added, however, that the Zaporozhye NPP also has a dry cask storage facility for spent fuel, where the level of radioactivity poses a much bigger threat. “A direct hit by a 155 mm shell, for example, could destroy this storage. But you really need a very high level of precision. If you just strike close to it, nothing will happen,” he said. Incidentally, 155 mm howitzers are supplied to the Ukrainian armed forces as part of foreign aid. “A more dangerous scenario would be the destruction of the reactors’ containment buildings. This absolutely can’t be done by accident, this would have to be a deliberate operation to create a radioactive disaster. I hope that neither side wants to see the events take a catastrophic turn. But one can only hope,” Valentin Gibalov said. According to Sergey Mukhametov, if a reactor were to blow up, the local authorities would have to resort to the practices used to manage the Chernobyl accident. “Depending on the scale they would have to impose a new exclusion zone, destroying everything in the area. No scenario can be ruled out. It’s obvious to everybody that the best solution is to leave the Zaporozhye NPP alone, but this is not what’s happening. I’m sure it’s obvious to the military commanders as well, but they have their own goals and priorities,” he added. The impact of a possible meltdown at Zaporozhye will depend on where exactly radioactivity will be released into the air or water. Sergey Mukhametov says all countries around Ukraine may be affected. “Talking about air masses, the bad news for Russia is that the ZNPP is located at a latitude where western disturbances prevail, which means that west winds prevail over other winds, and we get air masses blowing in from the Atlantic towards the Ural mountains. Admittedly, on a given day, the wind may be blowing in the other direction, towards Europe. As we remember, back in 1986, Geiger counters were clicking all across Europe even before the USSR reported about the Chernobyl accident,” he said. Radioactive dust will not stay airborne forever but will settle on the territories is sweeps over. This is the reason why, as some data suggest, the USSR deliberately produced radioactive precipitation after the Chernobyl disaster so that contaminated substances would settle before reaching densely populated cities. “Radioactive rain can happen naturally. But you must remember that rainwater brings radiation down onto the ground where it contaminates the soil and then percolates into underground water. The area of contamination can thus spread over time,” Mukhametov explained. A release of radioactivity into water presents a different scenario. “Any nuclear reactor needs cooling, unless the plant, like Fukushima, is located on the coast,” Mukhametov says. “Special ponds are built to hold water that circulates around the plant cooling it. It’s like a car engine. If water from these ponds seeps into the Kakhovka Reservoir, which is located close to the ZNPP and Energodar, it will then make its way into the Dnieper and go downstream. The problem is that further down the Dnieper is the North Crimean Canal, which was reopened after the start of the special military operation. It is used for agriculture and will need to be sealed immediately in case of an accident.” One should remember that the Dnieper flows into the Black Sea, an area of powerful cyclones which turn water flows anticlockwise. “If contaminated water makes it to the Black Sea, the spot, mixed with other water, will move along the Odessa coast and float past Romania and Bulgaria until it reaches the Bosporus and possibly enters the Sea of Marmara. The Black Sea, which survived the Chernobyl disaster fairly easily, will hardly be affected much. And it’s less important for the Russian fishing industry than the eastern and northern seas. The issue is, however, that we don’t know exactly the scale of a possible disaster at the ZNPP,” he said."
2022-09-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/562138-ukraine-nato-negotiations-wsj/,Better for Ukraine to ‘negotiate now’ – retired US general,"Sustaining the conflict in Ukraine is becoming increasingly difficult for NATO, so Kiev must think about negotiating with Moscow, retired US Army brigadier general Mark T. Kimmitt has said in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal. Washington’s latest military aid package to Kiev last month included “older and less advanced” systems, which “may indicate that battlefield consumption rates have outpaced production to a point where excess inventories provided to Ukraine are nearly exhausted,” Kimmitt pointed out in his article on Thursday. Dealing with “dwindling stocks of leading-edge weapon systems” in NATO countries would likely mean a prolonged conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Such a scenario could result in “more pressure from supporting nations, sustained inflation, less heating gas, and falling popular support” in the West, he wrote. Kimmitt, who served as assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs in 2008-09, suggested four ways to speed up the resolution of the conflict, which has now been underway for six months. The first option is to “dig deeper” into NATO stockpiles and send arms to Kiev that have so far been withheld by members due to their own national defense requirements, the retired general suggested. That’s something EU countries may be willing to do as it’s “better to use these weapons in Kherson than Krakow,” he added. The US and its European allies could also try ramping up production of the systems that are required by the Zelensky government, Kimmitt said, acknowledging that such a move would unlikely have an immediate effect on the situation on the ground. The third option is “to step up the conflict” by providing Ukraine with longer-range systems, such as ATACM missiles, F-16 jets, and Patriots, and “broaden the rules of engagement to attack targets in Crimea and possibly Russia,” he wrote. However, the retired general warned that such escalation would definitely face a “response from Moscow” and create the risk of conflict spilling into Europe. The final available solution, according to Kimmitt, is for Ukraine to “push for an interim diplomatic resolution without (or with) territorial concessions.” “There is little incentive to negotiate” at the moment, but Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky “must recognize that diminishing resupplies would have a disastrous effect on his army, not merely for battlefield operations but for the message of declining outside support it would send to the people of Ukraine,” he insisted. “Beginning the diplomatic resolution would be distasteful, and perhaps seen as defeatist, but as there is little chance of climbing out of the current morass, it may be better to negotiate now than later,” the retired general said. The two sides haven’t sat down at the negotiating table since talks in Istanbul in late March. Moscow, which had initially been optimistic about the prospects for the peace process, later accused Kiev of backtracking on all the progress that had been achieved in Turkey and said it had lost all trust in the Ukrainian negotiators. Russian officials warned that Moscow’s demands would be more extensive if talks were to resume."
2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/562131-kadyrov-hints-at-resignation/,Chechen leader says his time ‘has come’,"Ramzan Kadyrov, who has led Russia’s Chechen Republic for 15 years, has claimed he deserves “an indefinite and long vacation,” after holding his position for too long. Kadyrov shared a video address on his Telegram channel on Saturday, giving his thoughts on becoming the main “long-liver” among the heads of Russian regions. He quipped that probably the “time has come” for him to consider resigning, before he is “kicked out.” The Chechen leader said his youth is gone and ""we will try to leave on time.” “I myself noticed that I’ve been holding on for too long. I think that I fully deserved an indefinite and long vacation,” he commented in his video. Kadyrov cited a Chechen proverb as an example. “We have a saying in the Caucasus, no matter how long-awaited a guest is, it’s nice when he leaves on time.” Kadyrov made similar statements in November 2017 and February 2016, hinting at an impending departure. Kadyrov took charge of Chechnya in 2007, and has remained at the helm ever since. At present in Russia there are no restrictions on the term a regional leader can serve."
2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/562129-us-rules-out-russia-visa-ban/,US rules out Russia visa ban,"Washington won’t restrict the visas for all Russians as a punishment for Russia’s actions in Ukraine, said John Kirby, US National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, in an interview with the Dozhd TV channel that was released on Saturday. The US has introduced visa restrictions for individual Russians whom it considers to be “regime supporters,” Kirby said. However, Washington doesn’t believe that “holding all Russians accountable” is a productive measure, as the US’ decisions shouldn’t be turned into a war with the entire Russian people. It is not the Russian people who should be blamed, but “president [Vladimir] Putin and his cabinet,” he explained. On August 31, the foreign ministers of the 27 EU countries decided to suspend the visa facilitation agreement with Russia, which means reducing the number of visas issued and making it more difficult to obtain them. The details remain unclear, yet it’s certain that the introduction of the ban will result in more difficult, longer and more expensive procedures for Russians to obtain a Schengen visa. Russia sent troops into Ukraine in late February, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/562119-ukrainian-boy-rocket-launcher/,Ukrainian boy shoots rocket launcher at his brother,"A live munition went off during an arms show in the east Ukrainian city of Chernigov on Saturday, injuring at least five people including four children, some of them seriously, according to the prosecutor general’s office. Local media have reported a higher tally, saying four adults and four children were injured. The incident occurred during an open-air “weaponry exhibition” held by a local museum. According to media reports, a 10-year-old boy was playing with an anti-tank weapon, believed to be a Soviet-made RPG-18 single-use rocket-propelled grenade. The boy reportedly aimed the weapon at his 12-year-old brother and discharged it, injuring his sibling and several bystanders, including a 2-year-old child. All the injured were apparently hit only by the weapon’s exhaust, as the munition itself blasted away, striking the roof of a house, according to local authorities. It was not immediately clear whether the boy was able to ready the grenade launcher on his own or if the weapon was put on display in its battle-ready state. RPGs of that type need to be unfolded before use, and once in that state, have no safety features. Ukrainian officials have provided conflicting accounts of the incident and the exact nature of the arms show. According to prosecutors, the event was staged by a local territorial defense unit, displaying its own armaments. The head of the local military-civilian administration, Vyacheslav Chaus, claimed the origins of the “dangerous exhibits” were unclear and the whole event was organized to provide an “interactive” experience for children. However, the Chernigov city council insists it was not aware of the event, and did not provide permission to hold it. Some media reported that the show was organized by unspecified “volunteers,” who held a fundraiser to procure combat vehicles for Ukrainian troops."
2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/562121-gorbachev-funeral-moscow-ussr/,Gorbachev laid to rest in Moscow,"Mikhail Gorbachev has been buried alongside his wife Raisa at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow after a farewell ceremony attended by hundreds of mourners. The first and only president of the Soviet Union died in the Russian capital on August 30 at the age of 91. The funeral took place on Saturday afternoon with the participation of honor guards. The coffin with the body of the Soviet leader was covered with the Russian state flag as it was carried to the burial place. Earlier in the day, a farewell ceremony took place in Moscow’s House of the Unions where hundreds of people, including politicians and foreign diplomats, were lining up to pay their respects to Gorbachev. Russian President Vladimir Putin was not able to attend the funeral, but he paid his last tribute to the late Soviet leader before the official ceremony, on Thursday. After becoming the leader of the Soviet Union in 1985, Gorbachev launched sweeping reforms known as “perestroika” aimed at liberalizing the country’s economy and public life. His tenure saw the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War. He resigned at the end of 1991 with the breakup of the Soviet Union. In 1990, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."
2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/562117-klyuchevskaya-sopka-volcano-kamchatka/,Scaling of Eurasia’s tallest active volcano results in multiple casualties,"Five people have been killed in an attempt to climb Eurasia’s tallest active volcano, the Klyuchevskaya Sopka, at Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia’s Far East, the federal investigative committee has said. The incident occurred on Saturday, when a group of dozen tourists was at an altitude of around 4,150 meters, according to the statement by the agency. “According to preliminary data, five people have died after falling from great height,” the investigative committee said, adding that another person has been severely injured and remains unconscious. One of the guides who accompanied the tourists also fractured his leg, with his colleague calling for help via a satellite phone, the statement read. The investigative committee announced that it has launched a criminal case on inflicting death by negligence over the incident. The emergency ministry said that it has sent its rescuers to the Klyuchevskaya Sopka. With the altitude being too high for the helicopter to reach, they would have to walk to the site of the accident by foot from 3,300 meters. The tourists in the ill-fated group had arrived from different parts of Russia, including the capital, Moscow, their climb being organized by a firm from the Siberian city of Novosibirsk. At 4,649 meters in height, Klyuchevskaya Sopka is the tallest active volcano in Eurasia. It’s located on the Kamchatka Peninsula, a remote yet picturesque area in Russia’s Far East that hosts more than a hundred volcanoes, including 29 active ones."
2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/561994-ukraine-conflict-paid-bloody-sport/,How some Western 'fans' of Ukraine are turning the conflict into a paid-for blood sport,"For many Westerners, watching the conflict in Ukraine is a lot like watching a spectator sport. It’s a mindset exacerbated by the bombardment of pro-Ukrainian propaganda in the media, through the mythmaking of fictional Ukrainian superheroes and the dehumanization of Russians – including civilians. And now, that indulgence in violence has taken on a new level, becoming almost like an interactive video game in which far away observers can become indirect participants in the conflict. Those who’ve bought into the narrative proudly sport the team colors of the blue and yellow and indulge themselves in the merchandise promoting their team – all from the safety of their monitors. From Zelensky bobblehead dolls and custom Lego figures to “Saint Javelin” stickers, war profiteers (who call themselves “volunteers,” of course) are now selling messages on artillery shells that land in residential neighborhoods in Donbass, as detailed by the Washington Post. People can now participate in the bloody spectacle by paying money to put their slogans on bombs and drones directed at Russians and the Russian-speaking population of Donbass. Thousands of Westerners not directly affected by the violence are happily playing this interactive video game, sponsoring messages like “Hey Ruskie! I hope you like Ukrainian heavy metal,” to the less subtle “F**k Russians!,” which the Western government-funded ""Kyiv Independent"" has happily cited as examples. It’s a practice made easy by dehumanizing every Russian-speaking person in Donbass by calling them “orcs” or comparing Russian forces to the medieval Mongol hordes, aided by the creation of fictional heroes like the “Ghost of Kiev” and the Ukrainian troops who surrendered on Snake Island – false narratives eagerly promoted by tabloids and cheerleaders like US Congressman Adam Kinzinger and professional Russophobe Malcolm Nance. There’s a certain level of audacity required to be so involved in a conflict between two countries, one of which (the one you are rooting for) many couldn’t even identify on a map six months ago. Those who indulge in the commodification of real-world suffering aren’t just wishing for the deaths of people they don’t know, but happily pay to become indirect participants. One of the non-profits responsible for penning the messages eagerly admits that it harnesses “hatred of Russians” into getting people to pay for it. “Some volunteers take orders right on the front line, writing messages on shells with a permanent marker. Others take a more professional approach, painting the shells in advance and delivering the already branded ammunition to soldiers,” the Kyiv Independent reported. It’s a business, if a bloody one – adding slogans to artillery shells can come as cheap as $10 for generic lines to as much as $500 for more elaborate custom designs. Those who pay for their messages to be written on bombs are told that the money is used to buy fuel, food, and munitions for Ukrainian troops in the front lines. The more you contribute, the more accomplished you feel – not that there’s any way to track where your money’s going. The question as to why the Ukrainian military would need donations when it’s being bankrolled by Western governments – through taxpayer money, of course – isn’t one that even seems to cross the minds of anyone immersed in this new form of interactive entertainment. Writing messages on bombs isn’t anything new – it’s a well-documented practice that’s been done since the Second World War – but commodifying it for a global audience tuned in to real-time bloodsport is a wholly new development made possible with the rise of social media. It’s bread and circuses for the 21st century bourgeoisie – folks who want to feel like they’re accomplishing something while ignoring the social collapse happening all around them. And in case you’re wondering – no, you’re not allowed to cheer for the opposing team. Don’t question it. If Russians ran similar campaigns to write “F**k Americans” on IEDs used by the Taliban against US forces in Afghanistan, there would be Congressional pushes to declare war on Russia and no end of pearl-clutching in the media. As long as there’s a demand for entertainment, someone will provide it, and the propagandists will justify it – no matter how terrible the costs are for the civilians on the receiving end of those bombs."
2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/562110-zaporozhye-nuclear-plant-ukraine/,Moscow reveals details of latest Ukrainian assault near Zaporozhye nuclear plant,"Russia’s defense ministry has confirmed that Ukraine has made yet another attempt to take over the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant late on Friday, revealing some details of Kiev’s operation, which failed. Over 40 motor boats, divided into two groups and carrying over 250 Ukrainian special operations troops and foreign mercenaries, tried to land on the coast of the Kakhovka reservoir not far from Energodar, host city of the nuclear power plant, a ministry statement said on Saturday. The attackers were quickly spotted and struck by Russia’s Su-30 jets and Ka-52 attack helicopters. Those strikes sunk some 20 boats, while the rest turned around and retreated. The remaining Ukrainian troops were than targeted by the Russian artillery as they tried getting ashore in the Ukrainian-controlled territory, the ministry said. According to Moscow, the failed attack on the nuclear power plant saw 47 Ukrainian service personnel killed, including ten foreign mercenaries, with at least 20 others wounded. Kiev’s special forces attempted to storm the facility despite the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) being there, the defense ministry stressed. Ukraine attempted a similar attack ahead of the arrival of the IAEA team at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant on Thursday. It was also repelled by Russian troops, with the Ukrainian assault force suffering heavy losses. Moscow has suggested that Kiev’s plan was to capture the nuclear plant and then use the staff of the UN nuclear watchdog as “human shields” to maintain control over it. Russia has been insisting on international inspectors coming to the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant as it accused Ukraine of repeatedly shelling the facility in recent weeks and of risking a disaster that could affect many countries in Europe. Ukraine claims that the Russian forces who have been in control of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant since March have turned it into a military base and that they’re striking the station themselves in order to pin the blame on Kiev. IAEA chef Rafael Grossi, who headed the team of inspectors at the facility, has confirmed that the physical integrity of the plant “has been violated several times,” but added that it was impossible to determine if the damage was deliberate or accidental."
2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/562108-hungarian-premier-attends-gorbachev-funeral/,EU country’s leader attends Gorbachev funeral,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is in Moscow for the funeral of former USSR president Mikhail Gorbachev, who died on August 30 at the age of 91. According to the Kremlin, there is no meeting planned between Orban and Russian President Vladimir Putin afterwards. Orban paid his last respects to Gorbachev in Moscow’s House of the Unions on Saturday. He laid flowers at the base of the casket and offered his condolences to the bereaved family. Aside from the Hungarian premier, US Ambassador John Sullivan, British Ambassador Deborah Bronnert, German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr, French Ambassador Pierre Levy and Spanish Ambassador Marcos Gomez Martinez attended the memorial ceremony. The last leader of the Soviet Union passed away late on Tuesday. Gorbachev served as general secretary of the USSR’s Central Committee of the Communist Party from 1985 to 1990, going on to become the first and last president of the USSR. He left office after the country dissolved at the end of 1991. In his time as Soviet leader, Gorbachev launched sweeping reforms, known as perestroika, aimed at liberalizing the economy and public life. It was under his leadership that the Berlin Wall fell and the Cold War came to an end – something for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990. Gorbachev’s critics, however, blame him for the collapse of the Soviet Union and Russia’s subsequent loss of prestige and global influence. He will be buried in Moscow’s Novodevichy Cemetery next to his wife Raisa, who died in 1999."
2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/562104-german-ex-chancellor-ukraine-crimea/,German ex-chancellor weighs in on Crimea,"There is no prospect of Ukraine retaking Crimea by force, as the vast majority of the local population are ethnic Russians, former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has claimed in an interview. Speaking to Spain’s ABC newspaper last Saturday, Schroeder said: “the idea that President Zelensky could reconquer [Crimea] militarily makes no sense.” Schroder, who led Germany from 1998 until 2005, pointed out that it was Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev who made Crimea part of the then-Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, thinking the USSR would “last as long as the Catholic Church.” Schroeder mentioned his own repeated condemnation of Russia’s military offensive against Ukraine, describing it as a “mistake of the Russian Government.” However, he expressed doubt as to whether distancing himself personally from Russian President Vladimir Putin “would do any good.” “There must be concessions on both sides” if the parties in the conflict are serious about peace, the ex-chancellor insisted. However, according to Schroeder, such negotiations cannot succeed without the consent of the US as “this conflict is part of a larger geopolitical confrontation.” The former chancellor believes Washington is anxious as it knows it is losing its global hegemony, with China being the main rival. Russia, however, is not on a par with the US economically, and is therefore not a serious competitor, Schroeder opined. The 78-year-old veteran of German politics said that “Beijing is acting in this conflict in an extraordinarily rational way,” buying Russian oil and gas at a discount. European nations, by contrast, might be making a big mistake by relying too much on the US, and could end up losing their autonomy. However, there is currently no threat to the existence of the European Union in Schroeder’s eyes. He described as a “positive step” Sweden’s and Finland’s decision to join NATO. Commenting on the deepening energy crisis in Germany, the ex-chancellor said that just like many families in the country, his is already feeling the impact. He called on the German government to launch the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is ready to pump gas to Europe. Schroeder warned of “huge” consequences unless his advice is heeded."
2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/news/562097-ukraine-raid-speedboats-energodar/,Kiev attempts new raid near Zaporozhye nuclear plant – local official,"Ukrainian forces launched another attempted raid on the Russian-held town of Energodar shortly after midnight on Saturday, after shelling the area in the vicinity of Zaporozhye nuclear plant, according to a top local official. Several sabotage groups used at least 15 speedboats in an attempt to cross the Kakhovka Reservoir, local military-civilian administration member Vladimir Rogov claimed. The groups were allegedly seeking to land in three different locations – the nuclear city of Energodar itself, and the nearby towns of Vasilyevka and Dneproprudnoye. The first unverified reports of multiple speedboats moving out from the Ukraine-controlled shore of the reservoir emerged around midnight, coinciding with allegations of renewed shelling of the city of Energodar. After receiving and confirming information about the swarm of boats, Russian forces allegedly deployed Ka-52 attack helicopters and successfully repelled the attempted assault, Rogov said in a follow-up Telegram post around 2:45am. The Russian Defense Ministry is expected to share more details about the engagement soon, he added. The alleged new botched raid comes just two days after Kiev forces reportedly attempted to seize the Zaporozhye NPP shortly before a team of experts with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) – including the organization’s head, Rafael Grossi – arrived at the plant for an inspection. The failed September 1 operation was aimed at capturing the nuclear plant and using the personnel of the UN nuclear watchdog as “human shields” to maintain control over the facility, the Russian military suggested. The renewed attacks come after the departure of the main IAEA mission, even as Grossi said that six of the agency’s experts stayed behind in Energodar. Four of them will return after the weekend, while two will remain to keep a “permanent presence” at the NPP. Energodar and the Zaporozhye facility have been under Russian control since early March, and functioned without problems until drone and artillery attacks began in July. According to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, there have been 29 attacks against the Zaporozhye facility since July 18, involving 120 artillery projectiles and 16 kamikaze drones. Kiev has argued that the shellings were false-flag operations carried out by Moscow to make Ukraine look bad, but also that Russia was using the plant as a base for heavy artillery and equipment. On Friday, the Ukrainian General Staff admitted for the first time that Kiev’s troops have targeted the area of the nuclear power plant, allegedly attempting to strike Russian artillery systems. Moscow has consistently denied the accusations, saying that only lightly armed guards were deployed at the facility to ensure its security."
2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/562096-husband-murder-beauty-queen/,Husband sentenced for Russian beauty queen murder,"A Russian man found guilty of murdering his wife, a former beauty pageant star, has been sentenced to more than a decade in prison by a Moscow court, after horrific details of the case shocked the nation. The Sherbinsky District Court of Moscow convicted Alexander Popov for the murder of his wife Kseniya Popova (née Sapozhnikova) on Friday, handing down a 12-year prison sentence for the grisly crime. “After examining the evidence presented by the parties, evaluating the case materials, the court delivered a guilty verdict, according to which Alexander Popov was found guilty of the murder of his wife … and sentenced him to imprisonment for a term of 12 years,” the court said in a statement on Telegram. Popov initially went to the police in January to report his wife missing, claiming she had gone on a trip overseas and never returned. However, law enforcement soon grew suspicious of the man and made him their prime suspect, finding that Popova never left Russia, while interviews with her relatives revealed that they had received odd messages from her which did not fit with her usual mannerisms. Further doubts about Popov’s story were raised when officers discovered he had sent his daughter away to a friend’s house sometime in August 2021, after which he was seen hauling large trash bags out of his home. Popov eventually confessed to the murder after contacting the police, reportedly admitting to killing his wife and even showed the investigators where he disposed of her body. While he later retracted some of confessions, he was nonetheless convicted based on the evidence against him, though the court noted he still has a chance to appeal within 10 days of his official guilty verdict. As a young adult, Popova was a well-known beauty queen, and was crowned the winner of the ‘Miss Kuzbass’ contest in 2010. Born in the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk, she also sought to compete in the ‘Miss Russia’ 2011 contest. She moved to Moscow with her husband in 2020, after Popov found a job working for the Moscow Metro. He had previously served as a government official in their hometown."
2022-09-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/562093-zaporozhye-energodar-nuclear-shelling/,Ukrainian nuclear plant targeted again – official,"Ukrainian artillery have again targeted the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant and the city of Energodar, local military-civilian administration member Vladimir Rogov said on Friday night. The attack comes after Ukraine’s military admitted to bombing the area for the first time, and follows a failed attempt by Kiev’s commandos to seize the plant while UN inspectors were visiting. Four rounds impacted the area of the Zaporozhye NPP, Rogov said on Telegram shortly before midnight on Friday, with at least one heavy projectile allegedly landing between reactors two and three, while three struck about 400 meters to the east. The shelling has cut the main power line along the Dnieper river, so the ZNPP is having to divert power for its own operational needs, he added. The power plant had returned to normal operation by 2 am local time, with two of the reactors running, RIA Novosti reported citing local officials. However, around 20 explosions were heard in Energodar again. The renewed attack comes after the departure of the main International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission, which visited the facility on Thursday. However, IAEA director Rafael Grossi told reporters on Friday that six of the agency’s experts stayed behind in Energodar. Four of them will return after the weekend and two will remain as a “permanent presence” at the NPP, Grossi said after landing in Vienna. “If something happens or if any limitation comes, they are going to be reporting it to us. It’s no longer a matter of A said this and B said the contrary,” Grossi said. “For those who may have intentions on the plant, knowing that international inspectors are there, witnessing and informing immediately what is happening, has, I think, an inherent very important stabilizing effect.” Meanwhile, the Ukrainian General Staff admitted for the first time that Kiev’s troops have targeted the area of the nuclear power plant. In an official briefing on Friday they claimed to have destroyed three Russian artillery systems “in the areas of the settlements of Kherson and Energodar.” Previously, Kiev claimed that Russian troops stationed in the vicinity were staging false-flag attacks to make Ukraine look bad. According to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, there have been 29 attacks against the Zaporozhye facility since July 18, involving 120 artillery projectiles and 16 kamikaze drones. On Thursday, as the IAEA mission approached the plant, a group of Ukrainian commandos landed in Energodar using boats and tried to take over the compound. Both the initial wave and their reinforcements were eliminated by Russian troops, Moscow said. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky complained on Friday that Grossi had not demanded the demilitarization of the Zaporozhye NPP and its surroundings, calling it “the key security point of our agreements.” Meanwhile, his adviser Mikhail Podolyak told Ukrainian media that no international organization, including the IAEA, ought to be trusted."
2022-09-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/562082-ukraine-admits-bombing-npp/,Ukraine admits shelling area around nuclear plant,"The Ukrainian military publicly admitted striking the area around the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant in an official General Staff briefing on Friday. Previously, Kiev had claimed that Russian forces used the plant as a military base; now it says all troops have relocated due to the visit by IAEA inspectors. “In the areas of the settlements of Kherson and Energodar, accurate strikes by our troops destroyed three enemy artillery systems, as well as an ammunition depot and up to a company of personnel,” said the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the daily briefing. The military also claimed that, due to the arrival of the IAEA inspection team, the Russian “occupiers removed all military equipment from the territory of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. About 100 units moved to the plant ‘Atom Energomash’ and the rest were dispersed in the nearest settlements.” Energodar and the Zaporozhye facility have been under Russian control since early March, and functioned without problems until drone and artillery attacks began in July. Kiev has argued that the shelling was a false-flag operation by Moscow to make Ukraine look bad, but also that Russia was using the plant as a base for heavy artillery and equipment. Moscow has consistently denied the accusations, saying that only lightly armed guards were deployed at the facility to ensure its security. On Friday, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said Ukrainian claims that Moscow was using the facility to attack Ukrainian positions “with long-range artillery systems” were “blatant lies.” “I state with confidence that we do not have heavy weapons at the territory of the nuclear power stations and in adjacent neighborhoods,” Shoigu said at a meeting in Moscow, adding that he hoped the IAEA inspectors would testify to this as well. Shoigu also said there have been 29 attacks against the Zaporozhye facility since July 18, involving 120 artillery projectiles and 16 kamikaze drones. The IAEA mission arrived at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant on Thursday, led by agency chief Rafael Grossi personally. Grossi said the IAEA planned to have a “continued presence” on the site. As the IAEA team was en route, a group of Ukrainian commandos used boats to land in Energodar and attempted to storm the power plant. Their goal, according to the Russian Defense Ministry, was to use the IAEA inspectors as “human shields.” However, Russian troops destroyed both the initial strike group and its reinforcements."
2022-09-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/562061-mirotvorets-gorbachev-death-liquidated/,Ukrainian state-linked site celebrates Gorbachev’s ‘liquidation’,"The late Soviet reformist leader Mikhail Gorbachev has now been marked as “liquidated” by a controversial Ukrainian website that lists supposed enemies of Kiev. Mirotvorets, or ‘Peacemaker’, is a public database of individuals, whom anonymous moderators consider a threat to Ukrainian national security. Gorbachev is now listed among such people. After he passed away on Tuesday at the age of 91, the Ukrainian website updated his profile, adding the date of death and stamping the word “liquidated” in red letters across his photo. Though the term implies state assassination, the treatment is the same that Mirotvorets uses for all supposed enemies of Ukraine that it reports as dying, regardless of the cause. Gorbachev was added to the Mirotvorets blacklist over a May 2016 interview with the British newspaper The Sunday Times, in which he said: “I’m always with the free will of the people and most in Crimea wanted to be reunited with Russia.” He was referring to the referendum held in the former Ukrainian region after breaking from Kiev in the wake of the 2014 Maidan coup. The people of the Crimean peninsula voted overwhelmingly to reunite with Russia, which Moscow granted. Kiev and its allies described the plebiscite as conducted “at gunpoint” and refused to acknowledge its outcome. Mirotvorets is technically a private enterprise, but is widely believed to be connected with the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. Anton Gerashchenko, who was a ministerial advisor at the time the website was launched, was a vocal promoter of the database and indicated that he had input on its content. Gorbachev’s interview put him at odds with the new authorities in Kiev in a more direct way too. The SBU, Ukraine’s successor to the KGB, announced that he had been banned from entering the country for five years, days after it was published."

They look extremely ineffective, extremely cowardly and extremely unprofessional,” Mikhail Podolyak said in an interview on Thursday evening. This applies “not only to the IAEA”, but also to the UN, Amnesty International, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Ukrainian official claimed, adding: “By default, you should not trust them.” Podolyak’s remarks came as he criticized the IAEA mission to the Russia-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, which arrived earlier in the day. He expressed his low expectations from the mission, based on the positive remarks that Director General Rafael Grossi made after touring the facility in Ukraine. The Ukrainian official said he was willing to give the IAEA inspectors the benefit of the doubt and wait for them make an official report that would “show the depth of their inner destruction”. He explained his concerns, citing several aspects of Grossi’s visit. They include its relatively short duration, which Podolyak assessed was too short for a proper fact-finding mission. He also criticized the willingness of the IAEA chief to talk to a representative of the Russian atomic energy body Rosatom, who, Podolyak said, “delivered a strange long speech” to the UN official. The IAEA experts arrived at the station from Kiev despite continued military action in its vicinity. Kiev and Moscow have accused each other of being behind the shelling and of trying to derail the inspection. Some members of the mission stayed behind to monitor the situation, while Grossi and others left. Podolyak said the IAEA should blame Russia for attacks on the plant, and if their report fails to do so, only stating that inspectors witnessed evidence of strikes, his opinion about the organization will be vindicated. President Vladimir Zelensky too has expressed skepticism about the IAEA visit to the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. In a video statement on Thursday evening, he accused Grossi of failing to secure access to the station to “independent journalists”, who wanted to visit with the inspectors. Russia has accused Kiev of trying to send intelligence agents under the guise of the press. The visit was covered by Russia-vetted journalists, whom Zelensky branded “a crowd of propagandists.”"
2022-09-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/562044-russian-defense-minister-ukrainian-counteroffensive/,Russian defense minister comments on Ukrainian counteroffensive,"The Ukrainian military is suffering heavy casualties as it tries to retake territories seized earlier by Russian forces in southern Ukraine, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has said. Speaking on Friday during a conference call at the ministry, Shoigu stated that “the Ukrainian armed forces’ attempts at an offensive continue on the Nikolaev-Krivorozsk and other directions, and the enemy is suffering considerable losses.” The minister went on to allege that the counteroffensive had been planned by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky’s office “solely to create the illusion before the Western backers that the Ukrainian military is able to conduct an offensive.” Shoigu also claimed that Russian forces had taken over a village in Kherson region and reached the administrative border with Nikolaev region. On Tuesday, Russia’s Defense Ministry issued a statement claiming that its troops had killed over a thousand Ukrainian service members as well as “foreign mercenaries” and destroyed dozens of tanks and armored military vehicles in just one day. A day earlier, officials in Moscow proclaimed that the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson region had “failed miserably.” The Ukrainian government has been talking about a counteroffensive in the south of the country for several months now. In a video address on Sunday, President Zelensky promised to also reclaim the whole of Donbass, parts of the Zaporozhye and Kharkov regions currently held by Russian forces, as well as Crimea."
2022-09-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/562043-shoigu-zaporozhye-weapons-iaea/,No Russian heavy weapons at captured nuclear site – Moscow,"Russian armed forces are not using the captured Zaporozhye nuclear power plant for military purposes, contrary to Kiev's claims, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said on Friday. The ongoing mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will hopefully verify this, he added. Speaking during a working meeting, Russia's top defense official reported that since July 18 there have been 29 attacks against the Ukrainian plant, which is located in the city of Energodar. Some 120 artillery projectiles and 16 kamikaze drones were used, he added. Shoigu dismissed as “blatant lies” Ukrainian claims that Russia was using the facility to attack Ukrainian positions “with long-range artillery systems”. “I state with confidence that we do not have heavy weapons at the territory of the nuclear power stations and in adjacent neighborhoods,” the minister said. “I hope [members of] the IAEA inspection will confirm it with their own eyes.” The delegation of the UN’s nuclear watchdog arrived at the station on Thursday for a long-awaited on-site inspection. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky claimed that Russia was trying to turn the mission “into a fruitless excursion” and accused IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi of failing to secure access to the station for a group of “independent journalists” who’d wanted to travel with the inspectors from Ukraine. “We hope that the mission will make objective conclusions from the situation at the plant nevertheless,” Zelensky said in a video address on Thursday evening. He added that Ukraine’s goal was “demilitarization” of the Zaporozhye site. Moscow previously said it would not accept a full pullout of troops away from Energodar because it didn’t trust Kiev to do the same. On Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry reported thwarting a Ukrainian attempt to capture the power station through an amphibious commando operation. Kiev claims that Russia is the party that has been launching attacks on the plant, with a purported goal of smearing Ukraine’s reputation. It also reported that Russian heavy weapons were present at the facility. During the Friday meeting, Shoigu stressed that Kiev risked a nuclear disaster by attacking the Zaporozhye site. He accused the US and the EU of “hushing up” Ukraine’s role and in doing so “encouraging” Kiev to launch more strikes. “All responsibility for possible emergencies caused by possible future provocations will lay on the Ukrainian authorities,” he warned."
2022-09-02,https://www.rt.com/news/562027-ukraine-vias-ban-shmygal/,Ukraine demands ‘cold shower’ for Russian society,"Russians should not be allowed into the EU as long as their country is fighting Ukraine, Kiev’s Prime Minister Denis Shmygal said on Friday. Earlier this week, the bloc suspended an agreement with Moscow that previously allowed Russians to receive travel visas to the Schengen Area under a simplified procedure, as part of sanctions over the Ukraine conflict. However, Brussels stopped short of introducing a full visa ban, despite calls from some member states, including Finland and Estonia. Shmygal told Germany’s DPA news agency that he believes harsher measures should be implemented against Russian travellers. “Unfortunately, this is not just Putin’s war,” he said, citing polls that reveal large public support in Russia for the military offensive in Ukraine. “It’s impossible to divide the Russians into good and bad ones,” he added. It is “unbearable” for the Kiev government that while the conflict continues, some Russians can “make a nice life in the West, go on vacations, live la dolce vita,” the premier insisted. “There should be a cold shower for the Russian society in the form of a visa ban for tourists and students,” Shmygal added. Similar pleas have come from Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who told the Washington Post last month that he wanted the Russians to be barred from the West for at least a year. They should “live in their own world until they change their philosophy,” he said. Moscow earlier said that the idea of a visa ban was “Russophobic” and resembled the policies pursued by Nazi Germany in mid-20th century. Russia sent troops into Ukraine in late February, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-09-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/562020-ukraine-rescures-donbass-strike/,Ukrainian shelling kills over a dozen rescuers – DPR officials,"At least 13 firefighters, rescuers and medics have been killed, and nine others injured, in a “targeted” Ukrainian missile strike that destroyed their living quarters in the middle of the night, officials from the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) have claimed. The attack targeted facilities in the village of Rubtsy at around 4am local time on Thursday, according DPR emergency ministry chief, Aleksey Kostrubitskiy. “It was a targeted missile strike on our unit. All rockets hit residential buildings,” he said, calling it “a war crime that deserves punishment.” Out of the nine injured first responders, five are in a critical condition, according to the minister. Three buildings, which hosted the staff and equipment of the DPR emergency ministry, were also hit, Kostrubitskiy said. Residents of Rubtsy, which has been under Russian control since March, recalled hearing from four to six explosions in the middle of the night, saying they only learned about the target of the attack in the morning. Videos from the scene have shown what appeared to be one-story buildings, reduced to rubble by the strike. The victims of the attack “were not holding weapons. They worked to keep people safe. But we see the true attitude of Kiev towards the people of Donbass. This is the behavior of terrorists. It’s our duty to stop them and punish the criminals,” DPR leader Denis Pushilin said."
2022-09-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/562013-zaporozhye-iaea-permanent-grossi/,Nuclear inspector reveals next step of Zaporozhye mission,"The International Atomic Energy Agency will maintain a “continued presence” at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi announced on Thursday, after visiting the Russian-controlled facility in Ukraine. Shortly before the UN inspectors arrived, Russia accused Ukraine of shelling the area and sending a commando team to seize the plant. “We are finishing our long-awaited visit to the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant,” Grossi said in a short video posted on Twitter. “I have just completed a first tour of the key areas that we wanted to see in this first approach to the whole facility.” “Of course, there is a lot more to do. My team is staying on, and more importantly – most importantly – we are establishing a continued presence by the IAEA here,” he added, against the backdrop of the Reactor 3 building. Grossi personally led the IAEA mission to inspect the plant, which traveled through Kiev and the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporozhye before arriving in Russian-held Energodar on Thursday. After a delay at a Ukrainian checkpoint, they toured the facility for several hours, before heading back to Ukrainian-controlled territory. According to RT’s Alexey Repin, who was on site, the IAEA team also inspected the damage from Thursday morning’s Ukrainian shelling. They also chose to tour the facility on foot rather than drive, as originally expected. Zaporozhye is Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, and has been under Russian control since early March. Russia has called for an IAEA visit since June. In August, the nuclear site was targeted by regular artillery and drone attacks, which Moscow and Kiev blamed on each other. Ukrainian officials also claimed that the Russian military was using the plant as a military base, stationing heavy weapons there. Moscow denied the accusations, stating that it only had lightly armed guards defending the facility. On Thursday morning, Ukrainian artillery shelled the plant while a team of commandos crossed the reservoir in boats and attempted to storm the facility in order to use the UN team as “human shields,” the Russian Defense Ministry said. Both the initial assault group and the reinforcements that followed were reportedly destroyed by the National Guard and combat helicopters, however. Russia “did what it needed to do to keep our inspectors safe,” a spokesman for the UN secretary-general said on Thursday, after getting asked about Moscow’s report."
2022-09-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/562010-un-thanks-russia-nuclear-safety/,UN thanks Russia for keeping nuclear team safe,"The UN is appreciates Russia’s efforts to safeguard the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team that came to inspect the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, on Thursday. That's according to the secretary-general’s chief spokesman, who was speaking after the Russian Defense Ministry said it was “bewildered” at the lack of reaction to an alleged Ukrainian attempt to seize the facility by force. “We are glad that the Russian Federation did what it needed to do to keep our inspectors safe,” Stephane Dujarric told reporters at a briefing in New York, when asked about Moscow’s comments. “As with any UN mission, it is the responsibility of those who control a certain area to keep the UN staff safe,” he added, also thanking the “security people” and “drivers” for the “tremendous job” of getting the IAEA team safely in and out of the Zaporozhye NPP. The mission, led by IAEA director Rafael Grossi, was delayed at a Ukrainian checkpoint on Thursday morning. It eventually made its way to Russian-controlled Energodar and toured the facility for several hours, before heading back to Ukrainian-controlled territory. Right before their visit, however, Ukrainian artillery targeted the city of Energodar and the Zaporozhye NPP itself, while a group of commandos crossed the Kakhovka Reservoir by boat and attempted to storm the facility, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Both the initial assault group and the reinforcements that followed were wiped out by the National Guard and combat helicopters, the Russian military said. Their goal, according to Moscow, was to seize the Russian-held power plant and use the IAEA staff as “human shields” to maintain control over the facility. Energodar and the Zaporozhye NPP have been under Russian control since early March. In August, the nuclear site was targeted by regular artillery and drone attacks, which Moscow and Kiev blamed on each other. Ukrainian officials also claimed that the Russian military was using the plant as a military base, stationing heavy weapons there. Moscow denied the accusations, saying that it only had lightly armed guards defending the facility. Moscow has called for an IAEA visit to Zaporozhye, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, since June – but Ukraine’s insistence that the mission must travel through Kiev to uphold Ukrainian sovereignty contributed to delaying the mission until this week."
2022-09-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/562006-putin-ukraine-operation-goals/,Putin explains Ukraine operation goals,"Moscow seeks to end the conflict in Ukraine, which began in the aftermath of the 2014 Maidan coup, as well as prevent the emergence of an “anti-Russian enclave” in its territory, Vladimir Putin has said. The Russian president made the remarks on Thursday during an open class held for Russian schoolchildren called the “Important Talk.” “Everyone believes that some kind of aggression on the part of Russia is happening today. No one understands or knows that after the coup d’état in Ukraine in 2014, the people of Donetsk, Lugansk, Crimea – a significant part of them, in any case – did not want to recognize the outcome of this coup,” Putin said. New post-Maidan Ukrainian leaders began a war on their own citizens and “have been waging it for eight years,” he went on. “And our goal, our mission, the mission of our soldiers, of the Donbass militias, is to end this war, to protect people and, of course, Russia itself,” the president explained. An anti-Russian enclave is being created in the territory of present-day Ukraine, which is threatening our country. Putin also touched upon the state of and approach to school education in Ukraine, telling schoolchildren about what Russia’s Minister of Education Sergey Kravtsov witnessed during his recent visit to Donetsk and other territories liberated during the ongoing conflict. The president admitted that the minister’s account shocked him and he “was sitting with his mouth wide open” during Kravtsov’s report. They didn’t even know that Ukraine and Russia were part of a single state – the Soviet Union. They just don’t know it. That’s how they were taught. “[Ukrainian] schoolchildren did not know the Crimea bridge exists, they thought it was a fake,” Putin said, referring to the Kerch road and railway bridge erected between mainland Russia and the peninsula following the 2014 reunification. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-09-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/562001-ukraine-iaea-nuclear-plant/,Ukraine planned to use IAEA team as ‘human shields’ – Russia,"Kiev forces wanted to seize the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant in a daring military raid and use the personnel of the UN nuclear watchdog as “human shields” to maintain control over the facility, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Thursday. The botched raid came shortly before a team of experts with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) – including the organization’s head, Rafael Grossi – arrived at the plant for an inspection. According to the Russian military, multiple Ukrainian “saboteur groups” crossed the Kakhovka Reservoir in speedboats and barges near the plant early in the morning, but were intercepted and destroyed by Russian troops and National Guard forces. “Obviously, if the operation of the Kiev regime to seize the station was a success, the head of the IAEA, [Rafael] Grossi, and the experts of the mission would become a ‘human shield’ for Ukrainian saboteurs to prevent any attempts to destroy them by the Russian armed forces,” the Russian MoD said in a statement. The operation aimed at capturing the nuclear power plant appears to have been “planned in advance by Zelensky’s regime,” the Russian military suggested. Moreover, the delay in Grossi’s visit to the installation, originally planned for August 31, stemmed from the Ukrainians’ need for more time to get ready for that “military provocation,” it alleged. The ultimate goal of the operation was seizing control of the plant, while the presence of the IAEA team would have allowed the “saboteurs” to not only take cover from any potential Russian actions, but also to cement the new “status quo,” the military said. The success of the operation would have likely been reinforced by a “new wave of loud statements from Washington and European capitals, calling upon Russia to establish a ‘demilitarized zone’ around the nuclear plant, with IAEA observers guarded by Ukrainian troops,” it asserted. “In this regard, we fully understand the complete silence of all Western sponsors of the Zelensky regime, which de-facto confirms their tacit participation in the preparation of today’s provocation at the Zaporozhye plant,” the military concluded."

Speaking on Thursday during a virtual class for all Belarusian school and university students, Lukashenko said that “Ukraine is being divided” and that a “conflict is brewing between the president and the military.” According to the Belarusian leader, the Ukrainian army is the only power in the country that can “pound the table and say: let’s talk or else Ukraine will be wiped off the face of the earth.” Lukashenko argued that the country's military, which has first-hand experience of what is actually happening on the frontline, “sees that it’s hopeless.” Meanwhile, he warned that the conflict in the neighboring country could spiral into the “most dreadful confrontation” involving the use of weapons of mass destruction. He also stated that “Russia cannot suffer a defeat there,” adding that Minsk stands firmly by its ally, Moscow. Lukashenko went on to call out those who describe Russia and Belarus as “aggressors.” He argued that Moscow’s military operation was pre-emptive in nature, helping to avert an imminent Ukrainian missile strike on the southern regions of Belarus, including against Russian forces that had not yet been withdrawn from the country after military drills. He also alleged that the Russian military took out Ukraine's missile units half an hour before President Vladimir Putin announced the start of Moscow’s offensive in late February. Lukashenko suggested that the West – and the US in particular – had been behind the preparation for the planned attack against Belarus, claiming those powers would still “do everything to bring Russia to its knees.” “And Russia cannot kneel,” he concluded."

Speaking to journalists during a press call, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov explained that the president will be unable to attend the September 3 funeral for the former Soviet leader due to a tight schedule. He stated that Putin personally paid his last respects to Gorbachev on Thursday by visiting the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow, where the former leader’s body is currently being held. Peskov added that Gorbachev’s funeral will be carried out in part as a state funeral, meaning that there will be a guard of honor and the state will assist in organizing the farewell ceremony on Saturday. Mikhail Gorbachev passed away at the age of 91 on Tuesday. He was the last leader of the Soviet Union and his tenure saw the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War, and the subsequent breakup of the USSR. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990."

The inspectors arrived on Thursday, soon after reports emerged of renewed artillery fire and fierce combat in the vicinity of the plant. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other off firing shells and missiles dangerously close to reactors and other crucial infrastructure. “Rafael Grossi and the staff of the Zaporozhye plant are currently inspecting the location where the shells from Ukrainian artillery fell today,” RT’s Alexey Repin reports. “It wasn’t part of the initial program, but the plans are changing in real time. For example, it was expected that the IAEA team would be traveling across the plant by cars, but, as we are seeing, they prefer to walk,” he says. Europe’s biggest nuclear plant was seized by Russian troops shortly after Moscow launched a military operation in the neighboring country in late February. Several hours before the IAEA team’s arrival, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that its forces had repelled a Ukrainian attempt to recapture the facility. International inspectors are tasked with examining the general condition of the plant and assessing the damage to its facilities."

The top diplomat made the remarks on Thursday as he met students and staff at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO). “If [NATO] bases are created on the territory of Finland and Sweden, or rather, if they decide to create these bases for them – I am convinced that the Americans will have the key word ... Depending on how all of this materializes, of course, we will make a decision to strengthen our capabilities in Russia’s northwest,” Lavrov stated, without providing any further details. In any case, launching NATO bases in the territory of the two Nordic nations would “radically” expand the “line of contact” between Russia and the alliance, the minister added. Finland and Sweden scrambled to join the US-led bloc earlier this year, citing the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. While formally keeping a neutral status for decades, the two Nordic nations have been closely cooperating with the military alliance for a long time now. The accession process ran into a deadlock after a major NATO country, Turkey, objected to the plans to accept Sweden and Finland. Ankara accused the two countries of functioning as “guesthouses for terrorist organizations” and hosting members of outlawed Kurdish groups it deems to be “terrorists.” The deadlock was ultimately resolved in June during the NATO summit in Madrid after a series of intense negotiations. Turkey agreed to formally back the accession of Stockholm and Helsinki to the military bloc on the condition that they crack down on groups Ankara deems to be “terrorists” and address other bilateral issues, such as an arms embargo. Deliberations on how precisely to implement the agreement, however, are still ongoing."

The Russian news agency RIA Novosti published a video of the convoy with UN experts arriving at Europe’s largest nuclear facility on Thursday. The visit comes hours after the Russian Defense Ministry accused Kiev of dispatching commandos in an attempt to seize the plant. According to Russian officials, the attack has been repelled. Russian troops took control of the facility shortly after Moscow launched its military operation in the neighboring country. As the plant continued to operate with local staff, Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of firing shells and missiles dangerously close to its reactors.

Of the three, two have been injured and are in serious condition, the official said in an interview with Russian television. Doctors are fighting to save them, he added. An estimated 12 Ukrainian troops are still fighting against Russian forces, he claimed. The Russian Defense Ministry previously claimed that early in the morning, Kiev launched an operation apparently aimed at taking the nuclear site ahead of an inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Some of the Ukrainian troops failed to reach the southern bank of the Dnepr when their vessels were hit and sank, the ministry stated. Up to 60 commandos used speedboats to make a landing, before Russian forces engaged them, the report said. The power plant and the surrounding city of Energodar have been under Russian control since March. Throughout August, it came under regular fire, which Kiev and Moscow blamed on each other. Ukrainian officials also accused Russia of stationing heavy weapons at the nuclear facility. The IAEA’s fact-finding mission is expected to arrive in Energodar later in the day, though there were reports that their progress was interrupted by military activity. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of attempting to derail the inspection."

That's according to the country’s former president, Viktor Yushchenko. He told newspaper Ukrainska Pravda that t the tone changed significantly after Kiev accused Russian troops of committing war crimes in Bucha and other towns outside of Kiev in the spring. “I will not name any names, but presidents and prime ministers were arriving from Europe in groups with one message for President Zelensky: ‘Sit at the negotiating table, and we will figure something out later,” Yuschenko insisted. “But after seeing Bucha, Gostomel, they began to understand that the Ukrainian people will not grant the authorities permission … to sit down for negotiations and say, ‘Let’s pay for the peace with some part of the national sovereign territory.’ No one would even have such an idea!” Russia launched its military operation in the neighboring country in late February, taking large chunks of lands in southern Ukraine under its control and gradually pushing Ukrainian troops out of Donbass. Moscow denies that its soldiers have committed war crimes and maintains that its troops only strike military targets. Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine effectively broke down in late March, with both sides blaming each other for the failure of the negotiations. Ukrainian and Western officials have since argued that talks with Moscow would only make sense if Kiev gains the upper hand on the battlefield and can negotiate from a position of strength. “The Russian authorities will surely offer negotiations to us if they see the strength of the world that supports Ukraine,” Zelensky said on Monday."

Several Russian media outlets reported on Thursday morning that the top executive fell from the window of the Moscow Central Clinical Hospital, a top-notch medical facility that serves senior Russian officials and other elite clients. The hospital later confirmed the news, saying that law enforcement was on the scene to investigate the incident. Lukoil also confirmed Maganov’s death, stating that it came “after a lengthy serious illness.” Maganov was reportedly undergoing treatment at the hospital. Initial reports said he died after falling from the sixth floor of the building. There is speculation that the 67-year-old may have taken his own life after receiving bad news about his condition. Maganov spent his entire career in the oil business. He joined Lukoil in 1993, focusing on issues connected with the exploration of new reserves and extraction operations. His brother, Nail Maganov, is also a prominent executive, serving as the director general and board chair of Tatneft."
2022-09-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/561943-ukrainian-troops-seize-zaporozhye-nuclear-plant/,Ukraine launches raid near Zaporozhye nuclear plant – Russia,"Ukraine deployed troops from several directions in an apparent attempt to capture the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant on Thursday morning, the Russian Defense Ministry has announced. In one incident, two separate “sabotage groups” with a total strength of up to 60 troops used seven speedboats to cross the Kakhovka Reservoir and land about three kilometers from the nuclear facility to the northeast early in the morning, according to the claim. The Ukrainian commandos were presumably hoping to capture the station from the Russian troops who are guarding it, but were blocked, the ministry indicted. The Russian military deployed attack helicopters to support the plant’s guards, it added. A separate engagement took place about an hour later to the west of Energodar, which hosts the power plant, Moscow explained. Russian forces attacked and sank two watercraft that were carrying Ukrainian amphibious tactical teams, the statement said. The ministry also claimed that about two hours after the landing of the commando units, Ukrainian artillery began shelling a specific location near Energodar. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who are on their way to visit the facility, are scheduled to pass by the area, according to the report. “The provocation of the Kiev regime is aimed at derailing the arrival of the IAEA mission to the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant,” the ministry said. The plant and the city have been under Russian control since March. In August, the nuclear site was targeted by regular artillery and drone attacks, which Moscow and Kiev blamed on each other. Ukrainian officials also claimed that the Russian military was using the plant as a military base, stationing heavy weapons there. Moscow denied the accusations, stating that it only had lightly armed guards defending the facility. The IAEA mission was dispatched this week after several delays. Moscow and Kiev both welcomed the visit and pledged to facilitate it, while each accused the other side of attempting to prevent inspectors from reaching the target. The UN’s nuclear watchdog is expected to assess the situation on the ground, inspect the safety of the power plant, and verify that non-proliferation measures remain in place. The Zaporozhye facility is the largest of its kind in Europe and stores dozens of tons of enriched uranium and plutonium in its reactor cores and storage facilities, according to IAEA figures. Energoatom, the Ukrainian nuclear operator, claimed on Thursday that Russia launched mortar strikes at the plant, causing the shutdown of one of its two currently operating reactors. Russian-allied local authorities also reported the shutdown, citing unconfirmed reports, but said it was Ukraine that attacked the facility. The plant is staffed by Ukrainian civilian workers despite being under Russian control."

Videos and photos posted on social media show clouds of smoke rising from the buildings. The news comes as a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is due to visit the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant located nearby. Europe’s biggest nuclear plant was seized by Russian forces shortly after Moscow launched its military operation in the neighboring country in late February. The facility, which continues to operate with local staff, has repeatedly come under fire, with Moscow and Kiev blaming each other for the attacks. Aleksandr Volga, the Russian-appointed head of Energodar, said that a Ukrainian unit has been deployed near the city and that Russian military aircraft are targeting its fighters. The Russian Defense Ministry said that up to 60 Ukrainian commandos crossed the large Kakhovka water reservoir on boats and made an attempt to capture the plant. Vladimir Rogov, a pro-Russian regional official, cited reports that one of the plant’s power units has been shut down, and blamed Kiev for the shelling. Dmitry Orlov, the top Ukrainian official responsible for Energodar, accused Russia of shelling the city and endangering the plant. The IAEA team is expected to reach the plant on Thursday. “It’s a mission that seeks to prevent a nuclear accident,” IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told reporters on Wednesday after arriving in the city of Zaporozhye. Grossi said the mission will continue despite the reports of the escalation on the ground. “There has been an increased military activity in the area. Having come so far, we are not stopping,” Reuters quoted him as saying."
2022-08-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/561929-zelensky-italy-villa-russians/,Zelensky rents his Italian villa to Russians – media,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has rented his luxury villa in Tuscany to Russians for the month of August, Italian newspaper Il Tirreno reported on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Zelensky has called on EU leaders to deny visas to Russian tourists. A Russian couple with a London address have rented the villa for the month of August, paying the princely sum of €50,000 ($50,237), the newspaper reported. The villa, located in the seaside town of Forte dei Marmi, was bought by Zelensky for four million euros while the Ukrainian leader was still an actor, the report added. Photos posted on social media by the couple confirmed that they were staying in Zelensky’s property, Il Tirreno stated. Corriere Della Serra, another Italian newspaper, contacted the realtor managing the property, who said that “The tenants weren’t Russian, but I can’t say more because privacy prevents me.” However, the paper said that the tenants are likely of Russian origin, “but have long since had their residence and perhaps English citizenship.” Ever since Russian forces entered Ukraine in February, Zelensky has urged the EU to deny visas to Russian visitors. The Russian people, he told the Washington Post earlier this month, “should live in their own world until they change their philosophy.” Back in March, Zelensky specifically called on the Italian government to “block all [Russian] real estate, accounts and yachts, from the Scheherazade to the smallest ones,"" referring to a 140-meter (460 ft) superyacht allegedly belonging to a wealthy Russian individual that was moored at the Italian port of Marina di Carrara. All flights between the EU and Russia have been halted since the earliest days of Moscow’s military operation, and the bloc suspended a bilateral visa facilitation agreement with Russia on Wednesday. The suspension reduces the number of new EU visas available for Russians without eliminating travel entirely. In addition to Zelensky’s Tuscan villa, the Ukrainian president and his inner circle reportedly hold an extensive portfolio of offshore properties and assets, including several expensive residences in London."
2022-08-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/561920-eu-moscow-visa-row/,Russia promises retaliation over EU visa move,"Moscow will retaliate for the EU’s decision to “fully” suspend an agreement that allowed Russian citizens to apply for EU visas under a simplified procedure, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said on Tuesday. “Violation, circumvention or withdrawal of the EU from the visa facilitation agreement with Russia will not remain without consequences,” the diplomat told RIA Novosti. Russia reserves its right to take any necessary retaliatory steps, should they “be symmetric, asymmetric or some other that the EU would not expect,” Grushko added, suggesting that the visa decision will ultimately do the bloc more harm than good. If Brussels decided to shoot themselves in the foot again, that’s their own choice. Earlier in the day, the EU’s foreign ministers agreed to “fully” suspend the visa facilitation agreement with Russia. Announcing the decision, EU top diplomat Josep Borrell said the move would “significantly reduce the number of new visas issued by the EU Member States” to Russian nationals. “Until now, it was partially suspended for special collectives, groups of people – officials, entrepreneurs – and now it is fully suspended,” Borrell said, without providing any timeframe for the move to actually get implemented. At the same time, the bloc will continue to issue visas for “specific groups” of Russians, such as those who seem to oppose the current political leadership of the country. “There is a common understanding that this will allow for visas to be granted on an individual basis [after] a thorough assessment of each individual case, and especially for specific groups of people,” Borrell explained, insisting that the EU did not want to “cut” itself off “from the Russian civil society” and “from those Russians who are against the war in Ukraine.”"
2022-08-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/561918-iaea-zaporozhye-permanent-presence/,UN wants ‘permanent presence’ at Russia-held nuclear site,"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plans on establishing a “permanent presence” at the Russian-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear plant. Moscow has repeatedly accused Kiev of shelling the nuclear facility. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi made his remarks on Wednesday at a press briefing in Kiev, before inspectors traveled to Zaporozhye. The Zaporozhye facility is Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, and was seized by Russian troops several days after Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine in February. As it continued to operate with local staff under Russian control, the facility has come under artillery and drone attacks, with Russia blaming Kiev for the strikes. Ukraine has alternated between blaming Russia for the shelling, and accusing the Russian military of using the plant as cover for its soldiers. While the US has accused Russia of firing from the plant, a senior military official admitted on Monday that “there’s probably a likelihood” that Ukrainian forces have bombarded the nuclear facility. Moscow insists that it does not keep heavy weapons, including artillery, stationed at the plant. Grossi’s remarks were welcomed by Russia’s permanent representative to international organizations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov. In a series of posts to Twitter, Ulyanov said that Moscow has supported the IAEA’s mission “from the very beginning,” and wished the inspectors “productive work on the site.” Shortly before the IAEA delegation arrived at the plant, an official in the Russian-allied administration of Zaporozhye Region, Vladimir Rogov, said that a group of would-be saboteurs were arrested in the nearby city of Energodar. The suspected Ukrainian plotters were found with rifles, Western-made missile launchers, drones, and aerial photos of the nuclear plant, with Rogov claiming that they were planning a “series of terrorist attacks.”"
2022-08-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/561894-monkey-urals-city-rampage/,Monkey rampages through Russian city (VIDEOS),"A stray monkey attacked multiple people, including children, in the Russian city of Magnitogorsk on Wednesday. Upon being noticed by local residents, the medium-sized animal was minding its own business and behaving calmly, footage circulating online suggests. However, after being harassed by several people and dogs, the monkey ultimately became agitated. A local woman confronted the monkey in an attempt to hand it over to police. The woman told local media she followed it for a while but ended up being bitten and calling the cops. “We were allowed to lead it to some shop, they gave us a tomato, I tried to lure it, and it attacked. I called the police again, they said they were on their way. Then the monkey bit a 10-year-old boy and a girl. The parents of the girl tried to catch the monkey, it rushed at the man, he kicked it in the face,” the woman told local media. Following the altercation, the monkey reportedly barged into a local dentistry, escaping the clinic through a window. So far, all efforts to catch the monkey have failed, with local police urging locals to alert them of the animal’s whereabouts but to avoid further attempts to subdue it."
2022-08-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/561897-zaporozhye-nuclear-plant-sabateurs/,Ukrainian saboteurs plotted nuclear plant attack – officials,"Saboteurs sought to attack the Russian-controlled Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant during a visit by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the local authorities have claimed. The group was reportedly taken into custody. The suspected Ukrainian plotters had comprehensive information about the nuclear site and its vulnerabilities, a council member of the Russian-allied administration of Zaporozhye Region, Vladimir Rogov, told journalists on Wednesday. Footage purportedly showing the moment the group of would-be attackers was apprehended has circulated on social media. It features heavily armed men in uniforms busting into a dark apartment and securing at least three people in civilian clothing. The curtains in the room were drawn at the moment of the breach. There appeared to be three assault rifles placed next to the walls. The video also included what is presumed to be items seized during the arrest. They included what appeared to be three shoulder-fired rocket launchers, several hand grenades, a small commercial reconnaissance drone, a solar panel charger, and printouts of the city map and aerial photos of the nuclear plant. Rogov did not disclose when the arrests took place, but claimed that the group planned a “series of terrorist attacks” in the city, possibly timed to coincide with the expected visit of IAEA inspectors. The fact-finding mission dispatched by the UN’s nuclear watchdog is expected to arrive in Energodar later this week, possibly as soon as Wednesday. The nuclear site has been subjected to regular attacks by artillery and drones for weeks. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of launching the strikes. Kiev also claimed that Russian forces stationed heavy weaponry at the nuclear facility, which Moscow has denied. The IAEA fact finding mission, led by the organization’s head, Rafael Grossi, left the Ukrainian capital, Kiev on Wednesday morning. The experts are expected to spend up to several days in Energodar before heading back and reporting their findings."
2022-08-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/561883-vostok-international-military-exercise/,Major multinational military drills kick off in Russia,"International military drills have been launched in Russia’s Far East, with countries including China and India taking part. The US has voiced concern over Moscow’s ability to get other nations to participate in the exercises. The opening ceremony of the Vostok 2020 strategic exercises took place at a military range in Russia’s Primorsky Region on Wednesday, the Defense Ministry reported. Russia holds drills of this type annually, with the country’s military districts rotating each year as hosts. This year, the Eastern Military District welcomed 13 foreign nations, which accepted Russia’s invitation to send troops or military observers. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, who represented the host nation at the ceremony, said the wide participation and scale of the exercise made it exceptional and demonstrated “the increased role and importance of joint training of our armed forces.” Leaders of other delegations stressed in their speeches that the event was strictly defensive in nature. Footage from the scene shows soldiers from participating nations marching as a military band plays. The list of foreign guests includes Azerbaijan, Algeria, Armenia, Belarus, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Syria, and Tajikistan. Nine of them sent troops to participate in the maneuvers portion of the exercises. Vostok 2022 includes war games for staff officers and field exercises for troops, as well as naval and aerial training. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, over 50,000 soldiers and officers and more than 5,000 pieces of heavy military equipment, including some 140 aircraft and 60 navy ships, will be taking part in the week-long exercise, which starts on Thursday. The US has expressed concern over the event. During a daily briefing on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Washington has reservations about “any country exercising with Russia while Russia wages an unprovoked, brutal war against Ukraine.” When pressed, she declined to say whether the US would retaliate against participants, particularly India, for sending its troops to Russia."
2022-08-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/561889-eu-visas-ban-russians/,EU fails to agree on visa ban for Russians – Hungary,"There was “no consensus” among EU member states on the proposed full ban for Russian tourists, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Wednesday, as quoted by a journalist from news agency MTI. Szijjarto’s statement was made as EU foreign ministers have gathered for an informal meeting in Prague to discuss a further response to the Ukraine conflict. Several EU member states have already stopped issuing visas to Russian citizens, while several Central and Eastern European countries have lobbied for a bloc-wide ban, arguing that it is unfair to allow Russian tourists to visit the EU as usual while the conflict in Ukraine continues. Some, including Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, have said that tourists from Russia pose a security risk, and suggested that barring them from entering the EU would put additional pressure on the Kremlin. Others, such as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, have opposed a full visa ban, insisting that the bloc should not close its doors to ordinary Russians, especially if they disagree with the Kremlin’s policies regarding Ukraine."
2022-08-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/561876-sbu-nabu-humanitarian-aid/,Ukrainian officials accused of stealing trainloads of aid,"Ukrainian officials in the eastern Zaporozhye Region are being investigated for allegedly stealing massive amounts of humanitarian aid sent to them. They are accused of looting hundreds of freight cars’ worth of goods. Raids at offices and addresses associated with the suspected embezzlers were reported on Tuesday. Agents of the SBU, Ukraine’s successor to the KGB, and the anti-corruption agency NABU conducted the operations, according to a statement by the agencies. The region is mostly controlled by Russian forces, but its capital Zaporozhye and some of the surrounding areas are under Kiev’s control. The raids targeted the Kiev-appointed administration and members of the city council, according to the SBU and NABU. The agencies also reported confiscating what they believe to be narcotics and illegal firearms while searching the premises. While the official statement offered few details, a more comprehensive account of the ongoing probe came from Ukrainian public figure Evgeny Shevchenko, who is widely described by the local media as an unpaid agent for the NABU. The agency had previously confirmed working with him. According to his post on Facebook, the suspected grifters made off with “almost all humanitarian aid” sent to the region, selling the goods through local retail chains. The total volume of what was stolen amounts to 22 sea transport containers, 389 freight train cars and 220 trucks, Shevchenko claimed. The activist named several senior officials in Zaporozhye Region as suspects and shamed them for posing as Ukrainian patriots while profiting at the expense of the country. Shevchenko is a controversial figure in Ukraine. He emerged from the radical wing of the so-called Maidan protests of 2013-2014 and made a name for himself as an associate of militia commander and former MP Konstantin Grishin, who prefers to be called by his nom de guerre Semyon Semenchenko. Last year, Shevchenko and Semenchenko were arrested on allegations of involvement with an illegal militia. The arrests came after Shevchenko had accused the office of President Vladimir Zelensky of derailing an intelligence operation aimed at luring a group of Russian security contractors to Ukraine and detaining them. Shevchenko believes that his arrest and that of Semenchenko were an act of revenge by Zelensky’s chief-of-staff, Andrey Ermak. In his post about the raids in Zaporozhye Region, he linked the suspects with the president and the head of his office, pointing out that the officials targeted had been appointed by Kiev."

The report says the alternative form of administration could provide enhanced protection for the lungs. On Wednesday, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology and the Russian Direct Investment Fund announced the publication of an article on the nasal version of the Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine in the international peer reviewed medical journal Emerging Microbes & Infections. The piece details the tests conducted by Russian researchers on mice and Goeldi’s marmosets to determine its efficacy. According to the article, not only did the nasal form elicit a powerful and lasting immune response, comparable to that seen in the intramuscularly administered vaccine, but also provided especially strong protection to the nasopharynx and the lungs. This effect, if replicated in humans, could come in particularly handy in the fight against new Covid-19 strains, which typically enter the body via the nose and affect the lungs, the researchers said. The piece also stated that the nasal form of Sputnik V is as effective in minimizing fatality rates in patients as its conventional, intramuscular version."
2022-08-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/561877-gorbachev-profound-impact-history-putin/,Gorbachev made ‘profound impact’ on world history – Putin,"Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union and architect of perestroika and glasnost, governed the erstwhile state through “dramatic” and challenging times, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. Gorbachev passed away at the age of 91 on Tuesday. “Mikhail Gorbachev was a politician and statesman who made a profound impact on the course of world history,” Putin wrote in a condolence letter to Gorbachev’s family. He led our country through a period of difficult, dramatic changes, and large-scale external, economic and societal challenges. He understood deeply that the reforms were necessary and strived to offer solutions to urgent problems. After becoming the leader of the Soviet Union in 1985, Gorbachev launched sweeping reforms aimed at the liberalization of the economy and public life. His tenure saw the fall of the Berlin Wall and end of the Cold War. He resigned at the end of 1991 with the breakup of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990."
2022-08-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/561868-zakharova-eu-unity-dissent/,Russia points to cause of Western divisions,"Russia does not pursue a foreign policy aimed at dividing the West, or the EU in particular, despite claims to the contrary, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova explained. However, the bloc could benefit from being more tolerant of dissenting voices, considering how much it has hurt itself with its ‘united’ approach to Russia, she outlined in a radio interview on Wednesday. Zakharova compared the EU to the group of blind men in the painting ‘The Blind Leading the Blind’ by Dutch Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder. “They are united. No one in this group, who are being led towards a ditch, voices any doubt, objects, asks questions or protests,” she said. Brussels’ approach towards Russia is similar, the spokeswoman suggested, noting the “strange suicidal initiatives that are attributed to the EU, but are actually imposed or planted” by an outside force. She added that when it comes to Russia, the bloc does not tolerate dissenting voices – which is surprising, given that the EU claims to cherish democracy, a system in which opinions that differ from the dominant line of thinking are supposed to be appreciated. While many Western politicians claim that Russia wants to divide the bloc with its policies, this is not the case, Zakharova said. “If anything, our goal is to return common sense into international relations.” Her remarks came during a discussion in the radio interview on the EU’s proposed ban on visas for Russians. The plan is promoted by Ukraine and some Eastern European member states, but Western European nations such as Germany and France believe less radical restrictions should be adopted. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki suggested this week that an implosion within the EU could occur unless all member states follow the hardline Russia policy that Warsaw has adopted."
2022-08-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/561858-iaea-ukraine-nuclear-mission-zaporozhye/,UN inspectors head to Zaporozhye NPP,"A delegation of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has left the Ukrainian capital for the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant on Wednesday in order to assess the state of the facility amid fighting between Russia and Kiev’s forces. Before heading off, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told reporters that the inspectors intend to spend “a few days” at the plant and will report back afterwards. On Tuesday, however, the pro-Russian local authorities said that the IAEA mission in Energodar – the city where the NPP is located, and which is in the part of Zaporozhye Region controlled by Moscow’s forces – is expected to last one day. “The program of the visit is designed to last one day. They will have to review the plant’s operations in one day… So far it has been stated that [the purpose of the mission] is ‘to familiarize with the plant operations’. We see that as a vague concept,” Evgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Russian military-civilian administration, told Interfax news agency. He went on to say that the delegation is supposed to enter the territory controlled by Russian forces via Vasilyevka, a town east of the NPP and not far from the frontline. According to Balitsky, the experts could inspect two working reactors, the spent fuel storage area, and the cooling system. He also said the authorities intend to show the experts the damage caused by Ukrainian artillery attacks. “We are ready to show where the shells hit. We’re ready to show shell fragments; the Soviet-made [shells] fired by [MLRS] Grad and Uragan differ very much from those from the M777 howitzer. [We’re ready] to show the drones, who produced them, where and how they fell,” he added. Earlier, Grossi said the goal of the mission is to find out what is happening at the plant, assess its integrity, speak to both Russian and Ukrainian staff, and establish a permanent presence on the ground. Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of attacking the plant, which has been under Russian control since March, while warning that the shelling could trigger a disaster that would eclipse the Chernobyl incident. Recently, the local authorities also claimed that Ukraine tried to torpedo the IAEA mission to the plant by shelling the city of Energodar. Kiev insists, however, that it is Russia’s forces who are shelling the nuclear power plant while stationing military hardware there."
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/561848-putin-gorbachev-death-reaction/,Putin expresses condolences on death of Gorbachev,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed his “deepest condolences” on the death of Mikhail Gorbachev to his family and friends, the Kremlin said shortly after midnight on Wednesday. The president will “send a telegram” to Gorbachev’s relatives in the morning, his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told RIA Novosti. The Soviet Union’s first and only president died in Moscow at the age of 91, “after a serious and prolonged illness.” He was hospitalized at the very beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and had been under medical supervision ever since. Born in 1931, Gorbachev became the general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1985. He sought to reform the USSR through a series of economic (perestroika) and governance (glasnost) policy changes, and became its first elected president in 1990. Though the attempted coup against him in August 1991 failed, Gorbachev’s authority did not survive for long. By December that year, the leaders of the Soviet republics of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus had signed the Belovezh Accords, effectively breaking up the Soviet Union against the desires of the majority of its citizens."
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/558272-gorbachev-dies-soviet-leader/,Mikhail Gorbachev dies at 91,"Mikhail Gorbachev, the first and only president of the Soviet Union, has died at the age of 91, in Moscow. His death was reported on Tuesday night by the Central Clinical Hospital, which said in a statement that “Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev died this evening after a serious and prolonged illness.” According to the news agency TASS, Gorbachev was hospitalized at the very beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, at the request of his doctors, and had been under medical supervision ever since. Gorbachev will be buried in Moscow’s Novodevichy Cemetery next to his wife, Raisa, who died in 1999, TASS revealed, citing a source familiar with the family’s wishes. A divisive figure, supporters credit him with having played a key part in bringing about an end to the Cold War, while opponents accuse him of aiding in the fall of the Soviet Union and a major loss to Moscow’s prestige and global influence. Born in 1931 into a peasant family in southern Russia, in his teens Gorbachev operated combine harvesters on collective farms. His party career started early in his student years, when he studied law at Lomonosov Moscow State University. His ascent through the ranks was relatively rapid, and in 1985 he became the general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, making him the highest ranking official in the USSR. During his time in office, Gorbachev aimed to re-energize the stalled Soviet economy, which was riddled with inefficiency, overblown defense spending and creeping corruption. He called for urgent reorganization and modernization, but soon expanded his reform to the political and social structure of the whole nation. The policy of ‘perestroika’ was announced in 1986 as an attempt to reorganize the economy. More of a political movement, the “restructuring” aimed to give more independence to ministries and large state-owned enterprises. It also introduced some free market-style reforms. In 1988, Gorbachev permitted establishing private enterprises in the country for the first time since Vladimir Lenin’s “New Economic Policy” of the 1920s. Another policy proclaimed was ‘glasnost'. Gorbachev aimed to bring transparency into society, ease the Communist Party’s control over the media and release political prisoners. This was a radical change, since control over public speech had previously been an essential part of the Soviet regime. Gorbachev also proposed a constitutional change to move to a presidential system and created a new political body called the Congress of People’s Deputies. The 2,250 members were elected in the Soviet Union’s first semi-competitive parliamentary election. On March 15, 1990, following a vote in the Congress of People’s Deputies, Mikhail Gorbachev became president of the USSR. Gorbachev’s foreign policy, also known as the “new thinking,” marked a period of significant improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries, replacing the era of Cold War hostilities. In 1986, he announced plans to withdraw Soviet troops from Afghanistan, but it took three more years to complete the pullout. The Soviet-Afghan war was a major point of criticism for the West. It also cost the Soviet Union at least 15,000 casualties, put additional strains on an already creaking bureaucratic planned economy and filled the country with veterans suffering from combat stress disorders. The reengagement with the West paved the way for several key disarmament treaties to be signed. Moscow and Washington agreed to dismantle their intermediate-range conventional and nuclear missiles – the very precise weapons that could tempt the military into using nuclear weapons on a limited scale, but still trigger global mutual annihilation. Under Gorbachev, Moscow unilaterally stopped all nuclear tests. Moscow’s relations with the Eastern Bloc countries also underwent a radical change. Earlier, Soviet troops always served as the final argument, should one of the countries of the Cold War-era Warsaw Pact try to shift its allegiance. But Gorbachev’s liberalization included the right of self-determination for those nations. This was jokingly called the “Sinatra doctrine” after the singer Frank Sinatra, alluding to his song, 'My Way', as countries were allowed to determine their own internal policies. A string of revolutions in 1989 ousted European Communist regimes, and in 1990 West and East Germany reunified as one country. For his efforts in easing international tensions, Gorbachev was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990. In a statement accompanying the award, the Nobel Committee said that the president of the Soviet Union had played a “leading role” in the international peace process. Gorbachev is also well-known for having played a key role in the fall of the Berlin Wall, the symbol of a split Europe and divided world in the times of the Cold War. After the fall of the Nazi regime as a result of World War II, Germany had become two separate countries by 1949. The Federal Republic of Germany (or West Germany) was run by the Western Allies, while the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was controlled by the Soviet Union. Berlin was located inside East Germany, but it was shared by both West and East Germany, with the Berlin Wall dividing the territories of the two states. Built in 1961, the wall separated families and loved ones for 28 years. It was eventually toppled on the night of November 9, 1989. During a visit to West Germany earlier in 1989, the Soviet leader declared that every nation can “freely choose its own political and social system” and that Moscow would “respect for the right of all peoples to self-determination.” The fall of the Berlin Wall marked the dawn of a new age – the end of the Cold War and the bipolar world – and it paved the way for Germany’s reunification in 1990. The partial democratization of Soviet society under Gorbachev led to a surge in nationalist and anti-Russian sentiment in most of the 15 Soviet republics. But this drive for independence was not always peaceful. On several occasions, Moscow ordered the use of force against violent riots, as the nationalist course in certain regions was seen as capable of spawning much greater violence in the future if the government failed to act. However, the use of force only caused bigger protests. The frozen conflicts in ethnic enclaves around the country, such as Nagorno-Karabakh and Trans-Dniester, as well as the 2008 war in South Ossetia, are the legacies of those events. Amid growing tensions within the USSR, Gorbachev attempted to draft a new union treaty. However, a group of hardline Soviet top officials, who called themselves the State Committee on the State of Emergency, attempted to stage a coup and to remove Gorbachev from power to prevent the signing of the new union treaty. The coup failed, but it prompted Gorbachev to dissolve the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and to resign as the party’s General Secretary, as well as to dissolve all party departments within the governmental structures, thus effectively ending Communist rule in the USSR and eliminating its primary unifying political force. The Soviet Union collapsed with dramatic speed during the latter part of 1991, as one Soviet republic after another declared independence. In December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus met near the Belorussian town of Brest and signed the Belavezha Accords, which formally declared the Soviet Union effectively dissolved and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place. Gorbachev initially denounced the move as illegal, but later in the same month acknowledged it and announced his resignation as president. Gorbachev’s policies made him popular in the West, but in his own country he remains a controversial figure to this day. He is praised by many for his disarmament initiatives, the unification of Germany, instigating the fall of the Iron Curtain and ending the Cold War, as well as for granting Eastern European countries the right to self-determination. However, the former Soviet leader also faced significant criticism, mostly at home, from those who believe that his policies weakened the Soviet Union and its successor, Russia, and were the major cause of the collapse of the USSR. Some critics particularly say that, by moving forward with his disarmament initiatives, including the unilateral ones, he undermined the military and industrial might of the Soviet Union, while others accuse him of failing to prevent NATO from expanding further eastwards and eventually reaching Russia’s borders. After his resignation, Gorbachev created the International Non-Governmental Foundation for Socio-Economic and Political Studies (The Gorbachev Foundation), which is both a research center and discussion platform, as well as an NGO overseeing humanitarian charity projects. In 1993, at the initiative of the representatives of 108 countries, Gorbachev established Green Cross International, a non-governmental environmental organization, which now has offices in 23 countries around the world. In 1999, he also became one of the initiators of the Nobel Peace Laureates Summit, which meets every year to discuss global threats, such as violence and wars, poverty, crisis situations in the world’s economy, and the environment, according to the Gorbachev Foundation website. Between 2001 and 2009, Gorbachev also co-chaired the St. Petersburg Dialogue, an annual Russian-German forum held alternately in both countries and attended by politicians, entrepreneurs, and young people. The former Soviet leader had also visited around 50 countries since 1992 and been given more than 300 awards, diplomas, certificates of honor, and honorable distinctions, according to the Gorbachev Foundation. Gorbachev also wrote dozens of books, which have been published in 10 languages. “I was doing my best in bringing together morality and responsibility to people. It’s a matter of principle for me. It was high time to put an end to the rulers’ wild cravings and to their highhandedness. There were a few things I have not succeeded in, but I don’t think I was wrong in my approach,” he wrote in his political article of faith, published by the Gorbachev Foundation."
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/pop-culture/561825-russian-airline-allows-tattoos/,Top Russian airline introduces major changes for staff,"S7 airlines is now one of the first major Russian air carriers to update its rules for flight crews, significantly reducing limitations on how workers can look and dress. In a post published on the airline’s Telegram channel on Tuesday, it announced that S7 employees can now sport visible tattoos, have beards, and dye their hair vibrant colors. “Standard airline rules do not always justifiably regulate the appearance of flight attendants, pilots and employees at the airport. It’s time to update them!” the airline said, adding that it supports their workers’ right to express themselves and believes that tattoos and other superficial features have no impact on an employee’s professional traits. “If an individual style does not prevent a person from doing his job 100% and ensuring safety on board, we see no reason to keep these outdated traditions in place,” S7 wrote, going on to list certain things that will now be permitted on board. They include tattoos on visible parts of the body – as long as they are not offensive – bright colored hair dye, ballet flats or loafers instead of heels for female flight attendants, and beards for all male employees, as opposed to just pilots or airport workers, as was the case before. The airline notes that some restrictions – such as long nails or piercings on open parts of the body – will remain in place due to safety concerns. S7’s decision comes amid an industry-wide shift in which a number of airlines around the world have started relaxing appearance guidelines for crew members. Earlier this year, Virgin Atlantic became one of the first British airlines to allow flight attendants to display tattoos, which previously had to be covered up. Latvia’s AirBaltic airline also joined in on the trend earlier this month, permitting most tattoos, hairstyles, and piercings for uniformed staff. The first major international airline to allow tattoos for staff was Air New Zealand, which in 2019 announced that its employees would be permitted to sport traditional 'ta moko' Maori, as well as non-offensive tattoos on visible parts of the body while wearing their uniform or normal business attire."
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/561816-russia-ukraine-counter-offensive-losses/,Russia releases new estimate of Ukrainian counter-offensive losses,"Russian forces have taken out hundreds of Ukrainian troops and dozens of tanks and armored military vehicles after repelling an ill-fated offensive in the south of the country, the Defense Ministry claimed on Tuesday. A statement added that officials believe the failerd operation was mounted at the personal order of President Vladimir Zelensky. “The effective actions by the Russian forces destroyed 48 tanks, 46 infantry fighting vehicles, 37 other armored combat vehicles, eight pickups with heavy machine guns and more than 1,200 Ukrainian servicemen in one day,” they outlined. The Ministry added that Kiev sustained these losses during a botched offensive whose directions led to Nikolaev, Krivoy Rog, and other cities in southern Ukraine. The ministry went on to say that Moscow’s forces routed the units of the 128th Ukrainian Mountain Assault Brigade, which had been redeployed from western Ukraine to take part in the operation. “Five service members from this brigade laid down their arms and gave in,” the ministry added. Russian forces also wiped out “more than 200 militants, including about 40 foreign mercenaries” as well as more than 20 armor units, according to the military. The Russian Defense Ministry’s statement comes after its claim on Monday that the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson had “failed miserably.” At the time, the ministry put Kiev’s losses at 26 tanks, 23 armored fighting vehicles, nine more armored vehicles, two jets and at least 560 troops. Kiev has been talking about a “Kherson counteroffensive” all summer, while soliciting more weapons and ammunition from its Western backers. In a video address to the people on Sunday, Zelensky vowed that “Ukraine will return” to Donbass – as well as Kharkov, Zaporozhye, Kherson, and “definitely to Crimea.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/561804-peskov-eu-visa-restrictions/,Kremlin vows response if EU enacts visa ban for Russians,"The EU is “irrational” enough to act against its own interests and impose visa restrictions against Russian nationals, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. If it does, Russia will retaliate in a way that protects its citizens, he added. Speaking to journalists about the proposed EU restrictions on Tuesday, Peskov said the Russian government believed it to be within the realm of possibility that such a policy would be introduced. “Brussels and individual European governments have repeatedly shown an absolute lack of sense … when it comes to anti-Russian impulses,” Peskov said. He remarked that EU policies directed against Russia tended to benefit the US at the expense of their own people. Moscow has been monitoring media reports indicating that some visa restrictions may be negotiated this week during an EU ministerial meeting in Prague. If a policy change comes out of the gathering, it cannot be left without a response by Moscow, the spokesman said. “We will retaliate in a way that best serves our interests and the interests of our citizens,” Peskov assured, adding that the exact response can only be formulated if and when the EU acts. Ukraine and its most hardline EU supporters have been calling for an almost full ban on visa issuance to Russian citizens, with exceptions only on humanitarian grounds. The measure is touted as a proportionate response to Russia’s attack against Ukraine and the failure of its people to oppose their government’s policies. Some nations, such as Estonia, have claimed that banning Russian visitors was necessary for national security. However, countries such as Germany and France are reportedly advocating to other members of the bloc to take a less restrictive approach, arguing that a collective punishment of the Russian people would only alienate them from the West and boost domestic support of the country’s government."
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/561803-russia-washington-post-drones/,Moscow responds to claims it received Iranian drones,"Moscow has denied claims made by the Washington Post suggesting that Iran is supplying Russian forces with combat drones to be used in Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists on Tuesday that the Bezos-owned newspaper has engaged in quite a bit of “information stuffing” lately, and rejected claims that Moscow had received a shipment of UAVs from Tehran. Nevertheless, Peskov noted that Russia’s relations with Iran are “developing dynamically” and would continue to do so. The response comes after the Washington Post published an article on Monday stating that Iran had sent a shipment of drones to Russia, citing anonymous US and allied officials. The report says Tehran had transferred a number of Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series drones to Moscow and that many of them were already malfunctioning. In July, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan made similar claims, stating Washington had “clear evidence” that Iran was preparing to deliver “several hundred” drones to Russia, “including weapons-capable UAVs,” and that the sale would be conducted on an “expedited timeline.” Later that month, the White House toned down its allegations. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby admitted that Washington did not actually see any evidence of a deal. “We’ve seen no indications of any sort of actual delivery and/or purchase of Iranian drones by the Russian Ministry of Defense,” Kirby said. Tehran has rejected claims of any drone deals with Moscow, insisting that it would not take a side in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and would continue to push for a peaceful resolution."
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/561806-russian-prosecutors-24-year-sentence-treason/,Russian prosecutors request 24-year sentence in Safronov ‘treason’ case,"Russian prosecutors have requested a 24-year sentence in a maximum security prison for former journalist Ivan Safronov, who is accused of state treason for leaking classified intel to NATO’s intelligence services. Prosecutors have also requested a 500,000-ruble ($8,200) fine for Safronov, who is believed to have handed over confidential information regarding Russia’s military interests. According to Russian law, state treason can carry a sentence of between 12 and 20 years in prison, as well as a fine. Safronov, who once worked for Russian newspapers Kommersant and Vedomosti and later became an adviser to the head of the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, was arrested in July 2020. He is accused of two counts of cooperating with the Czech and German intelligence services. Prosecutors believe Safronov was recruited by members of the Czech special services in 2012 and leaked information to them related to Russia’s military-technical cooperation in Africa and the Middle East – the ultimate recipient of this classified intel being the US. They also claim that he was paid $248 in 2015 for providing information on the activities of Russia’s armed forces in Syria, which was sent to representatives of Zurich University in Switzerland and the German intelligence services. Investigators claim this information could have been used to analyze the actions of Russian troops in Syria. Safronov and his legal team have denied the allegations and have refused to reach a settlement with prosecutors, arguing that the defendant is being punished for his journalistic work. Safronov’s trial is ongoing, and is being held behind closed doors. After his defense team rests its case, the defendant will have the right to the last word, after which the court will enter deliberations to decide on a verdict."
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/561753-russia-china-new-world-order/,Dmitry Trenin: This Russia-China founded bloc represents half the world’s population and will help forge the new world order,"Over 20 years after it began as an attempt at cooperation between five-Russian led post-Soviet states and an emerging China, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has become a major global institution, representing close to half of the world’s population. From September 15-16, Samarkand, one of the ancient centers of human civilization, will host the annual summit of the group. The Uzbek presidency’s priorities include strengthening the SCO’s capabilities in assuring regional security and stability; promoting friendship and good-neighborliness; raising its global profile; countering threats in the information and ideological spheres; expanding parliamentary links; energizing economic interaction; enhancing connectivity; intensifying cultural and humanitarian contacts; and raising the general effectiveness of the collective and its mechanisms. All of this looks impressive, but quite anodyne, and the documents to be formally approved at the summit do not promise any major sensations – beyond the long-expected admission of Iran as the SCO’s ninth member state. Yet the environment in which the Samarkand summit will be held differs greatly even from last year’s gathering in Dushanbe. Russia’s military operation in Ukraine has led to a proxy war between Moscow and Washington. Meanwhile, Sino-US relations, already confrontational, have become palpably strained over the recent visit to Taiwan by US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. NATO’s new strategic concept adopted last June in Madrid describes Russia as the most significant and direct threat, and China – for the first time – as a challenge to Western interests, security and values. As a result, the international community has moved visibly closer to a Cold War-style division between two camps in an intensifying rivalry over the world order. That said, the SCO is unlikely to become the non-West’s version of NATO. While the US-led bloc is now more united than ever in its effort to preserve the order built and developed in the heyday of its global dominance, non-Western nations do not display anything similar to that sort of unity, hierarchy, and internal discipline. Russia and China, although they both reject US global hegemony, pursue very different grand strategies and – despite their public declarations of a cooperation that “knows no limits,” and a partnership that is “more than an alliance” – are careful not to damage their other important connections – e.g., China’s with the US and EU; and Russia’s with India – as they cooperate with each other. Moreover, China and India, not to mention the latter and Pakistan, while all members of the SCO, view each other as major security threats. Despite such diversity and complexity, however, the SCO, at the start of its third decade, is not only still in business, but is steadily getting more active and becoming more attractive to others. In 2001, it started at six; after 2017, the membership expanded to eight, with another 20 countries or so listed as observers, dialogue partners, or in the process of joining. Iran’s accession this year is spurring the interest of Turkey and a number of Arab countries, notably the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Qatar. The SCO community could potentially include much of the Eurasian continent between Belarus and Cambodia. Such enlargement carries obvious risks in terms of even wider diversity of interest, conflict, and frictions between the countries that aspire to join. Yet, the example of China and Russia; India and Pakistan finding the SCO useful to their interests is a convincing argument for accession. In fact, the SCO’s lack of a single leader; its consensus-based decision-making procedures; its emphasis on national sovereignty and non-interference is a welcome contrast to the US-dominated NATO or like-minded groups such as the G7. Being in the SCO does not mean following Beijing’s or Moscow’s guidance. So far, so good. Yet, to flip the coin, what can the SCO actually give its members, observers, and partners? The general answer is: security in their mutual relations and stability across the continent. The organization, after all, originated from talks on border and military security issues between China on the one hand, and Russia and the Central Asian states on the other. Membership itself does not guarantee that there will be no conflicts, but it provides for means to prevent or manage them. Thus, it provides a unique platform for regular high-level and top-level contacts between Delhi and Beijing. Anti-terrorist cooperation – for all the differences in defining ‘terrorism’ – is another obvious bonus. After last year’s US withdrawal from Afghanistan, SCO member states have stepped up their efforts to bolster stability in the region. Economic development has long featured as one of the key areas of SCO cooperation. China’s Belt and Road Initiative has been followed by the North-South corridor linking Russia, Iran, the Arab countries, and India. Peace in the South Caucasus could be cemented by restoring connectivity within the region and its links to the north and the south. The unraveling of ‘Chimerica’ and the EU-Russia decoupling in the wake of the Ukraine war signal the replacement of globalization with regionalization. Asian and Eurasian countries which for the past couple of centuries were much more closely involved with distant Western powers than with their own neighbors are now focusing on opportunities in their dynamic neighborhood. Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia are also opening doors much wider to Asian and Middle Eastern investment in Russia and trade with it. A new impetus for Eurasian interaction has been created in the post-Ukraine environment by the seizure by the West of half of Russia’s currency reserves. The central issue that has entered a number of countries’ strategic calculus is the reliability of the US dollar-based global financial system. Increasingly, national currencies of the SCO member states and observers, such as the Chinese yuan, the Indian rupee, the Turkish lira, the Iranian riel, as well as the Russian ruble are being used in trade between these countries. In parallel, national payment systems of these and other countries are becoming connected, allowing them to conduct transactions directly, rather than via Washington or its allies. At this point, the mechanisms are still cumbersome, but therein lies the beginning of a new international financial system which is free from diktat by a hegemonic outside power. The sanctions imposed on Iran, and now on Russia, could in the future be slapped on other nations that find themselves in conflict with the US. The international system as it emerged from the end of the Cold War is going through a deep crisis which will take a long time to resolve. The present system is founded on organizations either rooted in or inspired by the Cold War – like NATO or AUKUS, or heavily dominated by Western powers, like the international financial institutions, the OSCE, and the UN system as a whole. It is doubtful that the prime beneficiaries of the existing situation will do more than budge a little to make room for emerging players; they will certainly do their best to retain control over the system that they have devised and operated. While the future of the world order is being decided in the ongoing major power competition, a practical way of altering the situation to better serve the interests of the growing number of autonomous players is through developing organizations such as the SCO – independent, non-hegemonic, and inclusive. Potentially, the SCO could become a model for the 21st century order in the world’s most important regional space."
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/news/561788-eu-visa-ban-russia-sanctions/,EU states oppose full Russian visa ban – Politico,"EU member states are expected to reach a deal to slow the issuing of visas to Russian nationals and to make the process more expensive, rather than introducing a full ban, Politico reported on Monday, citing an internal document. According to a memo obtained by the outlet, ahead of informal talks of EU defense and foreign ministers in Prague, Germany and France argued that a visa ban would only alienate Russian people from the West, while driving a wedge between some members of the bloc. “While limiting contacts with regime representatives and authorities to areas of vital EU interest, we need to strategically fight for the ‘hearts and minds’ of the Russian population – at least the segments not yet completely estranged from ‘the West,’” Paris and Berlin reportedly stated. This position has apparently frustrated a number of EU states that insist on stricter measures against Russia amid the conflict in Ukraine. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told Politico that visa restrictions would hurt Russia, not the EU. The ban is “something that Russia is afraid of” because it affects the elite, she said. However, the debate on visas is still far from over, with a coalition of Russia hawks reportedly intending to hold talks before the Prague meeting. According to two of Politico’s sources, the jury is still out on how aggressive their stance will be. Germany and France spoke out against a strict approach in the memo, saying they “wish to maintain a legal framework that allows in particular students, artists, scholars, professionals – independent of whether they are at risk of prosecution on political grounds – to travel to the EU.” On Sunday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said a full visa ban for all Russians is unlikely to receive unanimous support in the bloc. “I think that we have to review the way that some Russians get a visa, certainly [not] the oligarchs. We have to be more selective. But I am not in favor of stopping delivering visas to all Russians,” he stated at the time. The Financial Times reported on Sunday that EU member states plan to back a suspension of the 2007 EU-Russia visa facilitation deal, which will make the process of applying for all EU visas more complicated, expensive, and protracted. A number of countries, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, and Latvia, have already stopped issuing visas to Russian citizens. Commenting on the visa ban proposals discussed at the EU level, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said these types of initiatives “don’t smell too good,” while expressing hope that common sense would eventually prevail."
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/561791-un-nuclear-inspectors-arrive-kiev/,UN nuclear inspectors arrive in Kiev – CNN,"Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) dispatched to assess the situation at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant have arrived in Kiev, CNN reported on Tuesday. Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling Europe’s biggest nuclear plant, which sits on the conflict frontline in southern Ukraine. Reports of shells and missiles landing dangerously close to the facility have sparked fears of a possible nuclear disaster, similar to the one at Chernobyl in 1986. CNN said its reporters have seen the inspectors at their hotel in the Ukrainian capital. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi announced the mission’s long-awaited trip on Monday. The plant was seized by Russian troops days after Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine. The facility continued to operate with local staff under Russian control. It was briefly completely taken off the grid last week, but later resumed operation. Ukrainian and US officials have accused Russia of using the facility as cover for its soldiers. Moscow, meanwhile, insists that it does not keep heavy weapons, including artillery, stationed at the plant. The international inspectors are planning to check the plant’s reactors and assess the damage done to the facility."
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/news/561780-russia-afghanistan-us-economy/,US must ‘pay the bill’ for Afghanistan – Russia,"The US should focus on compensating the Afghan people for the 20 years of “pointless occupation” rather than accusing others of not chipping in, Russia’s envoy to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, has said. The US sent troops into Afghanistan in 2001 to fight the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and other Islamist groups as part of its global War on Terror declared after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in America. The Taliban, however, seized Kabul and overran Afghanistan last year during the final stage of the withdrawal of the US and other Western forces. At a UN Security Council meeting in New York on Monday, US envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield suggested that Russia was not doing enough to help Afghanistan’s economy. “Russia argued, as others have in the past, that Afghanistan’s problems are the fault of ‘the West,’ and not the Taliban. Really?” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Here is my question: What are you doing to help other than rehash the past and criticize others? If you are concerned that Afghan women and children are dying, how are you helping them?” The US envoy went on to say that Russia contributed “nothing” to the UN Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan this year, and called China’s contributions “similarly underwhelming.” Nebenzia hit back at Thomas-Greenfield, arguing that Washington should bear the burden, given the nearly two decades of US troops in the war-torn country. “The cynicism of such statements is simply shocking: We are being asked to pull out our wallet to rebuild the country whose economy was virtually destroyed by the 20 years of occupation by the US and NATO,” Nebenzia said. “Instead of admitting one’s mistakes and trying to fix them, we are now being chastised for not wanting to pay for the bills of others. It’s an unusual proposition.” “No, dear former Western partners, it is you who must pay for your mistakes,” he added. We have helped and will continue to help Afghanistan, and we recommend that you focus on compensating… the Afghans for the 20 years of senseless occupation that destroyed Afghanistan and [threatened the survival of its people] In response, Thomas-Greenfield said: “Let me just state that if the Russian Federation believes that there was an economy in Afghanistan to be destroyed, it’s been destroyed by the Taliban.” Chinese Ambassador Zhang Jun said, “the fiasco of the past 20 years [in Afghanistan] has once again proved that military intervention and power politics are not the right way,” and “the tragedy in Afghanistan should never be allowed to repeat.” The UN has warned that the current level of foreign aid to Afghanistan is not enough. “You can’t use humanitarian relief to patch up what has been a completely collapsed economy,” Kanni Wignaraja, assistant secretary general and regional director of Asia-Pacific at the United Nations Development Program, said this month."
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/561775-ukraine-shelling-un-iaea-zaporozhye-nuclear/,Ukraine accused of targeting possible route of nuclear inspectors,"Ukrainian forces are shelling a route that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection mission could take to reach the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant this week, local authorities claimed on Tuesday. Zaporozhye Region council member Vladimir Rogov told RIA Novosti that “Ukrainian nationalists are targeting locations that could be visited by the IAEA mission in Energodar,” where the plant is located. He added that “[Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky’s regime also started a military operation in the south of the country,” which raises concerns for the safety of the IAEA mission. Rogov also said Kiev’s forces have shelled the NPP’s resort house that could accommodate the IAEA delegation. On Monday, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi announced that an expert group would visit the NPP this week to assess the damage sustained by the plant and check the safety and security systems. Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant has been under Russian control since March. Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of attacking the plant, while warning that the shelling could trigger a disaster that would eclipse the Chernobyl incident. Kiev insists, however, that Russian forces are shelling the site while stationing military hardware there. On Sunday night, Ukrainian forces shelled Energodar, the city where the plant is located, local officials said. They claimed that the attack, which injured nine people and deliberately hit a number of residential houses, was meant to torpedo the upcoming IAEA mission. “This provocation by Kiev-controlled militants is aimed at derailing the visit of the IAEA chief to the Zaporozhye NPP,” they said at the time. Also on Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that Kiev’s forces attempted a counter-offensive in Kherson in southern Ukraine, but “failed miserably.” The ministry went on to say that the Ukrainian army had attempted to attack in three directions, but made no gains and suffered “great losses,” which included dozens of tanks and armored fighting vehicles."
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/561769-pentagon-ukraine-nuclear-shelling/,Pentagon admits ‘likelihood’ of Ukrainian shelling near nuclear plant,"A senior US military official admitted on Monday that Ukrainian forces may have struck the area around the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, but insisted that this was only in response to Russian fire allegedly coming from the area. Earlier in the day, the Russian authorities said a Ukrainian artillery shell damaged the roof of the building storing reactor fuel. “What I know for sure is that the Russians are firing from around the plant,” the unnamed official told reporters during a background briefing at the Pentagon. “I also know that there are rounds that have impacted near the plant.” The official said it was “hard to explain, I guess” how the US was monitoring the situation around the nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest. “And I don't want to say that the Ukrainians haven't fired in that vicinity either because I think there's probably a likelihood that they have, but in good – in a number of cases, it's returning fire of the Russians who are firing from those locations,” he said. Russian forces established control of the Zaporozhye NPP in early March. National guard and nuclear protection specialists secured the site while the Ukrainian staff continued to operate without hindrance. The government in Kiev claims that Russian forces turned the plant into a military base from which they were attacking Ukrainian targets, but also that Russian troops were shelling themselves in a false-flag ploy to make Ukraine look bad. The US official claimed “the Ukrainians are very aware of the potential impacts of striking the nuclear power plant and they're going out of their way not to do that.” Moscow has provided evidence to the UN of repeated Ukrainian attacks on the Zaporozhye NPP and the nearby town of Energodar since July, using kamikaze drones and even US-supplied artillery. The latest attack came on Monday, when a round breached the roof of a building where fresh reactor fuel was being stored, a member of the local administration said. On Sunday, a drone was shot down over the plant, while Ukrainian artillery strikes on Energodar injured nine civilian residents. Kiev has demanded that Russia hand the Zaporozhye NPP back over to Ukrainian control, or at least demilitarize a 30-kilometer area around it. On Monday, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also urged demilitarization, as well as a shutdown of the reactors. The US has previously echoed Kiev’s accusations that Moscow wants to “steal Ukraine’s electricity” by shutting down the plant or disconnecting it from the Ukrainian grid. According to Russian nuclear experts, the biggest danger is not a reactor meltdown, but Ukrainian artillery striking the open-air spent fuel storage, which would result in a radioactive release. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi is personally leading the mission that is supposed to visit the plant this week."
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/561770-novaya-kakhovka-power-water/,Ukrainian strike on Russian-held city cuts water and power supply – official,"An intense Ukrainian artillery strike hit the Russian-controlled city of Novaya Kakhovka in Ukraine’s Kherson Region, cutting off the city’s power and water supply, local authorities reported on Monday evening. “We’re likely in for some gruesome consequences,” the Kakhovka district’s head Vladimir Leontyev told reporters. “Responding to the scene is currently impossible. There were a lot of strikes, something exploded.” According to Leontyev, there were hits reported both within the city limits and at the nearby hydroelectric power plant. While the exact extent of the damage had not been established yet, the attack has crippled the city’s water and power supply. “The fires are still burning and we are still hearing explosions,” Leontyev said around 10:45pm local time. The city’s hospitals had all been issued emergency generators and the authorities plan to start water deliveries in the morning, he added. Novaya Kakhovka had been on the receiving end of Ukrainian shelling all day. Earlier, Leontyev told the media that about ten salvos, each including at least six rockets, damaged many civilian structures, including a market. The official said Ukrainian forces were using US-supplied HIMARS systems to harass the city. Kiev claimed on Monday to have launched a counter-offensive in the Kherson Region, where Novaya Kakhovka is located. Natalia Humeniuk, Ukraine’s southern command spokeswoman, told state media that Kiev’s troops had breached the “first line of defense” of the Russian forces, but declined to give any details of the operation. By Monday evening, however, the Russian Defense Ministry said the Kherson offensive had “failed miserably,” with Ukrainian forces routed after suffering heavy losses. According to the ministry’s report, Kiev lost over 560 troops, dozens of armored vehicles and tanks, and two Su-25 ground-attack planes."
2022-08-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/561768-finland-confiscate-money-russians-border/,EU state confiscates cash from Russians – media,"Finnish customs officials have begun seizing cash from Russians returning home across the border, media outlet Fontanka reported on Monday, citing a man who claimed his money was confiscated. A resident of St. Petersburg identified only as Yuri was returning from a business trip to Serbia via Finland. He was driving back to Russia on Saturday evening when he was stopped at the border. When asked if he had any money with him, Yuri showed the customs officials €1,390 ($1,390) in cash. The man said he brought all of it from Russia and did not acquire any additional money abroad. He also had rubles and Serbian dinars, but the customs officials were apparently only interested in the euros. “They took only euros,” Yuri told Fontanka, adding that he was told he was “prohibited from taking the money to Russia.” The customs officials said he could either give all of his euros to “someone entering Finland” through the same border crossing, or hand it over to customs and get it back the next time he is in Finland. The man agreed to hand the money over, provided there was no time limit on when he could get it back. According to Fontanka, Yuri is not the only Russian who has been subjected to these restrictions, which were introduced due to the conflict in Ukraine. Other travelers have reportedly shared similar stories on the outlet’s Telegram channel. Finnish Customs officially warns on its website that “exporting banknotes of official EU Member State currencies to Russia is prohibited,” but says there are exceptions for money needed for diplomatic purposes and the personal use of those traveling to Russia. The Russian-language version of the website specifically states that “taking unused cash to Russia by an individual living in Russia and returning home” does not count as “personal use.” The measures are described as “export sanctions” related to the conflict in Ukraine, and it is not clear when they were introduced. So far, the Russian authorities have not commented on the development."
2022-08-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/561763-un-save-wwii-monument-latvia/,Baltic state destroyed WWII monument despite UN warning,"The UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) attempted to stop the destruction of a Soviet monument commemorating the liberation of Latvia and its capital, Riga, from the Nazis in World War Two. However, the memorial was still destroyed last week as Riga claims the UN failed to inform it about its decision to introduce temporary protection measures. The OHCHR asked Latvia to stop the dismantling of the monument – a process that was already in full swing – last week and preserve the already demolished parts, Latvian officials have confirmed to local media. An OHCHR official, Vivian Kwok, told the Sputnik news agency that the UN body had registered a complaint about the planned demolition and sought a temporary reprieve for the memorial. This decision was made after the OHCHR had received a complaint from five people alleging a violation of the UN’s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by the Latvian authorities. Latvia’s Foreign Ministry claimed, however, to have received the UN body’s decision only on August 26, a day after the last remaining part of the monument – a giant 79-meter-high obelisk – had already been destroyed. The fact that it arrived so late made the UN body’s decision unenforceable, the ministry maintained. Riga also stated that the OHCHR is “not a court” and its opinions are “not legally binding,” even though a nation recognizing the OHCHR authority should take its opinions into account and rectify shortcomings “in good faith.” The OHCHR itself told the news agency RIA that it had not made a final decision on the complaint yet. The demolition of the 1985 monument dedicated to the ‘Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders’ led to protests in the Latvian capital last week. Local police detained 14 protesters last Tuesday for disobeying orders to disperse. After Latvia gained independence following the dissolution of the USSR, the country’s authorities increasingly began seeing the memorial as a symbol of Soviet oppression and the question of taking it down was repeatedly raised. In May, the Baltic state’s government voted to remove all Soviet-era monuments by a November 15 deadline, citing the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Moscow has offered visas to those who were attempting to defend the monument. Meanwhile, Latvian President Egils Levits has said that people of Russian heritage whose loyalty to the government could raise questions should be “isolated from society.” Ethnic Russians comprise around 25% of the Baltic country’s population."
2022-08-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/561755-latvia-soviet-monument-threat/,Baltic state’s second city threatened over WW2 monuments,"Only one of Latvia’s 43 municipalities has not submitted a plan to dismantle monuments to Soviet “occupation,” and there will be consequences if this defiance of Riga continues, the Baltic country’s minister of environmental protection and regional development said on Monday. The lone holdout against Latvia’s crusade to demolish Soviet memorials is Daugavpils, a city in the south near the border with Lithuania and Belarus. Riga has “repeatedly” demanded that Daugavpils Mayor Andrejs Elksninas plan and implement measures to “dismantle objects glorifying the occupation,” minister Arturs Toms Pless told reporters. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development (VARAM) has been keeping a tally of the city’s refusals, he added. “If you have received a yellow card several times, a red card may appear at some point,” said Pless, according to the state news agency LETA. “The laws must be followed regardless of whether someone personally agrees or disagrees with them.” Citing the conflict in Ukraine, the Baltic state’s government voted in May to remove all the Soviet-era monuments by a November 15 deadline. An obelisk memorializing the Red Army troops who liberated Riga from Nazi occupation in 1945 was destroyed last week. Meanwhile, Latvian President Egils Levits told the state broadcaster LSM that ethnic Russians whose loyalty to the government was suspect should be “isolated from society.” Ethnic Russians make up some 25% of Latvia’s total population. VARAM has given Elksninas a 20-day deadline to submit a report providing “extensive, detailed information” on measures taken to dismantle the monuments so far and going forward. Two out of three Soviet monuments in Daugavpils are marked for destruction: a Red Army memorial and a monument to the 360th Rifle Division, which liberated the city. The third monument, in Dubrovina Park, has been spared destruction so far because several officers are buried there. The territory of present-day Latvia was ruled by the Russian Empire from 1795 to 1920, with Riga becoming the empire’s largest port. After the Bolshevik revolution, Latvia declared independence with the support of Germany and Poland. During the Second World War, Nazi Germany raised two Waffen-SS divisions in Latvia. The period from 1945 until 1991, when Latvia seceded from the USSR, was later designated by Riga as “Soviet occupation.”"
2022-08-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/561757-ukraine-mayor-zelensky-mistakes/,Odessa mayor calls for Ukraine and Russia to negotiate,"The mayor of the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa, Gennady Trukhanov, believes the conflict with Russia should be resolved politically. Kiev and Moscow should cease the hostilities and return to the negotiating table, he told Italy’s Corriere della Sera newspaper in an interview published on Sunday. Although he supports the idea of Ukraine “returning to [its] borders of 1991,” including Donbass and Crimea, Trukhanov maintains that these disputes should be resolved at the negotiating table, not the battlefield. “The lives of millions of people are at stake,” therefore “it is necessary to negotiate step by step, to seek compromises gradually, to avoid confrontation,” the mayor said. He argued that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has made “many” mistakes while in office. Trukhanov criticized the government for concentrating too much power in Kiev at the expense of the regions. “[Zelensky] should have left more autonomy to regions and municipalities,” he said, adding that had the president listened to his suggestions and those of others, “the country would work better.” Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status and broad autonomy within the Ukrainian state, was one of the reasons cited by Moscow when it launched its military operation in Ukraine on February 24. The Odessa mayor noted that Ukraine and Russia are “deeply connected by history, culture, language, religion, traditions.” Nevertheless, Trukhanov condemned Moscow’s military operation, calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a “monster” who could even go as far as to drop a nuclear bomb on Ukraine. However, he does not believe that Putin intends to bomb Odessa. The mayor also criticized the efforts of the Ukrainian authorities aimed at tearing down statues and monuments to Russian historical figures in Ukraine. “I am against taking down the statues. Even if we destroy the monuments, history does not change,” Trukhanov said, adding that removing statues of 19th-century Russian poet Aleksandr Pushkin, and the first Soviet cosmonaut, Yury Gagarin, simply “does not make sense.” The Kremlin signaled its readiness to strike a peace deal with Kiev in early August. President Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said at the time that the two nations were close to settling their differences in a way that was acceptable to Russia back in spring, but the draft agreement prepared during a meeting in Istanbul was torpedoed by Ukraine. Moscow warned that if Kiev refuses to end the conflict in a diplomatic way, Russia will still achieve the goals of its military operation. In mid-August, Ukraine ruled out any negotiations with Russia, arguing that talks would not serve Kiev’s goals. “The opportunity to win this war is much more important than any situational pause,” Zelensky’s aide, Mikhail Podoliak, said at the time."
2022-08-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/561758-ukraine-counter-offensive-fails/,Ukrainian attempt at counter-offensive has failed – Russia,"Ukraine’s much-heralded “counter-offensive” in Kherson has “failed miserably,” the Russian Defense Ministry insisted on Monday, listing estimated losses suffered by Kiev during the operation. Ukrainian forces had attempted to attack in three directions on orders of President Vladimir Zelensky but made no gains, Moscow explained. Russian troops caused “great losses” to the Ukrainian attackers during the day’s battles, a statement read. Kiev saw 26 tanks, 23 armored fighting vehicles, nine more armored vehicles, and two SU-25 ground-attack jets destroyed, while more than 560 troops were lost, according to the summary. The enemy's latest attempt at offensive actions has failed miserably. Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian outlet Suspilne quoted Southern Command spokesperson Natalia Humeniuk as saying that “offensive actions in various directions” had begun, “including in the Kherson region.” She offered no details, however, saying only that “any military operation needs silence.” By Monday evening, however, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine mentioned only a Russian attack near the village of Potemkino. Kiev has been talking about a “Kherson counteroffensive” all summer, while soliciting more weapons and ammunition from its Western backers. In a video address to the people on Sunday, Zelensky vowed that “Ukraine will return” to Donbass – as well as Kharkov, Zaporozhye, Kherson and “definitely to Crimea.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/561735-iaea-zaporozhye-nuclear-plant-ukraine/,Exact dates for IAEA mission to 'targeted' nuclear site revealed – WSJ,"Experts from the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will examine the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant between August 31 and September 3, in an effort to assess the situation at the site amid fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. “The inspection will begin on Wednesday and last until Saturday,” the WSJ reported, citing an internal Ukrainian government document. According to Morgan Libby, a former IAEA official, the agency’s mission may end up being the most important since the 1986 Chernobyl incident. “Everything else pales in comparison,” he told the paper. On Monday, Rafael Grossi, the watchdog’s chief, announced that the agency had formed an expert group to visit the NPP, which has been under Russian control since March but is largely still operated by Ukrainian personnel. “The day has come, IAEA’s Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporozhye (ISAMZ) is now on its way. We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility,” he wrote on Twitter. Grossi said the delegation would assess the damage sustained, check safety and security systems and speak to both Russian and Ukrainian staff on the ground. A New York Times report released on Saturday said that the IAEA’s team consists of 14 experts from “mostly neutral countries.” Neither the US nor Britain will reportedly have any representatives in the group given that Russia had dismissed those countries as “unfairly biased” over their support for the government in Kiev. Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of attacking the nuclear plant, while warning that the shelling could trigger a disaster that would eclipse the Chernobyl incident. However, Kiev insists that it is Russian forces who are shelling the site while stationing military hardware there. On Sunday, Kiev shelled Energodar, the city where the plant is located, injuring nine people and hitting three residential houses with artillery fire, local authorities said, claiming that “the provocation” was aimed at “derailing the visit of the IAEA chief to the Zaporozhye NPP.” In early August, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov noted that “targeting of the territory of the nuclear power plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is potentially extremely dangerous activity,” which may lead to catastrophic consequences."
2022-08-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/561742-ukraine-nuclear-power-plant-hit/,Ukrainian shelling damages roof of nuclear fuel storage – official,"A Ukrainian strike has hit a reactor fuel storage at the Russian-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, local authorities said on Monday. The roof of the building has been damaged as a result of the attack, Vladimir Rogov, the spokesman for Zaporozhye Region’s administration, said on Telegram. He also posted a photo of a hole in the roof that was supposedly caused by the strike. The affected storage facility holds fresh nuclear fuel for the reactors of the plant, which is the largest in Europe. Russia said earlier that a Ukrainian drone targeting the nuclear facility had been shot down. Moscow has repeatedly accused Kiev's forces of targeting the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant – which has been under Russian control since March, but operated by Ukrainian staff – with artillery and ‘kamikaze’ drones. It warned that those attacks could trigger a disaster that would eclipse the 1986 Chernobyl incident. Radioactive material could potentially reach Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Moldova, Belarus, and even Germany in a worst-case scenario. Ukraine, meanwhile, has claimed that the Russian forces have turned the nuclear plant into a military base and that they’ve been shelling the facility themselves to pin the blame on Kiev. Russia has repeatedly denied those accusation and urged for international inspectors to visit the site to assess the situation for themselves. Earlier on Monday, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi announced that such a mission will take pace after all, with IAEA specialists expected to arrive at the Zaporozhye plant this week."
2022-08-29,https://www.rt.com/news/561736-scholz-responsibility-ukraine-arms/,Germany can assume ‘special responsibility’ for arming Ukraine – Scholz,"Berlin can take on “special responsibility” in assisting Kiev to acquire the necessary artillery and air defenses in the conflict with Russia, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. Germany and many other Western countries have been arming Ukraine following the launch of Russia’s military operation in the neighboring state in late February. The EU should organize “a long-term and reliable division of labor between all partners of Ukraine,” Scholz said in a speech at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic on Monday. “I can, for example, imagine that Germany will assume special responsibility in terms of building up Ukraine’s artillery and air defense capacities.” Scholz stated that Germany will supply Ukraine with “new state-of-the-art weapons, such as air defense and radar systems, and reconnaissance drones.” “Our objective is a modern Ukrainian Armed Forces that are able to defend their country on a permanent basis,” the chancellor added. Germany had previously been reluctant to send weapons to conflict zones, mostly for historical reasons dating back to World War II. However, Berlin has recently “undergone a fundamental change of heart on this issue,” Scholz said, adding that Germany will “keep on supporting [Ukraine], reliably and, above all, for as long as it takes.” The German government announced last week that it would supply Kiev with an additional €500 million ($499.6 million) worth of arms. Berlin previously delivered Stinger anti-aircraft missile systems, Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled howitzers, and Gepard anti-aircraft gun tanks to Ukraine, among other weapons. EU defense ministers are set to discuss further military aid for Ukraine at an informal two-day gathering in Prague, which started on Monday. The Kremlin has warned that “flooding” Ukraine with foreign weapons will exacerbate the conflict, but will have no impact on the outcome."
2022-08-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/561731-novaya-kakhovka-ukraine-attacks/,Civilians evacuated to shelters as Ukraine attacks Russian-held town,"The Russian-controlled city of Novaya Kakhovka in Ukraine’s Kherson Region is evacuating civilians due to constant artillery attacks by Kiev’s forces, the local administration reported on Monday. “Over 24 hours, there were some ten rocket salvos, each including six or eight or more rockets. Many civilian objects were damaged by them,” including a city market and a driving school in the city center, the Kakhovka district’s head, Vladimir Leontyev, told the media. He said Ukraine was using US-provided HIMARS rocket launchers to harass the city, which is located on the left bank of the Dnepr River and hosts a hydroelectric power plant. Ukrainian forces are stationed on the opposite side of the river. A Ukrainian military spokesperson claimed on Monday that Kiev’s forces have launched an offensive in the south of the country, which includes Kherson Region, where Novaya Kakhovka is located. Natalya Gumenyuk, who spoke on national TV on behalf of Ukraine’s southern command, declined to offer any details about the purported operation, only claiming that Kiev’s forces breached the “first line of defense” of the Russian forces. Ukrainian officials have for months teased a looming offensive to retake the city of Kherson and push Russian forces back from Kherson Region. But earlier this month, Mikhail Podoliak, an aide to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, explained that these types of promises should be considered part of information warfare against Russia. “Certainly, all public comments are part of information warfare. We need to demoralize the Russian army,” he told the BBC in an interview. Sergey Aksyonov, the head of Russia’s Crimean Republic, which borders Kherson Region, dismissed Gumenyuk’s words as “fake news, like the previous ones.” He suggested that the claim was made for Kiev’s “Western masters who need to be shown action.” In reality, Ukraine’s forces are suffering significant losses on the southern front, Aksyonov claimed."
2022-08-29,https://www.rt.com/news/561728-zaporozhye-nuclear-ukraine-iaea/,Moscow urges ‘all nations’ to pressure Kiev over nuclear site,"Making Ukraine cease its attacks on the Russian-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant will require a joint effort from the whole international community, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov has said. “We still believe that all countries are obliged to put pressure on the Ukrainian side, so that it stops endangering the European continent by shelling the territory of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant and adjacent areas,” Peskov told the media on Monday. The statement came hours after International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi announced that IAEA experts would visit the nuclear plant this week to assess the security situation and establish a permanent presence at the facility. “We’ve been waiting for this mission for a long time. We believe it to be necessary,” the Kremlin spokesman said, adding that Moscow was ready to cooperate with the UN atomic agency. He assured that Russia would provide the necessary security to the IAEA inspectors once they reach the plant from Ukrainian-held territory. Peskov also commented on a suggestion by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that the crisis at Europe’s largest nuclear power station could be resolved by setting up a demilitarized zone around the perimeter. “No, there’s no talk about it,” the Kremlin press secretary said when asked about the proposal. Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of targeting the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant and the nearby town of Energodar with artillery and drones, warning that it could trigger a disaster that would eclipse the 1986 Chernobyl incident. Ukraine, meanwhile, has claimed that Russian forces have turned the nuclear plant into a military base and that they’ve been shelling the facility themselves to pin the blame on Kiev. Moscow, which has denied those accusations, has been insisting on a visit by the IAEA to the site. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that a Ukrainian drone was shot down above the Zaporozhye plant on Sunday and that at least eight large-caliber shells were fired at Energodar by Kiev’s forces on the same day."
2022-08-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/561719-estonia-visa-ukraine-property/,Thousands of Russians could lose property in EU country,"A visa ban could lead to thousands of Russians losing their property in Estonia, the deputy secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Veiko Kommusaar, warned on Monday. Tallinn has barred access to the country for Russian citizens with Schengen visas issued by Estonia from August 18, due to Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine. The Baltic nation’s banks have stopped accepting money transfers from Russia as part of earlier EU sanctions. This has made paying utility bills increasingly complicated for Russians who own real estate in Estonia but live in their home country. Russians who accumulate debt over unpaid utility bills due to the sanctions could eventually lose their property in Estonia, Kommusaar said in an interview with the ERR website. “Indeed, if it becomes impossible for a person to find ways of dealing with their real estate – extreme consequence may come. We currently don’t see how Estonia can make any concessions in this area,” he said. Around 12% of Russians (4,500 people) who own property in Estonia are under threat because of the visa ban, according to the deputy secretary. Interior Ministry data reveals that Russians possess 41,351 properties in total in the country. But most of them will be unaffected by the entry restrictions as they have residence permits and live in Estonia. Kommusaar also said it is dangerous for the country of 1.3 million that such a large amount of real estate is concentrated in Russian hands. “Of course, there are those critical places where owning a property is an immediate threat to our security. There are certainly other places, in the form of single apartments, where the problem isn’t that serious.” The official suggested that Estonia must work to limit the possibility of non-EU citizens acquiring real estate in the country."
2022-08-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/561715-nuclear-plant-ukraine-drone/,Ukrainian drone downed over nuclear plant – Russia,"Russian forces on Sunday shot down a Ukrainian drone that was apparently on a mission to strike the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, the Russian military said on Monday. The drone was shot down by small arms fire and fell on the roof of one of the buildings at the nuclear site, the Russian Defense Ministry said during a daily briefing. The building in question serves as storage for nuclear fuel and waste, it said. The crash didn’t cause any significant damage, the statement added. The incident was described as part of a pattern of Ukrainian attacks against the Russia-controlled facility and the city of Energodar, which hosts it. Ukrainian artillery launched at least eight large-caliber shells at the city on Sunday, with two of them landing near the nuclear power plant, according to the report. The Ukrainian staff at the facility “ensures the technical condition and operation” of the Zaporozhye plant, the Russian ministry added. It said there was no evidence of radiation leaks from the site. On Sunday, city officials reported a strike on a residential area by a Ukrainian 'kamikaze drone' and said another unmanned aerial aircraft was shot down by Russian air defense. The Zaporozhye plant has been subjected to regular artillery and drone attacks for weeks, with Moscow and Kiev accusing each other of launching them. The Ukrainian government has also claimed that Russia has used the captured facility as a military base to host heavy weapons and from which to launch artillery strikes at Ukrainian positions. The Russian military has denied such claims, saying that there are only lightly-armed guards at the plant. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors are expected to visit the Zaporozhye plant this week to ascertain what state it is in, verify the security of fissile materials in the reactors and storage facilities, and generally assess the situation. The mission has been delayed by weeks over concern for the safety of the inspectors. Both the Russian and Ukrainian sides have accused each other of derailing the visit."
2022-08-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/561707-dugina-murder-second-suspect/,Second suspect identified in Dugina assassination,"Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has identified a Ukrainian man, named Bogdan Tsiganenko, as an accomplice in the plot to murder Russian journalist and political activist Darya Dugina. The daughter of the well-known philosopher and ‘Eurasia’ advocate Aleksandr Dugin, was killed in a Moscow car bombing earlier this month. Tsiganenko allegedly helped the primary suspect, Natalya Vovk, obtain a fake Kazakhstani passport and assemble an improvised explosive device, which she later used in the crime, according to the statement. The suspected 42-year-old bombmaker entered Russia from Estonia in late June and left a day before the bomb attack on August 20, the FSB said on Monday. The IED was made at a rented garage, the agency added. The FSB believes that the two acted together as members of a “Ukrainian sabotage-terrorist group.” The agency released images and footage said to show Tsiganenko traveling with Vovk in her car, receiving falsified car plates for the vehicle, and entering and leaving Russia. The statement also provided new details about the assassination itself. The FSB released footage showing Vovk surveilling Dugina at a parking lot of the family festival where she presumably planted the bomb. The Ukrainian woman followed her target in her car and set off the explosion, which killed Dugina on the spot, according to the FSB. Dugina was a vocal critic of the government in Kiev and a supporter of Russia’s military action in Ukraine. She was also the daughter of controversial philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, who Western media has long described as a secret influencer of Russian foreign policy. After Vovk was identified as the primary suspect in the case, Russia accused Ukraine of masterminding the assassination. Kiev has denied any involvement. Vovk managed to leave Russia after killing Dugina, crossing into Estonia, according to the FSB."

On Saturday, the New York Times reported that the IAEA delegation consists of independent experts from “mostly neutral countries,” and neither the US nor the UK have any representatives on the team due to their strong support for Kiev. On Sunday night, Ukrainian forces shelled Energodar, the city where the plant is located, the local authorities said. According to Evgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Russian military-civilian administration, three residential houses were deliberately hit by artillery fire, injuring nine people, with two sustaining heavy wounds. The city authorities also claimed that the attack was meant to torpedo the IAEA mission. “This provocation by Kiev-controlled militants is aimed at derailing the visit of the IAEA chief to the Zaporozhye NPP,” they said. Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of attacking the nuclear plant and Energodar, while warning that the shelling could trigger a disaster that would eclipse the 1986 Chernobyl incident.

2022-08-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/561696-ukraine-donbass-recapture/,Zelensky promises to recapture Donbass,"President Vladimir Zelensky said in his daily evening address on Sunday that Ukraine will recapture Donbass, which is now almost fully seized by Russian forces. “We have not forgotten and will not forget any of our cities and any of our people,” he said. “Now Donbass is almost destroyed by Russian strikes, devastated. The proud and glorious Ukrainian Donetsk was humiliated by the Russian occupation and robbed. But Ukraine will return. For sure. Life will return. The dignity of the people of Donbass will return. The ability to live will return. The opportunity to live safely and happily,” the president added. According to him, this is what the Ukrainian flag will symbolize “when we set it up in Donetsk, Gorlovka, Mariupol, in all cities of Donbass, Azov area, in all areas under Russian occupation – in Kharkov, Zaporozhye, Kherson regions. And definitely in Crimea.” “Ukraine remembers everything,” Zelensky said. The US may be helping Ukraine prepare for an impending counteroffensive against Russia, the Washington Post claimed in a piece published this week, pointing to the type of weaponry making up the latest batch of military aid pledged to Kiev by the Pentagon. Last month, a number of top Ukrainian officials suggested that the country’s military would launch a counteroffensive in the south of the country in August to retake the city of Kherson. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-08-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/561695-dugin-moscow--car-bombing-target/,Dugin names target of attack that killed his daughter,"Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin believes his daughter, Daria, was the target of the car-bomb attack that took her life last week, he has told journalists. The murder generated a lot of speculation about whether the killers intended to assassinate Dugin himself or his daughter. “It was no mistake,” he said. “Every effort was made to kill her… she was the target,” he told a documentary titled “Why was Daria Dugina killed?” that is to be aired by Russia’s Channel One. Dugina, 29, was driving her father’s Toyota SUV when it exploded, prompting Russian law enforcement and authorities to assume that the philosopher himself might have been the target of the attack. According to Dugin, his daughter was targeted because she championed the “Russian idea… the idea of great power statehood; security for our people and our nation.” A conservative firebrand and rather fringe figure at home, Dugin himself has been dubbed ‘Putin’s brain’ and ‘Putin’s Rasputin’ by the western media that claimed he supposedly exerted influence on President Vladimir Putin’s worldview. In Russia Dugin is mostly seen as a marginalized figure with no real influence. Earlier, Dugin had called his daughter’s murder a “terrorist act” and blamed “the Nazi Ukrainian regime” for the killing. He also said that he wanted Russia’s “victory” in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine rather than revenge. Kiev has denied any official involvement in the car-bomb attack. The Russian security service, the FSB, identified the suspect behind the bombing as Ukrainian national Natalya Vovk, 43. Vovk, under the surname Shaban, appeared on the list of Ukrainian National Guard personnel that was published in April on the Russian internet. The doxx claimed she was associated with the “Azov” neo-Nazi regiment. However, neither Russia nor Ukraine officially confirmed this information. Earlier this week, the UN called for a probe into Dugina’s killing. An investigation is needed to “establish the facts” behind the incident, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, told reporters on Monday. Pope Francis called Dugina a “poor girl” and, in public comments this week, lamented that the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was claiming innocent lives on both sides. His remarks angered Kiev, which went as far as to summon the Vatican’s envoy to lodge a formal complaint over the Pope’s words. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry once again stated that the murder “had nothing to do with Ukraine” and called his words “unjust.”"
2022-08-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/561683-ukraine-us-sea-weapons/,US expands weapons deliveries by sea to Ukraine – WaPo,"The US has significantly expanded deliveries of weapons to Ukraine by sea amid the conflict with Russia, Pentagon officials have told The Washington Post on Saturday. The Pentagon mainly relied on cargo planes to send ‘lethal aid’ to the Ukrainian government at the start of the Russian military operation in the neighboring country. It began using the sea routes for some of the items a few weeks after the outbreak of the fighting in late February. But the American maritime operation was “significantly broadened” later in spring when Washington began sending howitzers and other heavy weapons, which require a lot of large-caliber ammunition, to Kiev, according to the paper. “Once we started to provide them howitzers, we knew that we were going to need more ammunition,” Army Col. Steven Putthoff, the deputy director of operations at US Transportation Command, said. “So, we could plan ahead a little bit more, and then we could start to use more sealift to provide that support and to get it there, sometimes even ahead of the request.” Planes are much faster in getting the weapons from the US to Europe, but ships can carry a lot more cargo, the paper pointed out. The switch in the Pentagon’s delivery methods signaled the new phase in the conflict as “Ukraine and its partners settled in for what is expected to be a grinding war that could continue for months more and possibly years,” the Washington Post said. US defense officials declined to detail the specific routes used by the Pentagon to deliver weapons to Ukraine, it added Washington has been the prime backer of Kiev amid its conflict with Russia, providing it with billions of dollars in military and financial aid, as well as intelligence data. The US deliveries to the Ukrainian military have included thousands of anti-aircraft Stinger missiles and Javelin anti-armor missiles, as well as such sophisticated hardware as HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, M777 howitzers and combat drones. The latest military aid package of $2.98 billion – the largest so far – was announced by US President Joe Biden mid-week. Russia has been critical of weapons supplies to Kiev by the US and its allies, arguing that they only prolong the conflict and increase the risk of a direct confrontation between Moscow and NATO."
2022-08-28,https://www.rt.com/news/561682-eu-visa-ban-report/,EU to suspend visa deal with Russia – FT,"EU foreign ministers plan to back a suspension of the 2007 EU-Russia visa facilitation deal at a two-day meeting in Prague, next week, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing three officials familiar with the matter. In response to Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, several member states have actively been lobbying for either a ban or heavy restrictions on the number of Russian citizens entering the bloc. “It is inappropriate for Russian tourists to stroll in our cities, on our marinas,” a senior EU official told the newspaper. “We have to send a signal to the Russian population that this war is not OK, it is not acceptable.” The suspension of the agreement would make the process of applying for all EU visas more complicated and expensive, as well as increasing waiting times. “We are in an exceptional situation and it requires exceptional steps. We want to go beyond suspending the visa facilitation,” an EU official was quoted as saying. The official stated that additional restrictions could be adopted by the end of the year, according to the FT. Countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Latvia have already stopped issuing visas to Russian citizens. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said this week that Russian tourists pose a security threat to the country, and that a travel ban could incentivize some Russians to “pressure” the Kremlin. Others, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell, spoke out against a full ban on Russian travelers. They argued that the bloc should not punish ordinary Russians for the actions of their government. Moscow blasted the proposed measures as “flagrant nationalism” and xenophobia. The Kremlin also expressed hope at the time that “common sense” would eventually prevail."

The plant and the nearby city of Energodar have been repeatedly shelled by Kiev’s forces in recent weeks. According to the outlet, the delegation includes Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA chief, and 13 other experts from “mostly neutral countries.” The report also reveals that neither the US nor Britain have any representatives on the team, given that Russia had dismissed those countries as “unfairly biased” over their support for the government in Kiev. The NYT claims the IAEA mission includes experts from Poland and Lithuania, countries that support Ukraine, but also from Serbia and China, which have much warmer relations with Russia. Delegation members also come from Albania, France, Italy, Jordan, Mexico, and North Macedonia. The goal of the mission, according to Grossi, is to see what exactly is happening at the plant, assess its integrity, speak to both Russian and Ukrainian staff there, and establish a permanent presence on the ground. The move follows a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron last week, during which the two leaders agreed on dispatching an international mission to the area “as soon as possible.” The team will apparently travel on terms arranged by Ukraine and the United Nations, which means the experts will arrive at Zaporozhye via territory currently controlled by Kiev’s forces. Moscow had previously insisted that such a mission should arrive only via Russian-controlled territory. Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of attacking the nuclear plant, while warning that the shelling could trigger a disaster that would eclipse the 1986 Chernobyl incident. At the same time, Kiev insists that it is Russian forces who are shelling the site while stationing military hardware there."
2022-08-28,https://www.rt.com/news/561664-ukraine-us-resistance-concept/,Ukraine following US blueprint to fight Russia – CNN,"During its conflict with Russia, Ukraine has been relying on a US-developed doctrine that involves both the military and civilians taking part in defensive activities, CNN reported on Saturday. The Resistance Operating Concept (ROC), which is said to provide a blueprint for smaller states to counter larger powers, was developed in 2013 in response to Russia’s conflict with Georgia in 2008. It was further enhanced after Crimea’s “nearly bloodless” reunification with Moscow in 2014, which “stunned Ukraine and the West,” CNN said. The ROC represents “an innovative and unconventional approach to warfare and total defense,” and guides the actions not only of the Ukrainian military, but also the civilian population. “It’s all hands on deck in terms of the comprehensive defense for the government of Ukraine,” explained retired Lt. Gen. Mark Schwartz, who was in charge of Special Operations Command Europe during the development of the concept. “They’re using every resource and they’re also using some highly unconventional means by which to disrupt the Russian Federation military.” Schwartz said it was “just incredible to watch… despite the unbelievable loss of life and sacrifice, what the will to resist and the resolve to resist can do.” Explosions at Russia’s military facilities in Crimea – far from the front line in Donbass – earlier in August were signs that the ROC had been in play, claimed Kevin D. Stringer, a retired army colonel who led the development team for the concept. Kiev never officially confirmed its involvement in the incidents, but CNN said it saw a Ukrainian government report confirming that it was behind them. Russia said the blasts at its Saki airfield in western Crimea were the result of an accident, while an ammunition depot in the north of the peninsula had been targeted in an “act of sabotage.” “Since you can’t do it conventionally, you would use special operations forces, and those [forces] would need resistance support – intelligence, resources, logistics – in order to access these regions,” Stringer said, explaining the alleged actions by Kiev. Civilian resistance under the ROC includes nonviolent actions such as boycotting public events, labor strikes, and even using satire and jokes as means of resistance. Violent actions, like using Molotov cocktails, arson and putting chemicals in gas tanks to sabotage enemy vehicles, are also part of the concept. Generally, the doctrine calls for a major PR campaign to control the narrative of the conflict, preventing the dissemination of the other side’s message, and keeping the population united. Video footage showing destroyed Russian hardware and edited to catchy tunes forms part of the strategy, along with clips of Ukrainian troops rescuing stray animals, and daily addresses by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky – “whether intentional or not,” CNN claimed. At least 15 countries have taken part in some form of training on the Pentagon’s resistance doctrine over the past decade, Nicole Kirschmann, a spokeswoman for Special Operations Command Europe, revealed. The program isn’t universal. It’s being tailored in accordance with each country’s population, resources and terrain. CNN’s report mentioned Estonia, Lithuania and Poland as nations that have expressed enthusiasm for the ROC."
2022-08-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/561530-russian-movies-what-to-watch/,"War, fatalism, even some heavy drinking: Here are the modern movies you should watch to understand the mysterious ‘Russian soul’","‘Russian longing,’ fatalism, existential reflections, intellectual conversations on abstract and eclectic topics, kitchen conversations – all this is an integral part of the international image of Russian culture, perhaps most amplified by the success of the country's 19th century literature. Today, Russian cinema is enjoying a renaissance. Eternal themes which Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov and Fyodor Dostoevsky wrote about, back in their time, are merged with the legacy of the brilliant Andrei Tarkovsky and the Soviet school of directing. Throw Konstantin Stanislavsky’s acting method into the mix – and other innovations of the Russian theater – and you have the ingredients of modern Russian film. A new generation of young, successful filmmakers are ready to present a wide variety of topics to modern audiences, not only in Russia, but globally as well. In honor of Russian Cinema Day, RT has put together a selection of the country’s most striking modern cinema, which will help people understand the mysterious ‘Russian soul’ just as well as the multi-volume classics of the renowned writers of old. Russian cinema has been around for more than a century. The first screening of a domestic film took place back in 1908 under Emperor Nicholas II. But despite its long and rich history, its birth only began to be celebrated relatively recently – in 1980. The date has shifted many times, and only in 2001 did it finally come to rest on August 27. It was on this day in 1919 that a decree on the nationalization of the USSR’s film department was adopted. Russia’s eventful history has left a big mark on cinema. Pre-war films, as well as those made during the ‘thaw’ period, were full of optimism, while in the 1970s there was more realism. After the collapse of the USSR, priorities changed and new filmmakers appeared to speak on their own topics. Despite the global changes in the country and society, Russian cinema did not stand still and tried to find new ways to communicate with its audiences. Finally, we can safely say that, in the last decade, the art form has been rejuvenated Modern Russian film preserves the traditional features and motifs of the national culture but works with them more carefully. Traditional time-tested dramatic devices are no longer the sole basis of a particular movie, but serve to complement the overall picture, imbuing it with the same ‘Russian soul.’ Time does not stand still, and cinema must develop, so attempts to shoot something in the spirit of the Soviet era are doomed to failure. The filmmakers bring a new language, new techniques, and new meanings to their works, even if we are talking about historical cinema. After all, it must first of all resonate with today’s viewer. At its best, modern Russian cinema is skillfully shot and technically sound, while TV serials raise important issues and speak to modern viewers. There are many new Russian filmmakers who have received wide recognition both at home and abroad. If you follow the winners of prestigious international film festivals, you’ll see that Russian films appear on the list every year. In the 21st century, several high-profile directors appeared in Russia at the same time, whose premieres aroused increasing interest. These include Yuri Bykov, Kirill Serebrennikov, Andrey Zvyagintsev, Kantemir Balashov, Ivan I. Tverdovsky, and others. These are all very different filmmakers, each with their own signature. What unites them is their ability to hook the viewer and ask the right questions. Andrey Zvyagintsev has long been the object of worldwide fame. His 2003 feature-length debut The Return won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Leviathan (2014) and Loveless (2017) were nominated for Oscars, and the latter won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Perhaps Zvyagintsev’s most famous work remains Elena. The picture received a special prize in the Cannes Film Festival’s ‘Un Certain Regard’ program. And the American magazine Rolling Stone included Elena in a list of the best 50 films from the second decade of the 21st century. Despite being released in 2011, the film has not lost its relevance today and, perhaps, has even acquired new meanings. This is a subtle and precise study of class stratification based on two people who entered into an unequal marriage. Anti-capitalist sentiments are very popular in the West now. Almost every Hollywood film either directly or casually criticizes capitalism. But many films lack a sense of proportion, containing banal slogans that often cannot be applied to the lives of ordinary people. Therefore, they resonate little with viewers on a personal level. Zvyagintsev’s story is simple and understandable yet has depth and encourages viewers to seek different meanings. Zvyagintsev does not criticize capitalism directly. He does not say things openly, but this is the attraction of Elena – the viewer can easily put himself in the place of the protagonists and, with the help of images and hints, grasp the main idea of the picture. Where to watch Elena: iTunes, Amazon Prime, KanopyWhere to watch Loveless: Amazon PrimeWhere to watch Leviathan: Amazon Prime Kantemir Balagov, a student of leading Russian cinema figure Andrei Sokurov, perhaps best shows what cinema is like in modern Russia. Balagov’s full-length debut Closeness was a great success as part of the 2017 Cannes Film Festival’s ‘Un Certain Regard’ program. The president of the screening, Thierry Fremaux, even said that Closeness represented a “revival of the film industry” in Russia. Fremaux, of course, was exaggerating a bit, as many good films had been shot in Russia before 2017, but his reaction can be understood. Closeness is shot in a genuinely new Russian film style, the search for which has long been discussed by many film critics. Balagov’s second film, Beanpole, was already a much-anticipated event and, naturally, became one of the best Russian films of 2019. The picture tells the story of a friendship between two women in post-war Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) in 1945. The first thing that catches your eye is the maximum respect given to frontline soldiers. The war has just ended. The siege of Leningrad had been broken just a year and a half before. People in the city are still suffering from huge spiritual trauma but trying to start a new life in peacetime, which seemed completely unattainable not so long ago. But with all this, Balagov did not fear vivid visualization. Beanpole has a distinctive palette that cannot be confused with that of any other movie. The delicate balancing of the semantic load, the narrative’s difficult subject, and the most beautiful video sequence is the film’s main attraction. In 2020, former US President Barack Obama even included Beanpole in his annual list of best pictures. It is not surprising that after such success, Balagov was invited to the USA to shoot the pilot of the series The Last of Us, which is based on the Sony video game of the same name. Where to watch Closeness: Amazon Prime, KanopyWhere to watch Beanpole: Amazon Prime, Kanopy Kirill Serebrennikov launched his filmmaking career back in the 1990s though his major breakthrough came after “Playing the Victim” was released in 2006. The monologue about Russian football delivered by Vitaly Khaev’s character quickly became a source of popular quotes. Since then, Serebrennikov has turned into a popular theater director, has made more movies, and has become the creative force behind a trendy Moscow venue. Two of his more recent films, “Summer” and “Petrov’s Flu,” are an important achievement in his career. “Summer” is a biopic dedicated to the Leningrad underground rock scene in the early 1980s and, more specifically, to Viktor Tsoi, the frontman of Kino and one of Russia’s most iconic musicians, who died in a tragic accident on August 15, 1990, at the age of 28. Just eight years had passed since his first album was released, but those years had made Tsoi a true legend. Even today, his fans gather in the center of Russia’s biggest cities to mark important dates in his life by singing his songs and celebrating his legacy. While being fully aware of the singer’s tragic fate, Serebrennikov made a movie brimming with optimism, even though every viewer knows where and when the main protagonist’s story will come to an end. “Petrov’s Flu” transports its viewers to Yekaterinburg in the 1990s following the Petrov family, who come down with the flu as the country is going through a tumultuous period after the collapse of the USSR. This multilayered film uses magic realism to create, quite counterintuitively, an authentic depiction of the times. Suffering from the flu, the characters sometimes have trouble telling reality from feverish hallucinations, and this approach, teetering on the brink of surrealism, may well be the most accurate depiction of 1990s Russia. Where to watch “Summer”: Kanopy Yuri Bykov burst onto the movie scene in 2013 with “The Major.” The director succeeded in making the tragic story of a police officer who tries to hide a crime he committed really relatable. In 2018, Netflix released “Seven Seconds,” a miniseries based on “The Major’s” plot, which enjoyed a positive critical reception and allowed Regina King to win an Emmy award as an outstanding lead actress. Nearly all of Bykov’s movies focus on “the ordinary man,” a well-known phrase for any Soviet or Russian school student, who will have heard it many times in literature classes covering 19th century Russian literature. And it’s true that Bykov’s creativity is deeply rooted in Russian culture, as he manages to give very convincing cinematic expressions of Russia’s trademark brand of melancholy, sense of doom, and fatalism. By putting traditional themes in the context of the country’s present-day realities, however, Bykov has reinvented the language of Russian cinematography. His work is geared towards a younger audience but resonates well with lovers of classical literature. “The Fool” follows a plumber’s struggle against bureaucracy and small-town corruption. “Guard” reminds us that warring criminal gangs are still around, if you just look outside the major cities. These topics have a universal appeal for almost anyone on this planet. Everywhere you have people abusing power, however limited, you have criminals, and you have everyday problems which you often cannot resolve, so you just have to accept reality and get on with your life as best you can. “The Method,” an expensive police crime drama, stands out from the rest of Bykov’s work. It tells the story of a unique detective who uses a mysterious method to catch the most elusive and dangerous serial killers. “The Method,” which at the time of its release in 2015 had very little competition in Russia, foreshadowed the era of high-quality Russian TV shows. Where to watch “The Major”: Amazon Prime (you might also like the American remake “Seven Seconds” on Netflix)Where to watch “The Fool”: iTunesWhere to watch “Guard”: NetflixWhere to watch “The Method”: Netflix With HBO premiering “The Wire” in 2002, a success later followed by “Lost” and “Mad Men,” the TV series boom in Hollywood predated the golden age of Russian shows by a decade. Bykov’s “The Method” demonstrated that a TV drama in the world's largest country could be intelligent and beautifully shot. A major boost for the quality of Russian shows was the rapid emergence of Russian streaming services, which put fewer constraints on directors’ creativity than typical producers of movies shot for the silver screen. Boris Khlebnikov followed his hugely successful 2017 drama “Arrhythmia” with “An Ordinary Woman,” a TV series starring Anna Mikhalkova. The protagonist appears to be a simple person, who owns a small flower shop, raises two kids, and takes care of her husband, a surgeon. Soon enough, however, we find out that all this is a cover for her prostitution racket. The show was a revelation both for audiences and critics. A bold idea and an unusual take on dealing with social issues have made “An Ordinary Woman” one of the most prominent achievements of Russia’s TV series industry until this day. “To the Lake” is a major post-apocalyptic thriller about a group of people who are trying to survive a terrible plague which turns everyone into zombie-like creatures. Released towards the end of 2019, shortly before the coronavirus pandemic, the series quickly became a meme, first in Russia, then everywhere else after Netflix bought the first season. November 2020 saw the premiere of “Dead Mountain,” the most unorthodox Russian show yet in terms of both form and content. Released on a streaming platform, the series was a sensation. It masterfully balances two parallel narratives – one about the death of young tourists in the mountains and the other about the investigation of the incident. The execution of the first story line is immaculate. The director used angles and lighting typical of the late 1950s and early 1960s to transport audiences back in time in a veritable time machine. “Central Russia’s Vampires” is another brilliant attempt at trying to uncover Russia’s true identity. The movie is a dazzling mixture of sci-fi, mysticism, comedy, everyday life, love drama, and even a quest for the human soul. While at first you may be tempted to see “Central Russia’s Vampires” as a tribute to Taika Waititi’s “What We Do in the Shadows,” this feeling quickly goes away after the show takes quite a different turn. The story arc is built around a family of vampires who have been living in the Russian city of Smolensk for hundreds of years. The patriarch, who has been around since the Middle Ages, has been adding family members by converting people who were facing imminent death into bloodsuckers. The appeal of the show is in small details such as the characters’ personal traits, gestures, and seemingly inconsequential remarks. The important and popular idea behind “Central Russia’s Vampires” is that what makes us human is how we act, so that a vampire may be more humane. Another key concept is the love for the place we’re from. Given their vast experience and longevity, these ancient creatures could have easily become billionaires and moved to Moscow to enjoy a fancier lifestyle, yet they choose to reside in a humble house in Smolensk because they really enjoy the connection to their hometown. Last year, 153 Russian movies were released – a significant achievement for a country where 15 or 20 films per year would have been a lot 20 years ago. The Russian movie industry is experiencing a renaissance, which has seen the arrival of new writers and directors and the release of many series made by budding filmmakers. All in all, there is healthy competition. The films mentioned in this article are just a handful of Russia’s cinematic offerings, and many more original creations deserving of the highest respect can be found if you do a little research."
2022-08-27,https://www.rt.com/news/561644-medvedev-nuclear-weapons-ukraine/,Ex-Russian president names condition for using nukes,"Moscow would only resort to nuclear weapons in four scenarios, all of which present an existential threat to the Russian state, former president Dmitry Medvedev told French media on Friday. Speaking to the TV channel LCI, Medvedev was asked whether Russia’s military doctrine allows for using tactical nuclear weapons. The former president responded that Moscow’s nuclear posture has been made public, and there is nothing secret about it. “There are four reasons for the use of nuclear weapons. For the sake of interest and for the French public, I will name them: the launch of nuclear missiles, the use of nuclear weapons, attacks on critical infrastructure that controls nuclear weapons, or other actions that threaten the existence of the [Russian] state,” he said, adding that none of the above has happened so far. Commenting on the possible use of tactical atomic weapons, or arms containing depleted uranium, the former president noted that Russia has never put those into action, unlike some Western countries. “Over the past 20-30 years, the NATO states have used them quite actively both in Yugoslavia and Iraq. There is some uncertainty around this topic, with very tragic consequences. So, in this sense, we must first look at what Western countries have done in certain situations,” Medvedev said. The former president stressed that Russia’s response “will be consistent with the size of the threats this country is facing,” and that Moscow’s military offensive in Ukraine, which started in late February, is a defensive measure. According to Medvedev, one of the reasons for the attack was a statement by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who said at one point that Kiev does not rule out restoring its nuclear potential. “Apparently, he wanted to scare us, but in the end he created an even heavier atmosphere, which ultimately forced the Russian Federation to launch a special military operation,” he said. Last week, Ivan Nechaev, deputy press secretary of the Russian Foreign Ministry, stated that Moscow has no need to use a nuclear option in Ukraine, and that Russia is a responsible nuclear power, which will only use its atomic arsenal if its very existence is under threat."
2022-08-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/561637-un-us-nuclear-talks/,UN comments on US-Russia nuclear arms talks,"Russia and the United States need to resume talks on replacing the landmark New START nuclear arms reduction treaty, a senior United Nations official said on Friday. Speaking at the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), Izumi Nakamitsu, UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, was asked when she thinks Moscow and Washington should start negotiating a potential successor to New START. “I think as soon as possible,” she said, stressing that the treaty, which sets limits on the US and Russian nuclear arsenals, must be replaced before the 2026 expiry date. “Otherwise, the world will have no restraints, and we’re saying that this will be a very dangerous situation,” Nakamitsu added. The UN believes that both Russia and the US have no objections to negotiating a successor to New START. “We’ve been calling on both parties to resume their engagement as soon as possible,” the official noted. The UN official’s comments come after Andrey Belousov, the deputy Russian representative to the UN and other international organizations in Geneva, revealed on Thursday that US-Russia contacts on strategic arms reduction have not been interrupted. However, US Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Bonnie Jenkins said further discussions on the New START treaty were not yet taking place. “Discussions between the US and Russia about the next steps in relation to the New START treaty are not happening right now because of the situation we're dealing with. And these talks will continue in the future when the situation for that is right,” she noted. In early August, US President Joe Biden claimed that Washington was ready to negotiate “a new arms control framework to replace New START when it expires.” Following this statement, however, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that no proposals on the matter had been made by the US."
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561625-amnesty-warning-donbass-trial/,Amnesty issues warning about Donbass tribunal,"Amnesty International is against putting Ukrainian POWs on trial for alleged war crimes, insisting that Russia and Donbass are in no position to do so. Describing the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics as “Russian-backed armed groups,” the organization called the upcoming tribunals “illegal and abusive.” The organization also blasted the decision to set up the trials in the city of Mariupol, captured by Russian and Donbass forces during the ongoing conflict, saying it was “a further act of cruelty against a city.” “Any attempts by Russian authorities to try Ukrainian prisoners of war in so-called ‘international tribunals’ set up by armed groups under Russia’s effective control in Mariupol are illegal and unacceptable,” Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Marie Struthers, said in a statement on Friday. The remarks echoed those recently made by top Ukrainian officials, including Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who threatened to cut any potential negotiations with Russia should Ukrainian POWs, primarily fighters of the notorious neo-Nazi Azov regiment, be placed on a “show trial.” “If this despicable show trial takes place … This will be the line beyond which any negotiations are impossible. Russia will cut itself off from any negotiations,” Zelensky said in a video address on Monday. Zelensky’s call, however, has been promptly snubbed by top Russian and Donbass officials, with the head of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, stating such threats will have “no effect” on the tribunal plans. “The data on 80 counts of crimes committed by the Azov has been collected, 23 people have been arrested and are in custody,” Pushilin stated. Russian Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin issued a darker warning in response to Zelensky’s threats, suggesting the public hearings will expose Kiev’s crimes, which is why the Ukrainian president rightfully fears them. “He and the Kiev regime have reasons to be afraid,” Volodin said. “He and his inner circle ordered to bomb, shoot and kill peaceful citizens: the elderly, women, children. That is why Zelensky is doing everything to prevent the tribunal.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561627-un-ukraine-resolution-support/,Only one in three UN members back new anti-Russia resolution,"Ukraine’s latest proposal to condemn Russia has attracted the backing of just 58 out of 193 UN member states, a far cry from the number that symbolically supported Kiev in the General Assembly in March. Kiev’s envoy to the UN Sergey Kislitsa heralded the proposed resolution on Wednesday, following the Security Council meeting convened on Ukraine’s independence day. The session featured a video address by President Vladimir Zelensky, for which the council had to override protocol requiring in-person appearances, and a series of statements by Western governments denouncing Russia. Moscow’s envoy Vassily Nebenzia provided the counterpoint by introducing evidence of Ukrainian atrocities into the record and even naming Kiev’s western backers as accomplices in specific instances. Kislitsa’s resolution also fell short of the support Kiev had back in March, right after the start of the Russian military operation. At the March 2 General Assembly session,141 member countries – or 73% of the UN – voted for a nonbinding resolution to condemn Moscow. This week, however, that support stood at 30%, with no African, Persian Gulf or BRICS countries on board – and only two Latin American governments, Colombia and Guatemala, standing with Ukraine."
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561624-explosion-police-chief-killed/,Blast kills police chief in southeastern Ukraine,"Deputy commander of local traffic police, Alexander Kolesnikov, was killed in an explosion in the southern Ukrainian city of Berdyansk on Friday. The city was seized by Russian forces early in the ongoing conflict and has remained under their control ever since. The blast occurred at a local holiday house, which is currently used to accommodate temporarily displaced people and refugees, primarily from Mariupol, local mayor, Alexander Saulenko, has said. The explosive device, filled with pre-made shrapnel, was affixed to a tree some three meters above ground, he added. Kolesnikov’s service vehicle was in the blast zone, while shrapnel also pelted a playground nearby. “During the explosion, miraculously, there was no one on the playground where children could play and be, none of the children were injured,” Saulenko said, blaming the incident on Ukrainian authorities. “There is a Ukrainian trace of the Kiev terrorist regime, which is trying to fight the peaceful population in such fashion, which indicates that they do not think about the victims among children and civilians,” the mayor said. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561618-orthodox-church-exorcism-rules/,Russian church to ‘streamline’ exorcisms,"The Russian Orthodox Church has finalized a draft of rules to regulate the practice of exorcism, in the making since 2021. If the draft becomes part of canon law, banishing demons will be a free service, and only priests and bishops will be allowed to practice it, to prevent abuses. Exorcism can be performed “only in cases of demonic possession,” and not for persons with mental disorders or diseases or those who “feign possession,” says the draft document, published on Thursday on the website of the Moscow Patriarchate. The clergy are instructed to become familiar with basic psychiatry so they can make the appropriate judgment. “The performer of the rite of exorcism can only be a bishop, or a priest who has received the blessing of the ruling bishop for this,” the document adds. “The Church expects a high spiritual life from the performer of an exorcism. Neither the exorcist nor his hierarchs should expect payments for performing the rite.” Instructions for the rite itself take up two pages of the seven-page document, while the rest is dedicated to explaining the Russian Orthodox Church’s position on exorcism, a historical examination of the practice both in Russia and other Orthodox nations, and problems associated with exorcism. The draft has been published to solicit public comment, with the commenting period open through the end of October 2022. The church previously said the hierarchs have spent close to three years working on the document. Its necessity was explained by the fact that sometimes “sick people are subjected to humiliation or psychological violence” during mass “cleansings” captured on video, which then result in “false possession” reports and “mass hysteria.” In late 2020, church spokesman Bishop Hilarion of Volokolamsk said that believers should not perform exorcisms by themselves. At least two exorcism-related deaths have been reported over the previous decade. A nine-year-old boy was gagged and whipped during a 2019 ritual, and choked to death. In 2011, a 25-year-old woman in Voronezh also died after her parents attempted to exorcize her. Orthodoxy is one of the four officially recognized religions in Russia, followed by Islam, Buddhism and Judaism. Around half of Russia’s population identify as Orthodox faithful."
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561609-nuclear-plant-shelled-again/,Artillery hits Zaporozhye nuclear dump,"Four artillery projectiles fired from Ukrainian positions struck the fuel storage site of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant on Friday, authorities in the Russian-controlled city of Energodar claimed. They added that radiation levels remain normal, suggesting that they inflicted no damage. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant was seized by Russian troops in early March, soon after Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine. Since then, Russian National Guard and specialist troops have been guarding the site, while the Ukrainian staff continued operations. Russian and local officials have accused Ukrainian forces of repeatedly attacking the Zaporozhye NPP with drones, artillery and even US-supplied weapons. Kiev has rejected the accusations and claimed Russia was using the facility as a military base and shelling its own troops to make Ukraine look bad. On Thursday, shelling started a wildfire south of Energodar and forced a shutdown of the power plant to prevent a meltdown. While the reactor building is designed to withstand a lot, the plant’s support systems are far more vulnerable. The area where hundreds of barrels of spent fuel are stored is particularly problematic, as any breach could lead to a radioactive release. Russian ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia has shown evidence of Ukrainian culpability in the shelling to the Security Council, including naming the units involved and giving their precise location. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday he personally intended to lead a mission to inspect the Zaporozhye NPP “within days.” Moscow has repeatedly called on the IAEA to come inspect the facility, but the mission has been delayed by Ukraine’s insistence the inspectors must travel through Kiev. The Ukrainian government and its Western backers have accused Russia of a plot to “steal Ukrainian electricity” and demanded Moscow hand the Zaporozhye plant back to Kiev’s control, or set up a 30-kilometer (18-mile) demilitarized zone around it. Moscow has rejected the demands as unacceptable."
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561608-ukraine-drones-gift-taiwan/,Taiwan delivers 'gift' to Ukraine – Bild,"Ukraine received a gift of 800 drones to mark its independence day this week, which are designed to fly over targets and drop mortar shells on them, German tabloid Bild has reported. The present came from Taiwan, the newspaper said on its Russian-language social media on Thursday. The claim was widely repeated in Ukrainian media. The drones are made by the Taiwan-based firm DronesVision, which also makes anti-drone equipment. The Revolver model is a quadcopter design that carries a package of eight 60mm mortar shells weighing over 10kg, which can be released by the operator, according to the producer. The package looks like the rotating barrel of a revolver, giving the weapon its name. This kind of delivery system was developed and widely used by militant groups in Syria, who modified commercial drones to drop explosives. Some Ukrainian troops and their opponents from the Russia-allied militias of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics militarized simple drones in the same way amid the ongoing conflict."
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561595-ukraine-de-russification-danger-risks/,Ukraine may come to regret 'de-Russification'– Politico,"Eradicating Russian linguistic and cultural influence amid the ongoing conflict is understandable but risks future trouble for Ukraine, as it will not only “give fodder to Kremlin propagandists” but also will make it harder for Ukrainians to live together peacefully, Politico has claimed. “Ukrainians’ firmer sense of nationhood and identity, fueled by fury at what is befalling them, risks becoming less inclusive and more Russian-hating,” Jamie Dettmer, opinion editor at Politico Europe, wrote in a piece published Friday. While blaming Moscow for “laying the groundwork” for what could become a long-running “ethnic conflict,” the author admits that de-Russification in Ukraine needs a “cool-headed examination.” “The process of removing Russian cultural and linguistic influence from the country is not an easy – or necessarily equitable – thing to do, when around a quarter of Ukrainians still identify as Russian speakers,” Dettmer, who previously worked as foreign and war correspondent for Voice of America, pointed out. This process – that had often merged with de-communization – started well before Russia launched its military operation in late February, the author noted. Back in 2015, for instance, Kiev banned Soviet symbols, including flags, street names and monuments commemorating Communist leaders. Since 2016, Dettmer wrote, all information on notice boards at railway stations and airports could only be given in Ukrainian and English but not in Russian. In January this year, the Politico editor recalled, Human Rights Watch raised concerns about “the lack of protections” for Russian speakers after a new law on language entered into force. The legislation, he explained, required media outlets registered in Ukraine to publish only in the Ukrainian language “or to provide an accompanying Ukrainian version, or equivalent in content, volume and method of print, when publishing in another language.” However, while exceptions were made for other minority languages, none were provided for Russian, Dettmer explained. According to the journalist, there are “risks in rejecting all things Russian.” First, he stated, it “gives fodder to Kremlin propagandists.” And, second, “aggressive de-Russification will make it even harder for all Ukrainians, regardless of their traditions and pasts, to reconcile and live together peaceably,” he claimed."
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561592-us-embassy-drunken-guard/,Russia releases video of ‘drunk’ US embassy worker,"Russia’s foreign ministry has, in jest, advised the US Department of State to remunerate more generously its staff working in Moscow, for their tough working conditions. The suggestion is accompanied by a video apparently depicting a drunken US embassy employee trying to make it to his work early in the morning. On Thursday, the ministry published a post on its Telegram channel reading: “We call on the US Department of State to raise the pay for the employees of the American embassy in Moscow for unbearable working conditions.” The message went on to suggest that “fighting us is a tiring activity.” Accompanying the ‘advice’ is a three-minute-long video clip, which features CCTV footage apparently captured early in the morning on July 10 this year in the vicinity of the US embassy in Moscow. It starts out with a caption reading “An employee of the US Embassy in Moscow is fighting the Regime… as hard as he can.” The clip then shows a man staggering across a street and then along a sidewalk, with a gait resembling that of an intoxicated person. At one point, the man tumbles to the ground, struggling for some time to get up again. The man is then seen entering the diplomatic mission’s grounds, the back of his shirt visibly wet and dirty after his fall. The video goes on to show the man attempting to open a door, though without much success. Eventually a policeman comes to his rescue. The two are seen talking, then the man shows what looks like an ID card and walks away from the door. The clip ends by quoting a Washington Post article dated December 3, 2021, saying: “The embassy is so shorthanded that many staff have had to take on extra jobs. U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan, for example, learned how to mix solutions to clean the restrooms and also how to work a floor buffer…” According to Russian media, the man in the video is an embassy guard, US marine Navarro Nicholas Stormy. The US government has accused Moscow of effectively paralyzing its embassy’s work by expelling most of its staff. Russia, in turn, insists the expulsions were ordered in response to Washington booting out Russian diplomats."
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561594-belarus-warplanes-nuclear-weapons/,Belarus delivers on nuke promise to Putin – Lukashenko,"Belarus has finished preparing some of its military aircraft for the possible deployment of Russian nuclear weapons, President Alexander Lukashenko revealed on Friday. “You remember [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and I said we will modify Belarusian Su jets so that they could carry nuclear weapons. Did you think we were blabbing? It’s all done!” he said, as quoted by national news agency Belta. The remark came as he was discussing NATO’s military deployments near Belarus’ borders. Lukashenko was referring to his meeting with the Russian president in late June, during which the Belarusian leader shared concerns over Poland’s requests for the US to deploy American tactical nuclear weapons on its soil. The Poles “are training to deploy nuclear warheads. Could you please at least help us modify warplanes that we have… so that they could carry nuclear weapons,” he said at the time. He later estimated that the necessary modifications could be complete within a couple of months. The US has been training non-nuclear NATO members like Poland how to use its tactical nuclear weapons for decades. Moscow has long called such exercises a violation of Washington’s non-proliferation commitments, which the US has denied. During the meeting with Lukashenko in June, Putin offered help to modernize Belarusian warplanes at Russian military factories, and to train its pilots to alleviate Minsk’s concerns about NATO."
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/560965-ukrainian-mirotvorets-website/,'Peacemaker' of death: This Ukrainian website threatens hundreds of thousands with extrajudicial killings — some are Americans,"For the last eight years, a group of publicly unknown activists in Ukraine have been compiling lists of ‘enemies of the people’ with impunity. Hundreds of thousands have been declared criminals without trial. Among them are not only Russian citizens, but also Ukrainian opposition figures and bloggers, European politicians, and US citizens. At the very least, being added to this list is a stigma that makes life difficult in Ukraine, but it can also serve as justification for imprisonment or, in some cases, even being killed. This is exactly what happened last weekend to Daria Dugina, daughter of world-famous Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin, who’s name also can be found on that list. RT explains what is behind the Mirotvorets, or ‘Peacemaker’, website, whose creators seek to bring ‘peace’ to their country with the help of extrajudicial killings, and why the Ukrainian authorities have done nothing about this despite condemnation from the international community. The main page of the Ukrainian Mirotvorets website proclaims that the outlet represents a ‘Center for Research of Signs of Crimes against the National Security of Ukraine, Peace, Humanity, and the International Law’. It claims to have been created by a group of academics, journalists, and other specialists. However, their names are known to no one, and the outfit itself has never even been officially registered in Ukraine. Nevertheless, this organization has been in operation for nine years, since August 2014. And although it positions itself as “independent, non-state media,” government officials still had a hand in its creation. In fact, the website emerged at the initiative of Anton Gerashchenko, a former adviser to the Ukrainian minister of internal affairs. Mirotvorets’ activities boil down to publishing personal information on people who the site’s administrators consider a threat, in one way or another, to Ukrainian statehood. The site’s owners urge the country’s law enforcement agencies to take note of the personal data and activities of the people it lists. However, street radicals sometimes also take heed of Mirotvorets’ lists. And every time someone unlucky enough to have had his or her home address or other personal data revealed turns up dead, the site is updated: the name of the deceased now appears in bright flickering letters reminiscent of a Las Vegas casino, and the person’s photo is crossed out with the callous inscription: ‘liquidated’. For example, the current Mirotvorets’ web page design displays this way the data of the Russian journalist Darya Dugina, daughter of the philosopher Aleksandr, who was brutally killed last weekend in her own car. Despite the accusations from the Russian FSB, Ukraine denies any involvement in that murder. On Mirotvorets, however, Dugina’s death is described with a brief, dehumanizing commentary, along with a conspiracy theory: “Liquidated by the special services of fascist russia (sic) due to interspecies disagreements.” According to the site’s administrators, “the sources of information used by the Mirotvorets Center for ongoing academic research are publicly available materials that are printed and posted on social networks, web publications, private web pages, and specialized forums and blogs, as well as radio and TV broadcasts.” However, it’s not that simple. In 2017, the site launched its IDentigraF facial recognition system, which was funded by donors from 40 countries, according to the center’s editorial board. This database contains more than 2 million images of “persons who have committed crimes against Ukraine and its citizens.” In addition, up until 2016, the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), and other law enforcement agencies in the country were among Mirotvorets’ partners. One can’t help but conclude that the personal information of the people who ended up in ‘Purgatory’ – a section of the site where personal information, including addresses, phone numbers, and documents, is published – were not obtained solely from social networks and newspapers. As of 2019, when the latest Mirotvorets report was published, the site contained data on “more than 30,000 Russian war criminals”, “more than 70,000 terrorists, militants, mercenaries, members of illegal armed formations and private armies controlled by the Russian aggressor”, “about 40,000 flagrant violators of Ukraine’s national borders”, “more than 44,000 traitors to the Motherland”, “more than 6,000 anti-Ukrainian propagandists”, etc. In total, nearly 200,000 people have been declared ‘criminals’ over the five years. However, these figures are far from complete since the site continues to collect personal information on a daily basis. Recently, participants in Russia’s Special Military Operation to demilitarize Ukraine, as well as Russian politicians, have been added to the list – although to an insufficient extent, according to the website’s creators, who support the official government in Kiev. Mirotvorets’ creators claim that the center “carries out its activities in strict accordance with the current legislation of Ukraine and international legal acts ratified by our state.” As an example, they refer to Article 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine, which obliges citizens to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. In legally justifying its activities, Mirotvorets refers to laws on information, terrorism, and privacy, as well as the ‘Convention on the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automated Processing of Personal Data’ adopted in 1981. However, the articles cited in the above-mentioned pieces of legislation have been chosen very selectively, with an emphasis on “protecting the security of the state.” Legally speaking, the Mirotvorets’ approach is very controversial. First of all, one of the basic principles of justice is the presumption of innocence, which is reflected, in particular, in the Council of Europe’s ‘Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms’. Among the crimes for which Mirotvorets collects data are “impingement on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”, being a “traitor to the Motherland”, “aiding militants and terrorists”, disseminating “war propaganda”, “inciting ethnic hatred, fascism, or anti-Semitism,” etc., which are included in the Criminal Code of Ukraine. However, only a court can find a person guilty of such acts, whereas Mirotvorets has no such authority. Mirotvorets not only accuses people of committing ‘crimes’ but also includes more abstract offenses in its lists, such as producing “anti-Ukrainian propaganda” and “participating in anti-Ukrainian propaganda events.” The list even has a section for “agents of influence of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine.” However, such areas are regulated by articles 9-11 of the ‘European Convention on Human Rights’, which concern freedom of expression, conscience, religion, thought, assembly, and association. The Mirotvorets center’s administrators are essentially seeking to deprive people whose opinions and beliefs do not suit them of their right to expression. In addition, in the site’s ‘On Interaction and Cooperation with the Center’ section, there is a sample form for reporting personal information on ‘criminals’ and their relatives, which includes fields for addresses, phone numbers, photos, links to social network profiles, and their ‘crime’ (i.e., categorization as ‘militant’ or ‘terrorist’), all without trial or investigation. The ‘criminals’ on public display, along with their wives, children, and parents, don’t even know they’re in ‘Purgatory’, let alone given a chance to defend themselves or cross-examine witnesses and confront their accusers. As long as Mirotvorets was limiting itself to publishing information on Ukrainian citizens living in Crimea and Donbass, Ukrainian opposition politicians and journalists, and Russian residents and officials, the odious organization went unnoticed in the ‘civilized world’. But a scandal erupted in 2016, when Mirotvorets published information on employees of a host of media outlets, including the BBC, Reuters, Al Jazeera, AFP, Le Monde, the Guardian, Le Figaro, France 24, El Mundo, CBS News, CNN, Sky News, The Daily Telegraph, The Times, Cheska Televize, Radio France, Channel 9 Australia, the Associated Press, Japan TV, the Daily Mail, Die Welt, the Washington Post and New York Times, as well as representatives of Human Rights Watch and many other organizations, for “cooperating with a terrorist organization"" (i.e., the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics). US State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau noted at the time that the US was “very concerned about the hacking of a database and publication of personal information about journalists in combat areas.” “It is simply unacceptable for journalists to be threatened for what they say or write. Governments should do everything possible to ensure the safety of journalists. A wave of online threats against journalists worsens the situation,” said Dunja Mijatovic, OSCE representative on Freedom of the Media. In addition to journalists and human rights defenders, politicians have also made it into Mirotvorets’ database. The website published information on German Bundestag deputies who visited Crimea, a list that includes Evgeny Schmidt, Rainer Balzer, Gunar Lindeman, Harold Latch, Nick Vogel, Helmut Seifen, and Blakes Christian. Ten US citizens, as well as French actor Samy Naceri, were relegated to ‘Purgatory’ for the same ‘offense’. According to the website, the Greek ‘enemies of Ukraine’ include former Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, cartoonist Stathis Stavropoulos, retired Air Force Lieutenant General Pavlos Hristou, and ‘Russian Athens’ editor Pavel Onoiko. While former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras also visited Crimea, he was removed from the database after expressing support for Petro Poroshenko. Top-tier politicians are also represented in Mirotvorets’ lists. Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder can be found there, while Croatian President Zoran Milanovic and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban have also been recently added, as has authoritative American diplomat Henry Kissinger. Inclusion in the Mirotvorets list has been used as a justification for threats directed not only against ordinary citizens and journalists, but politicians as well. As the infamous and recently recalled Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnyk, wrote, ""an irresponsible trip of several would-be deputies can carry very, very unfortunate legal consequences for them. It is a pity that our warnings are still not taken seriously. Well, we’ll see.” In turn, Benjamin Moreau, deputy head of the UN’s human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, stressed that the problem is moving from a purely legal to a practical one: some banks refuse to issue loans to persons included in the Mirotvorets database. The uproar involving the murders of opposition politician Oleg Kalashnikov and journalist Olesya Buzina after their addresses were published in the Mirotvorets database is widely known. Of course, the word ‘after’ does not necessarily mean ‘due to’, but the creators of the notorious center played along. In commenting on these murders, they wrote: “Agent 404 has distinguished himself again. He has been granted a short-term leave for the successful completion of today’s combat mission.” There have been repeated demands to shut down the website. In 2018, Germany joined the chorus of journalists and human rights activists protesting Gerhard Schroeder’s inclusion in the database. According to the Cabinet of Ministers, “the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany most definitely condemns Mirotvorets and demands that the Ukrainian government and authorities assist in its removal.” In February of 2021, the European Parliament approved a resolution stating: “The EP regrets that the political climate in the country has deteriorated when intimidation, hate speech and political pressure are widely used for political purposes; urges the authorities to strongly condemn and ban the activities of extremist and hateful groups and websites, such as Mirotvorets, which create tension in society and misuse the personal data of hundreds of people, including journalists, politicians and members of minority groups.” But so far, calls for the closure of Mirotvorets have, in fact, been limited to a chorus of journalists, human rights defenders, and parliamentarians, who lack the power to make legally binding decisions with respect to Ukraine. This issue is not included among the list of requirements put forth by the Council of Europe or the European Commission that Kiev must fulfil in order to implement the EU Association Agreement. Allocation of European and American assistance to Ukraine for carrying out reforms has not been made contingent on closing down Mirotvorets, nor have measures been taken to pressure the Kiev authorities to respect privacy and the presumption of innocence. With the Western authorities turning a blind eye, the Ukrainian government has been able to ignore the activities of the scandalous site and dismiss demands from international human rights defenders by coming up with various pretenses. For example, in response to demands by the UN for it to be shut down, Dmitry Razumkov, the ex-speaker of Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, said that the Rada does not have the authority to close media outlets. Nevertheless, when the Ukrainian authorities want to shut down certain media outlets, they do not hesitate to do so. For example, the National Security and Defense Council granted Zelensky the ability to close the 112 Ukraine, NewsOne, and ZIK opposition TV channels, and subsequently First Independent and UKRLIVE, as well as an online publication called Strana, among other media outlets. The Mirotvorets site is still up and continually updated with new data to this day."
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561566-pope-killing-russian-journalist/,Not even Pope Francis is safe from Kiev's wrath: Holy Father is latest subject of Ukraine’s fiery judgment,"After mentioning the death of Darya Dugina, a young Russian journalist and political activist, Pope Francis has faced the anger of Kiev, which apparently thinks it has the monopoly on “innocence.” For the past six months, Kiev has lashed out at various government leaders and international organizations, like Amnesty International, for example, which reported on Ukraine’s violations of international law on the battlefield. So it was just a matter of time before the Catholic Church got an earful, too. And that’s what happened this week when Pope Francis, addressing a congregation in the Vatican, mentionegd the death of Darya Dugina, whose life was cut tragically short by a car bombing. But before uttering the name of the deceased Russian woman, the Pope acknowledged the innocent victims on both sides of the conflict. “Whether they are Ukrainians or Russians … I think of so much cruelty, of the many innocents who are paying for the madness, the madness of all sides because war is madness,” Pope Francis told his flock. “I think of the poor girl (Darya Dugina) who was blown up by a bomb under her car seat in Moscow. The innocent pay for the war.” That seems to be a fair assessment of the horrors of warfare that few could find fault with. While government leaders are ultimately responsible for leading their people into the “madness of war,” it is the “innocent” people – from soldiers on the frontlines to civilians back home – who suffer the brunt of the consequences. Yet, like a true politician, Ukraine’s Vatican ambassador Andrey Yurash politicized the Pope’s words, saying it was impossible to call Dugina “innocent” when she – together with her prominent father, the political philosopher Aleksandr Dugin – advocated on behalf of Moscow’s special military operation in Ukraine. Today’s speech ofPope was disappointing& made me think about many things: can’t speak inSame categories aboutАggressor &Victim, Rapist and Raped; howPossible To Mention 1of ideologists of🇷🇺ImperialismAs innocent victim?She wasKilledBy russiansAsSacredVictim &isNowOn Shield ofWar pic.twitter.com/GvvM7zJDCa There are several problems with Yurash’s peculiar brand of moralizing, the first one being that he, much like the Western world in general, conveniently fast-forwarded past eight years of bloodshed in Donbass that has caused millions of people – not just “political ideologues” – to support Russia’s intervention in eastern Ukraine in the first place. I’m not sure what Mr. Yurash was tweeting about in 2014, but somehow I doubt it had anything to do with the unprovoked attacks on Russian speakers in Donbass that have killed thousands. Second, it was telling how the Pope’s use of the word “innocent” when applied to Darya Dugina triggered such a powerful response from someone who calls himself a diplomat. What’s more, in his tweet, Yurash went on to apparently insinuate that it was the Russians themselves that killed her in order to make her a martyr. In any case, perhaps the diplomat’s response was to be expected since, as the anti-Russian narrative goes, there are no ‘innocent Russians’ to be found on the planet. They are simply extinct, and in fact may have never existed in the first place. Simply being Russian means guilt through association, that is, association with oneself. Just ask Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas who, in an effort to spare the European continent from those treacherous Russian tourists, is calling for a full visa ban to mitigate the “security threat.” In fact, all things considered, it was akin to a miracle to hear Pope Francis, the main religious leader of the Western world, not only mention Dugina’s assassination, but to go so far as to call a Russian citizen “innocent.” The entire world should seriously heed the Pope’s words, which I believe were spoken quite deliberately. The Bishop of Rome may have his faults, but he has been one of the few voices of reason throughout the last six months of “madness.” In June, Pope Francis challenged the Western narrative that says Russia is to blame for the hostilities in Ukraine, full stop. He did this by alluding to a conversation he had with a “very wise man” who he declined to name. This person told him: “They [NATO] are barking at the gates of Russia. They don’t understand that the Russians … can’t have any foreign power getting close to them.” The individual continued: “We do not see the whole drama unfolding behind this war, which was … either provoked or not prevented.” What lessons can we take away from this? Perhaps the most applicable one comes straight from Holy Scripture, which says, ‘May he who is without sin cast the first stone’. Those words should silence many people on both sides of the conflict."
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/news/561589-us-weapons-watchdog-ukraine/,Pentagon watchdog doubtful Kiev tracks US weapons,"The Pentagon’s acting Inspector General Sean O’Donnell told Bloomberg on Thursday that his office will test the effectiveness of the system that tracks US weapons shipped to Ukraine as part of the Defense Department’s multi-billion dollar military assistance program. “As far as we can tell, right now, everything that is supposed to shoot and go boom, they are using every bit of it,” the official said, adding that the system needs to be double-checked as the Ukrainians use “hand receipts” to trace supplied arms. “I don’t think they have much fidelity” as to where it ends up, O’Donnell said. The IG’s office will be looking into the weapons shipments to ensure that they are not being diverted to the black market, according to the report. Concerns over such risks have been voiced by various European and international law enforcement agencies, following evidence that at least some easier-to-smuggle Western arms have ended up in the hands of gunrunners offering them to clients online. American and Ukrainian officials have given assurances that all Western weapons sent to Kiev are traced and used as intended to fight Russia. Reports to the contrary tend to be harshly criticized by Kiev and its allies. CBS News this month agreed to remake a documentary about corruption in Ukraine and how it affects foreign aid. The film originally featured remarks by the founder of an organization that has been sending various items to Ukrainian soldiers for years. He said getting equipment to the frontline in Ukraine required navigating a network of “power lords, oligarchs [and] political players,” trying to capitalize on the supplies. The Pentagon has in the past been caught failing to properly account for the vast scale of its assets. The department has failed multiple attempts to pass a financial audit since 2017, when the first such check was launched. After the latest failure in 2021, US military officials said they hoped to pass the test for the first time by 2027."
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561584-kiev-protest-pope-dugina/,Ukraine summons Vatican envoy,"Kiev has summoned the Vatican’s representative in Ukraine to lodge a formal complaint over remarks made earlier this week by Pope Francis on the killing of a Russian journalist in Moscow. Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said during a media briefing on Thursday that Archbishop Visvaldas Kulbokas had visited the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry earlier in the day. Kiev was “disappointed” with remarks made by the Pope in response to the assassination of Darya Dugina, a Russian journalist and political commentator. She was killed by a bomb planted in her car. Moscow identified a Ukrainian woman as the primary suspect and accused Kiev of masterminding the murder, but Kiev has denied any involvement. Pope Francis called Dugina a “poor girl” and lamented that the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was claiming innocent lives on both sides. In response, Kiev claimed that the head of the Roman Catholic Church had made a false equivalence between “the aggressor and the victim.” The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said it could not understand why he mentioned the death of “a Russian citizen on Russian territory that had nothing to do with Ukraine.” Dmitry Kuleba also said “Ukraine’s heart was torn by the Pope’s words”, calling them “unjust”. Kiev’s ambassador to the Vatican, Andrey Yurash, earlier criticized the Pontiff on Twitter. He branded Dugina an ideologue of “Russian Imperialism” rather than an innocent person, and claimed that she was killed by “Russians”. Dugina was the daughter of controversial Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, who advocates Russian exceptionalism. Western media have portrayed him for years as a secret influencer of Russian foreign policy. Darya Dugina shared some of his political views and was a fierce critic of the current Ukrainian government. The bombing happened last weekend as the two were leaving a family party together near Moscow. According to initial reports the father was supposed to travel with the daughter in the bomb-rigged car, leading many to believe that he was the intended target. Russian investigators later said the suspect rented an apartment in the block where Dugina lived, indicating that the daughter may have been the target."
2022-08-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/561567-gorlovka-donetsk-chemical-attack/,Ukraine strikes chemical plant – DPR,"Ukrainian rockets loaded with cluster bombs damaged a chemical plant in the Donetsk People’s Republic on Thursday and caused an electrical fire, according to local officials. The “Stirol” factory halted operations but there was no chemical release and the fire was eventually put out, authorities in the city of Gorlovka said. The plant was struck on Thursday afternoon by two missiles from Ukrainian “Uragan” multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), Gorlovka Mayor Ivan Prikhodko said on Telegram. The rockets were allegedly loaded with cluster munitions, which exploded and started a fire at the electrical substation inside the “Stirol” plant and on the roof of the nearby “Transammiak” factory. “Stirol” director Vasily Agarkov told local media that the factory halted operations until the fire was extinguished. Agarkov said that about 40 cluster bombs were scattered inside the factory, but that there was no risk of a chemical release. There were no reports of casualties. Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) emergency services said they received a fire call shortly after 6 pm local time, and it took the firefighters until 7:45 to localize the blaze. This was the second artillery attack on “Stirol” this month. On August 12, Ukrainian shelling, as claimed by DPR officials, also caused a fire at the plant, hitting a warehouse with construction materials. Gorlovka is located northeast of Donetsk city, with heavy fighting currently going on north and west of the city between Russian and DPR forces on one side, and Ukrainian troops on the other. Before the conflict, “Stirol” used to be one of Europe’s largest producers of mineral fertilizers, accounting for 3% of the global export of ammonia and related compounds. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/561532-medvedev-military-coup-kiev/,Russian ex-president envisions military junta in Kiev,"Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has predicted that the Ukrainian military may stage a coup in Kiev to do what the civilian government refuses to do – negotiate peace with Russia. Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of the Russian National Security Council, outlined the scenario as one of two options that he believes to be viable for Ukraine. The other was if the government of President Vladimir Zelensky changed its tune and agreed to Russia’s terms for ending hostilities. Either way, Russia will get what it wants from Ukraine, the official said. Moscow declared the demilitarization and ‘denazification’ of Ukraine as the goals of its military operation in the country. Kiev initially appeared willing to accept a neutral status, but was later emboldened by Western military aid. Zelensky now insists that defeating Russia on the battlefield and retaking all the land that was under Kiev’s control before 2014 is the only possible option for his country. The assessment by Medvedev apparently came in response to a Wednesday article in The Guardian, which made predictions for how the Ukrainian crisis could develop over the next six months. Dan Sabbagh, the British newspaper’s defense and security editor, offered five predictions that he considers likely. The expectations included a deadlocked conflict and a reduction in the intensity of hostilities, a campaign of sabotage by Ukrainian special forces and a renewed refugee crisis during winter. The Russian official said that any scenario for the conflict that would predict a victory for Kiev was “crystal-clear lies and demagoguery.”"
2022-08-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/561547-russian-military-ukraine-warplanes/,Russia reports destruction of eight Ukrainian warplanes,"Two separate attacks by Russian forces have destroyed or disabled eight Ukrainian Air Force planes, the Defense Ministry in Moscow claimed on Thursday. In one sortie, Russian warplanes launched precision munitions at a Ukrainian airfield near the city of Mirgorod in the central Poltava Region, military spokesman Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov said during a daily briefing. Two warplanes, a Su-27 and a Su-24, were destroyed while two other Su-27s and a Su-24 were critically damaged in the raid, he said. The Ukrainian military reported Russian strikes on “military infrastructure” in the city on Wednesday morning, but did not disclose the damage they caused. According to the Russian side, up to 30 “nationalists” were killed. The second reported precision strike strike hit Dnepr military air base in Dnepropetrovsk Region, destroying three unspecified military aircraft, according to Konashenkov. As of Thursday, the ministry claims to have destroyed a total of 273 Ukrainian military planes since launching the operation in February. The Russian official also confirmed a strike on a train station in the Ukrainian town of Chaplino, but disputed Kiev’s claims about the nature of the target. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky stated on Wednesday evening that the attack had killed 22 civilians, including an 11-year-old child. His office updated the death toll on Thursday to 25. Konashenkov said that an Iskander missile hit a train carrying Ukrainian troops and weapons eastward. He claimed that the strike killed more than 200 Ukrainian soldiers and destroyed 10 military vehicles."
2022-08-25,https://www.rt.com/news/561540-putin-military-size-ukraine/,Putin orders Russian military to boost manpower,"The size of the Russian military is set to increase to 1.15 million troops next year, in line with a decree that President Vladimir Putin signed on Thursday. The document, published on the government’s website, adds 137,000 to the ranks of the Armed Forces from January 1, 2023. It also instructs the cabinet to allocate the necessary funds for the expansion. The move comes amid the Russian military operation in Ukraine, launched in late February. Moscow sent troops into the neighboring country six months ago, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-08-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/561529-ryazan-wildfires-possible-arson/,Sabotage suspected as Russia fights wildfires,"Massive wildfires raging in Russia’s Ryazan Region may have been caused by an arsonist bent on sabotage, a Russian minister told media on Thursday. “We see certain elements of sabotage. There are elements of arson at the root of the wildfires,” Emergencies Minister Aleksandr Kurenkov has said, as he updated the public on the situation. Russian law enforcement will investigate whether foul play was actually involved, the official added. Ryazan Region, which is located some 150 kilometers southeast of Moscow, has been hit by some of the worst wildfires experienced in recent years. The ministry reported this week that flames had engulfed almost 15,000 hectares (37,000 acres) of forests. The first blaze in the region was detected on August 7. In ten days, the wildfires had spread so much that the smoke from them could be smelled in the capital. Firefighters tackling the disaster are also dealing with hot weather and fast winds, which make their job more difficult, the minister explained. “At the moment I assess the situation as difficult, but it is fully under control,” Kurenkov told journalists. Russian law enforcement is currently on an alert for possible saboteurs seeking to damage the country on behalf of Ukraine. On Thursday, the domestic security agency FSB reported apprehending a Russian citizen who’d allegedly plotted “terrorist attacks” in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The suspect was described as a local resident and a supporter of Azov, a Ukrainian National Guard unit, whose members have a record of supporting far-right ideology. Moscow considers it to be an international terrorist organization. The FSB claimed that the man wanted to attack targets belonging to Russia’s Baltic Fleet and Khrabrovo Airport, which is used by both civilian and military aircraft."
2022-08-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/561535-security-systems-activated-zaporozhye-nuclear/,Security systems activated at Zaporozhye nuclear power plant – officials,"Security systems have been activated at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant after a power outage, which temporarily left the facility without electricity, members of the Russia-backed administration in the Ukrainian region have claimed. The plant has since been connected to an alternative source of power, according to officials. The blackout is said to have been caused by massive wildfires in the area, which were started by Ukrainian shelling, theу said. Fires, which have engulfed parts of the steppe and woods surrounding the city of Energodar, led to short-circuits in the local grid, leaving not only parts of Zaporozhye region without power, but also the neighboring Kherson region. The head of the pro-Russian military-civil administration of Energodar, Yevgeny Balitski, has been quoted by media as saying: “according to preliminary information, because of massive shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces, which has continued since last night, fields and undergrowth caught fire. This led to a short-circuit in the grid.” Meanwhile, Ukraine’s state-owned Energoatom company, which is the operator of the power plant, has issued a statement saying Russia’s actions have “resulted in the complete disconnection of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant from power supply – for the first time in history.” The Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant is the largest facility of its kind in Europe. It was seized by Russian forces in early March, soon after Moscow launched its military offensive against Kiev. Since then, the country’s National Guard and Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defense Troops have been guarding the site, with Ukrainian staff continuing to operate the plant. Over the past month, Russia has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the nuclear power plant, damaging some of the equipment and buildings. Moscow has warned that Kiev is risking a nuclear incident on a similar scale as the 1986 Chernobyl disaster or even worse. Ukraine, in turn, strongly denies its military is targeting the facility, and accuses Russian troops of deliberately shelling the plant to frame pro-Kiev forces. Moreover, Ukrainian officials and some of their Western supporters claim that Russia is using the plant as a military base, hiding its personnel and hardware on its grounds. Russian officials, for their part, have repeatedly called on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to send inspectors to the facility, saying that such a mission would corroborate Moscow’s version of events."
2022-08-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/561520-danilov-ukraine-preparation-war/,Kiev was gearing up for military conflict since 2019 – security chief,"A top Ukrainian security official has said that Kiev had been gearing up for hostilities with Russia since as early as December 2019. The Russian military had earlier reported uncovering classified Ukrainian documents indicating a planned offensive against Donbass rebels. The revelation about Kiev’s military preparation was made by Aleksey Danilov, who chairs Ukraine’s national security council, in an interview with the Polish daily Wyborcza on Tuesday. “We were actually preparing for the war from December 2019, and all the claims that we were not dealing with it are absolutely out of touch with reality,” he was quoted as saying. “If we did not prepare for war, today Russian tanks would be in Warsaw, Prague, Tallinn and Vilnius.” Danilov was apparently deflecting criticism directed at President Vladimir Zelensky. The Ukrainian leader admitted in an interview with The Washington Post last week that he’d intentionally downplayed US warnings about a possible Russian attack to prevent a mass exodus of Ukrainians. The newspaper called the admission the first serious messaging failure by Zelensky due to a furious domestic backlash he faced. In the interview, the security chief stood by the president’s decision, calling it correct in the long run. When Russia justified its late February attack against Ukraine, it cited the threat that Ukrainian forces posed to rebel militias and civilians in Donbass. In March, the Russian Defense Ministry published what it claimed to be classified Ukrainian documents proving that a Ukrainian operation in the east was in the pipeline. The Russian military assessed that Kiev would have launched an offensive in Donbass sometime in March, were it not for the Russian intervention. Moscow recognized the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics as sovereign states days before sending troops into Ukraine. Russia demanded a withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the lands claimed by the two republics, which Kiev rejected. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the two regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.”"
2022-08-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/561512-kiev-blasts-pope-dugina/,Ukraine chastises Pope for condemning journalist's murder,"Pope Francis was wrong to express regret for the death of Russian journalist and political figure Darya Dugina, Ukraine’s envoy to the Vatican has said. The diplomat claimed the woman was not an innocent victim, and her murder was orchestrated by “Russians.” Dugina was killed on Sunday, when a bomb planted in her car exploded. The Pope condemned the incident, calling the woman “a poor girl” and lamenting that innocent people die on both sides during wars. The Ukrainian diplomat, Andrey Yurash, called the remarks “disappointing” in a tweet on Wednesday, saying the “aggressor” and “victim” cannot be spoken about in “the same categories.” He wrote that Dugina was not an innocent party, as she was an ideologue of “Russian Imperialism,” and went on to claim that she was killed by “Russians,” supposedly to rally domestic support for the military operation against Ukraine. Today’s speech ofPope was disappointing& made me think about many things: can’t speak inSame categories aboutАggressor &Victim, Rapist and Raped; howPossible To Mention 1of ideologists of🇷🇺ImperialismAs innocent victim?She wasKilledBy russiansAsSacredVictim &isNowOn Shield ofWar pic.twitter.com/GvvM7zJDCa Dugina was the daughter of controversial Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, whose works promote Russian exceptionalism, and who has been widely described in the Western media as a behind-the-scenes architect of Russian foreign policy. Darya shared some of his beliefs and was a vocal supporter of the Russian military action against Ukraine. Russian investigators have identified a Ukrainian woman as the prime suspect in Dugina’s murder. According to the FSB security agency, she rented an apartment in the building where the victim lived and fled from Russia to Estonia right after the bombing. Moscow has accused Kiev of masterminding the killing, which Ukrainian officials have denied."
2022-08-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/561422-dugins-daughter-daria-alexandrovna/,"'A vile, cruel crime': How Darya Dugina, daughter of philosopher Aleksandr, died and what it means for Russia","Last weekend, a brutal murder stunned Russia. A young woman got into her car and drove home after a busy day at a literature and musical festival. She was on the highway when a bomb went off and her SUV caught fire. She died at the scene. Darya Dugina's devastated father, who was in a friend’s car right beside his daughter’s, watched as the rescue services extracted the burned body from the wreck. The attack immediately became a matter of national importance. Leaders of political parties and top Russian officials attended her funeral, while the president posthumously decorated her with a state award. RT explains why the death of Dugina may become a symbol of Russia’s external political struggle, and what the Kremlin will do next. On Tuesday, hundreds gathered at the Ostankino broadcasting center in Moscow to pay their last respects to the journalist and political scientist. On the night of August 20, Darya was heading home with her father from the ‘Tradition’ cultural festival near Moscow. Around 9pm, the car with Dugina at the wheel exploded on Mozhaisk Highway, where she died. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation has opened an investigation into what it calls a “murder committed in a socially-dangerous manner.” It is still uncertain who the actual target was – Darya or her father Aleksandr Dugin, one of the founders of the concept of ‘Eurasianism’, who is seen as a controversial advocate of ‘the Russian world’ in Ukraine and some Western countries. His political studies have focused on the creation of a Eurasian superpower through an association of Russia and former Soviet republics. The car belonged to Darya, but Russian media outlets say her father had used it quite often in the last six months. According to one version, they had planned on going together, but Aleksandr changed his mind and took a friend’s car at the last moment. Darya may also have been the target of the attack. She had followed in her father’s footsteps and became a proponent of Eurasianism. At home, she is well known for her work as a journalist for RT and the Zvezda and Tsargrad TV channels, as well as political commentary for other Russian media. Darya publicly supported the military operation in Ukraine and was placed under sanctions in the summer of 2022. The US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand accused her of spreading disinformation. She had also reported from Mariupol, which is now liberated by the joint forces of Russia and the Donbass republics. In the autumn of 2022, a chronicle about the Russian military that she co-authored is set to be published – ‘Book Z’. On Monday, two days after the terrorist attack, the FSB security agency announced it had solved the crime and blamed the special services of Ukraine. According to the FSB, the assassination was organized by Natalya Vovk, a Ukrainian citizen who came to Russia from Ukraine along with her teenage daughter, Sofia Shaban, in July 2022. Some sources claim Vovk once served in the Neo-Nazi Azov Battalion. After the explosion, Vovk and her daughter left Russia and entered Estonia through Pskov Region. Ukraine denied any involvement and called the FSB’s findings “propaganda.” Estonia refused to provide details about Vovk’s border crossing. Tallinn said the country’s Police and Border Guard Board had not been approached by Russia with a request for this information. Urmas Reinsalu, the country’s minister of foreign affairs, went as far as to dismiss the conclusions drawn by the Russian special services as a provocation. “We regard this [the FSB statement] as [a] provocation … by the Russian Federation, and we have nothing more to say about it at this moment.” In Russia, the journalist’s murder is seen as nothing if not political, with Telegram channels and other media abuzz with discussions about the implications of this incident for the country’s policies. President Vladimir Putin described the crime as vile, in a telegram addressed to the parents of the deceased journalist, which was published on the Kremlin’s official website. “A vile, cruel crime cut short the life of Darya Dugina, a bright, talented person with a true Russian heart, kind, loving, sympathetic and open. Journalist, scientist, philosopher, and war correspondent, she honestly served the people and the Fatherland, and proved by deed what it means to be a patriot of Russia,” The murder reverberated well beyond Russia’s borders, prompting US State Department spokesman Ned Price to say that Washington “condemns the intentional targeting of civilians anywhere.” Remarkably, the Americans have struck a rather ‘neutral’ tone in their comments. “The U.S. Department of State’s reaction to Darya Dugina’s assassination and the evidence of Ukraine’s involvement provided by Russia discredit the United States’ human rights protection efforts. Washington has no moral right (or, needless to say, any legal grounds) to judge the human rights situation in remote parts of the world since the murder of a journalist does not even receive a comment from this perspective, apparently so important to US officials. They simply ignored the fact that the incident involved a public figure,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram. The names of those attending the funeral on August 23 spoke volumes about the political nature of the tragedy. Among those present were State Duma Deputy Chairman Sergey Neverov, the head of the nationalist LDPR party, Leonid Slutsky, businessman Evgeny Prigozhin, novelist and political activist Zakhar Prilepin, the leader of the political party ‘A Just Russia’, Sergey Mironov, and other politicians. Signs reading ‘Funeral Service/ Farewell Ceremony for journalist Darya Dugina’, with black arrows, provided directions, guiding the mourners through the corridors and staircases of the Ostankino Television Center. Police cordons were lined up a couple of kilometers from the television center, and the entrance to the building was protected by metal detectors and guarded by armed policemen who performed triple security checks on everyone waiting to get inside. Officers used under car inspection mirrors and explosive detection dogs. The line of mourners holding bunches of lilies, roses, and carnations – in even numbers, as is traditional for funerals in Russia – were gradually admitted into the building and joined those gathered in the ceremony hall. The farewell ceremony brought together hundreds of people – young men and women wearing T-shirts with an eight-pointed star, a symbol of Eurasianism, as well as older men in similar attire. There were war correspondents and servicemen in military uniform, some of whom had DPR shoulder patches. There were Darya’s journalist colleagues, her fellow students from MSU’s philosophy department, as well as representatives of Russian media outlets. The microphone set up for those who wished to pay tribute to the deceased was claimed in turn by Darya’s friends and family, representatives of the president, the church, and state media, while people in the mourning procession approached the coffin one by one and crossed themselves as they placed flowers. Some expressed their condolences to Darya’s grieving father who was sitting close to the coffin. “For those of you who have been affected by her tragic death, her personality, and her integrity, she would have one wish: ‘Don’t remember me! Don’t glorify me! Fight for our great country! Defend our faith, our holy Orthodoxy, and love our Russian people!’ Because she died for the people. She died for Russia. She died on the frontlines – because the front is right here. It’s not there [in Ukraine] but here. It’s with each of us,” Dugin said at the ceremony. State Duma Vice Speaker Sergey Neverov said Dugina’s death will unite the people of Russia even more. “I have no doubt that not only the executors, but the organizers will pay in full. The path of light that Darya led unites us even more for the liberation of Russian cities in the fight against fascism and that hateful regime,” Neverov said at the ceremony. Sergey Mironov called Dugina a “true patriot and, however strange it may sound, a fighter for independence and sovereignty.” The young woman was in an open casket, and, if not for the ‘venchik’ (a ribbon with the images of Jesus, Mary, and John the Baptist placed on the deceased person’s forehead according to Orthodox tradition), she might have been mistaken for someone who is peacefully asleep. Darya Dugina was not a well-known public figure, but her death has become symbolic, according to the director of the International Institute for Political Expertise, political analyst Evgeny Minchenko. And this symbol only grows stronger as the reactions to the untimely death of the journalist continue to come in from Ukraine. “There are very different, opposite reactions. On the one hand, quite understandably for any normal human being, people acknowledge the tragedy; on the other – some inexplicable happy celebratory giggles are heard from the other side of the frontlines [reactions from Ukrainian media – RT]. I believe this mix has made this symbol even stronger,” he told RT. Minchenko believes that this tragic event will give impetus to Russia’s internal political struggle, rather than provoking harsh foreign policy decisions. “When people keep saying you have to play harder, what is it that has not been done yet? They start demanding some mythical response targeting the decision-making center. Well, where are these centers? I would ask. Do we know exactly where the decisions are being made, where the secure bunkers are that accommodate the leaders? Some are calling for the entire area along Bankova Street [in Kiev] to be bombed, but, you know, it has residential buildings in addition to government [buildings],” Minchenko said. He also believes that we should not expect a wave of strict measures against dissenting voices in domestic politics, since Russia already has “very clearly defined laws” regarding these matters. Nevertheless, a political discussion on the domestic scene is bound to be stirred up. As for the Russian government, it intends, as statements from officials indicate, to find those behind the assassination, both the masterminds and the operative, and deliver justice. “I believe it’s a barbaric crime, and there can be no mercy to those behind it. As far as I am aware, the Federal Security Service has already established the facts, and investigation is underway, so once it’s complete, there is no doubt that all the involved parties from those who had ordered it to those who carried it out will pay the full price,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an official statement on August 23, 2022."
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561496-zelensky-soldier-nazi-symbol/,Zelensky praises Neo-Nazi soldier on social media,"Ukraine's president has posted a picture of a soldier wearing the insignia of a notorious Nazi SS division to his official Instagram account. The post, part of a series celebrating Ukraine’s Independence Day, was not the first piece of Nazi iconography he has shared. Zelensky posted the image on Instagram early on Wednesday. In it, a Ukrainian soldier carrying a rifle displays the standard of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, also known as the 1st Galician division. Comprising predominantly Ukrainian volunteers from the Galicia region (which spans what is now southwestern Poland and western Ukraine), the division is known for committing war crimes against Polish civilians during the course of World War II. A post shared by Володимир Зеленський (@zelenskiy_official) The Ukrainian soldier, identified by Zelensky as ‘Mikhail,’ also wears the patch of the 49th Rifle Battalion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is named after the nationalist ‘Carpathian Sich’ militia of the 1930s. Most of the Carpathian Sich’s members were also members of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, led by Nazi collaborator and war criminal Stepan Bandera. Bandera is considered a hero by Ukrainian nationalists, and is openly celebrated by top Ukrainian officials. Zelensky’s post also includes a picture of Sergey Volynsky, also known as Volyna, who commanded a marine unit attached to the Azov regiment in Mariupol earlier this summer. The Azov regiment, a neo-Nazi militia folded into the Ukrainian military in 2014, was destroyed after a proctracted siege at the Azovstal steel plant in the coastal city and its members either killed or captured. Volynsky is currently in custody. Zelensky has posted images of his soldiers wearing Third Reich insignia before. In a post across multiple social media platforms celebrating the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, the Ukrainian president included a picture of one of his troops wearing the ‘death’s head’, or ‘totenkopf’, insignia of the 3rd SS Panzer Division. This division was heavily staffed by former concentration camp guards and was responsible for numerous massacres of French civilians and Polish Jews. Ukraine is the only country in the world that has integrated openly neo-Nazi militias into its national military, and while these militias were once described by Western media outlets as “neo-Nazi,” they are now referred to as “far-right groups.” Since Russian troops entered Ukraine in February, stashes of Nazi paraphernalia have been found in the houses and bases of these militia members, and social media accounts run by the Ukrainian government have also posted images of soldiers wearing Nazi and far-right symbols."
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561468-ukraine-cluster-mines-protest/,Protesters call out West over Ukraine’s use of mines on civilians,"A group of protesters gathered on Wednesday at the embassies of the US and France in Moscow to protest the use of scatterable mines by NATO-backed Ukraine. The protesters taped images of the mines to the sidewalk around the embassies. The stickers featured a QR code leading to a website explaining what the PFM-1 mines are and accusing Ukraine of dropping them on cities. The munitions regularly maim civilians, according to the website, which shows photos of some of the victims. The demonstration in front of the American embassy included activists lying immobile on the ground, apparently as a symbol of the casualties inflicted by the mines, according to images from the scene. The PFM-1 is designed to deny access to an area to enemy foot soldiers and is usually deployed in large quantities. The munitions are generally either dropped from an aircraft or disbursed from a ground-fired cluster projectile. They scatter while gliding down and become armed after hitting the ground. Each mine contains a pressure-activated fuse and a small explosive charge, which can blow off a person’s foot or hand. The design was reportedly influenced by the US-made BLU-43 Dragontooth mine, which works the same way and was used during the Vietnam War. The Soviet version is nicknamed ‘petal’. Ukraine has large stockpiles of Soviet weapons, including an estimated six million PFM-1 mines as of 2011. The country was supposed to dispose of its stocks of the mine to comply with its international obligations. However, Kiev has allegedly deployed a portion of the remaining mines to harass cities such as Donetsk, the capital of the Moscow-allied Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). Ukrainian officials have denied using the mines and have accused Russian troops of dropping them. DPR officials regularly post warnings on social media, instructing civilians to look out for the maiming munitions and to call demolition experts upon finding them."
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561490-lukashenko-fan-merch-store/,'Merch' store for Belarusian leader opens in Moscow,"A store with Alexander Lukashenko-themed merchandise has opened in Russia. The outlet is located at the refurbished Belarus pavilion that was unveiled at the All-Russian Exhibition Center (VDNKh) in Moscow on Tuesday. The store offers assorted merchandise, such as T-shirts, baseball caps, purses and other items adorned with select quotes from the Belarusian president, such as: “No emergency, undress and get to work;” “But I’m a dictator, it’s hard for me to understand democracy;” “We won’t let anyone bend us over” and so on. The outlet also offers pillows that say, “If you want to know how I sleep, you have to sleep with me” for those who apparently want to get more intimate with the self-proclaimed “last dictator” of Europe. The opening ceremony of the store was attended by multiple high-profile officials, including First Deputy Prime Minister of Belarus Nikolay Snopkov, Belarusian ambassador to Russia Dmitry Krutoy, and others. The ceremony featured a small fashion show, with models parading around the presidential merchandise. The first store offering Lukashenko-themed fan merchandise opened in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, last December. The tongue-in-cheek idea of a fan store materialized after the Belarusian president received a set of T-shirts featuring his own quotes for his birthday last year."
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561488-nebenzia-un-zelensky-crimes/,Barely audible Zelensky dodges Russian response at UN,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky hastily left a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday before Russia's representative responded to his claims. Appearing by video link, Zelensky had argued that that the freedom of the world depended on Ukraine’s independence and accused Russia of threatening a nuclear disaster at the Zaporozhye power plant and being responsible for inflation, hunger and high energy prices. His speech was barely audible and he closed his connection before Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia called out his government and its Western backers for being the principal threat to Ukraine’s independence. An exception was made to the usual in-person-only rules to facilitate Zelensky's remote participation. Russia had objected to this breach of protocol. It was the second time the Security Council has voted to override its own rules and allow Zelensky to deliver a video address; it was also done in June, also over Russian objections. Nebenzia noted the technical problems that made about a quarter of Zelensky’s speech impossible to understand. The Russian envoy also chided the Security Council for turning Wednesday’s sessions into a series of declarations by Western powers of their unconditional support for the government in Kiev, and disagreed with their argument that Russia threatens Ukraine’s independence. The main, the only threat to the independence of Ukraine is the current government in Kiev. Ukraine’s woes began with the illegal 2014 Maidan coup, he argued, with Western governments ever since turning a blind eye to actions by Kiev that they would never tolerate at home. Kiev’s militants burned dissenters alive in Odessa and bombed the people of Donetsk and Lugansk in a “senseless crusade against itself,” Nebenzia argued, which resulted in the loss of Crimea and the independence of the Donbass republics. A war that lasted almost eight years could have ended at any point had Ukraine carried out its obligations under the Minsk agreements, the Russian envoy pointed out, but neither Kiev nor its Western backers were inclined to do so. Ukrainian troops continue to shell the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant and civilian infrastructure, not just in the Donbass republics but in territories until recently under their control. “Our former Western partners, instead of condemning their Ukrainian wards, continue to send them new weapons, letting Kiev reach places it was not able to target before. This makes them accomplices to crimes against civilians,” Nebenzia told the UN. He also noted that, according to Ukrainians themselves, American advisers are involved in selecting targets for US-supplied weapons such as HIMARS rocket launchers, which were used to kill Ukrainian prisoners held in Yelenovka. “We know Zelensky is well aware that the Ukrainian forces are behind this crime, even though he falsely accused Russia of it today,” Nebenzia said. The Russian ambassador also called out Ukraine’s bombing of civilian areas, use of its own civilians as human shields, deploying banned landmines against civilians – he even held up a ‘petal’ mine as evidence – and an “unprecedented campaign of lies” against Russia, “not seen since the Nazi propaganda of [Joseph] Goebbels.” Nebenzia also pointed out that the current US President Joe Biden had blackmailed Ukraine into firing a top prosecutor, and how the State Department’s Victoria Nuland discussed the composition of the government in Kiev with the US ambassador – not Ukrainians – in the infamous intercepted phone call. Just about all Ukrainian government agencies now have embedded Western advisers, he added. “If this is independence, what does dependence look like?” he asked the Security Council."
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561487-nuclear-power-plant-spies/,Ukrainian spies detained at nuclear plant – Russia,"Russian forces have detained two employees of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine, who have been providing information on troops and hardware locations to Kiev’s forces, the Russian National Guard (Rosgvardiya) said on Wednesday. “Apart from that, a violator of access control [to the plant], an accomplice of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who transmitted the coordinates of the movement of columns of Russian military hardware, has been detained,” they added. After seizing control of the power station on March 4, Russian forces have detained 26 violators of access control to the plant – the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the National Guard revealed. The facility continues to operate with local staff, while Russian troops patrol the premises and check for explosive devices and unexploded munitions, the National Guard said. They noted that “Specialists of the nuclear, biological and chemical defense of the National Guard, together with colleagues from the Ministry of Defense, daily, several times a day, monitor the situation by measuring radiation levels at control points along the perimeter of the facility.” In recent weeks, the nuclear power plant and the nearby city of Energodar have been repeatedly shelled by Kiev’s forces. The attacks damaged multiple buildings on the premises of the plant, causing fires and power outages, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Moscow has warned that the continuing attacks could ultimately render the power plant inoperable and might even result in a major disaster similar to the one in Chernobyl in 1986. Kiev and some Western officials, however, have accused Russia of shelling the plant, despite the fact that it is controlled by Russia’s own troops."
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561478-boris-johnson-visit-kiev-ukraine/,Boris Johnson visits Kiev as UK donates more weapons,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrived in Kiev on Wednesday, marking Ukraine’s Independence Day with his third visit to the city since the start of Russia’s military campaign in February. Urging Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to ignore calls for negotiations, Johnson outlined a new $63 million arms shipment for his military. After a press tour through the streets of Kiev, Johnson appeared in a joint news conference with Zelensky, in which he urged the Ukrainian leader not to “advance some flimsy plan for negotiation” with Russia. While it is unclear which specific plan Johnson was referring to, British officials have publicly called on Kiev not to enter talks with Moscow on numerous occasions since Russia sent its troops into Ukraine in February. “The United Kingdom is with you and will be with you for the days and months ahead, and you can and will win,” Johnson told Zelensky. Johnson also used his appearance in Kiev to announce a new package of military aid to Ukraine worth £54 million ($63 million). According to a Downing Street press release, the package will include loitering munitions – commonly known as suicide drones – and 850 Black Hornet micro-drones – helicopters around the size of a mobile phone which feed back video and still images to their operators. In total, the UK has given Ukraine more than £2.3 billion ($2.7 billion) in military aid since February, and is currently training Ukrainian military recruits on British soil. The training program was announced by the UK last month, shortly after Zelensky admitted that his military was losing between 100 and 200 soldiers per day, not counting those wounded, on a battlefield described by the Ukrainian president as “hell.” August 24 marks six months since Russia’s military operation in Ukraine began, and 31 years since Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union. In Washington, US President Joe Biden used the day to announce a new arms package worth nearly $3 billion, the largest US weapons tranche for Ukraine to date. For Johnson, the trip to Kiev will be his last as prime minister. Johnson will leave office in two weeks, after resigning in July amid multiple scandals. Pending the outcome of a Conservative Party ballot, he will be replaced by either Foreign Secretary Liz Truss – a hardline opponent of Russia who has promised to be Ukraine’s “greatest friend” – or former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who similarly promised Kiev that the UK will “remain your strongest ally.”"
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561462-russian-visas-latvian-protesters/,Russia offers visas to defenders of Soviet monument,"Russia is ready to grant asylum to Latvians who face harassment in their home country for protesting their government’s crackdown on Soviet-era symbols, Moscow’s envoy to Riga has said. The embassy “has started issuing Russian visas to citizens who had been detained these days near the monument to the liberators of Riga,” Ambassador Mikhail Vanin told Russian television on Wednesday. This will allow them “to flee Latvian territory and find asylum in Russia, should they need it,” he added. Latvian police reported detaining 14 people who were demonstrating on Tuesday against the government’s move to demolish the World War II memorial. Law enforcement said the demonstrators were taken into custody for their refusal to disperse when ordered. The monument has long served as a flashpoint for tensions between Latvia’s government, which brands the historic period when Latvia was part of the Soviet Union as an “occupation,” and the country’s ethnic Russian community, which seeks to preserve some parts of the Soviet legacy. Latvian nationalist forces have long sought to rid the country of all Soviet symbols. This campaign gained impetus amid the rift between Russia and Western nations over the conflict in Ukraine. The government announced earlier in August that the monument in Riga, which had served as a place for commemorating World War II victims, would be torn down and recycled. The promise was carried out on Tuesday, but the move sparked protests. The Russian embassy called the removal of the monument “an act of vandalism by the state” and accused Riga of mislabeling people who disagree with the decision as a national threat. The protesters “get roughly detained by the police, while leaders of the state voice various threats against those people, from expulsion and revocation of permanent residency permission to criminal prosecution,” the statement said. Latvian President Egils Levits said in an interview on Wednesday that Russians in Latvia who are not loyal to the country’s government should be “isolated from society.”"
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561465-russia-azov-commanders-bounty/,Russia places bounty on neo-Nazis,"Moscow will offer a reward for any information leading to the capture of two commanders of Ukraine’s notorious Azov regiment who are accused of brutally torturing and murdering Russian POWs, the Ministry of Internal Affairs announced on its website on Wednesday. The bounties have been placed on 28-year-old Konstantin Nemichev and 26-year-old Sergey Velichko, who have served as commanders in the Azov regiment. The unit was declared a terrorist organization by Russia’s Supreme Court in June. Both of the fighters have been put on the international wanted list, as well as Russia’s 'ten especially dangerous wanted criminals' list. “The leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation has decided to offer a reward for assistance in detaining the commanders of the Ukrainian nationalist battalion Konstantin Nemichev and Sergey Velichko, accused of committing a crime under Article 317 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation,” the ministry’s press service wrote, adding that one million rubles (~$16,600) will be paid out for information on each individual. The ministry previously called for the arrest of the two Azov commanders back in May after Russia’s Investigative Committee had identified them as being responsible for “causing multiple bodily harm, including with the use of firearms” to at least eight Russian servicemen, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Both Nemichev and Velichko are currently part of the Kraken regiment operating near the city of Kharkov, which primarily consists of Azov veterans and other neo-Nazi fighters and volunteers. The regiment describes itself as a special reconnaissance and sabotage unit under the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, operating separately from the Armed Forces. Last week, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed that Kraken forces had executed some 100 fellow Ukrainian soldiers who had abandoned their positions amid a Russian breakthrough in the Kharkov region. According to Moscow, the executions were carried out to “suppress panic and intimidate the personnel of the Armed forces of Ukraine.”"
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561455-us-aid-arms-ukraine-delay/,‘Months or years’ before US arms reach Ukraine – media,"Years could pass before some of the weapons in the upcoming “largest ever” package of US military assistance to Kiev actually reach Ukraine, according to Western media reports. On Tuesday, a number of mainstream media outlets cited anonymous US officials as describing the impending announcement of a $3 billion package of military aid to Ukraine. If confirmed, it would be the largest of its kind so far. Washington is by far the biggest supplier of military hardware to Ukraine as it fights against Russia. However, some of the promised equipment “will not be in the hands of Ukrainian fighters for months or years,” according to NBC News, one of the outlets that reported the upcoming package. Included in the package are advanced weapons that are still in the development phase, it explained. The same caveat was cited by the Associated Press, which said that it may take “a year or two” for the arms to reach the battlefield, according to its sources. Washington expects Ukrainian forces “to fight for years to come,” US officials told the AP. The AeroVironment Switchblade 600 drone is an example of a weapon system that was promised to Ukraine months ago but has yet to be delivered. Defense News said this week that the Pentagon plans to sign the contract necessary for sending 10 of the so-called “kamikaze drones” within a month. Last month, Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov called on foreign suppliers of arms to use his country as a testing ground for new weapons. He pledged to provide detailed reports about the experiences of Ukrainian soldiers with the prototypes provided to them."
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561451-latvia-monument-protesters-arrested/,Latvia detains protesters after destruction of Soviet monument,"Latvian police detained people protesting on Tuesday against the dismantling of a Soviet monument commemorating the liberation of Latvia and its capital, Riga, from the Nazis, in World War Two. Local authorities stated that of the several dozen who showed up at the site, 14 were arrested for disobeying orders to disperse. The news portal Delfi reported that on Tuesday morning Latvian police and “builders and equipment” arrived at Victory Park in Riga, where the famous Soviet monument is located. The memorial was surrounded by fences covered with opaque sheeting as the workers began dismantling it. In the evening, people began coming to the park, many carrying flowers. The police, however, did not let them approach the monument, so they tried laying the flowers in a field next to a nearby gas station, which was also eventually disallowed by the police, according to Delfi. Closer to midnight, even more people came to the site, states the outlet, many of whom began singing the popular Russian WW2-era song ‘Katyusha’. Meanwhile, some of the protesters began growing more agitated and were getting into verbal skirmishes with the police, after which they were ordered to disperse. Those who failed to comply were arrested. The monument, formally dedicated to the ‘Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders’ was built in 1985. However, after Latvia gained independence following the dissolution of the USSR, the country’s authorities increasingly began seeing the memorial as a symbol of Soviet oppression and the question of taking it down was repeatedly raised. With anti-Russian sentiment in the country rising in recent years, Russia’s operation in Ukraine that started in late February served as the catalyst for the final decision to demolish the monument. Earlier this month, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated that government-level decisions by countries such as Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to completely destroy the Soviet military memorial heritage, as well as anything related to Russia, was a manifestation of neo-Nazism in these states."
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561449-russian-priest-stabbed-death/,Russian priest stabbed to death by arsonist – prosecutors,"An altercation at a church in the Moscow suburb of Domodedovo, has left a priest dead, investigators reported on Wednesday. The perpetrator, who was apprehended, is thought to be former Sunday school teacher, well known to the deceased. The death of Father Sergey Lopukhov, the archpriest of the St. Nicolas Church in Domodedovo, was confirmed by the Moscow Region Investigative Committee. According to the prosecutors’ report, the victim took the 22-year-old male suspect by surprise as he was trying to start a fire inside a room of the Sunday school hosted by the church. The perpetrator stabbed the priest, delivering a fatal injury, investigators said. Some media outlets said the cleric was discovered by firefighters responding to the fire. They reportedly found him bleeding out from multiple stab wounds at the stairs of the school building. The prosecutors released footage from the scene, showing what presumably was the blurred-out body of the victim lying by the front door and officers inspecting the charred interior of the site of the arson. Law enforcement said the suspect, a local resident, was apprehended shortly after the knife attack. The statement said the motive for the crime is yet to be established. News outlet Baza claimed that the perpetrator is a former teacher at the Sunday school. Father Sergey allegedly disciplined him for making inappropriate advances toward one of his female teenage students. Baza claimed that the attacker did not try to flee the scene of the crime and surrendered to police when they arrived."
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561326-vladislav-ugolny-31st-independence-of-ukraine/,Vladislav Ugolny: The real root of the Ukraine conflict goes back 100 years and is misunderstood in the West,"Here's how the current narrative goes: Ukraine is at its peak on its 31st Independence Day. Thanks to euphoric national unity, the state was able to resist the Russian army. Kiev is still its capital, Odessa remains under its control and there’s are plenty of fortifications in Donbass for the Ukrainian army to hide behind. However, its eastern fortress is not Mariupol or Severodonetsk anymore, but Avdeevka. Although they prefer to omit this fact. This outcome of the first six months of Russia's military operation may seem like a convincing argument for those who believe Ukraine has a glorious future. Kiev managed to mobilize its defenses in the early days by hectically handing out arms to anybody interested, amassing experienced nationalist fighters in Donbass and bribing regional elites which may have been ready to take Russia’s side – or threatening them. In reality, this is the result of a policy of violence, coercion, deceit, manipulation and alienation, continuously conducted since 1991. It could’ve been called colonial policy if Ukraine were independent from the influence of the Atlantic agenda. But this is ultimately the victory of the pro-Western bloc over their pro-Russian fellow citizens. We have seen this before during the Anglo-French standoffs in America and India. And how did it end for Native Americans and Indians? Not good. And there’s nothing good in store for Ukraine either. Eight years ago, it lost Crimea and the natural resources of Donbass. Today, the former is many things at once: a rapidly developing showcase of the ‘Russian world’ and a constant military threat, as the Black Sea Fleet regularly strikes Ukrainian military targets with Kalibrs. The most successful offensive was also the one launched from the peninsula, giving Russia control over Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk and Mariupol. With just half of Donbass lost in 2014, Ukraine has found itself on the brink of an energy collapse, as its unified coal mining and thermal energy complex was ruined. The need for corrupt schemes to buy coal from Donbass republics arose, making fortunes for oligarch Rinat Akhmetov and ex-president Pyotr Poroshenko. The rebellious Donbass also posed a constant military risk to Ukraine, bringing forth the current war. The most daring and motivated infantry also comes from the region. Both republics have artillery and tanks, but their infantry will be remembered for achieving the impossible for six months already, breaking through the Ukrainian defense in depth. Now in 2022, Ukraine has lost Kherson, half of its Zaporozhye Region and a third of the Kharkov Region. These territories have now been cut out of the Ukrainian economy. No more Kherson watermelons – the delicious sweet fruit ripening under the southern sun. The largest nuclear power plant in Zaporozhye is now controlled by the Russian army, although it still provides electricity for Ukrainian towns. You can’t rush things when it comes to nuclear energy, but the day will come when Ukrainians will lose every watt of energy from the Zaporozhye facility. And that is a force majeure situation. Trying to overcome these circumstances, the Ukrainian nation has spent thirty years in preparation for a conflict with Russia. According to Alexey Arestovich, an ex-spy and now the most popular Ukrainian pundit, this is a ‘meta-historical’ conflict, the climax of a 400-year-long war, after which Ukraine will either be victorious or forgotten. Arestovich is a continentally-inclined philosopher, so he uses some abstruse wording to communicate the same things that Ukrainians are used to hearing in less sophisticated terms – from oligarchs with their criminal 1990s past and former Soviet officials with their Communist party rhetoric. The most concise message would be the typical ‘Glory to Ukraine’ salute which was originally popular in Galicia but was recently adopted more widely. Billionaire criminals, politicians and officials, residents of Galicia – that is the ‘Ukrainian nation’ that is celebrating the anniversary of usurping institutional power and getting privileges, not the country’s independence. Some received the privilege of getting unique access to the privatization of Ukraine’s economy with the right to lobby the interests of their multi-billion-dollar businesses: metallurgy, energy, the food industry, the chemical sector, amber mining, alcohol and tobacco manufacturing, banking, etc. Yes, there are foreign investors in Ukraine, but it’s the local oligarchs that control the most profitable industries. Not sharing the Ukrainian market with other competitors, especially from Russia, has always been their vital interest. They had help from politicians and officials, making the citizens of Ukraine their main source of building wealth. They stole government funds, smuggled contraband, manufactured counterfeit goods, and had their share of the drug and human trafficking market, as well as gambling. The unitarian structure created a situation where government offices could be bought, which helped them make money in the Odessa port or extort it from Kharkov businessmen promising them pain-free tax audits (you needed to have connections in Kiev, where these jobs were distributed). That’s why the authorities always ignored the demands for federalization – the idea of losing the monopoly on the decision-making process freaked them out, especially if it could potentially benefit Moscow. Finally, the residents of Galicia – formerly part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire – joined Ukrainians and became citizens of one country only in 1939. These people were separated from the rest of the nation by religion, dialect, values and history. Galicia had very few industries. The only valuable things about the region were its Polish and Austrian architecture (or what was left of it), a couple of resorts, woods (which have thinned out significantly by now due to uncontrolled deforestation), and a proximity to the EU border that made smuggling and labor migration much easier. This is nothing compared to the riches in the south and east of Ukraine. Galicians soon realized that they possessed the ultimate resource that could secure their region's status as the cultural center of the country: their history, a history that could legitimize both Ukraine’s drive to distance itself from Russia and its attempts to stay independent by assimilating its Russian population – even if it’s exactly the kind of ‘colonial’ policy they often complained about. Galicians became the crusaders of Ukrainization, a restless minority clamoring for its rights. It seemed logical: “We live in Ukraine, so we must speak Ukrainian, mustn’t we?” But there’s only so much time in the school curriculum, so Ukrainian language, literature, and history came to be studied at the expense of other subjects, including Russian. Then the Ukrainian government introduced a unified entrance test for universities, and having a good command of Ukrainian became obligatory for any student-to-be. Children of Russian-speaking families became less competitive. If anyone said that the Russian and Ukrainian languages should have equal footing, Galicians answered that it would lead to the extinction of Ukrainian since it would not be able to compete with Russian. This is only one of the examples of institutional discrimination against the Russian-speaking population of Ukraine. Any political force that tried to protect the rights of Russians was destroyed. Yevgeny Kushnaryov, the former governor of the Kharkov Region, who nearly separated the area from Ukraine in 2005, died on a hunting trip under mysterious circumstances. The ‘Party of the Regions’, which had used his ideas, came to power after his death but didn’t keep its promises to protect the Russian-speaking regions. Neither did it make the Russian language a state language, as it pledged. Another story is the demise of the Rodina party in Odessa, which had been represented in the Odessa city council and whose leader had served in the national parliament. Even the party’s name bears witness to Ukraine’s chauvinistic policy: The names of parties were to be registered in Ukrainian, so the Odessa party had to find a Russian word that would sound exactly the same as a Ukrainian word. As a result, “Fatherland” in Russian had to pretend it was “Family” in Ukrainian. The party was wiped out by the end of 2013, with its leader, Igor Markov, sent to prison and other key figures forced to either emigrate or go into hiding. No one except the people of Odessa spoke up in protest: Rodina was deeply foreign to the Ukrainian state. By the way, repressions against the party came on the orders of the allegedly “pro-Russian” president Yanukovich. As a result, the Russians of Ukraine were left without political representation in a country that had set its sights on assimilating them. By the time Maidan happened, it was clear that Russians in Ukraine faced an uncertain future. Each of them had a choice: run, fight, or surrender. Many chose the first option: From 2015 to 2018, over 400,000 Ukrainian citizens received a Russian passport. For a period after that, the figure is even higher, but that is due to the mass granting of Russian citizenship to the people of Donbass who had stayed on their native soil. Many took up arms after Crimea and the Donbass republics exercised their right to self-determination and used violence to suppress protests in Kharkov, Odessa, and Zaporozhye, driving large numbers from these regions to volunteer. Some have remained and are now waiting for the Russian army to liberate their cities and towns. Video reports from Svetlodarsk and Severodonetsk have captured moments when militiamen’s families see their sons for the first time in eight years and cry tears of joy. Many have given up, however. Not everyone is born a hero and not everyone is prepared to leave everything behind or live a dissident’s life in a hostile environment. This is the tragedy of Russians in Ukraine. This tragedy is the triumph of the Ukrainian state, which took Russian Ukrainians hostage and turned them against Russia. How did it come to pass? Let’s say a long time ago, a small boy dreamed of serving in the military one day. He eventually became a Ukrainian officer and took the oath, making his mom and dad proud. Let’s assume that we’re talking about a Russian-speaking family from Kharkov. The Ukrainian government then started a war in Donbass and called on the boy, now a grown man, to do his duty. The Ukrainian government interpreted the oath to protect the Ukrainian people as a promise to crush the Russians who had risen up in Donbass. The officer faced a dilemma – what was good and what was evil? Some made the right choice and refused to go to war, others made a mistake. Sometimes they had the good intention of trying to prevent greater bloodshed and taking care of conscripts. There were Ukrainian officers in 2014 who avoided escalations and just wanted to save the lives of their subordinates, who had been thrown into the frontlines. Yet, as the war dragged on, people kept dying and the stakes got higher. While children were being killed in Donbass by the Ukrainian army, Russian-speaking Ukrainian servicemen’s friends and colleagues were losing their lives at the hands of the people’s republics’ militias. So the conflict acquired a personal dimension for them. The Russians who made different choices and found themselves on the opposite sides of the divide were killing each other, while the Ukrainian government was celebrating victory. A retailer from Odessa might have also had little admiration for an independent Ukraine, which, in his view, was synonymous with corrupt officials, thuggish law enforcement, and a never-ending economic crisis. Without proper maintenance, his dear city was slowly falling apart. Then the war broke out, making it likely that street fighting would destroy everything he had. What is he to do? Some have resigned to this risk, others hope that the Russians will take Odessa peacefully, while still others have decided (or been told to by Ukrainian radicals) to support the Ukrainian army between Nikolayev and Kherson in the hope that the frontline will stay far away and their livelihoods will be spared. The Russians who are fighting against Ukraine have many questions and harsh words for those Russians who give in to it and support it. This is a tragedy. The most capable units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are made up of Russian-speaking soldiers and officers. Their senior commanders often went to the same military schools as Russia’s senior officers. The only match for a Russian soldier is a Russian soldier. This is what happened a hundred years ago during the Civil War in Russia. It's this factor that runs through the present conflict. “After all, Ukrainians are an interesting and difficult opponent. Probably the most difficult of all possible for us. They are part of the Russian people, only with their brains washed. But at the same time, in other respects, they are carriers of all the same qualities and properties that we have. They know us intimately, as we know them. In terms of psychology and mentality, it’s like being at war with your own shadow,” a Russian soldier wrote in his Telegram blog. NATO has found the perfect way to introduce a hybrid war against Russia: they have set its twin against it and administered arms so it won’t collapse. For Russians, I repeat again, this is a tragedy and a fratricidal war. However, Russians have no alternative because they cannot abandon Donbass or allow the genocidal assimilation of the Russians of Ukraine to continue. Nothing good awaits Ukraine. In their confrontation with Russia, Ukrainians have been forced to resort to the help of the West and, consequently, lost their independence. In the short term, this promises benefits in the form of loans, arms supplies, and diplomatic assistance, but you have to pay for everything in the end. By drawing Western influence into the post-Soviet space, Ukraine has raised the stakes by an order of magnitude. Ukrainians have already lost a lot. Even if the frontline remains as it is now, Kiev will definitely lose the rest of Donbass this winter due to its inability to provide heating there. It will be a snowy field populated by Ukrainian soldiers shivering from the cold, harried by Russian artillery shelling. There will also be vulnerable grandmothers who simply have nowhere to go. Only the Russian army can save them. Everything has been decided with Donbass, but not with Kharkov. The mayor of the city glibly reports on the heroic struggle to prepare for the heating season, but there is a possibility that a large amount of the city’s population of one and a half million will not survive this winter. Kharkov is the second most important city in Ukraine. Zaporozhye may experience similar problems. In any case, the humanitarian crisis caused by the failure of the Ukrainian government to shore up the housing and utilities sector (for example, by not mobilizing its workers to the front) will turn the frontline territory into a no man’s land. Ukraine will lose its economic benefits, and receive only new displaced persons in return. The ‘grain agreement’ allowed the ports of Odessa to hope for the beginning of at least some work, but Ukraine is still under a naval blockade. Trade has risen, but the ports are not actually functioning. In fact, the Odessa metropolitan area has been deprived of its main sphere of activity, and the Ukrainian government is not able to harness its full potential. The city is suffering losses. Its prospects are unclear. The only thing that is actually moving forward in Odessa is a fight against monuments of ‘Russian imperialism’. Since Ukrainians cannot unblock the port, they want to compensate by demolishing a monument to the city’s founder, Catherine the Great. This Independence Day is the apogee for Ukrainian statehood. Ukrainian nationalists were able to use three decades to fool and intimidate others, as well as consolidate and bribe radicals. Thanks to this, Ukraine has withstood six months of confrontation with Russia and will endure for some time. But its defensive strategy will only lead to a slow retreat, a loss of territory, and the inability to ensure the proper administration of the frontline territories. Looking forward, difficulties will only increase and become more complicated, which will lead to a proportional increase in the cost of maintaining Ukraine for the West. Every penny saved means a worsened humanitarian crisis and a further reduction in territory. Where the fear of change initially sparked a national upsurge, now there will be increasing war fatigue, poverty, unemployment, hunger, and cold. In the end, the Russian army will move forward, step by step, with its superior number of artillery barrels, ready to provide humanitarian aid in every liberated Russian city."
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561447-latvia-russian-community-isolation/,Russians in Latvia should be 'isolated' – president,"Ethnic Russians who are not loyal to the Latvian government should be “isolated from society,” the country’s President Egils Levits argued in a radio interview on Wednesday. Discussing the positive and negative effects for Riga of the conflict in Ukraine, Levits called the emergence of “a section of Russian society that is not loyal to the state” a matter of concern. “Our task is to deal with that [section] and isolate it from society,” he added, as cited by the Latvian public broadcaster LSM. The positive effects that the president mentioned included the rise of patriotism and nationalism in the country and growing awareness of the price that has to be paid for freedom. The Latvian government earlier decided to remove several Soviet-era monuments despite the objections of its ethnic Russian community. Some were moved to the Museum of Occupation – which is how the Latvian government perceives the time it was under Moscow’s control – while others were slated for scrapping. According to Levits, Latvians have become more sensitive about such monuments since Russia attacked Ukraine in late February. The Latvian president assessed that the situation in Ukraine proved that the Russian military was not as strong as some people had believed. He pledged that his country would continue providing assistance to Kiev. People living in the Baltic state, as well as in other Western nations, are suffering from inflation and surging energy prices, Levits added, a state of affairs he called the cost of “defeating Russia.”"
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561441-zaporozhye-official-car-bomb-assassination/,Zaporozhye official killed in car bombing,"The top official in the military-civilian administration of Russian-held Mikhailovka, Ivan Sushko, was killed after his car was blown up by Ukrainian saboteurs, Zaporozhye Region Council member Vladimir Rogov announced on Wednesday. “An explosive device was planted under the seat of the car of the head of the settlement. As a result of the explosion, Ivan Sushko was wounded and taken to the hospital in critical condition, where he soon died,” Rogov said on Telegram. Just one day earlier, officials in Kherson Region also reported a blast that was targeted at one of the members of the local administration, according to regional head Kirill Stremousov. He said the perpetrators also used an improvised explosive device and their intended target was Igor Telegin, the deputy head of the department of internal policy of the administration of Kherson Region, which is currently controlled by Russian forces. Stremousov stated that Telegin was not injured as a result of the explosion, which he blamed on local saboteurs."
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561440-ukraine-shells-shopping-mall-donetsk/,Ukraine shells shopping mall in Donetsk – DPR officials,"Ukrainian troops have shelled the Galaktika shopping mall in Donetsk, causing a major fire in the building, Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) emergency officials said on Wednesday. The staff have been evacuated, and there are no casualties, officials said. Photos posted on social media allegedly show huge clouds of thick smoke coming from the building. On Tuesday, Ukrainian forces used NATO-standard artillery shells to bombard residential blocks in Donetsk, killing three civilians, officials said. The office of DPR chief Denis Pushilin took a direct hit, while a hotel where journalists usually stay was also damaged. Pushilin, who was unharmed, accused Kiev of using “terrorist methods” of warfare. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561428-rt-vists-zaporozhye-plant/,Damage to Europe's largest nuclear power plant revealed (VIDEO),"RT has visited the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine, seeing first-hand the aftermath of the shelling of the facility by Kiev's forces. The largest nuclear power plant in Europe was seized by Russian troops in late February. Since then, National Guard and Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defense Troops have been defending the facility as the plant continues to operate with local staff. Kiev’s troops have been firing at the plant and the nearby city of Energodar from the opposite site of the large Kakhovka water reservoir, the Russian Defense Ministry has consistently claimed. The falling shells damaged the facades of some buildings, while missile parts are still stuck in the ground. One of the water pumping stations was hit, but continues to operate as most of the equipment is hidden underground. “This [impact] crater within the vicinity of the cleaning facilities was created last Saturday due to shelling by Ukrainian forces,” RT’s Alexey Repin reports. “Literally 150 meters from here in the plant’s fifth power unit, and it’s still working, just around the corner.” “At the moment, the radiation at the station, as well as the surrounding areas, is within the norms. The shelling hit mostly auxiliary equipment, hydrogen, and oxygen facilities,” a member of the Russian nuclear defense troops told RT. “We’re trying to repair the damage as soon as possible, so that the nuclear plant will not have to halt its operations.” Nevertheless, Moscow has repeatedly warned that the shelling could make the plant inoperable or cause a nuclear disaster similar to the one in Chernobyl in 1986. The shelling had already caused several fires and power outages at the plant this month, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Russian officials have urged the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to send inspectors to the facility as soon as possible. Ukrainian and US officials have accused Russia of shelling the plant and using it as cover for its soldiers."
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561437-ukraine-scorched-earth-shoigu/,Ukraine uses scorched earth tactics – Moscow,"Ukrainian troops are trying to inflict maximum damage to civilian infrastructure, as well as targeting civilians who reside in the areas where they are fighting Russian forces, Moscow's top defense official has claimed. Minister Sergey Shoigu warned, on Wednesday, that Ukrainian military units “are using scorched earth tactics, grossly violate international norms, act like terrorists."" “They use residential areas, schools, kindergartens as firing positions, deploy tanks and artillery guns there, using the population as a human shield,"" he added. He went on to accuse Kiev of remotely mining frontline communities with anti-personnel mines, claiming it is evidence that Ukraine intends “to inflict maximum damage to civilians and civilian infrastructure.” Shoigu was speaking at a meeting of defense ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a regional security group that includes several post-Soviet states, as well as China, India, and Pakistan. Earlier this month, Amnesty International released a report confirming that its inspectors witnessed Ukrainian troops using civilian sites such as schools and hospitals as military bases. Kiev condemned the document, claiming that the human rights organization was aiding Russia by corroborating these facts. Amid the backlash, Amnesty’s German branch said it wanted independent experts to review the process that led to the publication."
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561430-roizman-arrested-youtube-video/,Ex-Russian mayor and Kremlin critic detained,"Russian law enforcement has taken into custody opposition politician Evgeny Roizman, who is reportedly suspected of discrediting the Russian Armed Forces on his YouTube channel. The news broke early Wednesday morning as police arrived at Roizman’s apartment in Ekaterinburg, the Urals city where he served as mayor from 2013 to 2018. The politician spoke to journalists from the window, confirming his status as a detainee and explaining the accusations against him. He said he has been accused of discrediting the Russian Armed Forces and indicated that the investigation against him was initiated “in Moscow” rather than by the local authorities. Journalists outside Roizman’s home reported that they witnessed the seizure of his personal items, such as computer equipment. The office of his foundation was targeted as well, its head confirmed to local media. According to a source cited by TASS, Roizman is being investigated over a video published on his YouTube channel. The politician claimed the case against him was “over one phrase about Ukraine.” Roizman is an outspoken critic of the Russian government, and his opposition activities have gotten him in trouble with the law in the past. He has been fined on numerous occasions for violating regulations regarding public gatherings in the country. This year, after publicly discrediting the military became a fineable offense in Russia, a court in Ekaterinburg found Roizman in violation on several occasions. He has accumulated around $2,500 in fines, according to media reports. A repeat violation of this kind may be considered a criminal offense under Russian law. Roizman came to prominence as a public figure in the early 2000s, thanks to his hardline campaign against drug crime in his city. Before serving as mayor of Ekaterinburg, he was a lawmaker in the Russian State Duma."
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561434-shoigu-ukraine-offensive-pace/,Slow pace of Ukraine operation meant to protect civilians – Moscow,"The Russian military campaign in Ukraine is progressing as intended, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has said. The relatively slow pace is the result of a conscious decision to protect civilian lives, he stated. Speaking at an international event on Wednesday, the minister stated that Russia “strictly follows the norms of humanitarian law” in Ukraine, countering claims to the contrary made by Kiev. “We do everything to avoid casualties among peaceful citizens. Certainly, it slows down the pace of the offensive, but we take this approach consciously,” he added. Shoigu contrasted Russia’s priorities in Ukraine with those of the US and its allies. The ongoing supplying of weapons to Kiev and other Western policies only prolong the conflict and inflate the human cost, he said. Western nations have accused Russia of launching an unprovoked war of aggression against the neighboring country, and have said their military assistance will continue for “as long as it takes.” Moscow, which believes the operation was necessary to stop NATO’s creeping expansion into Ukraine, says its opponents want to “fight to the last Ukrainian” in order to hurt Russia. The senior Russian military official was speaking during a ministerial meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a regional Eurasian security group that counts nations such as China, India, and Pakistan among its members."
2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561414-nebenzia-un-zaporozhye-nuclear/,Evidence of Ukrainian shelling of Zaporozhye provided to UN,"Russia has submitted photographic evidence of Ukrainian attacks on the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant to the UN Security Council and the General Assembly, ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said on Tuesday. He also briefed the Security Council on the most recent attacks, some of which involved NATO-supplied weapons, and insisted that Russia does not use the site as a military base. ""Despite the false statements of the Kiev regime and its backers, Russia has not placed heavy weapons on the territory of the ZNPP and does not use the station for military purposes,” Nebenzia said during the council’s emergency session on Tuesday afternoon. “The Russian Ministry of Defense is ready to provide the IAEA with high-resolution images, which show that weapons, especially heavy ones, are not placed on the territory of the station,” he added. In addition to the photographic evidence of Ukrainian shelling of the plant, Nebenzia entered into the record a timeline of strikes, named the Ukrainian artillery unit involved, and specified which strikes featured M777 howitzers given to Ukraine by the Pentagon. “It seems that our colleagues exist in some kind of their own parallel reality, in which the Russian military shells the NPP it is protecting, using American systems at that,” Nebenzia said. Contrary to insinuations by Kiev and its Western backers, Nebenzia noted, Moscow had given assent to the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit the Zaporozhye NPP back in June, before the Ukrainian drone, artillery and rocket attacks began. Nebenzia blamed the US and its allies for tolerating “criminal” behavior by Ukraine – from the shelling of the Zaporozhye NPP to the car bomb that killed Russian journalist Darya Dugina in Moscow over the weekend, and was cheered by some NATO officials he mentioned by name. The Zaporozhye plant is located in Energodar, a city in southern Ukraine under the control of Russian troops since March. The plant’s civilian staff continued operations unhindered until the artillery attacks began in July. Kiev has denied responsibility for the attacks and accused Russia of shelling the nuclear site to discredit Ukraine, but also of placing troops and heavy weapons inside the NPP’s perimeter and thus making it a legitimate target. The US and its allies used the meeting to demand Russia withdraw from the plant, accuse Moscow of a plot to “steal Ukrainian electricity,” and demand the immediate end of all military operations in ukraine. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday he will personally head the mission to the ZNPP in the coming days, and that the UN nuclear watchdog intends to establish a permanent presence on site."
2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561410-zelensky-take-back-crimea/,Ukraine will seize Crimea ‘by any means necessary’ – Zelensky,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced on Tuesday that Ukraine will take the Russian territory of Crimea, by military force if necessary and without consulting any country, including Kiev’s Western backers. The Ukrainian military’s strikes on the peninsula have thus far been limited. Speaking at the so-called ‘Crimea Platform’, a Ukrainian-organized gathering of 60 nations and international organizations that back Kiev’s claim of sovereignty over Crimea, Zelensky said that “Ukraine is strong and powerful enough” to make the idea of a “Ukrainian Crimea” a reality. “We will return Crimea by any means that we consider correct, without consulting with other countries,” Zelensky said, according to Strana.ua, a Ukrainian news outlet. ""I know that Crimea is with Ukraine, [and] is waiting for us to return. We need to win the fight against Russian aggression. Therefore, we need to free Crimea from occupation.” Considered Russian land since imperial times, Crimea was an autonomous republic within the Soviet Union until it was appended to the Ukrainian SSR by Soviet Premier Nikita Kruschev in 1954 for logistical reasons. The peninsula remained in Ukrainian hands after the fall of the USSR, until its people voted overwhelmingly to join Russia in 2014, after the Kiev government rejected a number of plebiscites during the 1990s aiming at re-establishing Crimea as an independent republic. The US-led NATO alliance considers Crimea to be “illegally annexed” Ukrainian territory, and has demanded that Moscow return the region to Ukrainian control. A US official told Politico last week that Washington has given Ukraine its blessing to strike targets of its choosing in Crimea. Kiev’s military has carried out a number of these strikes in recent weeks, including a drone attack on the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol on Saturday. Explosions at military sites on the peninsula have been blamed by Russia on Ukrainian “sabotage,” but Kiev has neither officially confirmed nor denied responsibility. With its forces tied up fighting Russian and allied troops in Donbass, Ukraine has relied on drones to carry out its sporadic attacks on Crimea. The aim of these attacks is “not military, but psychological,” Crimean official Oleg Kryuchkov stated after Saturday’s strike, adding that owing to their small payload of explosives, drones are unable to inflict extensive damage. Zelensky ruled out the prospect of a ceasefire on Tuesday, telling the summit that Ukraine would not freeze the current front line to ""calm down Russia."" Moscow has repeatedly blamed Kiev for the breakdown of peace talks earlier this year, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accusing Western governments of “keeping Ukraine from any constructive steps” toward a peace settlement."
2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561394-moscow-gay-sex-minors/,Two men could face jail over ‘window sex’ – media,"Two young Muscovites ended up in legal trouble after allegedly having sex by the window of their apartment in the eastern part of the Russian capital, the media outlet Baza reported on Tuesday. The alleged sexual act was witnessed by two boys, aged 12 and 13, who notified their mother of the display. The woman alerted local police, who raided the apartment and detained one of the suspects. The other man willingly turned himself in to police the next day, according to Baza. The suspects were identified only as 21-year old Timur and 22-year-old Daniil. The two men were reportedly placed in pre-trial detention for two months and are facing charges of sexual assault. Given that the victims of the alleged “assault” are below 14 years of age, Timur and Daniil could face lengthy terms of 12-20 years behind bars. In order to convict the two men under that clause, however, prosecutors must prove that they had knowingly and deliberately engaged in sex in front of minors. One of the suspects, meanwhile, reportedly told the police that they were not having sexual intercourse at all and that the boys had misinterpreted what they had seen. According to his account, the two young men were fixing a burst water pipe at the apartment and got undressed to avoid getting wet. Moreover, the mother of one of the suspects denied the young men were even gay, insisting her son has a girlfriend, Baza noted."
2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561398-iaea-zaporozhye-nuclear-mission/,UN team to visit Zaporozhye nuclear plant ‘within days’ – IAEA chief,"International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday he intends to personally visit the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant in Ukraine in the coming days as part of a fact-finding mission. Europe’s largest atomic power station, under Russian control since March, is at risk due to repeated Ukrainian artillery attacks. Grossi told the BBC on Tuesday that he expects to personally lead the IAEA mission “within days, not weeks.” He would not say whether they would travel through territory controlled by Russia or by Ukraine, saying only that such matters need to be “set aside” given the urgency of the situation. The IAEA wants to inspect the integrity of the Zaporozhye NPP, speak to both Russian and Ukrainian staff there, and establish a permanent presence on the ground, Grossi said. Moscow has repeatedly called for an IAEA inspection since the Zaporozhye NPP came under attack in mid-July. The Russian Defense Ministry says Ukrainian artillery is shelling the plant, using rocket launchers provided by NATO. Kiev has denied responsibility and accused Russia of shelling the nuclear site to discredit Ukraine. Kiev has insisted that the IAEA team can only travel to the site through Ukraine. Russia’s permanent envoy to the organization, Mikhail Ulyanov, said last week that he could see an inspection happening “in early September,” provided there was no interference from “external factors that have nothing to do with the goals of the IAEA visit.” Russia wanted an IAEA visit in June, Ulyanov said, but that proposal fell through and “in a sense, things have to be done from scratch now.” The Zaporozhye plant is located in Energodar, a city in southern Ukraine under the control of Russian troops since March. The plant’s civilian staff continued operations unhindered until the artillery attacks began in July. While the US and its allies have demanded that Russia hand the plant back to Ukraine, Kiev has floated the idea of a 30-kilometer demilitarized zone around it. Russia has rejected both demands as unacceptable, citing repeated “provocations” by Ukrainian forces."
2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561383-ukraine-duda-courage-plaque/,Ukraine praises Polish leader,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky unveiled the ‘Alley of Courage’ in central Kiev on Tuesday to celebrate supporters of the fight against Russia. Located outside the national parliament, the venue is to be adorned with plaques embedded in the street reminiscent of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Polish President Andrzej Duda, who visited Kiev to meet Zelensky, took part in the unveiling ceremony, receiving the first plaque at the site. It’s the third time Duda has travelled to Ukraine since the hostilities broke out in late February. “The name of President of Poland Andrzej Duda will always be on this alley. It is a symbol of courage, a symbol of friendship, a symbol of support for Ukraine when it is really needed,” Zelensky said during the ceremony. The Alley will include the names of not only political leaders but other unspecified “partners” from the collective West and elsewhere, who have been assisting the Ukrainian government since the beginning of the conflict, Zelensky added. Poland has been among the top supporters of Kiev, having sent hundreds of tanks, long-range artillery systems and other military hardware to prop up Ukrainian forces in their fight against Russia. Moscow has repeatedly warned the collective West against “pumping” Ukraine with weaponry, insisting such aid would only prolong the conflict rather than change its ultimate outcome. Back in July, Kiev passed a bill that guaranteed Poles rights similar to those of Ukraine’s own citizens. Critics warned that such a move could result in the merger of the countries and possibly the dissolution of the Ukrainian state in the future. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561396-russia-western-values-poll/,Russians increasingly disillusioned with Western values – poll,"The number of Russians who believe Western values to be beneficial to the country has fallen drastically in the last 20 years, according to a poll conducted earlier this month by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VCIOM) and published on Tuesday. “The West is not only a culture, but a whole system of socio-political and economic patterns and models,” wrote the pollsters, noting that while Russian society largely looked to the West in the 1990s, it has since changed its attitude towards Western values. Back in 2000, only 10% of respondents felt that Western democracy and civilization were “harmful for Russians,” according to the poll. Now, however, that number has risen to 26%. Another 33% said that Western civilization and culture were “unsuitable for Russia,” up from 25% in 2000, while over half of those polled, or some 59%, said they didn’t see any benefits to the Western model. It was also noted that in the past 22 years, the share of people in Russia who hold a positive view of Western values has declined from 55% to 30%. “The Western world has ceased to suit Russians as a source of reference points and development vectors. This opinion divides society into two groups,” stated VCIOM. The survey revealed that Western values are embraced the most by younger people aged 18 to 34, 55-50% of whom believe the West is necessary for Russia and has much good to offer. However, after the age of 35 people start to hold opposing views, which intensify among those over 60. Some 70% of respondents in this age group regard Western values as unsuitable or destructive. Over a third of those polled also believe that Western culture has a significant influence on the tastes of Russians, with some 44% saying this influence is “somewhat negative” or “very negative.” The number of Russians who see the influence as positive dropped from 17% in 2000 to just 9% in 2022. The poll revealed that Russians who watch TV are more likely to hold a negative view of the West (78%), while active internet users are almost evenly divided: 44% expressed a negative view, while 48% see the West in a more positive light. The poll was conducted by phone on August 5 and surveyed over 1,600 people from different regions of Russia."
2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561388-donetsk-shelling-govt-office/,Latest deadly attack on Donetsk: What we know,"Ukrainian troops bombarded government buildings and residential areas in Donetsk with Western-supplied shells and missiles on Tuesday, Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) officials have said. According to the city’s emergency services, three civilians were killed and six injured as several apartment complexes and vehicles were damaged. Officials stated that NATO-standard 155mm caliber shells were used in the attack. DPR head Denis Pushilin’s office took a direct hit, with the upper floor of the building destroyed. Pushilin, who was not at his workplace during the attack, is unharmed. The deputy information minister of the DPR, Daniil Bezsonov, said that Pushilin’s office was struck with a missile fired from a US-made M142 HIMARS launcher. The city’s Central Hotel, where journalists usually stay, was also shelled. The facade of a school was damaged as well. There were no reports of casualties in either the office building, or in the hotel. In a video address outside his damaged office, Pushilin argued that the West bears responsibility for the attack by providing weapons to Ukraine. “This makes the West complicit in the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Donetsk,” he said, accusing Kiev of using “terrorist methods” of warfare. Kiev has not commented on the matter. Ukrainian officials previously alleged that their troops only strike military targets."
2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561376-ukraine-russia-conflict-us/,"A nuclear showdown? One of the greatest 'realist' fears about the Russia-Ukraine conflict is actually groundless, and here's why","Fears that the Ukraine conflict is now bogged down into some sort of stalemate which risks dangerous escalation from the parties involved in order to achieve victory are misplaced. There is only one victor in the Ukraine conflict, and that is Russia. Nothing can change this reality. Renowned American intellectual John Mearsheimer has written an important article about the conflict, entitled: ‘Playing with Fire in Ukraine: The Underappreciated Risks of Catastrophic Escalation’. The article paints a dark picture about both the nature of the war in Ukraine (prolonged stalemate) and probable outcome (decisive escalation by the parties involved to stave off defeat). Mearsheimer’s underpinning premises, however, are fundamentally flawed. Russia possesses the strategic initiative – militarily, politically, and economically – when it comes to the war in Ukraine and the larger proxy engagement with NATO. Moreover, neither the US nor NATO is in a position to escalate, decisively or otherwise, to thwart a Russian victory, and Russia has no need for any similar escalation on its part. In short, the Ukraine conflict is over, and Russia has won. All that remains is a long and bloody mopping up. The key to understanding how Mearsheimer got it so wrong is to dissect his understanding of the ambitions of both the US and Russia when it comes to the issue. According to Mearsheimer, “Since the war began, both Moscow and Washington have raised their ambitions significantly, and both are now deeply committed to winning the war and achieving formidable political aims.” This passage is especially difficult to parse out. First and foremost, it is extremely difficult to articulate a sound baseline when it comes to assessing US “ambitions” vis-à-vis Ukraine and Russia. President Joe Biden's administration inherited a policy which had been conceived in the George W. Bush-era and partially implemented under the team of Barack Obama (where Biden played a critical role). This was a very aggressive policy geared toward undermining Russia with the goal of weakening the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to such an extent that eventually he would be replaced by a figure more amenable to adhering to a US-dictated policy line. But one cannot pretend that there were not four years of Trump administration policy which threw the anti-Putin – and, by extension, anti-Russia – narrative promulgated by the Obama administration on its head. While Trump was never able to gain traction for his ‘why can’t we be friends’ approach to US-Russian diplomacy, he was able to seriously undermine two major policy pillars which propped the Obama-era policy up, namely NATO unity and Ukrainian solidarity. The Biden administration was never able to resuscitate the Obama-era policy direction regarding Russia, inclusive of its anti-Putin goals and objectives. Trump’s undermining of NATO's unity and purpose, when combined with the humiliating pull-out from Afghanistan, put the bloc on the back foot when it came to standing up to the challenge of a Russian state determined to be more assertive about what it viewed as its legitimate national security interests, inclusive of a new European security framework respectful of the notion of a Russian ‘sphere of influence’. Instead, the world was treated to the spectacle of Joe Biden insulting his Russian counterpart with cartoonish ‘he’s a killer’ comments, all the while making promises regarding diplomatic initiatives (pressuring Ukraine to accept Minsk II, starting ‘meaningful’ arms control talks) that his administration proved unable and/or unwilling to follow through on. When confronted with the reality of a Russian military build-up around Ukraine, the best the Biden administration could do was make empty military threats and even emptier promises about “meaningful and unprecedented” economic sanctions should Russia intervene militarily. The fact is, while US government officials may make bold statements about the need to inflict harm, via proxy, on the Russian military through the provision of billions of dollars’ worth of weapons to Ukraine, it is the US which has had defeat inflicted on it in terms of the ongoing losses of its Ukrainian proxy military and the destruction of the equipment provided in support. The US, like its NATO allies, has proven to be very good at making bold pronouncements about goals and intent, but very bad at putting them into practice. This is the state of American ‘ambitions’ vis-à-vis Ukraine today – all rhetoric, no meaningful action. Any fear of a US and/or NATO military intervention in Ukraine must be weighed against the reality that hot air does not generate cold steel; US politicians might be adept at filling the pages of a compliant mainstream media with impressive-sounding words, but neither the US military nor its NATO allies are able to generate the kind of meaningful military capability needed to effectively challenge Russia on the ground in Ukraine. This reality severely limits the scope and scale of any possible US ambitions regarding Ukraine. At the end of the day, Washington has only one path forward – to continue to waste billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money sending military equipment to Ukraine, which has no chance of changing the outcome on the battlefield, to convince a domestic American audience that their government is ‘doing the right thing’ in a losing effort. There is no ‘military option’ in Ukraine for either the US or NATO because, simply put, there is no military capable of meaningfully executing such an option. This conclusion is critical to understanding Russia’s ‘ambitions’. Unlike the US, Russia has articulated clear and concise objectives regarding its decision to dispatch military forces into Ukraine. These can be described as follows: Permanent Ukrainian neutrality (i.e., no NATO membership), the de-Nazification of Ukraine (the permanent eradication of the odious nationalistic ideology of Stepan Bandera), and the de-militarization of the state – the destruction and elimination of all traces of NATO involvement in the security affairs of Ukraine. These three objectives only reflect the immediate goals of the Special Military Operation in Ukraine. The ultimate objective – a restructured European security framework that has all NATO infrastructure withdrawn to the 1997 boundaries of that alliance – remains as a non-negotiable requirement that will have to be addressed after Russia secures its final military and political victory in Ukraine. In short, Russia is winning on the ground in Ukraine, and there is nothing either the US or NATO can do to alter this outcome. And once Russia secures this victory, it will be in a far stronger position to insist that its concerns about a viable European security framework be respected and implemented. Mearsheimer believes that the situation on the ground in Ukraine provides both the US and Russia with “powerful incentives to find ways to prevail and, more important, to avoid losing.” At the end of the day, the Ukraine conflict is not an existential one for either the US or NATO; a loss in Ukraine will be another setback – Afghanistan on steroids. But a Ukrainian defeat does not, in and of itself, threaten NATO with collapse or spell the end of the American Republic. Simply put, Mearsheimer’s fear that a loss in Ukraine “means that the United States might join the fighting either if it is desperate to win or to prevent Ukraine from losing” is unfounded. So, too, is his contention that “Russia might use nuclear weapons if it is desperate to win or faces imminent defeat, which would be likely if US forces were drawn into the fighting.” Russia neither “faces defeat” nor has anything to worry about, existentially, from a US military intervention which, from all practical points of view, could not materialize even if the US wanted to be so bold. Mearsheimer concludes his article by noting that “This perilous situation creates a powerful incentive to find a diplomatic solution to the war.” Nothing could be further from the truth. Just as the US would be loath to seek a “diplomatic solution” to the conflicts waged against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, Russia would be similarly disinclined to engage in any diplomacy which denied it the full implementation of its core objectives. Back in March, in response to a tweet from Joe Biden which declared “Let there be no doubt that this war has already been a strategic failure for Russia,” I responded by tweeting, “This war will go down in history as a strategic Russian victory. Russia will have halted NATO expansion, destroyed a dangerous den of Nazi ideology in Ukraine, redefined European security by undermining NATO, and demonstrated Russian military prowess, an important deterrent.” Those words were accurate then, and they remain accurate today."
2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561384-lavrov-mercy-dugina-killers/,‘No mercy’ for killers of Russian journalist – Lavrov,"Moscow will show no mercy towards those responsible for the death of Darya Dugina, Russian Foreign Minister Segey Lavrov has said. Investigators have accused Kiev of masterminding a plot to kill the journalist and political commentator in a car bombing. “I consider it a barbaric crime for which no forgiveness can be granted,” Lavrov said on Wednesday, when asked about the murder, which took place on Saturday evening. The Russian investigation into the assassination will hopefully identify all the culprits soon, the minister added. “Certainly, the organizers, the middlemen and the executors can get no mercy,” he said. When asked whether the killing was “an act of terrorism or personalized retaliation,” Lavrov declined to offer a judgment. He made the comments during a joint press conference with his Syrian counterpart, Faisal Mekdad, in the Russian capital. The FSB, Russia’s domestic security agency, identified a Ukrainian woman, Natalya Vovk, as the suspected assassin. She had entered Russia with her teenage daughter and rented an apartment in the same block where Dugina lived. She had allegedly been present at the same public event as the journalist, upon the conclusion of which the latter’s car was blown up, according to investigators. Vovk fled to Estonia before she could be apprehended, the FSB said. There is an image of an ID bearing the suspect’s name circulating online indicating that she is a member of a Ukrainian National Guard unit known as the Azov Battalion, which has been widely reported as enlisting radical Ukrainian nationalists in its ranks. Russia believes that Vovk acted on an order from the Ukrainian government. Kiev has denied any involvement in the bombing. Dugina was the daughter of philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, a controversial thinker known for his advocacy of Russian exceptionalism. He is often described in the Western media as having behind-the-scenes influence on the Kremlin’s foreign policy. Darya, a public figure of some prominence in her own right, shared some of her father’s ideas about Russia’s place in the world. The car targeted by the killer had belonged to Dugin, who was reportedly supposed to accompany his daughter but at the last moment ended up taking a different vehicle."
2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561377-russian-troops-nikolaev-region/,Russian troops make signficant advance in Ukraine – Moscow,"Russian troops have made advances into Ukraine’s Nikolaev Region, a strategically important area in the south of the country, the Defense Ministry in Moscow reported on Tuesday. According to the ministry’s spokesman, Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, Russian and allied forces have destroyed Ukrainian military units defending the town of Aleksandrovka and managed to reach the administrative border of Nikolaev Region. The town is in Ukraine’s Kherson Region, which has mostly been under Russian control for months. It lies on the coast of the Dnieper-Bug estuary, through which the waters of both rivers flow into the Black Sea. The Bug River comes from the north, where the city of Nikolaev, the capital of the eponymous region, an important industrial and port city, and major stronghold of the Ukrainian military, is located. Konashenkov also said that elsewhere in southern Ukraine, Russian troops have advanced into Nikolaev Region and have taken control of 12 square kilometers (4.6 square miles). He identified the location of the advancement as near the village of Komsomolskoye. Russian forces were already in control of a small southeastern portion of Nikolaev Region, which borders Kherson Region. Earlier in August, Nikolaev’s regional authorities announced a major crackdown on suspected Russian sympathizers in the provincial capital. The city was placed on a two-day lockdown while law enforcement screened for potential “collaborators” reporting intelligence matters to Russia. Vitaly Kim, the head of the administration, said he did not trust anyone in the city to be loyal to Kiev and hinted that he could order a Bolshevik-style purge of “traitors.”"

Pyotr Vrublevsky, the Ukrainian ambassador to the Central Asian country, told a local blogger in an interview about the Ukraine conflict on Monday: “We are trying to kill as many [Russians] as possible. The more Russians we kill now, the fewer our children will have to.” “In our country, where peace and unity are the key principles of state policy and societal consolidation, such statements are unacceptable and inappropriate, no matter who makes them,” the APK, an advisory body to the president of Kazakhstan, said in a statement on its website on Tuesday. “Diplomacy must serve the ideals of peace and cooperation, not hatred and animosity.” “The language of animosity is foreign to us,” the APK said, adding that “the propaganda of ethnic hatred is unacceptable in any form.” The Ukrainian diplomat’s words sparked outrage in Russia and among the Russian community in Kazakhstan. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram that “only an ambassador of a terrorist regime can say such things.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

The video shows ten people crowding inside what is claimed to be the consultation room of a neurologist. She is seen asking the patients to do the simple finger-to-nose test – which can help diagnose issues with proprioception. The doctor then asks the cameraperson to close the door and wait outside. The footage was published on Wednesday on local social media in Yakutsk and went viral nationwide. Some news outlets called the neurologist “the laziest doctor ever.” The hospital reacted to its unexpected five minutes of fame by reporting that it had launched a disciplinary investigation into the incident and would take action depending on the outcome.
2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561357-zakharova-us-dugina-murder/,Russia slams US reaction to murder of journalist,"The US has no moral right to lecture any nation about human rights after downplaying the assassination of Russian journalist Darya Dugina, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has said. Moscow has accused Kiev of masterminding the car bombing that resulted in her death. The reaction of the US Department of State to the high-profile murder and the evidence that Russia released in the investigation discredits Washington’s claim that it is concerned about human rights, Zakharova said on Tuesday in a social media post. “Washington has no moral right … to judge the state of human rights in faraway places if they don’t even comment on the murder of a journalist,” despite claiming to care about protecting the media, she said. “They simply did not take notice that she was a public figure.” Dugina was killed by a bomb planted under the car of her father, controversial Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin. She was a notable figure in her own right, working as a journalist and advocating for nationalist causes in Russia. Russian investigators said they identified the killer as a Ukrainian woman, who allegedly cased out her target beforehand, going as far as renting an apartment in the same block where Dugina lived. Open-source data indicate that the suspect, Natalya Vovk, serves in the Ukrainian military. Moscow accused Kiev of ordering the assassination, which the Ukrainian government has denied. Ned Price, the spokesman for the US Department of State, commented on the death of Dugina on Monday, stating that Washington “unequivocally [condemns] the targeting of civilians,” be they in Ukraine or Russia. “I don’t have anything to share beyond what you have all heard publicly, and that is that Ukraine has denied any involvement,” he said. Price added that he has “no doubt that the Russians will put forward certain conclusions” after investigating the bombing."

The proposals are being drawn up by an advisory group headed by former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. ""We believe security guarantees to be a very important issue, we constantly discuss this matter with all our partners. We talked about this today as well, and I’m glad that our partners are interested… By the end of this month, I think on the 29th or 30th, we can count on the first document emerging,” Yermak told reporters after a meeting with aides to the presidents of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Hungary. The Ukrainian official noted that he had already gone over the paper, touting it as “very powerful.” Earlier this month, in a Guardian op-ed, Yermak said Ukraine was preparing recommendations on security guarantees. He signaled that while Kiev’s long-term goal remains NATO membership, what he termed “Russia’s current belligerence” makes accession difficult. He believes Kiev needs legally binding guarantees from its partners for weapons deliveries, the exchange of intelligence, and the support of its defense and economy. On Tuesday, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev commented on the talks, saying that any security guarantees for Ukraine could have only been provided by Russia, but Kiev has given up that chance. “No one will accept Ukraine into NATO now. The alliance consists of Russophobes, but it is not suicidal,” he said."

2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561303-hungary-russia-eurocrat-elites/,"Kirill Teremetsky: Hungary is not Russia’s ally, but it’s a rare rational partner in an increasingly fanatical EU","We are witnessing a clash between Eastern European Realpolitik, the followers of which still remember Hans Morgenthau’s precepts about the primacy of the national interest, and the broader Western ideology and politics of high hopes and illusions. In this, mutually beneficial bilateral ties are sacrificed in favor of political agendas. On August 21, Hungarian oil and gas giant MOL and Slovakia’s Slovnaft paid for Russian oil transit through Ukraine. Kiev’s UkrTransNafta did not accept payment from Moscow’s Gazprombank allegedly because of sanctions. The stopping of transit through the Druzhba pipeline was another step to pressure Russia, which could not have taken place without the approval of their Western partners. But why is Hungary itself willing to look for ways to pay for Russian energy resources in an emergency and go against the EU’s sanctions policy? And why did Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto go to Moscow at the end of July for talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, about additional gas supplies? Despite the cooling of Hungarian-Ukrainian relations after 2014 and the lack of official support from Budapest for the Kiev authorities, Hungarian oil and gas company MOL has transferred €300,000 and sent special equipment worth €50,000 to keep the Ukrainian gas transmission system functioning during the Russian military operation. Hungary is concerned about the continuity of energy supplies from Ukraine, as it is 60% dependent on Russian oil (with another 16% coming from Kazakhstan, which also uses the Druzhba pipeline) and 85% on Russian gas. Thanks to stable and pragmatic bilateral relations between Russia and Budapest, long-term contracts have been concluded, allowing the country to buy energy resources at a price five times lower than the broader European market. The $10 billion project signed in 2014 between Rosatom and Hungary’s MVM to build two units of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant, which despite the political environment has been successfully implemented, allows Hungary to remain an attractive country for big business and foreign investment, thanks to its cheap electricity. All this helps Viktor Orban’s ruling Fidesz-CDPP coalition to make and keep promises to voters in the form of relatively low petrol and gas prices and lower electricity tariffs. They are also able to use pre-election populist measures such as thirteenth salaries and extra social payments, and influence public opinion through the media (MOL and energy company MVM Group are sponsors of Hungarian government publications) and student institutions. MOL will pay its shareholders a dividend of $652 million this year. One of the beneficiaries and shareholders (30.5%) are nominally non-governmental foundations that fund educational institutions such as Corvinus University and Mathias Corvinus Collegium. This helps the ruling party influence the formation of the ‘right’ view among students on political processes taking place in Hungary. At the same time, Budapest is diversifying its energy sector and trying to gradually reduce its dependence on Russian raw materials. Budapest buys LNG from Croatia, participates in gas projects in the UAE and Oman, and has a strategic partnership agreement with ExxonMobil (although a pipeline project from Romania proved unsuccessful). Hungarian operator FGSZ and Serbia’s Srbijagas completed an interconnector at the border between the countries for supplies through Turkish Stream on July 5, 2021, so the Hungarian government will buy natural gas from Azerbaijan from 2023. Hungary imports oil from Iraq and Iran, and cooperates in this sector with Kuwait and Bahrain, while developing its own fields (in the Baranja region). On May 18, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, unveiled a plan to move away from Russian energy, called REPowerEU. Up to €300 billion is planned to be allocated for the modernization of the bloc’s energy sector. The Hungarian side vetoed the sixth package of sanctions on Russia, which initially envisaged a complete rejection of Russian energy supplies. According to Foreign Minister Szijjarto, up to €18 billion would be needed to upgrade and refocus the country’s oil and gas industry. Szijjarto has repeatedly stated that Hungary has already lost more than €10 billion due to the imposition of economic sanctions on Russia in 2014. If the EU had adopted the sixth sanctions package in full, it would have been, as Orban put it, a real “nuclear blow” to the Hungarian economy. Gasoline prices in the country, according to him, would have at least doubled. Therefore, for Hungary and some individual CEE countries, reliefs were granted in the form of a postponement of the embargo on oil and gas supplies from Russia until 2024. In 2017, after the freezing at the time of Nord Stream 2, Orban blasted Western countries (especially Germany) given that they were already supplied with Russian gas thanks to the first branch of Nord Stream, while Budapest had no such guarantees of uninterrupted supplies (it was hardly controversial to say that Ukraine is not the most reliable transit country). In this context, the prime minister actively supported the Turkish Stream project. On May 21 of this year, during a press conference, Szijjarto asked why an embargo on offshore oil supplies from Russia should not be imposed. After all, Hungary, unlike most countries that more actively support the sanctions, does not have access to the sea; it gets its energy by land. In doing so, the minister once again rebuked the Western EU comrades for double standards. Budapest’s stance really irritates the European Commission, which has already accused the Hungarian authorities and Orban personally of undermining the bloc’s unity during the refugee crisis. Eurocrats have criticized the country for high levels of corruption and shutting down ‘free’ media, while repeatedly threatening to cut funding from the EU’s stabilization fund. In addition, Budapest does not support the bloc’s desire to arm Ukraine and does not allow the supply of military equipment through its territory to Transcarpathia. The EU either has to make an exception for Hungary and subsequently allow the purchase of Russian energy until the expiry of the contracts (and negotiate again with Budapest at the end of this period, at the same time gradually connecting Hungary to the newly developing energy infrastructure) or pay the amount of money that Budapest has estimated for modernizing the energy sector (adding to the money Hungary has not received to cushion the economic effects of the pandemic). Of course, due to the urgency of the circumstances, Brussels may decide in the future on a new package of sanctions without taking into account Hungary’s opinion, but then the EU can expect a new Brexit (analysts have been writing about Hungary’s possible exit from the association for a long time), which, in the current circumstances, is absolutely unacceptable to the ruling circles of the EU. This relationship between official Brussels and Orban suggests that the Hungarian government will continue to take a tough line on the Russian oil and gas embargo. It is clear that Hungary is not going to follow anyone’s orders to its detriment. For the Orban government, the Hungarian people (not the politicians in Brussels or Washington) and the Hungarian economy (not the pan-European ideology) come first. The Hungarian government follows pragmatism in its foreign policy and is ready to defend its position on the international scene. Hungary is only comfortable with win-win projects, such as the reconstruction of the Belgrade-Budapest railway to speed up the delivery of Chinese goods from the Greek port of Piraeus (China is paying all the costs for its ‘Silk Road’ and the Hungarian government is promoting the initiative in Europe). The European Commission’s plan to move away from Russian energy carriers, developments in Ukraine, Poland’s desire to influence the agenda in Europe, and Washington’s dream of increasing the EU’s dependence on its energy carriers could spur the development of the 2016 TSI project (or ‘Three Seas Initiative’, which includes 12 countries, including Hungary). This project involves transporting liquefied natural gas (and eventually oil) from the US through offshore terminals in Poland and Croatia, and in the future, also Norwegian gas – the first deliveries to Poland via the new Baltic Pipe pipeline from Norway are planned for October 2022. It is worth keeping an eye on developments in the Three Seas Initiative, as Poland already has experience in buying and selling US LNG, and Croatia has been re-selling it to Hungary and other countries since 2021. In May, the Polish authorities decided to terminate the Yamal intergovernmental agreement with Russia on gas supplies, concluded in 1993. In fact, the US-Polish project is already underway. With proper funding and political will on the part of the EU, the TSI infrastructure network could be successfully completed in the next few years. Hungary is not an ally of Russia, but it is a consistent and rational business partner. And there are few such states left in Europe. In the current circumstances, working contacts are needed with the Hungarian side regarding the possible prolongation of the energy supply agreements (so that any REPowerEU proposal looks completely unprofitable). The July meeting between Szijjarto and Lavrov proves that the channels of communication between the countries are established, and we understand and hear each other."
2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561355-volodin-zelensky-tribunal-mariupol/,Zelensky ‘has reasons to fear’ tribunal – Moscow,"President Vladimir Zelensky fears that his complicity in war crimes will be exposed during a planned trial of Ukrainian troops, the speaker of the Russian State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, has claimed. This is why he threatened to cut off all talks with Moscow if Russia’s ally in Donbass goes ahead with plans to launch a tribunal in Mariupol later this month. Writing on social media on Tuesday, Volodin said “everybody” is looking forward to the tribunal, except Zelensky, “who considers it unacceptable.” “He and the Kiev regime have reasons to be afraid,” he added. “He and his inner circle ordered to bomb, shoot and kill peaceful citizens: the elderly, women, children. That is why Zelensky is doing everything to prevent the tribunal.” The lawmaker was referring to a statement Zelensky made on Monday about the scheduled trial of Ukrainian troops captured by the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), an ally of Russia. The Ukrainian leader called the proceedings a “despicable show trial” and “the line beyond which any negotiations are impossible.” The DPR captured hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers during the battle for the city of Mariupol, including members of the notorious Azov Battalion, which has in its ranks fighters openly displaying neo-Nazi views and sympathies. Some of them have been accused of committing serious crimes during intensive fighting against DPR militias and Russian troops. Volodin called for the trial to be held publicly, “so that the world community will know about the crimes against humanity committed by the Kiev regime.”"

Earlier, Riga city council decided to demolish the installation despite a number of protests. Russia’s Zvezda TV reported that the demolition of the WWII Victory Memorial had already begun, with an excavator removing the stairway leading to sculptures depicting three Soviet soldiers. The city authorities earlier refused to grant permission for a protest by the Latvian Russian Union political party, which the organizers had planned to hold on Monday to denounce the removal of the monument. According to Latvia’s LSM media outlet, officials cited the “opinion of security services,” as well as the fact that the rally would have taken place in an area “currently cordoned off due to the demolition process.” In an interview with Latvia’s LTV network last Wednesday, Riga Mayor Martins Stakis said the WWII memorial, once dismantled, will be “sent for recycling.” The official claimed that the “Museum of the Occupation of Latvia has not recognized any part of the monument as artistically valuable.” Stakis added that a park will be built in place of the memorial. The Riga City Council passed its decision in May, though calls for the removal of this and other Soviet war memorials have been made in the Baltic nation for years. Some see the monuments as symbols of “Soviet re-occupation,” and the launching of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine in February intensified public debate over the memorials. Also in May, the Latvian parliament voted overwhelmingly in favor of unilaterally renouncing part of a treaty with Russia which guaranteed protection for Soviet war monuments in the country."

The State Department evacuated US diplomats from Kiev in February. The embassy in the Ukrainian capital was then formally reopened in May. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

After becoming the world’s first-registered Covid-19 vaccine in August 2020, the Sputnik V has been approved for use in around 70 countries. According to a Russian study published in the peer-reviewed Vaccines journal in June, the existing version of Sputnik V is 97% effective against hospitalization with Omicron in patients vaccinated with three or four components (revaccination with Sputnik Light or Sputnik V after Sputnik V)."

The car bombing that killed Dugina shows the true nature of the Ukrainian state and the UN Security Council will be briefed about it in an upcoming meeting, Russia’s permanent representative to the body, Vassily Nebenzia, added. “We have asked for an urgent meeting tomorrow on Zaporozhye, where Ukrainian provocations continue,” Nebenzia told TASS, adding that he will bring up Saturday’s car bombing in Moscow in that context. The attack “clearly demonstrates the nature of the Ukrainian state,” the ambassador added. “The connection between their saboteurs and this murder is obvious, and has already been revealed by the FSB.” Dugina, 29, was the daughter of philosopher Aleksandr Dugin. They attended a festival outside Moscow on Saturday. She was killed in the explosion of a bomb planted in her father’s Toyota SUV. A source within the Russian security service told TASS on Monday that Dugina herself was the intended target, and that the bomb was detonated remotely once the killer knew she was behind the wheel. The FSB has identified the suspect as Ukrainian national Natalya Vovk, 43. The Russian security service released a video on Monday showing Vovk entering the country in July with Donetsk People’s Republic license plates and in the company of her teenage daughter. Vovk was also registered as renting an apartment in the same Moscow building as Dugina, and hastily leaving the country on Sunday – crossing into Estonia with Ukrainian license plates and her hair a different color. Ukraine has denied any official involvement with the bombing. According to Russian media, however, Vovk appeared in the database of Ukrainian National Guard personnel published in April, under the surname Shaban and linked to the neo-Nazi “Azov” regiment."

On Monday, Dugin blamed the Ukrainian government for the murder and said he wanted a military victory rather than revenge. “As you know, in a terrorist act by the Nazi Ukrainian regime, my daughter Darya was savagely murdered before my eyes on August 20, while returning from the ‘Tradition’ festival near Moscow,” Dugin said in a statement released by his ally, conservative tycoon Konstantin Malofeyev. Darya was “a beautiful Orthodox girl, a patriot, a military correspondent, a TV expert and a philosopher. Her speeches and reporting have always been profound, grounded and restrained. She never called for violence or war. She was a rising star at the beginning of her journey,” Dugin wrote. “The enemies of Russia killed here dishonorably, on the sly.” Such acts of terrorism want to break the will of Russians by targeting the best and most vulnerable among them, Dugin said, adding that the terrorists will not succeed. Wishing for simple revenge or retribution would be “too petty, and un-Russian,” he added. “Instead, we need victory,” Dugin wrote. “So win, please!” Dugina was driving her father’s Toyota SUV when it exploded, leading Russian authorities to suspect the bomb was meant for him. The FSB has identified the perpetrator as Ukrainian national Natalya Vovk, 43. On Monday, the Russian security service released a video showing Vovk entering the country as a brunette with Donetsk People’s Republic license plates last month. She was accompanied by her teenage daughter, whose surname was given as Shaban. Vovk was also registered as renting an apartment in the same Moscow building as Dugina, and leaving the country hurriedly on Sunday – crossing into Estonia with Ukrainian license plates and her hair dyed blonde. Vovk, under the surname Shaban, appeared on the list of Ukrainian National Guard personnel that was published in April on the Russian internet. The doxx claimed she was associated with the “Azov” neo-Nazi regiment. Ukraine has denied any official involvement in the bombing."

Dugina “showed with her actions what it means to be a patriot of Russia,” the president added, blasting her murder as a “heinous and cruel crime.” The 29-year-old journalist was the daughter of anti-Western author and political commentator Aleksandr Dugin. Darya herself was also known for her active support of the ongoing Russian military offensive in Ukraine. She was killed while returning from a conservative family festival held outside of Moscow. A bomb was planted under Dugina’s car, according to Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). The agency has identified the prime suspect behind the murder as Ukrainian national Natalya Vovk. According to some media, Vovk allegedly served in Ukraine’s National Guard and was reportedly a member of the Azov Battalion, which has fighters who openly hold nationalist and neo-Nazi views. Dugina was driving a Toyota SUV that belonged to her father when the bomb went off, suggesting that Dugin may have been the intended target. Kiev has denied any relation to the incident, saying that Ukraine “has nothing to do with this.” The Russian president has posthumously awarded Darya Dugina the Order of Courage."

Published on National Flag Day, the survey suggested that people tend to link the word ‘Russia’ with the official national symbols, the Russian people and their motherland. “Our fellow citizens have only positive associations with the word ‘Russia’,” the polling agency said in a statement, adding that these include “nature, history, architectural landmarks, cities, animals, culture and literature” among others. The biggest group of respondents (12%) linked Russia to its national symbols – the flag, emblem and national anthem. Almost as many people, a respective 11% and 10%, said they associate it with “the people"" and ""home."" Around 7% of Russians named Putin as the symbol of Russia and just as many mentioned the country's nature, such as the birch tree or Siberia’s Lake Baikal, the biggest freshwater lake in the world. The poll showed that young Russians tend to associate their nation with Putin more closely than their older compatriots. Among those aged between 18 and 24, 10% saw Putin as the symbol of Russia. The bear was named by just 5% of respondents. On Monday, Putin addressed the nation on National Flag Day and said that the flag “remained Russia’s symbol in difficult, challenging periods of its history,” including World War I and “the contradictory, arduous 1990s” that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. The flag has become “a symbol of the unity of our people and their devotion to the Fatherland and readiness to uphold national interests,” the president said, adding that it “symbolizes our faith in our traditional values that we will never give up – truth and justice, solidarity and mercy, and respect for Russia’s centuries-long uninterrupted history.” Russia is a “strong, independent world power” that is “committed” to defending its national interests and will not “permit any foreign hegemony or diktat,” he added. His words came amid the ongoing Russian military operation in Ukraine, which has led to unprecedented tensions between Moscow and the West. The US and its allies in Europe and elsewhere have subjected Russia to harsh sanctions. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

At around 1pm local time, Kiev’s forces launched a series of attacks using US-made HIMARS artillery systems. The shelling was apparently meant to sabotage Russian efforts to repair the bridge after previous attacks, local emergency services said. At the moment of the attack, a crew of civilian employees from the local repair and restoration team were working on the bridge while a ferry carrying civilians was passing underneath it. The shelling left two people dead and 16 injured. Another three people are yet to be accounted for, according to local authorities. A representative for the local emergency services told TASS news agency that there were no losses among those who are tasked with ensuring the transfer of civilians across the Dnieper river. Meanwhile, Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Kherson region, said that the Antonovsky Bridge was not destroyed as a result of the attack, but had sustained significant damage. Earlier this month, Ukraine’s forces conducted a series of attacks on the bridge that connects the Russian-controlled city of Kherson with the rest of southern Ukraine. While the attack on August 8 did not lead to any casualties, it managed to destroy several pieces of equipment that had been brought to the site to repair damages from previous artillery strikes and caused local authorities to keep the bridge closed to all traffic. While the bridge has been closed for nearly a month now, Russian forces have launched a ferry to transport civilians from one side of the Dnieper river to the other. Local authorities also reportedly plan to build a pontoon bridge that will connect the two shores and be easier to repair in case of an attack by the Ukrainian side."

The more Russians we kill now, the fewer our children will have to. That’s it,” he said. The Ukrainian envoy’s remarks sparked anger in Russia, with Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accusing Kiev of ‘terrorist’ policies. “Only an ambassador of a terrorist regime can say such things. The Kiev Nazis have been killing people for eight years silently and blaming Moscow for everything, but now they are openly talking about their ethnic cleansing plans,” she wrote on Telegram. Earlier this month, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev accused Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky of taking a page out of Adolf Hitler’s playbook by calling for the collective punishment of all Russians. Medvedev was referring to a previous statement by Zelensky in which he suggested deporting all Russians – regardless of their political leanings or circumstances – from Western countries. “Adolf Hitler tried to implement such ideas about an entire people,” the Russian official remarked. “Any more questions about the nature of the Ukrainian authorities?”"

2022-08-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/561163-russian-flag-history/,"Jesus, Byzantium and the Slavic legacy: The true meaning behind the Russian flag explained","Every national flag distills the history and values of the people it represents. America's star-spangled banner is a great example of this. The Russian flag and its coat of arms, which predate it by a hundred years, are equally steeped in history. They have undergone changes in the last couple of centuries, but these symbols have retained the link between Moscow and the Byzantine Empire, the idea of Slavic brotherhood, and references to the country’s naval history. As Russia celebrates National Flag Day, RT sheds some light on its origins. The traditional symbol used by medieval Moscow princes, who brought together Russian principalities and created a unified state, was the figure of a horseman, which can be found on seals dating back to the 13th century. For a long time, it was just a knight on horseback holding a spear or a sword. Sometimes it was not even a warrior. Thus, Vasily the Blind used a seal depicting a horseman with a falcon on his arm. However, Yury of Moscow linked the image to his patron saint, St. George, and then it was made to represent one of the icon’s best-known deeds – the slaying of the dragon with a spear. Ultimately, St. George became the classic symbol of Moscow heraldry and can still be seen on Moscow’s coat of arms and on the shield in the middle of the national equivalent. The 15th century witnessed several important developments in Russia. For the first time in centuries, Ivan III, the grand prince of Moscow, managed to unify most of the old Rus lands under one ruler. He was widowed in 1467 after his wife, Maria, died at just 25 years of age. His second spouse was Sophia Palaiologina, the niece of the last emperor in Constantinople.The marriage to a relative of the last emperor of the Orthodox Christian superpower was important to Ivan in terms of both status and religion. Even though Byzantium had fallen to Turkish conquerors by then, the princess from the House of Palaiologos lost none of her pride. A strong and independent Greek woman, Sophia quickly adjusted to life in Ivan’s court and would not be overshadowed by her energetic and ambitious consort. One of Byzantium’s notable traits was a coat of arms in the form of a double-headed eagle. That was an incredibly ancient image literally going back to some of the first states in history, such as the Hittite Empire. It is likely that the double-headed eagle as a heraldic symbol traces its origins back to that era. In any case, these images first appeared in Anatolia. The Komnenos dynasty was the first to adopt it as a seal of the royal family, and later, the eagle with two heads served as an emblem of the Palaiologos, the last royal dynasty of the Byzantine Empire. Ivan III aspired to a status comparable to that of Byzantine emperors, so it was a natural choice for Moscow princes, and later tsars, to adopt the royal symbol as well. As time went by, the eagle was gradually transformed into the shape we see today. Under Ivan the Terrible, the shield with the horseman was moved to the bird's chest. In the 17th century, a scepter and an orb, the symbols of the Russian tsar’s power, appeared in its claws. It was then, under Tsar Alexis, the father of Peter the Great, that the function of the double-headed eagle was first put down in writing when it was officially adopted as the national coat of arms. It has remained in this role ever since, with the exception of the period between the revolution of 1917 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Tsar Alexis also contributed to the creation of Russia’s first flag. Initially, the shape, colors, and design of the Russian banner were not defined in any specific way, but religious images were almost invariably used – even the Russian word ‘znamya’ (banner) comes from ‘znamenie’ (sign, omen). Ivan the Terrible used a red banner with the image of Jesus Christ as his military flag. The volunteer army led by Prince Pozharsky, which liberated Moscow in 1612, also used a red flag, albeit depicting the biblical military leader Joshua, son of Nun, instead of Christ. The need to have a uniform flag which would be easily interpretable and recognized by everyone arose with the birth of the Russian Navy. For a long time, Russia was cut off from the seas, but when Russia’s first European-style navy ship, the Oryol, was being built on the Oka River, its commander asked Tsar Alexis what the Russian banner should look like. In 1667, the monarch approved white, blue, and red as the colors of the Russian national flag. Opinions vary on how exactly the colors were arranged. One theory is that it was a blue cross dividing two white and two red squares. What we do know for sure is that the tsar was shown the flags of England, Denmark, and Sweden as examples and these did have crosses on them. Peter I introduced a uniform navy flag of white, blue, and red. At first, it also included the heraldic double-headed eagle, which later disappeared. What’s important to remember is that the white, blue, and red flag was initially meant for the navy. Peter himself drew a sketch of this new flag and made the three colors standard for officers’ scarves. The country’s later flags were based on a combination of these colors, and the white, blue, and red banner was perceived as essentially Russian. At its introduction, the flag had no heraldic meaning, although some researchers linked it to the Moscow coat of arms. White was supposed to stand for St. George, while blue and red symbolized his cloak and the field he was riding in respectively. There are other interpretations of the choice of colors. One theory claims the tricolor comes from the official title of Russian tsars, ‘The Sovereign of all Rus: the Great, the Little, and the White’, in which white stands for the White Rus (modern Belarus), blue – for the Little Rus (the territories currently controlled by Ukraine), and red – for the Great Rus, or Russia itself. Until the 1917 revolution, there was another popular explanation in which white was thought to symbolize freedom and independence, blue stood for the Mother of God, and red was the expression of great power statehood. There are other, more prosaic versions as well, but, interestingly, there has never been any official explanation of the white, blue, and red symbolism either in Peter’s times or later. White, blue, and red have been typical flag colors in many Slavic countries since as early as the 13th century, when Serbia had a red and blue banner and Moravia used a blue flag with a red and white eagle. The 1848 Prague Slavic Congress officially defined the pan-Slavic colors based on the Russian tricolor, and this color combination was used for a number of state flags. The modern flags of Slovakia and Slovenia have the same colors arranged in the same order as the Russian banner, and are differentiated by their coats of arms placed above the color stripes. The colors are also used by Serbia and Croatia. Bulgaria was an exception. While it borrowed the concept of the Russian flag, it replaced the blue stripe with a green one, green being one of the colors on the coat of arms of the Battenbergs, the first princes of Bulgaria. As Slavic nations were uniting under banners of similar colors, Russia itself, remarkably, switched to a different color scheme. From 1858 to 1896, the Russian Empire officially used a black, yellow, and white flag associated with its coat of arms. Even though this combination was known in Russian heraldry since the reign of Peter the Great, the flag was only used sporadically, except the period in the second half of the 19th century when it became standard for government and administrative buildings on important occasions. The black, yellow, and white flag did not gain as much traction as the white, blue, and red, and was perceived more as the Romanovs’ banner than the national flag. It occupies a special niche in Russian society today, and is used by a range of right-wing groups who seek to highlight their admiration of the imperial period in Russian history, hence its informal moniker the ‘imperka’. Eventually, in 1896, Nicholas II made the white, blue, and red banner the only national flag of Russia. In some instances, it would also include the coat of arms. In Soviet times, the Russian tricolor was largely forgotten, with flags of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic invariably being versions of the red banner. The classic white, blue, and red flag was used either by emigres, or by collaborationist military units fighting on the side of Germany during World War II. The tricolor reemerged in Russia in the autumn of 1991 and was officially raised above the Kremlin to replace the red flag on December 25, 1991. It is still used today with minor modifications. The white, blue, and red flag remains primarily a symbol of the long and perhaps most illustrious era in Russian history – the imperial period. First adopted in an almost medieval country – which was 17th-century Russia – it saw the Russian Empire being consumed by the blaze of a world war, and was reborn in those troubled days when the USSR was falling apart. Whatever fate may yet befall Russia, it would be hard to imagine it with any other flag."

She is in the process of appealing the court ruling. The US, which has called her detention in Russia unlawful, previously offered to exchange her and another American citizen in Russian custody, former US Marine Paul Whelan. Washington reportedly suggested swapping them for Viktor Bout, who is serving a sentence in the US on gun running charges. Rodman previously claimed credit for the 2014 early release by North Korea of Korean-American activist Kenneth Bae, who later thanked the celebrity for his intervention. The basketball great famously made several trips to North Korea, met with the leader, and called him a personal friend. He does not appear to have the same kind of connection with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but claimed in the NBC interview that he knows him “too well.” Rodman previously called Putin “cool as f**k,” and claimed the two met and spent time together during the NBA champion’s visit to Moscow in 2014. The US Department of State has discouraged American citizens from visiting Russia in its official travel advisory. It claims they could face “harassment,” “arbitrary enforcement of local law,” and “wrongful detentions” in the country. Rodman did not explain whose “permission” he received for the mission, but would need a visa to get past customs."
2022-08-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/561289-germany-shower-medvedev-scholz/,Only German 'who can shower decently' named,"Given current gas prices and energy-saving restrictions in Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz appears to be the only one in the country who can take a decent shower, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has joked. “And what would happen with the price by the end of the year? $3,000? $4,000? Any higher bets, gentlemen?” Medvedev added in a sarcastic post on social media on Monday. The remark included a link to Medvedev’s late-March prediction that EU officials, including in the German government, were shooting themselves in the foot with their anti-Russian policies. Their actions were “the best way to leave Europe without gas,” he said at the time. The German chancellor was asked last week by a school student how often he showered, to which he said “every day.” During the same meeting he said he considered himself a wealthy person, knowing how much ordinary Germans earned. Scholz’s approval rating has reached its lowest point since he took office last December, according to a poll published last week by Germany’s INSA research institute. Only 25% of the German public is satisfied with his performance as chancellor, while 62% of those polled expressed disapproval. The price of natural gas in Europe surged to over $2,600 per thousand cubic meters last Friday after Russian energy giant Gazprom announced a three-day shutdown of the Nord Stream pipeline. The route, which connects Russia directly to Germany via the Baltic Sea, has been operating at just 20% of capacity for weeks. Gazprom has blamed anti-Russian sanctions for disrupting the regular maintenance of the German-produced equipment used to pump the fuel. Berlin said it didn’t believe the explanation and accused Moscow of cutting flows for political reasons."

The would-be suicide bomber was recruited in Turkey by the terrorist group Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS), the statement said. The man was radicalized on social media and met a representative of IS in Istanbul to record a pledge of allegiance before going on a mission to India, the FSB said. Russia served as a transit nation for the trip, the agency said. Russian law enforcement described the intended target of the terrorist attack as a “member of the ruling circles of India.” The FSB said the man was a citizen of an unnamed Central Asian nation, who was “staying in the Turkish Republic between April and June 2022.” The agency also released a video in which the suspect, whose face was blurred, confessed to pledging allegiance to ISIS. He was speaking in broken Russian and said he received “special training” and was supposed to meet a handler in India who would provide him with the “necessary materials for a terrorist attack.” The Indian target allegedly insulted the Prophet Mohammed, he said."
2022-08-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/561279-gatilov-ukraine-conflict-peace/,Russia assesses possibility of ending Ukraine conflict,"Western nations are stalling the conflict in Ukraine to cause more damage to Russia, but the longer it lasts, the more difficult it will be to end with a peaceful solution, a senior Russian diplomat has stated. Ukraine’s current position makes diplomatic contact with Russia impossible, Gennady Gatilov, Russia’s permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, told the Financial Times on Sunday. The US and its allies are using the hostilities in Ukraine “as a matter of pressure on Russia, as a tool of isolation of Russia … damaging our position, economically, politically,” he said. Consequently, Kiev broke off direct talks with Russia in March, which promised a potential resolution to the conflict, the diplomat said. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky claimed the talks with Russia were no longer possible after accusing Russia in April of committing war crimes in the town of Bucha near Kiev. Russia denied the allegations. Zelensky repeatedly said he was ready to talk to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, to end the conflict, but would do so only after all Russian troops withdrew to the pre-2014 positions. Moscow believes this indicated that there was no “practical platform” for a Putin-Zelensky meeting, Gatilov said. “Now, I do not see any possibility for diplomatic contacts,” Gatilov told the British newspaper. “And the more the conflict goes on, the more difficult it will be to have a diplomatic solution.” Russian ties with Western nations have likewise become virtually non-existent, and the delegation he leads has no formal or personal contacts with any Western counterparts, he added. Russia believes that the US does not care about the interests of Russia’s neighbor and wants to fight Russia “to the last Ukrainian,” the diplomat said."
2022-08-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/561277-zelensky-talks-pow-trial/,Zelensky warns against putting neo-Nazis on trial,"There will be no more peace talks with Russia if captured Ukrainian Neo-Nazis are subjected to a “show trial,” the country's President Vladimir Zelensky has claimed. The authorities of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) have previously said that they are planning tribunals for suspected war crimes committed by Ukrainian troops, including members of the Azov Battalion, whose ranks include fighters with openly nationalist and neo-Nazi views. “If this despicable show trial takes place… This will be the line beyond which any negotiations are impossible. Russia will cut itself off from any negotiations,” Zelensky said in a video address early Monday, adding that such a trial would be a violation of international law. Zelensky’s statement comes after photos appeared on social media allegedly showing large cages being installed on the stage of the Mariupol Philharmonic. Ukraine’s military intelligence service, the GUR, said that the cells will be used to house Ukrainian troops captured by Russian and Donbass forces during the siege of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. They were largely drawn from the Azov Battalion. DPR head Denis Pushilin told TASS this month that “active preparations” for the proceedings were underway. “The first tribunal will most likely be held in Mariupol. It will be organized by the end of summer,” he said. The peace talks between Russia and Ukraine have been stalled since spring. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/561272-ukraine-pushkin-bust-vandalism/,Ukrainian neo-Nazis target Pushkin bust,"A bust of 19th-century Russian poet Alexander Pushkin was allegedly attacked by a group of Ukrainian neo-Nazis in a Kiev metro station this week. A video that has surfaced on social media shows two masked men wearing military-style clothes pouring red dye on the bust. One of them can be heard saying, “Glory to Ukraine!” and calling their act a “creative” performance. One of the men also appears to be wearing an insignia that resembles an emblem of the Right Sector neo-Nazi group – which is considered a terrorist group by Russia. The metro station appeared to be empty at the time of the act and the Kiev authorities have so far not reacted to the vandalism. The stunt comes as Ukraine increasingly seeks to rid itself of any cultural references to Russia, ranging from street names to monuments. In June, the Kiev authorities renamed several metro stations in the city. Leo Tolstoy Square has been renamed in honor of Vasyl Stus, a local poet. There was also a petition to change all Pushkin Streets across Ukraine to the name of American writer Stephen King, but it failed to gather enough signatures. The Kiev Conservatory, which is officially named the Pyotr Tchaikovsky National Music Academy of Ukraine (UNTAM) after the Russian composer, has so far resisted the trend that has engulfed Ukraine since the start of the Russian military campaign in February. In June, its board refused to rebrand and remove the composer’s name. The Ukrainian Education Ministry has revealed plans to wipe Russian literature out of the nation’s school curricula. Deputy Education and Science Minister Andrey Vitrenko said in June that “everything that somehow connects us with the Russian Empire should be thrown out.” The ministry has not yet officially announced any changes, but local media has reported that Alexander Pushkin, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Bulgakov, and other iconic Russian authors are among those to be banned.

2022-08-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/561260-russian-communists-left-unite/,Communists call for Russia’s ‘patriotic left’ to unite,"Russia’s Communists are inviting all “patriotic left” factions in the country to unite under its banner, the party’s leader, Gennady Zyuganov, has proclaimed. The teaming up of left-wing forces in the country already began ahead of the parliamentary elections last September, the long-time party boss told RIA-Novosti on Saturday. “We all got together,” Zyuganov said, referring to 56 organizations, including some trade unions, which joined the Communist Party (CPRF) ahead of the vote. The move helped the Communists snatch almost 19% of the ballots and finish second, behind only the ruling United Russia party (49.82%). The CPRF currently has 57 seats out of 450 in Russia’s parliament, the State Duma. This process of unification of like-minded forces must continue, insisted Zyuganov, who had been the head of the CPRF since 1993. “If anybody has such a desire – join up, we’ll consider all applications,” the 78-year-old promised. Last month, Sergey Mironov, the leader of leftist group Fair Russia – For Truth, which has 28 seats in the parliament, claimed that a union between his party and the CPRF would inevitably happen in the future. Zyuganov responded to the idea by stating that his party was ready to run in the next election together with Fair Russia if the latter was prepared to work to implement the CPRF’s program."
2022-08-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/561254-kiev-denies-dugina-assassination/,Kiev denies responsibility for Dugina killing,"Kiev has nothing to do with the assassination of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian political commentator and philosopher Alexandr Dugin, an aide to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky pledged on Sunday. Speaking on national television, Mikhail Podoliak insisted his country is not “a terrorist state,” an apparent response to suspicion voiced by officials that Kiev might be behind the bombing. “I want to stress out that Ukraine, of course, has nothing to do with this, because we are not a criminal state, unlike Russia, and especially not a terrorist state,” he noted. Podoliak also indicated that the killing of Dugin’s daughter is “a testament to the ongoing struggle for power and influence among various groups in Russia.” Moreover, he did not rule out that Russia could use the blast as an excuse for announcing a large-scale mobilization amid the military offensive in Ukraine. Moscow has denied all claims it plans to do so, castigating such speculation as “bogus stories.” Podoliak’s comments came after Denis Pushilin, the leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic, accused the “terrorists of the Ukrainian regime” of carrying out the bombing. However, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova did not pin the blame on Kiev but noted that if investigators determine that Ukraine is indeed responsible, this “would be the case of state terrorism policies carried out by the Kiev regime.” Dugina was killed Saturday night outside Moscow when the SUV she was driving was ripped apart in an explosion. According to Russia’s Investigative Committee, the blast was caused by a bomb that had been attached to the underside of the vehicle. Investigators believe the attack to have been premeditated and to be a contract job. Earlier on Saturday evening, Aleksandr Dugin was giving a lecture at a family festival called ‘Tradition’ in Moscow Region. Dugina was in attendance at the event. Several reports say Dugin initially planned to leave the festival with his daughter but later decided to take a separate car, while Darya took his Toyota Land Cruiser Prado. Dugin is known for his staunch anti-Western and ‘neo-Eurasian’ views. Western media has portrayed him as a driving force behind key aspects of President Vladimir Putin’s foreign policy. However, despite his reputation in the West, in Russia he has never enjoyed official endorsement from the Kremlin and is largely considered a marginal figure."
2022-08-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/561092-nato-terrorist-states-russia/,NATO members pushing to brand Russia a 'terrorist state' tells us that the US and its allies lack self-awareness,"Efforts are underway in the US Senate to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. Before going down that road, lawmakers may wish to consider some inconvenient facts. If Russia’s military operation in Ukraine is doing anything – aside from eradicating the resurgence of fascism on the European continent – it is revealing the shocking lack of self-awareness in Western capitals. Perennial American Russophobes from opposite sides of the political spectrum, Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Sen. Lindsey Graham, are now agitating members of Congress to include Russia in Washington’s list of ‘state sponsors of terrorism,’ which presently includes North Korea, Iran, Cuba and Syria. Meanwhile, the Baltic State of Lithuania signed off on its own legislation in May declaring Russia a ‘terrorist state.’ Yet Vilnius didn’t stop there, accusing Russia of carrying out ‘genocide’ on its neighbor’s territory. The resolution states that Russia is committing “genocide against the Ukrainian people,” while saying that the Russian military, like some kind of modern-day Huns, “deliberately and systematically target civilian targets..."" Consider how US-led coalition forces ‘liberated’ the Syrian city of Raqqa from Islafmic State militants, who scattered their forces throughout the civilian population thereby turning civilians into ‘human shields’ – a technique now being employed by Ukraine. The US-led Coalition's relentless four-month ‘precision’ bombardment against IS killed and injured thousands of civilians, while reducing homes, businesses and infrastructure to rubble. Surveying the damage on the ground, Amnesty International concluded that the US-led Coalition “launched strikes likely to cause excessive harm to civilians and failed to distinguish between military targets and civilians."" The tragic irony of the situation, from Russia’s perspective, is that while Moscow is attempting to spare infrastructure and human lives, it is branded the ‘terrorist state,’ whereas Ukraine is granted hero status as it employs those same tactics that put civilian life at grave risk. Naturally, tragedies will occur and Russia, like any country that finds itself at war, will eventually be accused of killing innocent civilians. Yet these casualties are vastly exacerbated by the fighting techniques of the Ukrainian military, which, it should be emphasized, has been receiving its training from NATO forces since 2014. Time and again, when Russian troops enter a city, they find the enemy fortified behind civilian infrastructure, like hospitals, kindergartens and schools. This automatically turns the facility into a military target for Russian forces, which Ukraine then uses as ‘proof’ that Moscow is deliberately targeting civilians. It’s the oldest trick in the book, used by terrorists, but thanks to the media’s political biases and the Western leaders’ geopolitical interests, that label is now being slapped on the other side in the fight. This month, Amnesty published a report that supports the claim that the Ukrainians are not fighting the fair fight. “Ukrainian forces have put civilians in harm’s way by establishing bases and operating weapons systems in populated residential areas, including in schools and hospitals…,” the human rights group said, much to Kiev’s ire. “We have documented a pattern of Ukrainian forces putting civilians at risk and violating the laws of war when they operate in populated areas,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. “Being in a defensive position does not exempt the Ukrainian military from respecting international humanitarian law,” she added. Kiev was enraged, with the director of Amnesty Ukraine resigning in protest, and President Vladimir Zelensky calling the organization an “accomplice of Russia” and “a terrorist themselves” – another indication of the label being used as little more than a political smear. Now that we’ve compared and contrasted Russian and American fighting techniques, let’s take a look at Russia’s most vocal European accusers – the Baltic states of Lithuania and Latvia. Do they have the necessary street cred to declare Russia – or any country for that matter – a state sponsor of terrorism? As it turns out, Vilnius existed as a vital link in the CIA’s top secret ‘extraordinary rendition’ program – which saw suspected Islamist militants from conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq captured and held in so-called ‘black sites’ outside the US. In windowless and soundproofed rooms on the desolate outskirts of the Lithuanian capital, “one could do whatever one wanted,” said Arvydas Anusauskas, who led a Lithuanian parliamentary investigation into the site in 2010. “What exactly was going on there, we did not determine.” Too bad they didn’t ask Abu Zubaydah, a former guest of the dungeon hideout. In January, the Lithuanian government was ordered to pay Zubaydah, who, like so many other detainees was eventually proven innocent of all charges, €100,000 ($113,319) in compensation for the brutal treatment he suffered at the site. In other words, Vilnius had secretly violated European laws banning torture, which includes beatings, waterboarding, sensory and sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, endless blaring noise and harsh light. Now does Lithuania really sound like the kind of place that should be inducting other countries into the terrorism hall of fame? Probably not. And then there’s Lithuania’s neighbor Latvia, which just can’t shake its Adolf Hitler obsession after nearly a century. Each year, on March 16th, thousands of Latvians parade through the capital Riga, resplendent in their Nazi regalia to pay homage to the homegrown SS divisions that fought in World War II alongside the Nazis – you know, the same characters who were responsible for the untimely death of millions of Jews, Christians and others. I could be wrong, but I’m pretty sure that would qualify Nazi Germany as being a full-blown terrorist state by modern standards, which suggests that Latvia has some explaining to do. But instead, it would rather tear down old Soviet statues while its parliament declares Russia a terrorist state for fighting the same menace. Sorry, it just doesn’t wash."

According to Russia’s Investigative Committee, the explosive device ripped through the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving in Moscow Region, near the village of Bolshie Vyazemy, on Saturday night. It has been reported that the vehicle belonged to her father. “It has already been established that the explosive was planted under the bottom of the car on the driver's side. Darya Dugina, who was driving, was killed on impact,” the agency said, reiterating that investigators believe the attack to have been premeditated and to be a contract job. The Investigative Committee said that its specialists are now inspecting the scene and that the vehicle was being removed from the site for further examination. “Expert assessments are being commissioned, including biological, genetic, chemical and explosive forensics,” the agency noted, adding that a recording from the SUV’s dash cam had been retrieved, while law enforcement officials are working to identify suspects and possible witnesses.

2022-08-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/561135-russia-nato-ukraine-propaganda/,Glenn Diesen: How 'Russophrenia' from supposedly smart people in the West has slowly led us towards a major European war,"The author and holocaust survivor, Victor Klemperer, identified two distinct styles of language that defined Hitler’s propaganda against the Jews: either “scornful derision” of the inferior race or “panic-stricken fear” of their threat to civilisation. Anti-Russian propaganda over the past centuries has similarly produced two contradictory positions – disdain for Russians as an uncivilised and backward people, and simultaneously an immeasurable threat looming over Europe. A state of affairs described by one writer as ""Russophrenia: the idea that Russia is simultaneously about to fall apart, and also take over the world."" Russia is hopelessly inept and weak, yet it is also capable of subverting the democracies of the world and restoring a global empire. Moscow is so impaired that the West does not need to acknowledge or accommodate its basic security interests, yet NATO’s 30 member states need ever-more weapons to defend against the dreaded Russians. Exaggerating the weakness or the strength of an adversary (or both) is a key component of propaganda, which carries with it the obvious risk of miscalculations, as the real capabilities of the opponent are not accurately assessed. The war in Ukraine is a good case study of this phenomenon. To encourage more NATO, more military spending and containment of Russia, it is commonly argued that we have underestimated the threat of the Russians. During the Cold War, it was falsely argued that the Soviets enjoyed a huge positive missile gap vis-à-vis the US, which incentivised further military spending in the US. After the Cold War, NATO expansion and raison d'etre have continued to rely on an exaggerated Russian threat. To encourage a more forceful approach to Russia, it is now argued that we have overestimated Moscow’s strength. Case in point, an article by The Atlantic argues that “Ukraine Has Exposed Russia as a Not-So-Great Power”. It suggests that because the Russian army “has seized only 20 percent of Ukraine,” it is time to shed the illusion of Russia being a great power. This conclusion supports an even more hard-line position towards Russia as opposed to Kissinger’s argument that great powers must be accommodated for peace. In other words, more of the same policies that fuelled tensions and brought us to this horrific conflict. There is no doubt that Russia failed to achieve a swift victory in Ukraine. Russia stormed up to the outskirts of Kiev in the early stages, seeking to impose a settlement. The Russian territorial advances seemed very impressive and coincided with the narrative of an all-mighty Russia. In reality, these positions relied on thin and vulnerable supply lines. With the failure of achieving a diplomatic settlement with Kiev, these positions had to be abandoned. The UK and the US persuaded Kiev to abandon the peace talks in Istanbul, and the nature of the fighting subsequently changed fundamentally. The collective West promised it would provide all the weapons required if Ukraine would end negotiations and fight Russia. Washington stipulated its objective of permanently weakening Russia and knocking it down from the table of great powers. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin explicitly announced that American aims included getting “Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things it has done in invading Ukraine”. This objective is consistent with the goals set by the renowned intelligence-linked think tank RAND Corporation in 2019, which is to overextend and take down Moscow: “The Ukrainian military already is bleeding Russia in the Donbass region (and vice versa). Providing more U.S. military equipment and advice could lead Russia to increase its direct involvement in the conflict and the price it pays for it”. The Russian hope of a swift victory was thus replaced with a war of attrition, in which Moscow aimed to grind down and destroy the Ukrainian army – before imposing a settlement. The breaking point has now been reached, as evident by the current collapse of Ukraine’s most heavily fortified positions in Maryinka, Pisky and Avviivka. This will likely end in August or September, and then shift towards more rapid territorial conquest. Is it strategically wise to deny this reality to sell the narrative of a weak Russia? The narrative of an inept, exhausted and demoralised Russian military that has almost run out of ammunition has persisted since March. Yet, there is an even wider problem with the narrative of Russia not being able to defeat its weak neighbour. In reality, NATO has also indirectly gone to war against Russia. US Brigadier General Joseph E. Hilbert argued that “the worst thing the Russians did was give us eight years to prepare.” Furthermore, the collective West has supplied increasingly advanced weapons since Russia invaded in February 2022. American political scientist John Mearsheimer defines a great power by its “reasonable prospect of defending itself against the leading state in the system by its own efforts.” It appears that Russia has passed that test as the collective West has now thrown everything but the kitchen sink in terms of supplying military hardware, military intelligence, and economic sanctions. The collective West has depleted a large part of its weapons storage in a futile effort to stop Russian advances on the battlefield. This is despite the fact that Russia is only fighting with its peacetime army of 200,000 troops against a Ukrainian army several times this size. The 3:1 rule of war stipulates that in order that for the attacker to win the battle, his forces should be at least three times the force of the defender. In Ukraine, this ratio is reversed with 1:3 in Ukraine’s favour. Russia’s 2 million reserve soldiers and much of its more advanced weapons are kept as backup in case NATO directly enters the war. The collective West has launched unprecedented economic sanctions with the explicit expectation that it would immediately collapse the Russian economy, financial system and currency. This never happened and the Russian ruble is the strongest performing currency this year. Instead, the sanctions have backfired so spectacularly, to the extent that the West has set fire to its own house in the hope it would spread to Moscow. The attempt to mobilise the international community against Russia has also failed, as 85% of the world population live in countries that have refused to participate in sanctions – despite pressure and threats from the US. Even the pope pointed to NATO expansionism as a source of the war. Denying that Russia is a great power may feel good, but as stated by Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu more than 2,500 years ago: “There is no greater danger than underestimating your opponent”. Wishful thinking about Russian weakness incentivises the collective West to escalate, while diplomacy and a peace agreement become increasingly difficult and unfavourable. Before February 2014, Russia’s main policy towards Ukraine was to preserve it as a neutral state, a bridge between East and West. After the Western-supported regime change and support for an “anti-terrorist operation” against Donbass, Russia demanded autonomy for Donbass. As the US sabotaged the Minsk peace agreement, which was aimed at delivering autonomy, for seven years, the Kremlin switched to pushing for Donbass independence. Once the US began sending advanced weapons to Ukraine with the explicit aim of permanently weakening Russia, Moscow expanded its territorial claims to counter this threat. The anti-Russia sanctions have been exhausted, and have backfired terribly. There is now a recognition that the measures have been a spectacular failure, as Western economies crumble while Moscow is shifting its economic connectivity to the East. Russia’s economic dependence on the West has been a source of great influence, but this leverage is dwindling and is not coming back. The desire to depict Russia as feeble is required as NATO insists it must negotiate from a position of strength. But isn’t this the source of the problems? For 30 years, NATO negotiated against a weaker Moscow, and the result was that the US-led bloc could act unilaterally and ignore Russian security interests. By abandoning pan-European security agreements, pan-European security collapsed. We have been moving slowly towards a major European war for 30 years and there are no good solutions anymore. But an end to wishful thinking must be the beginning."
2022-08-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/561236-moscow-dugina-murder-car-bomb/,Dugina Moscow car bombing death officially confirmed,"A criminal case has been launched over the death of the daughter of prominent Russian philosopher and political commentator Aleksandr Dugin, the Investigative Committee announced on Sunday morning, adding that a car bomb is suspected as the cause. Darya Dugina, 29, has been officially confirmed as the victim of the explosion outside the Russian capital, the agency said in a statement. According to investigators, a blast ripped through her Toyota Land Cruiser at around 9pm local time on Saturday as she was driving near the village of Bolshie Vyazemy in Moscow Region. It is thought an explosive device detonated inside the vehicle, which then caught fire. “The female driver, who was behind the wheel, has been killed on site,” the Investigative Committee said. A journalist and political commentator, Dugina was the daughter of philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, who is often painted in the West as the ideologist of President Vladimir Putin’s foreign policy over the past decade. However, in Russia, Dugin is viewed as a relatively marginal figure due to his often extreme anti-Western and ‘neo-Eurasian’ views. The 60-year-old has never been officially endorsed by the Kremlin. On Saturday, he was giving a lecture at family festival called 'Tradition', with his daughter in attendance. Some reports suggest that Dugin initially planned to leave the event in the same car with his daughter, but later changed his plans. Russian writer and political activist Zakhar Prilepin, who also attended the festival, hinted that Ukraine could be behind the bombing. “They do things like this. They’ve crossed the line long ago,” he wrote on Telegram, noting the assassination of the head of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, in 2018, which was blamed on Kiev, and other high-profile bomb attacks in Donbass in recent years. “This comedy idol, this sleepy man in a T-shirt – he greenlights such actions,” Prilepin said in an apparent reference to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who was a comedian before turning to politics. Judging from his post, the writer believes that Dugin, not his daughter, was the real target of the attackers. No evidence of Kiev’s role in the bombing has been made public so far."
2022-08-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/561233-moscow-car-blast-dugin/,Car blast kills daughter of Russian philosopher Dugin,"A powerful explosion ripped apart an SUV near Moscow on Saturday night, instantly killing its driver, identified as Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian political commentator Aleksandr Dugin. The incident took place on a highway 20km west of Moscow at around 9:35pm local time, with witnesses saying the blast occurred in the middle of the road, scattering debris all around. The car, which was engulfed in flames, then crashed into a fence, according to photos and videos from the scene. The emergency services said one person was inside the car and was instantly killed by the blast – a female whose body was reportedly burned beyond recognition. The authorities have yet to officially confirm the identity of the victim, but multiple Russian Telegram channels and media sources reported that the victim was Darya Dugina (Platonova), 29. Her father, Aleksandr Dugin, was spotted at the scene soon after the incident, visibly shocked, according to several videos circulating on social media. WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE Preliminary reports suggested that a home-made explosive device might have been involved, but investigators have yet to confirm the cause of the blast or any potential motive. Earlier on Saturday evening, Dugin was giving a lecture on ‘Tradition and History’ at a family festival in Moscow Region. His daughter was in attendance. Unconfirmed reports say Dugin initially planned to leave the festival with her but later decided to take a separate car, while Darya took his Toyota Land Cruiser Prado. Dugina was a political commentator and daughter of the veteran Russian philosopher, known for his staunch anti-Western and ‘neo-Eurasian’ views. Western media has painted Dugin as a driving force behind President Vladimir Putin’s foreign policy over the past decade. In recent months, CBS dubbed him “the far-right theorist behind Putin’s plan,” while the Washington Post called him a “far-right mystical writer who helped shape Putin’s view of Russia.” In Russia, the supposed shadowy puppet master is largely considered to be a marginal figure. While he has served as an adviser to several politicians, Dugin never enjoyed official endorsement from the Kremlin. In 2014, he was fired from his position at Moscow State University, after critics interpreted his call to “kill, kill, kill” those behind massacres in Ukraine, such as the Odessa tragedy, as a call for a genocide against Ukrainian people. The US think tank RAND Corporation wrote in 2017 that despite Western media reports of Dugin’s alleged “ties and connections” to the Russian leadership, he is “perhaps best thought of as an extremist provocateur with some limited and peripheral impact than as an influential analyst with a direct impact on policy.”"
2022-08-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/561214-ukraine-chemical-poisoning-moscow/,Russian soldiers in Ukraine hospitalized with severe chemical poisoning – Moscow,"Several Russian soldiers involved in the military operation in Ukraine have been hospitalized with severe chemical poisoning, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Saturday. Traces of Botulinum toxin Type B, which is an “organic poison of artificial origin,” have been discovered in samples taken from the servicemen, the ministry said, accusing Kiev of “chemical terrorism.” The Russian troops were “hospitalized with signs of severe poisoning” after being stationed near the village of Vasilyevka in Zaporozhye Region on July 31, the statement said. “The Zelensky regime has authorized terrorist attacks with the use of toxic substances against Russian personnel and civilians” following a string of military defeats in Donbass and other areas, the ministry insisted. Moscow plans to send laboratory tests from the soldiers to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Botulinum toxin, often called the “miracle poison,” is one of the most toxic biological substances known to science. Produced by the Clostridium botulinum bacteria, it blocks the release of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, causing muscle paralysis. Botulinum toxin Type A has been used in medicine in small doses in recent decades, especially to treat disorders characterized by overactive muscle movement. It’s also well known in cosmetology under its shortened name, Botox. However, Botulinum toxin poses a major threat as a bioweapon due its ease of production and distribution, and the high fatality rate resulting from poisoning. Recovery is only possible after a lengthy period of intensive care."
2022-08-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/561207-ban-tourists-eu-shoigu/,EU calls to bar Russians recall ‘Nazi policies’ – Moscow,"Calls to ban Russian citizens from entering the EU, now being pushed by some of the bloc’s member states, are reminiscent of “Nazi policies,” Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said on Saturday. “We are now witnessing another vivid manifestation of Nazi policies: speaking from high podiums, [European officials] are actively promoting the Russophobic idea of barring all Russian citizens from entering EU countries,” he told the plenary session of the First International Anti-Fascist Congress, which is part of the ‘Army-22’ international military technology forum. Shoigu also expressed alarm that the results of the Nuremberg trials detailing crimes against humanity committed by the Nazis are being reassessed in a number of countries, especially in the Baltic region. “SS legionnaires’ marches have become a tradition in Estonia and Latvia; monuments and obelisks are being erected in honor of war criminals. Nazi slogans are openly proclaimed in the streets of Lithuanian cities,” he said. The defense minister recalled that fascist regimes came to power in many European countries in the 1930s, including Germany, where the Nazi ideology proved to be the most radical and expansionist form of fascism. He also underlined that international capital was instrumental in Nazis’ ascent to power. “It is abundantly clear that the financial and economic cooperation between the Anglo-American and Nazi business circles was one of the main factors that led to the Second World War,” Shoigu said, adding that the Soviet Union was the country that had borne the brunt of Nazi aggression. On this point, the minister noted that “history lessons had been poorly learned by those who rely on their own strength and commit violence.” “The bombing campaign on Yugoslavia, the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, cultivating terrorist structures in Syria – specific authors and actors always stand behind all these and similar crimes. The responsibility for such actions and their consequences rests entirely on the leadership of the United States and NATO,” he stated. Shoigu’s comments followed a decision by the Estonian government on Tuesday to remove several Soviet-era war memorials in Ida-Viru County, including a historic T-34 tank in the provincial capital of Narva. This monument has been a flash point for tensions between Estonia’s nationalistic government and the city’s Russian community. Many Tallinn officials view Soviet memorials as a reminder of a historical period that they consider to have been an occupation, while others see them as a symbol of the sacrifices made during World War II and the victory over Nazi Germany. Estonia recently barred most Russian citizens with Schengen visas issued by the Baltic nation from entering the country, while Finland announced this week that it would be cutting the number of entry visas available to Russians by half."
2022-08-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/561205-russia-foreign-fighters-strike/,Foreign fighters eliminated in Ukraine – Russia,"US nationals were among the foreign fighters killed in high-precision Russian airstrikes on nationalists’ combat positions in Kharkov Region in northeastern Ukraine, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed at its daily briefing on Saturday. Ministry spokesman Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov said Russian aircraft had struck “the positions of the nationalist unit Kraken and the units of foreign mercenaries” near the village of Andreyevka. “More than 100 militants were killed, including up to 20 American mercenaries,” Konashenkov stated. He added that the Russian forces hit other targets in eastern Ukraine and Donbass, destroying seven command centers and intercepting six drones. The Ukrainian General Staff did not report any losses, but said on Saturday that the Russians had shelled several villages near Kharkov. The Kraken volunteer unit was formed in February by veterans of the Azov Regiment, which is known for welcoming fighters with openly nationalist and neo-Nazi views into its ranks. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/561197-drone-sevastopol-crimea-ukraine/,Drone targets Russian Black Sea fleet HQ – governor,"A Ukrainian drone crashed into the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port of Sevastopol on Saturday morning, Governor Mikhail Razvozhayev has said. The low-flying UAV was spotted approaching the city from the bay, but was only shot down once it was above the headquarters. The drone crashed into the roof of the building and caught fire, Razvozhayev said on Telegram, adding that the work of Russia’s air defenses allowed damage from the indecent to be minimized. The governor said there were no casualties or significant damage resulting from the attack, which he blamed on Ukraine. Footage uploaded on social media shows plumes of thick black smoke coming from the roof of the Black Sea Fleet headquarters. The HQ was struck by a drone in late July, leaving six people wounded and prompting the cancellation of Navy Day celebrations in Sevastopol. Shorty after the incident in Sevastopol, Crimean Governor Sergey Aksyonov said another drone had been shot down in the west of the peninsula. The Crimean governor’s aide, Oleg Kryuckov, said on Telegram that the aim of the ongoing drone attacks was “not military, but psychological” as the UAVs only carry a small payload of explosives, unable to cause extensive damage. He advised the population to stay clam and report any suspicious activity to the authorities. There were also several reports of air defenses being activated in various part of Crimea over incoming UAVs on Friday. On Tuesday, a temporary ammunition depot in northern Crimea was targeted in what the Russian Defense Ministry called an “act of sabotage.” Last week, a fire and series of explosions at the Saki airfield in the western part of the peninsula left one person dead and 14 others injured."
2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/561183-evpatoria-air-defense/,Crimea air-defense interceptions caught on camera (VIDEOS),"Air-defense systems intercepted an unidentified object in the sky over Evpatoria, a city located on the western coast of the Crimean peninsula, on Friday night. The interception was caught on camera. “In Evpatoria, presumably, the air-defense system was activated. Crimea is under reliable protection,” an adviser to the head of the region, Oleg Kryuchkov, wrote on his Telegram channel. An explosion in the sky, followed by a trace of smoke, can be seen in the footage circulating online. Some outlets speculated that a Ukrainian drone may have been shot down, following yesterday’s news that an unmanned aerial vehicle had been intercepted by air-defense systems in the vicinity of the Belbek airfield in Sevastopol, Crimea’s largest city. Air-defense systems were also activated in the city of Kerch, near the Crimean Bridge. The reports came after Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov said Kiev’s pledge not to attack Russian territory with Western-provided weapons would not apply to Crimea, which was later confirmed to Politico by an unnamed official in US President Joe Biden’s administration. Crimea broke away from Ukraine following a violent coup in Kiev in 2014 and voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to rejoin Russia, which was not recognized by the West."
2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/561179-macron-putin-call-ukraine-nuclear/,Macron calls Putin,"Russian President Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron have had their first phone call in almost three months to discuss the Ukraine conflict and nuclear security in the area of Zaporozhye, the Kremlin said on Friday. The call was initiated by the French side and saw the two leaders discuss “various aspects of the situation around Ukraine,” according to the Kremlin’s readout. Putin emphasized that “the systematic shelling of the territory of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant by the Ukrainian military poses a danger of a large-scale disaster that could lead to radiation spillover onto a large territory,” Moscow said. The two leaders agreed that a mission under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should be dispatched to the NPP “as soon as possible” in order to assess the situation on site. “The Russian side confirmed it’s ready to provide the Agency’s inspectors with all the necessary assistance,” the Kremlin said. According to the Elysee Palace, Putin agreed that the IAEA mission to Zaporozhye NPP would be dispatched on the terms already arranged by Ukraine and the United Nations. This would mean that the IAEA delegation might travel via the territory currently controlled by Kiev’s forces. Previously, Moscow insisted that such a mission could arrive only via Russian-controlled territory. The two sides will address this issue again in the coming days, after technical teams discuss the matter in detail, the Elysee said. According to the Kremlin, Putin once again invited international experts to visit a detention facility in Yelenovka, in the Donetsk People’s Republic. An artillery attack on the prison, which Moscow says was carried out by Kiev’s forces, killed 50 Ukrainian POWs and injured dozens more last month. Putin also informed his French counterpart on the implementation of the deal for Ukrainian grain exports via the Black Sea. This agreement, which was brokered by the UN and Turkey, is also supposed to allow Russia to deliver fertilizers and food products to the global markets. However, the Kremlin noted, “obstacles for the Russian grain [export] persist,” which continues to have an adverse effect on global food security. The most recent call between the two leaders took place on May 28 and also involved German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. During that conversation, Putin blamed Ukraine for the stalled peace talks, assuring his counterparts that Moscow remained ready to negotiate an end to the ongoing conflict and condemning the West for supplying Kiev with weapons."
2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/news/561162-us-ukraine-party-conflict/,US on verge of directly joining Ukrainian conflict – Moscow,"Washington’s continued support for Kiev during Moscow’s military operation has put the US on the verge of becoming party to the Ukrainian conflict, Russia’s deputy Foreign Minister, Sergey Ryabkov has said. “We don't want escalation. We’d like to avoid a situation, in which the US becomes a party to the conflict, but so far we don’t see any readiness of the other side to take these warnings seriously,” Ryabkov told Rossiya 1 TV channel on Friday. Moscow rejects Washington's explanation, that providing Ukraine with weapons and other aid is justified by Kiev’s right to self-defense, he pointed out. “Excuse me, what kind of self-defense is it if they are already openly talking about the possibility of attacking targets deep in the Russian territory, in Crimea?” the deputy FM wondered. According to Ryabkov, such statements are being made by the Ukrainian side “not just under the blind eye of the US and NATO, but with the encouragement of this kind of sentiment, approaches, plans and ideas directly from Washington,” Ryabkov insisted. “The ever more obvious and deeper involvement in Ukraine in terms of countering our military operation, in fact, puts this country, the US, on the verge of turning into a party to the conflict,” he reiterated. The US has been the strongest supporter of Kiev amid its conflict with Russia, providing Kiev with billions of dollars in military and financial aid, as well as intelligence data. Washington’s deliveries to the Ukrainian military have included such sophisticated hardware as HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, M777 howitzers and combat drones. Reuters reported on Friday that US President Joe Biden is about to announce another lethal aid package for Kiev of around $800 million. An unnamed official from the Biden administration told Politico on Thursday that the White House had no problem with Ukraine attacking Crimea, which became part of Russia after a 2014 referendum staged in response to a violent coup. The US believes that Kiev can strike any target on its territory, and “Crimea is Ukraine,” the American official insisted. There have recently been a number of explosions near a Russian ammunition depot and at a military airfield in Crimea, which the Defense Ministry said were acts of “sabotage.” However, Ukrainian authorities haven’t officially confirmed involvement in the attacks. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/561155-visa-restrictions-finland-reaction/,‘Due reaction’ to follow Finland’s visa move – Russia,"Finland’s decision to dramatically decrease the number of visas it grants to Russian citizens has been noted by Moscow, which will react to the move in due course, a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry has said. The decision, which Helsinki announced on Tuesday, “fits the pattern of the Russophobic campaign in certain EU nations, which was initiated by the Baltic states,” Ivan Nechaev said during a daily briefing on Thursday. He added that the Russian government was also aware that visa restrictions could be imposed on its citizens by the EU. The possible move was confirmed by European Commission spokesperson Anitta Hipper this week. Russia considers such actions to be evidence that Finland and rest of the EU “are reneging on their international obligations” for the sake of “politically motivated discrimination against Russians,” Nechaev said. “Such steps shall not be left without due reaction by the Russian side,” he added. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky called on Kiev’s allies to restrict the access of Russian citizens to their nations in retaliation for Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. He also suggested they should deport Russian nationals, including those who are critical of Moscow’s policies. All Russian citizens share collective responsibility for their government’s actions, he argued in an interview with the Washington Post earlier this month. After facing criticism over the remark, Zelensky said Russians concerned for their safety in their home country could apply for political asylum in foreign nations."
2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/561153-kraken-execute-ukrainian-soldiers/,Nationalist unit executes 100 fellow Ukrainian troops – Russian MoD,"Some 100 Ukrainian soldiers have been executed by nationalist fighters from the “Kraken” regiment for abandoning their positions, Russia’s Ministry of Defense claimed in a daily briefing on Friday. After Russian forces carried out an assault on Ukraine’s 58th motorized infantry brigade on August 14 near the settlement of Udy in the Kharkov region, the remnants of the formation fled their positions and retreated, ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said. In order to “suppress panic and intimidate the personnel of the Armed forces of Ukraine,” fighters from the neo-Nazi “Kraken” regiment “demonstratively executed 100 servicemen of the 58th motorized infantry brigade who abandoned their positions” near Udy, the official said. The “Kraken” regiment describes itself as a special reconnaissance and sabotage unit under the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, operating separately from the Armed Forces. Moscow considers it to be an offshoot of the notorious neo-Nazi “Azov” regiment which suffered a crushing defeat in the city of Mariupol back in May. Russia’s Defense Ministry has accused the battalion of committing several war crimes since the beginning of the conflict, and believes it to be responsible for brutally mistreating Russian POWs. While there is no information on how many fighters the “Kraken” regiment has, some estimates suggest it is about 1,800 soldiers strong, most of whom are Azov veterans and volunteers. Over the course of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, the Ministry of Defense has regularly reported the elimination of hundreds of fighters from the “Kraken” regiment as well as from other nationalist divisions. In its Friday update, Russia’s MoD reported destroying temporary deployment points of the “Azov” and “Aidar” formations near the city of Soledar in the Donetsk People’s Republic, and claimed to have eliminated over 50 neo-Nazi fighters as well as 12 units of military equipment."
2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/561147-iaea-mission-ukraine-september/,Moscow comments on timeline for nuclear inspection of Zaporozhye NPP,"The UN nuclear watchdog could send an inspection team to the Russia-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant in Ukraine in as soon as two weeks, a senior Russian diplomat said on Friday. “Forecasts don’t always come true, but my sense is that it can happen in early September,” Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s permanent envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said during a media briefing. The Russian diplomat stressed that the proposed timeline is conditional on non-interference by “external factors that have nothing to do with the goals of the IAEA visit.” The mission should have been launched in June, he explained, but the plan failed, and “in a sense, things have to be done from scratch now.” The Zaporozhye plant is located in the Ukrainian city of Energodar, and is controlled by Russian troops, although its civilian operators are Ukrainian. Over the past month, it has come under a series of attacks, which Russia has blamed on Ukrainian forces. Kiev has denied responsibility and accused Russia of shelling the nuclear site to discredit Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have also claimed that Russia is using the plant as a military base, keeping heavy weapons on site and carrying out artillery strikes against Ukrainian troops from the facility. The Russian Defense Ministry has said the only Russian forces present at the plant are lightly armed guards. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has said he wants to personally lead a fact-finding mission to the Zaporozhye plant. Both Moscow and Kiev have expressed their support for such a visit, despite near-daily reports of shelling in Energodar. “It appears that the Ukrainans are trying to prevent the mission from happening,” Ulyanov said during the briefing. The UN previously suggested that the entire area around the city should be demilitarized, but Russia insisted the proposal was not viable, claiming that Ukrainian forces cannot be trusted to abide by such an agreement. By withdrawing forces from Energodar, Russia would expose the nuclear power plant to increased risks, a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Thursday."
2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/561146-us-doomed-eu-russia-cold-hunger/,US has doomed EU to hunger and cold – Russia,"The United States has doomed the EU to hunger, cold and isolation by pressuring the bloc to cut its ties with Moscow, Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said on Friday. He wrote on Telegram that Washington would “stop at nothing to cling to its power over the world as it throws under the bus the citizens’ welfare and the economies of European countries to achieve this end.” He noted that natural gas in the US costs $333 per 1,000 cubic meters. “At the same time, Washington sells it to Europe for a price which is 7.3 [times] higher, rendering the EU economy uncompetitive,” he wrote, adding that the eurozone’s annual inflation rate had hit a record 8.9%. Volodin said Europe had been hit by a heatwave that triggered huge problems in the agriculture sector, as well as an energy crisis which had seen prices soar six times in one year. The EU’s decision to phase out Russian energy supplies and cut economic ties with Moscow “have been made under Washington’s pressure,” the State Duma speaker claimed. “US policies in Europe are enforced by England that has left the EU high and dry, as well as by a number of countries that are sovereign in name only – Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine – with Poland, the Czech Republic and Finland joining this Russophobic coalition in the hopes of getting an American handout,” Volodin wrote. His comments come as the EU is plagued by an energy crisis due to rising global prices. Earlier this month, the bloc approved a plan that would see its member states reduce gas consumption by 15% in a bid to tackle the crisis. Another factor that has exacerbated the energy crunch was the EU’s decision to wean itself off natural gas from Russia, as the bloc considers these supplies to be unreliable. However, President Vladimir Putin has rejected accusations that Moscow could cut off gas supplies to the EU, stating that Russian energy giant Gazprom is “ready to pump as much as necessary” but that the bloc has “closed everything themselves.”"
2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/561134-zelensky-deception-image-damaged/,Zelensky faces furious criticism from Ukrainians — WaPo,"Many Ukrainians have been infuriated by an admission, from President Vladimir Zelensky, that he concealed news of the imminent Russian special military operation last spring. That’s according to the Washington Post, where he made the revelation earlier this week. Zelensky’s disclosure that he sacrificed lives to avoid ruining the economy was his first serious communication blunder since the conflict began, the paper said. Before Zelensky seemed “beyond reproach, a national hero” to Ukrainians, the publication said, but the acknowledgment has “punctured the bubble, triggering a cascade of public criticism unprecedented since the war began.” In the interview, Zelensky admitted that prior to the outbreak of hostilities with Russia, he was downplaying US warnings about a looming attack out of fear Ukrainians would flee the country en masse. “If we had communicated that … then I would have been losing $7 billion a month since last October,” he said. Zelensky claimed that this deception of his own people prevented Russia from capturing the country in three days. In late January, Zelensky promised Ukrainians a peaceful year, stating that people would be cooking barbeque during the May holidays, like they always do. The statement came days after he met with CIA Director William Burns, who reportedly laid out in detail Russia’s military plans. Many ordinary Ukrainians and public figures were angered, seeing their president apparently not trusting them to handle the truth. Ukraine could have prepared for the fighting far better, stocking up on food and updating civil defense infrastructure and saving many lives that were lost, critics argued. Some questioned Zelensky’s motives in not informing the public. “He didn’t want to put the country on a military footing because he was afraid of losing power,” journalist Bogdan Butkevich wrote on social media, as cited by the Washington Post. Some of Zelensky’s supporters argued that people could have listened to American officials, who delivered public warnings about the Russian threat, instead of trusting their president, the article read. The newspaper ended the piece with remarks from a Ukrainian woman, who said people should not discuss Zelensky’s admission until after the conflict is over. “Ukraine is winning because of our belief in the president and our armed forces,” she was cited as saying. She believes that Zelensky would face accountability for his action afterwards, because “this is the society we are fighting for.”"
2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/561123-energodar-zaporozhye-nuclear-shelling/,Ukrainian forces shell nuclear plant city – official,"Ukrainian forces once again targeted Energodar with artillery on Thursday night, according to Vladimir Rogov, a member of the local administration. Rogov claimed at least seven shells hit the Russian-controlled city that hosts the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, the largest such facility in Europe. In a Telegram post, Rogov claimed that heavy artillery fire targeted the city around 10:50pm local time. The Zaporozhye NPP suffered no damage in the strike, local authorities later told Russian media. There were also no immediate reports of any casualties or damage to civilian infrastructure. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres voiced concern about the situation around the nuclear facility earlier on Thursday, during his meeting with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Lviv. While he stopped short of blaming either side, Guterres has once again called to demilitarize the area, insisting that an agreement was “urgently needed” to establish Zaporozhye as a “purely civilian infrastructure” to ensure the plant’s safety. “Common sense must prevail to avoid any actions that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant,” the UN chief said, adding that the facility “must not be used as part of any military operation” and that any damage to the plant would be “suicide.” Moscow has repeatedly called for an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission to the plant, which Guterres said could only happen with Kiev’s approval. Zelensky reiterated on Thursday that any such mission can only take place via Kiev-controlled territory, while calling for an “immediate and unconditional withdrawal” of Russian forces from the area. However, removing Russian troops “would only make the nuclear power plant more vulnerable,” according to Russian Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman, Ivan Nechayev, who on Thursday cited repeated “provocations” from Kiev’s forces and dismissed the idea of a “demilitarized zone” as “unacceptable.” The Russian Defense Ministry also warned on Thursday morning that Ukraine might carry out artillery strikes on the Zaporozhye NPP amid the visit by Guterres and Erdogan – and then accuse Moscow of causing a disaster at the site. Ukraine’s military intelligence responded by saying that Russian forces might stage a nuclear “provocation” in the territory they control. Russian troops took control of the Zaporozhye NPP early on in the course of military operations in Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry denies deploying any heavy weapons at the nuclear site, insisting that only Russian troops at the facility are lightly armed guards providing physical security against “provocations.” Moscow has repeatedly accused Kiev of conducting frequent drone and artillery strikes against the nuclear plant and the city of Energodar since mid-July. Kiev has denied responsibility and said Russian forces were attacking the plant to discredit Ukraine, while also claiming that Russia is using the facility as a military base."
2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/561122-vnukovo-moscow-gold-heist/,$13 million gold heist busted at Moscow airport,"An international conspiracy to smuggle 225 kilograms of gold worth an estimated 760 billion rubles (roughly $12.7 million) through Moscow was thwarted by sharp-eyed customs agents, the Federal Customs Service (FTS) of Russia announced on Thursday. The scheme involved two groups of three travelers who swapped suitcases inside Vnukovo Airport. The group, bound for the United Arab Emirates, was caught with a number of gold bars in their bags. The attempted heist took place on August 11, the FTS said in a statement. According to the customs service, three Armenian nationals smuggled the gold into the airport in their carry-on luggage. Since Armenia is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, they were not subject to customs controls. Once inside, however, they traded suitcases with a trio of Russian citizens, who had come in with empty baggage. The Russians were en route to Dubai in the UAE. Customs officers monitoring the airport’s security cameras, however, noticed something strange – three passengers dragging their wheeled suitcases with considerable effort. They began following the trio and saw them swapping bags with the other men, proceeding to the gate for their Yerevan flight with much more spring in their step. The customs inspectors decided to do a spot check on the passengers headed to the UAE, who had already boarded their flight. “The smugglers with the valuable cargo were detained by Vnukovo customs operatives after boarding their plane,” the FTS said. After stepping on board and checking the suspects’ bags, customs officers found 45 gold bars, the FTS said in the initial report. None of them had been declared or cleared customs inspection. All had the legally mandated serial numbers and other identification marks. The newspaper Kommersant later reported that the haul amounted to a total of 71 gold bars – 14 ingots of 12kg each and 57 smaller, one-kilo bars. Prosecutors said they intend to charge the group with three felonies, including criminal conspiracy and smuggling of goods designated of strategic importance. A Moscow court ordered the three Armenian nationals jailed until September 11. They were identified as Artak Ayvazyan, Karen Darbinyan and Arman Harutyunyan, officially unemployed. Their attorneys made a motion to keep them under house arrest instead, but the court denied it. The Russian citizens were released pending trial after signing statements that they would not leave Moscow."
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561120-biden-supports-ukraine-attacks-crimea/,US supports Ukraine attacking Crimea – Politico,"The US regards Ukrainian strikes on Crimea as fair game for ""self-defense purposes,” Politico reported on Thursday, citing an unnamed official in President Joe Biden’s administration. Washington won’t stand in the way of attacks on the peninsula “if Kiev deems them necessary,” the outlet reported. Historically Russian, Crimea was part of independent Ukraine from 1991 to 2014 before locals voted to reunify with Moscow. “We don't select targets, of course, and everything we've provided is for self-defense purposes. Any target they choose to pursue on sovereign Ukrainian soil is by definition self defense,” the anonymous official said. Asked by Politico if the Biden administration considered the peninsula sovereign Ukrainian territory, the official said: “Crimea is Ukraine.” Crimea broke away from Ukraine following an armed coup in Kiev in 2014 and voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to join Russia, which was not recognized by the West. A Ukrainian official told the outlet that the ""message of support” from Biden’s administration “had made its way to Kiev."" Politico’s reporting echoes earlier comments by Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov. Reznikov told US government-funded broadcaster Voice of America on Thursday that Kiev’s promise not to attack Russian territory with Western-provided weapons does not cover Crimea – and that Washington had not objected to Ukrainian attacks there. Powerful explosions near a Russian ammunition depot rocked the village of Mayskoye in northeastern Crimea on Tuesday. It was the second such incident in a matter of weeks, with a series of explosions also happening at the Saki military airfield earlier in the month, injuring 14 people and killing one. Russia's Ministry of Defense said the recent strikes were acts of ""sabotage"" and caused damage to civilian objects, including power lines, a power station, a railroad and several residential buildings. Ukraine has not directly confirmed responsibility for the recent attacks, but following the incident at the Saki airfield, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said the war ""began with Crimea and must end with Crimea – its liberation.""​"
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561119-crimea-airfield-explosions-heard/,Ukrainian drone shot down over Crimean airport,"The mayor of Sevastopol, Crimea’s largest city, has reported that a Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down by air defense systems in the vicinity of the city airport. “According to preliminary data, recently in the vicinity of the Belbek airfield an unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down by air defense systems,” Mikhail Razvozzhaev posted on his Telegram channel late on Thursday. The official added that there have been no reports of casualties or material damage as a result of the incident. Even though the drone attack was apparently foiled, the mayor noted that pro-Ukrainian groups on social media had already begun peddling messages about a “successful” attack. Razvozzhaev called on Sevastopol residents to keep calm and only trust official sources of information. Meanwhile, Reuters has reported at least four explosions in Sevastopol, citing eyewitnesses. Ukrainian journalist, Anatoly Shariy – a vocal critic of the Kiev government – claimed on his Telegram channel that some of the explosions were so loud that people heard them ten kilometers away from the airfield. The Belbek airfield has been used exclusively by the Russian air force since Crimea rejoined Russia in 2014."
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561117-crimea-air-defense/,Air defense systems activated near Crimean bridge (VIDEOS),"Air defense systems have been activated in the city of Kerch, in the vicinity of the Crimean Bridge, an adviser to Crimea’s governor said on Thursday evening. Videos circulating on social media showed what looks like a missile piercing the night sky, and sounds of explosions. Oleg Krychkov posted a short message on his Telegram channel, saying that according to preliminary information, “Air defense systems have been activated in Kerch. No danger for the city and the bridge.” There was a sound similar to that of thunder, with car alarms going off as a result, Russia’s TASS news agency reported citing the Kerch city council. Social media users have been sharing videos which purportedly depict the incident. The footage features a bright object moving across the night sky that looks like a missile, with some videos also capturing the sound of one or several explosions. The operator of the Crimean bridge, which links the peninsula with the Russian mainland, told journalists that there have been no traffic disruptions along the transport artery. Vladimir Rogov, member of the Russian military-civilian administration in Ukraine’s Zaporozhye Region, said on his Telegram channel that “according to preliminary data, a Ukrainian drone was shot down far away from the Crimean bridge.” He added that no casualties or material damage have been reported. Thursday evening’s activity comes amid a series of incidents in Crimea recently. On Tuesday, a temporary ammunition depot in northern Crimea was targeted in what the Russian Defense Ministry called an act of sabotage. Ammunition stored at the site exploded, causing damage to power lines, a power station, a railroad and several residential houses. Last week, a fire at a military airfield near the resort town of Novofyodorovka and a subsequent wave of explosions claimed the life of one civilian and left 14 more people injured. Russian authorities did not report any findings that would indicate foul play behind the fire. While stopping short of claiming responsibility, several top officials in Kiev have hinted that Ukrainian forces may have been behind the incidents. They also warned that more such fires and explosions could be expected in Crimea in the near future, and also threatened to target the Kerch bridge. The US government has given Ukraine the go-ahead to target Crimea, the outlet Politico reported citing a Biden administration official."
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561118-ammunition-depot-on-fire-belgorod/,Ammunition depot on fire in Russian region bordering Ukraine (VIDEOS),"An ammunition depot caught fire on Thursday night near the village of Timonovo, governor of in Russia's Belgorod Region Vyacheslav Gladkov has confirmed. There are no casualties, he said. The area is just across the border with Ukraine. ""An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo, Valuysky urban district. According to the latest reports, there were no casualties, no injuries. The head of the district is taking the residents of the villages of Timonovo and Soloti to a safe distance,"" Gladkov said on his Telegram channel. Emergency services are on the scene and the cause of the fire is under investigation, he added. Since the start of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, Kiev’s forces have carried out numerous strikes on settlements and border checkpoints in Russia’s regions of Belgorod, Bryansk and Kursk. The attacks, which mainly involved drones and mortars, have hit both infrastructure and residential areas, resulting in destruction, injuries, and several civilian deaths."
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561114-russia-belgorod-ukrainian-mines/,Ukraine scatters ‘butterfly’ mines in Russia – governor,"A large number of Ukrainian ‘butterfly’ anti-personnel mines have been found spread across Russia’s Belgorod Region, which borders Ukraine, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov told reporters on Thursday. He stated that the mines had been discovered after Kiev’s forces shelled the Shebekinsky urban district near the village of Sereda back in May, and that regional authorities were still unable to allow residents to return as many of the mines were still spread throughout the area. “The Petals (PFM-1 anti-personnel mines) were scattered in large numbers and at a great distance. Now we are taking measures to remove everything,” said Gladkov. The governor added that, due to the increasing threat, schools located in the 5km zone in nine border municipalities could not open as usual and that the situation was even further complicated by the fact that some children were beginning to find and play around with unexploded shells and cartridges. He recalled that, earlier this month, one boy lost his hand after trying to disassemble ammunition that he had found in his village. He had also severely damaged his face and eyes. Gladkov has urged residents of Belgorod Region to exercise caution when walking down the streets. “We must do everything to protect the lives of both the small inhabitants of the region and the adults,” he said, noting that local authorities, law enforcement and the Ministry of Defense were doing everything they can to make the region safe, but warned it was still dangerous. Russian regions bordering Ukraine have been reporting attacks by Ukrainian forces since March, including mortar strikes, drone bombardments, and suspected sabotage attempts. In May, a truck driver was killed in a mortar strike on the village of Tyotkino in Kursk Region, where several other civilians were injured. Belgorod was hit by several ballistic missiles in July, killing a total of five civilians, and injuring at least five more."
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561111-ukraine-shelling-child-killed/,Child among dead after Ukrainian shelling – DPR,"At least three civilians, including a child, were killed on Thursday after Ukrainian forces shelled the city center of Svetlodarsk in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), according to local officials. Five 155mm artillery shells struck the city at 9:50 am as local residents gathered near a school and a city hospital to receive water. The shelling was reported by the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR) representative office in the Joint Center on Control and Coordination (JCCC) on its Telegram channel earlier in the day. “Three civilians were killed, including one child, and 12 people were injured. Additional information is being specified,"" the JCCC reported. War correspondent Andrey Rudenko said that the shelling of Svetlodarsk targeted a local hotel, kindergarten, pharmacy and a place where people gather water. He added that two people died on the spot as a result of the attack, including a fourteen-year-old. Home to some 11,000 people, the industrial city of Svetlodarsk in the DPR has been the center of several battles amid Russia’s ongoing military campaign in Ukraine. Russian forces took control of the city in late May. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561109-ukraine-finland-reconnaissance-satellites/,Ukraine to gain more reconnaissance capabilities,"Finnish satellite maker ICEYE announced on Thursday that it had signed a contract with a Ukrainian charity to provide Kiev with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imaging capabilities. In a statement published on its website, ICEYE said the deal would grant the government in Kiev access to the full capabilities of one of its SAR satellites already in orbit, which is able to capture images on Earth’s surface regardless of the time of day or weather conditions. While the satellite will continue to be operated by ICEYE, the company will also provide Kiev with access to its constellation of SAR satellites for over a year, which will allow Kiev’s forces to receive high resolution radar satellite imagery on “critical locations with a high revisit frequency.” Sergey Prytula, the founder of the Sergey Prytula Charity Foundation that signed the contract with the Finnish satellite maker, said ICEYE’s products are the “most developed radar satellite imaging technology in the world as of today.” Although he did not provide details on how much the deal with ICEYE cost, in a YouTube video announcing the signing of the contract, he noted that it had been paid for using money his charity was gathering for the purchase of Bayraktar drones, which Turkey ended up gifting to Ukraine. According to Prytula, the charity raised over $16 million. “This agreement is a significant step in responding to the government of Ukraine’s urgent request for critical Earth observation data and it will greatly benefit our armed forces,” said Prytula. ICEYE CEO Rafal Modrzewski said he also believed the contract would provide Kiev with “objective data and technological support.” Operating the world’s largest SAR satellite constellation, ICEYE positions itself as the global leader in persistent monitoring via satellite imaging. Founded in 2014, the company has so far deployed some 21 satellites, including both commercial and dedicated customer missions, and claims to be the only organization in the world that offers its clients “rapid delivery of high-precision SAR satellites and data.”"
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561090-kinzhal-kaliningrad-hypersonic-finland/,Russia relocates jets armed with hypersonic missiles,"Three Mig-31 supersonic interceptor aircraft carrying Kinzhal air-to-surface hypersonic missiles have been deployed to Russia’s western exclave of Kaliningrad, the country’s Defense Ministry has announced. On Thursday, the planes were relocated to Chkalovsk airfield in Kaliningrad Region as part of “additional strategic deterrence measures,” the ministry explained. During their flight, the Mig-31s worked out interactions with Russian forces stationed in the area, as well as the naval aviation of the Baltic Fleet, it added. The planes will be placed on 24/7 combat duty in Kaliningrad, according to the Defense Ministry. Russia’s neighbor Finland said later on Thursday that the Mig-31s may have violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland as they were heading to their destination. According to the Finnish Defense Ministry, an investigation has been launched into the incident. Kinzhal, which means ‘dagger’ in English, can travel at a speed of Mach 12 (around 14,800kph), while constantly performing evasive maneuvers, which is believed to allow it to penetrate any existing air defenses. Several Kinzhal missiles have been deployed by Russia during the conflict in Ukraine, according to the Defense Ministry. The missile is one of several hypersonic systems developed for the country’s military in recent years, along with the Avangard glider, which is fitted on silo-based ICBMs, and Zircon (Tsirkon) missiles, to be used by the navy. Kaliningrad, which borders Poland and Lithuania, and has access to the Baltic Sea, also hosts nuclear-capable Iskander missiles."
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561096-russia-nuclear-arsenal-use/,Russia explains rules for using nuclear weapons,"Russia is a responsible nuclear power and will only use its nuclear arms if attacked with weapons of mass destruction or if its existence is under threat, a spokesman for the country’s foreign ministry has said. Meanwhile, some Western officials argue that nukes can play a role on the battlefield, Ivan Nechaev added. According to Russia’s official nuclear posture, “the use of the nuclear arsenal is possible only in response to an attack as a self-defense measure and in extreme circumstances,” the deputy press secretary of the ministry said during a daily briefing on Thursday. The diplomat was responding to a question about the risk of nuclear escalation in the conflict with Ukraine. Russia is not in the habit of “saber-rattling, especially with nuclear weapons,” he said. Moscow is determined to keep the situation in Ukraine conventional and has no need to use a nuclear option in Ukraine, Nechaev asserted. He lamented that the leaders of Western powers have become far less responsible than their Cold War-era predecessors when it comes to deterrence issues. “The liberal-globalist circles think it possible to discuss lowering the benchmark for the use of nuclear weapons,” he said, citing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg as one example. The Russian Defense Ministry has repeatedly reassured that its goals in Ukraine can be achieved without the use of nuclear arms. Deploying them would not make any military sense, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said this week."
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561091-ukraine-zaporozhye-nuclear-contamination/,Russia warns of another Chernobyl,"Ukraine’s ongoing attacks on the Russia-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant may cause a far worse disaster for Europe than the current energy crisis, a Russian Defense Ministry official has warned. Igor Kirillov, who heads Russia’s Nuclear Biological and Chemical Defense Troops, illustrated the likely worst-case scenario of a direct hit on Europe’s largest nuclear plant, during a briefing on Thursday. He showed journalists a map, with plumes of radioactive material from the site reaching Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Moldova, Belarus and even Germany. He blamed Ukraine's Western backers for trying to downplay the danger of targeting the atomic plant, and forgetting the lessons of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear incident. According to Kirillov, both disasters involved “the failure of support systems, the disruption of power supply and partial and complete shutdown of the cooling systems, which led to overheating of nuclear fuel and the destruction of the reactor”. The fallout of the Chernobyl disaster affected some 20 countries, while causing 4,000 deaths, a major spike in cancer cases, and the permanent relocation of around 100,000 people. The effects of the Fukushima nuclear incident might seem “insignificant” at first glance, but up to 500,000 people have abandoned their homes because of it, he noted. “Our experts believe that the actions of the Ukrainian armed forces may cause a similar situation at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant,” Kirillov said. Strikes by the Kiev forces could render the plant’s cooling systems and other support infrastructure inoperable, which would lead “to overheating of the core and, as a result, the destruction of reactor units at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, with the release of radioactive substances into the atmosphere and their spreading for hundreds of kilometers,” he warned. “Such an emergency will cause mass migration of the population and will have more catastrophic consequences than the looming energy crisis in Europe,” the military official added. Moscow has accused Kiev of carrying out 12 attacks on the nuclear facilitity, which provides energy to both Russian- and Ukrainian-controlled areas, since mid-July. Ukraine insists that Russian forces are shelling the site, while accusing them of stationing military hardware at the plant. The Russian side has denied both accusations, while also urging International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts to visit the Zaporozhye facility to see what is actually happening."
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561016-russia-relations-north-korea/,No longer a pariah? Russia and China could be about to 'normalize' North Korea and leave the US with another Asian headache,"At beginning of this week the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin had exchanged letters with Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. The report stated both countries had agreed to “expand the(ir) comprehensive and constructive bilateral relations with common efforts”. Matching the anniversary of Korean independence on August 15th, Putin’s outreach comes as Russia seeks new partners away from the West. It also follows reports that North Korean expatriate workers would be assisting in the reconstruction of liberated territories in the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, to which it recently granted diplomatic recognition. But it’s also an indication that the world has changed, significantly. Only a few years ago Russia, as well as China, were at least somewhat willing to cooperate with the United States in imposing sanctions on the DPRK in the bid to curb its nuclear and missile development. That situation no longer exists. The outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine, combined with America’s bid to try and contain the rise of China, now means we exist in a multipolar international environment where multiple great powers are competing for influence. This breaks down the space for cooperation over common issues, but also increases the need for strategic thinking among the competitors. In the eyes of Moscow, this makes their calculus concerning North Korea even more important than it was before, drawing parallels to the Cold War era. We should not forget that it was the Soviet Union that enabled the creation of the DPRK in the first place. It was following the closing days of World War II that a strategic contest for influence in East Asia began to emerge between the US and the USSR over the former territories of Imperial Japan. As the Red Army marched south, an agreement was made to divide the Korean Peninsula at the 38th parallel. Although the original agreement was designed only to make the division temporary, geopolitical frictions soon saw it become permanent, and rival Korean states emerged. The US-backed Republic of Korea in the South, and the Soviet- and China-supported Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in the North, headed by former Red Army captain and guerrilla fighter Kim Il-sung. The two young nations went to war in 1950, again supported by their respective superpower backers. Active fighting in that conflict ended three years later, but a formal peace agreement has not been signed to this day. And while Koreans on both sides of the divide wish for reunification, the scale of foreign involvement in the 1950s war stands as a reminder the peninsula is seen as a strategically critical landmass linking the continent of mainland Eurasia to the eastern seas. Great powers have always seen it as a chess piece in the bid to dominate North East Asia. This had led to a tug of war which over the centuries has included the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the Russian Empire, the Empire of Japan and the United States, the People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union. But for the last three decades, since the end of the original Cold War, North Korea found itself increasingly isolated as China and Russia, for a period of time, both sought ties with the West, as well as the much more lucrative and successful South Korea. US unipolarity meant there was little interest from Moscow or Beijing in opposing America’s wishes to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear trajectory, which it sees as its last hope for regime survival. But now a new paradigm is emerging, and just like in the times of old the DPRK, it’s seen yet again as a strategically indispensable bulwark against American power and military hegemony on Russia’s own border periphery, not least against its US-backed neighbors such as Japan. In such an environment, there is no longer any benefit for Russia in cooperating with the US on the North Korean issue. The horse of “North Korea denuclearization” has long bolted, and instead the presence of a nuclear armed DPRK with ICBM capability is another thorn in Washington’s side, which if removed, only expands US power. Thus, when America demanded another sanctions resolution against North Korea at the UN Security council earlier this year, both Russia and China vetoed it for the first time in over 15 years. It is a sign of the world we live in. Moving on from here, Russia is likely to deepen its military and economic ties with North Korea, primarily because of its strategic and political worth. In this view, history has completed a full circle and as the US shores up its allies to confront Moscow and Beijing, the theme of “bloc politics” re-emerges."
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561088-ukraine-deutsche-welle-propaganda/,Kiev slams German state media over 'Russian propaganda’,"The Russian-language section of Deutsche Welle (DW) is “spreading Russian propaganda,” Oleg Nikolaenko, the spokesman for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has claimed, while calling on Berlin to take action. He vented anger at DW on his Facebook page on Wednesday, saying that the German state-funded outlet was a “stooge for Russian propaganda, manipulates quotes and misrepresents the causes and consequences of the Russian aggression against Ukraine.” The post includes several screenshots, of what he sees as DW’s wrongdoing. One of the messages reported an initiative by a Russian political party last month to designate Ukraine “a terrorist state.” Another was from Vogue magazine, which disproved claims that in 1939 it published a glamorous photo of Adolf Hitler and his companion Eva Braun. The theme became popular in Russian social media after the magazine printed images of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenksy and his wife Elena last month, with users comparing the actual photoshoot with the fictional one. Nikolaenko was also apparently unhappy with DW’s coverage of a possible disaster at the Russia-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, a poll on a ban of all Russians from the Schengen zone, and even Zelensky’s statement calling for such a restrictive measure. The Ukrainian diplomat recalled that the German government had banned Russian media outlets like RT from broadcasting in the country, adding: “We are calling on our German partners to react to the narratives of the Russian propaganda, which are being spread in the DW content.”"
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561080-anti-radiation-missiles-ukraine/,New US missile won't turn tide for Ukraine – Business Insider,"A new type of missile that Ukraine is now using against Russia after some projectiles were provided by the US is unlikely to change the tide of battle, according to an article published by Business Insider (BI) on Wednesday. Ukraine received AGM-88 HARM missiles as part of the most recent weapons delivery from Washington. US Under Secretary of Defense Colin Kahl confirmed the shipment of anti-radiation air-launched missiles during an August 8 briefing. Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov mentioned receiving such weapons from the US in an interview last week. Neither official identified the weapon system by name, but debris reportedly found this month on the ground in Ukraine points to the specific model. The AGM-88 HARM, which has been in service since the mid-1980s, is designed to home in on strong radiation produced by ground radar systems. These weapons are usually launched to disable enemy air defenses ahead of a raid. In the Ukrainian conflict, it is likely to have only “a limited impact,” considering its nature, defense writer Michael Peck said in the BI article. Ukraine doesn’t have that many warplanes, he pointed out, so “shutting down Russian air-defense radars won’t necessarily translate into more success for Ukrainian aircraft.” The type of missile is, in many ways, “a psychological weapon,” but Ukraine could potentially use them against Russian radars used for counter-artillery warfare, Peck said. Artillery battles have been the deciding factor in the conflict so far, and Kiev has repeatedly complained about being completely outgunned as it asked for increased support from the US and its allies."
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561073-provocation-nuclear-power-plant/,Ukraine planning nuclear provocation on Friday – Moscow,"Ukraine plans to carry out artillery strikes on the Russia-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant on Friday, and then accuse Moscow of causing a disaster at the site, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Thursday. The predicted attack will be timed to coincide with the ongoing visit to Ukraine by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Moscow insisted. An official said they had detected the movements of Ukrainian troops, indicating a looming “provocation.” Kiev has deployed units trained in responding to the use of weapons of mass destruction, pre-positioning them to report a radiation leak and demonstrate a purported action to mitigate it, Russian military spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. The ministry said it expects a Ukrainian artillery unit to attack the plant on Friday from the city of Nikopol. “The blame for the consequences [of the strike] will be attributed to the Russian armed forces,” the statement said. In a separate statement on Thursday, Igor Kirillov, who heads Russia’s Nuclear Biological and Chemical Defense Troops, said his directorate has modeled possible scenarios for a disaster at the Zaporozhye plant. A plume of radioactive materials from the site may reach Poland, Slovakia and Germany, he warned. Russia has accused Ukraine of conducting frequent drone and artillery strikes against the nuclear power plant in the city of Energodar over the past few weeks. Kiev has denied responsibility and said Russian forces were attacking the plant to discredit Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have also claimed that Russia is using the Zaporozhye facility as a military base. During the briefing, Konashenkov denied Ukrainian claims that Russia has deployed heavy weapons at the Zaporozhye plant and is attacking Ukrainian troops from the site. The only Russian troops at the facility are lightly armed guards providing physical security, the official said. The ministry pledged to do its best to prevent damage to the nuclear facility."
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/news/561074-ukraine-foreign-fighters-kharkov/,Dozens of foreign fighters eliminated in strike on Ukrainian base – Russia,"Dozens of foreign mercenaries, fighting for Kiev against Moscow, have been killed in an attack on a compound in the city of Kharkov in northeastern Ukraine, Russia’s Defense Ministry said on Thursday. “A temporary base of foreign mercenaries in the city of Kharkov was hit with a ground-based high-precision weapon. More than 90 militants were killed,” ministry’s spokesman Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov announced during his daily briefing. The Russian Air Force also struck Ukrainian manpower and military hardware in Kherson and Nikolaev Regions, eliminating 80 combatants and injuring 50 others, he added. Compounds, hosting foreign mercenaries in Ukraine, have already been targeted by Russia several times this month, leading to multiple casualties. Thousands of fighters from Poland, Canada, the US, the UK and other countries responded to a call by President Vladimir Zelensky and flocked to Ukraine. In April, the Russian military estimated their numbers at nearly 7,000. However, last month it said that only 2,741 foreign fighters remained in Ukraine. Many of them were killed, while others fled to their home countries and later complained about chaos in the ranks of the Kiev forces, and a lack of arms and other equipment. Konashenkov had earlier warned that mercenaries aren’t viewed as combatants under international law and “the best thing that awaits them if they are captured alive is a trial and maximum prison terms.”"
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561071-iaea-inspection-zaporozhye-plant/,Russia urges international inspection of shelled nuclear site,"Russia is calling on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant as soon as possible to fulfill its mandate as the UN’s nuclear watchdog, a senior Russian diplomat said. “We would like such an IAEA mission to take place soon. Russia will do its best to facilitate it,” Igor Vishnevetsky, the deputy foreign minister for arms control, said during a Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty conference on Wednesday. The inspection was supposed to happen sometime ago, he added, but was derailed “not due to a fault of ours.” The diplomat pointed the finger at Ukraine, saying that its regular attacks on the nuclear site was why it was not safe for IAEA monitors to visit it. “People should not attack nuclear sites, should not use artillery or other weapons against nuclear power plants,” Vishnevetsky stressed. “The Ukrainian side knows it very well, and nevertheless does it, effectively committing acts of nuclear terrorism.” The Ukrainian power plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, comes under regular artillery shelling. One projectile this week reportedly struck ten meters from a container holding spent nuclear fuel. Kiev denies carrying out the strikes and claims that Russian troops are shelling the plant to discredit Ukraine. It also accused Russia of stationing its military forces at the Zaporozhye plant. The UN would neither confirm nor deny allegations by either side and called for a demilitarized zone around the nuclear facility. The US said that Russia had to cede control of the plant and the city of Energodar, where it’s located, to Ukraine, to prevent the risk of a nuclear disaster."
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561062-nord-stream-antonov-victory/,Russia names main victim of US energy ‘victory’,"Western Europe’s current woes with natural gas supplies are due to US pressure to block the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from coming online, the Russian ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov claimed in a TV interview on Wednesday. With this move, he said, the US won a victory not so much over Russia, but over much of European industry, which now has to rely on far more expensive American “molecules of freedom.” “No matter how much Washington tries to present Russia as an unreliable supplier, this is not true,” Antonov told Russia-24 in an interview that aired Wednesday evening. “The problems of our buyers began solely as a result of sanctions and restrictions imposed or inspired by the US,” the ambassador added. “We are ready to sell to everyone who needs inexpensive and high-quality resources.” He cited the example of Nord Stream 2, the pipeline under the Baltic Sea that was supposed to deliver natural gas from Russia to Germany. It was completed last year but Berlin halted its certification in February – prior to the escalation of hostilities in Ukraine – and refused to make it operational despite appeals from German industry and local officials to do so. “The pipeline was ready to launch and could solve almost all the supply problems that arose with [Nord Stream 1] due to the sanctions confusion,” Antonov said. “The only thing missing is political will, the EU states just need to press the button and the pipeline will start working. But in the EU capitals they gave in to persistent pressure from the White House. As a result, a bet was made on expensive LNG.” Liquefied natural gas is exported by the US in quantities nowhere near sufficient for the European market. Antonov made a pointed reference to the US Department of Energy calling it “molecules of freedom” back in 2019. Nord Stream 2 was a victory for Washington, which “struck a massive blow not so much against Russia, but against European competitiveness,” Antonov said. Addressing reports that the US and its allies are trying to impose a price cap on Russian oil and gas exports, Antonov predicted that such attempts would backfire, as there would be a realignment of commodity markets “not in favor of Western countries.” “US attempts to divide the energy markets into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ leads to destabilization, rising fuel prices and inflation,” Antonov said."
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561061-ambassador-us-relations-crumbs/,Moscow’s envoy picks over ‘crumbs’ of Russia-US relations,"Relations between Washington and Moscow are at an “unprecedented” low, making it practically impossible to resolve many issues that impact the entire world, the Russian ambassador to the US said on Wednesday in a TV interview. The Washington establishment and the media are overwhelmingly Russophobic, unlike the American public in general, ambassador Anatoly Antonov told the news channel Russia-24. “The situation is unfortunate. I would like to describe it otherwise, but I can't. Everything that has been built up in recent years has been destroyed,” Antonov said in the interview, aired on Wednesday evening. “It seemed like two years ago we were talking about a difficult relationship, when we had the Trump administration here kicking out Russian diplomats and seizing our property.” But ever since Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, relations between Moscow and Washington have degraded to a point where Russian nationals, even those living in the US, are subjected to discrimination, intimidation and harassment, Antonov said. Antonov described Russian-American political dialogue as “paralyzed” to the detriment of even those areas where the two countries have mutual interests. The first contact Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken had in six months was a phone call at the end of July. Of our interactions, only crumbs remain. The few remaining areas of interaction amount to a deconfliction hotline in Syria, some work on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and to some extent peaceful space exploration. “Unfortunately, this is all I can name today,” Antonov said, adding that Russia is firmly convinced that without direct interaction, it’s impossible to solve not just bilateral problems but issues that affect the entire world. Russophobia currently dominates major American cities, but as one gets further from Washington, there is “less interest in European affairs and more questions about why the US is feuding with Russia in difficult economic times,” according to Antonov. “Unfortunately, cultural, scientific, and educational ties have been severed. Mentions of our country's role in World War II are also being erased,” he added. While Americans are slowly growing tired of anti-Russian rhetoric and are more interested in their everyday problems, according to the ambassador, there is a long way to go before the current hostility can be overcome. Antonov claimed that US “political circles do not like our desire to create a new international order.” The Kremlin demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc, after recognizing the Donbass republics as independent states over Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements. Ukraine insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked, even as its former president admitted that for Kiev the main goal of the Germany- and France-brokered protocols, first signed in 2014, was to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.”"
2022-08-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/561058-navalny-deripaska-lavrov-defamation-sanctions/,Russian billionaire sues Navalny,"Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska has sued opposition activist Aleksey Navalny and his associates over an “investigation” posted on YouTube in 2018 that accused the aluminum tycoon of giving bribes to Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Tweeting about the lawsuit on Wednesday, Navalny called on the US, EU and UK to impose more sanctions on Deripaska and Lavrov. The opposition blogger is currently in prison for a series of transgressions, from defrauding a French company and donors to his political campaigns, to contempt of court. He claims to be a victim of political persecution by President Vladimir Putin’s government. “Putin crook is suing,” Navalny tweeted in Russian, posting a redacted photo of the court summons. He said Deripaska was demanding the removal of photos and videos depicting him with Lavrov in Japan, among other things. Deripaska’s lawyer Alexei Melnikov told the outlet RBK that his client has indeed filed a defamation lawsuit. “Based on the published photograph of the plaintiff with Foreign Minister Lavrov, completely unacceptable allegations were made about various crimes, in particular, with arguments about corruption, bribery and lobbying,” Melnikov said. In addition to Navalny, the lawsuit names his associates Georgy Alburov and Maria Pevchikh, as well as The Insider, the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, and Associated Newspapers Limited, the parent company of the Daily Mail. Pevchikh told RBK that Deripaska demanded not only the deletion of their “investigative report,” but also a video rebuttal, saying he would demand 50 million rubles (around $825,000) a day in damages until this is done. She added she did not intend to comply with his demands. Navalny seemed to suggest that the verdict before the Zelenograd court will be a foregone conclusion, tweeting, “I have no doubts about the ability of Putin's oligarch to convince Putin's court.” He also called on the US, EU and the UK to “introduce really effective sanctions against these thieves and accomplices of war” and make sure they can’t “bribe politicians and journalists” in the West to “launder their image.” Deripaska has sued Navalny for defamation before, winning a judgment in November 2021. Earlier this week, the aluminum magnate sued another Russian billionaire, banker Oleg Tinkov, demanding two billion rubles ($35 million) in compensation over an Instagram post in which Tinkov called him “an oligarch and a thief.”"
2022-08-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/561049-embassy-latvia-soviet-reparations/,Russia warns EU state over Soviet debt,"The Russian embassy in Riga has poked fun at Latvian media reports that a state commission is working on establishing “damages” from the Soviet “occupation” of the Baltic state, which is now a member of the EU and NATO. If Latvians really wanted reparations from occupiers, they shouldn’t give a pass to Poland, Sweden or the Teutonic Order, the embassy joked on Wednesday. It also warned that Riga could end up owing Russia money after they tally all the Soviet investments in its infrastructure and industry. According to statements in some local media, the “commission on accounting of damages from the Soviet occupation” is soon expected to present a report on alleged financial losses Latvia suffered between 1940 and 1991, the embassy said. “We never cease to be surprised at the selectivity of Latvian officials. After all, a fair accounting would also take into consideration the losses from the occupation of Latvian land by the German crusaders, the [Polish-Lithuanian] Commonwealth and Sweden,” the Russian diplomats said, noting that this accounts for more than 500 years of foreign rule. If the commission tallied up the entire housing, transport, communication, port and industrial infrastructure built from scratch in the Latvian Soviet Republic, the embassy added, “Latvia would end up with a bill to pay instead!” Imperial Russia ruled the territory of present-day Latvia from 1795 to 1920, developing Riga into the empire’s largest port. Some 40,000 men served in the Latvian Rifles, an elite imperial infantry corps, during the First World War. The majority joined the Bolshevik revolution, with one of their officers, Colonel Jukums Vacietis, becoming the first commanding general of the Red Army. Though they played a key role in winning the Russian civil war for the Reds, the Latvian Rifles lost the war in their own home province to a coalition of German, Polish and Estonian troops. In 1920, the Bolshevik government signed the Treaty of Riga, recognizing an independent Latvia. In August 1940, however, a pro-Soviet government made a bid for admission into the USSR. During the Second World War, Latvia was occupied by Nazi Germany. Two Waffen-SS units, the 15th and 19th grenadiers, were raised as the Latvian Legion. Around 10,000 of them continued to wage guerrilla war against the USSR until 1956, calling themselves “Forest Brothers.” Latvia declared independence in August 1991, and to this day denies citizenship to ethnic Russians living in its territory."

Due to his athletic physique, some online commentators compared Andrey Fesik to ‘GigaChad,’ a popular internet meme, representing an ultra-masculine male. Fesik’s leap to fame came earlier this month when a poster prepared for his campaign was uploaded online. It featured a topless photo of the muscled candidate and a slogan promising that the city is going to be in firm hands if he’s elected on September 11. The 35-year-old bodybuilder, who’s employed as a trainer at a local gym, is running for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR). The party, which is often described as ultra-nationalist and populist, currently holds 21 seats in the Russian parliament. The LDPR has been around since the early 1990s, and was led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who passed away earlier this year due to complications from Covid-19.

Internet users browsed through Fesik’s Instagram page and discovered more spicy images there. Those that attracted the most attention featured him sporting a kitchen apron and reading a newspaper in a revealing gown. Публикация от Андрей Фесик (@fesik_andrey) The heightened attention prompted the aspiring politician to briefly block access to the account and allegedly delete some of the more controversial photos. His page is now accessible again. Fesik told Gazeta.ru last week that his promotional pictures appeared on the internet by accident and that the poster with his topless photo was just one of many possible choices that hadn’t been approved yet. Публикация от Андрей Фесик (@fesik_andrey) His team decided to add “a touch of irony and sarcasm” because “the people are tired of formulaic candidates and slogans,” he said. “The voter wants to see real people with some healthy sense of humor. We already have a lot of serious men in jackets, and what’s the good of that?” he said. Fesik also confirmed that it wasn’t a stunt and that he’s an actual candidate, who has already been registered to take part in the election."
2022-08-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/561029-millionaire-dan-rapoport-dead/,Former Moscow nightclub king found dead in US,"Latvian-born millionaire Dan Rapoport, known for founding Moscow’s exclusive SOHO Rooms nightclub, has been found dead in Washington DC, his wife Alena confirmed on Wednesday. While she did not provide any details of his death, she denied earlier reports that the 52-year-old businessman had committed suicide. On Tuesday, journalist Yuniya Pugacheva announced on her Telegram channel that Rapoport had killed himself, but not before apparently letting his dog out into a park along with some money and a suicide note attached. The journalist also claimed she had seen Rapoport in a London bar in May surrounded by young women and suggested that his wife had left him. “There were no letters, no suicide, no trip to London and no divorce,” Rapoport’s widow told the RBK news outlet, adding that she was supposed to meet her husband in the US. “We had plans, he had planned meetings, other plans... Dan evacuated us from Kiev and returned to Ukraine to help the country. We were supposed to meet later in the US,” she said. Rapaport was born in Riga, Latvia. In the 1980s his family emigrated to the US but after the fall of the USSR in 1991 he went to Moscow to become an investment banker. In 2007 he co-founded the Soho Rooms club which became one of the most popular nightclubs in the Russian capital, often frequented by the rich and famous. After publicly throwing his support behind Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Rapoport left Russia in 2012 and moved back to the US with his then-wife Irina and two children. He lived in Washington DC until 2016 before splitting up with his fiance and selling their mansion to Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka for $5.5 million. Since then he had been living in Kiev with his second wife Alena, with whom he had a daughter. Five years ago, Sergey Tkachenko - another co-founder of the Soho Rooms - was found dead after seemingly jumping out of the window of his apartment in central Moscow."
2022-08-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/561023-russia-alcoholism-putin-advice/,Putin gives advice on tackling alcoholism,"The government should promote healthy alternatives to excessive alcohol consumption rather than adopting restrictive policies, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday. “You cannot prohibit it or impose excessively high excise duties to ramp up the prices,” the Russian leader said during video meeting with a Russian governor on Wednesday, adding that ignoring the problem and saying “people drink and they always will” is also the wrong approach. There are “simple things” that can be done to deal with the issue effectively, Putin suggested, including promoting better lifestyles and offering healthier alternative ways for people to spend their free time. “I am not saying anything novel here, but still. The promotion of a healthy lifestyle is very important. But it’s not enough. There needs to be a developed infrastructure for sports and physical training,” the president noted. “And culture in the wider sense needs attention. Make the conditions for people to go to places, foster their interest in culture,” he added. The issue was raised when the president mentioned to Aleksandr Avdeev, Governor of the central Russian Vladimir Region, that his constituency’s alcoholism rate is double the national average. Alcohol abuse has a long history in Russia, and for centuries taxing vodka and other spirits has been an easy way for the government to fill its coffers. However, national consumption has significantly dropped in the last decade, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). A 2021 report by the European office of the WHO’s SAFER initiative, aimed at combating alcohol abuse, said that between 2010 and 2016 Russia saw a 26.1% decline in estimated per-capita consumption, compared to the average 12.5% decrease in the region."
2022-08-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/561020-china-russia-military-exercise/,Beijing confirms joint military drill with Moscow,"Chinese troops will be among the foreign participants at a multilateral military exercise in Russia called Vostok 2022, China’s Defense Ministry confirmed on Wednesday. The People’s Liberation Army will send personnel to Russia, expecting the event to “deepen pragmatic and friendly cooperation with the militaries of the participating countries, enhance the level of strategic coordination among the parties, and enhance the ability to deal with various security threats,” a statement said. Beijing noted that current regional and international tensions did not affect its decision. Vostok 2022 will take place at 13 locations in eastern Russia between August 30 and September 5, the Russian Defense Ministry announced in late July. It said foreign militaries were invited, but did not specify nationalities. The Chinese statement mentioned Belarus, India, Mongolia and Tajikistan among the guests. Moscow conducts a strategic exercise of this kind once a year, with one of Russia’s five military districts picked to host it. In 2021, the Zapad maneuvers were held in the west of the country, together with Russian ally Belarus, while in 2020 the Kavkaz exercise took place in the south, with nations like Armenia, Iran and Pakistan participating. The last event in the eastern military district took place in September 2018. Chinese and Mongolian troops were involved in the Russian maneuvers at that time."
2022-08-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/561015-ukraine-crimes-strikes-permission/,No agreement with US forbidding attack on Crimea – Kiev,"Ukraine’s pledge not to attack Russian territory with Western-provided weapons does not cover Crimea, Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov said on Tuesday. Western nations have claimed that their supplies of advanced weapons to Ukraine were conditional on their non-use against targets in Russia, but officials in Kiev have long suggested that Crimea does not fall under that rule, as it considers the peninsula to be its own territory. In an interview with US government-funded broadcaster Voice of America, Reznikov said the US has not objected to strikes on the territory, which Russia views as its own. “We have an agreement with the US that we will not use weapons provided by the US and partners against the territory of the Russian Federation. But if we discuss de-occupying… Ukrainian land where the enemy is now, there are no such restrictions,” he said, after being asked about possible attacks against Crimea. The minister stated that the limiting factor in such strikes would be the range of the weapons it receives from foreign allies. In the same interview, he expressed hope that Ukraine would soon receive MGM-140 ATACMS tactical ballistic missiles. The Lockheed Martin-made projectiles can be fired by the M142 HIMARS and the M270 MLRS rocket systems, which Ukraine already has, and have a range of up to 300 km, significantly further than the types of ammunition provided by the US so far. Crimea broke away from Ukraine after the 2014 armed coup in Kiev, which ousted the democratically elected government. Crimeans overwhelmingly voted in a referendum to join Russia, which accepted the bid and enshrined the peninsula’s new status in its constitution. The move was not recognized by Kiev, which has said it will only seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis after defeating Russia militarily and ousting it from all captured territories, including Crimea. The administration of US President Joe Biden has said it imposed restrictions on Ukraine, to avoid being directly dragged into a conflict with Russia. Some officials in both the US and Russia have asserted that the conflict in Ukraine is a NATO war with Russia by a proxy. Washington has said its goal in Ukraine is to achieve a strategic defeat of Moscow."
2022-08-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/560649-putin-west-officials-extremism/,"Putin first, populists next – who else will Western leaders blame for an energy crisis caused by NATO's geopolitical ambitions?","At the outset of the Ukraine conflict, Western officials proclaimed their unity against Moscow and vowed to accelerate their transition away from Russian fossil fuels and towards greener energy. The idea was to deprive the Kremlin of revenues which, in their minds, would result in defunding the military operation in Ukraine. So they went full scorched-earth on their own cheap energy supply – that is, gas from Europe's largest country – and sanctioned it. It wasn’t long before it became obvious that was something much easier said than done. Soon, officials started making public requests of their citizens to “do their part” by sacrificing their everyday comforts and quality of life, like taking shorter showers – as though that would remedy the fact that industrial representatives were already sounding the alarm about rationing and manufacturing shortages. Next, Western officials started backpedalling on their pledges to eradicate those forms of energy they had previously considered non-green. It was barely a few months earlier that Germany was chastising France for persisting with nuclear energy. Now, Berlin may potentially be joining Paris in turning back to it as a source, all while it also fires the old coal plants back up. Western Europeans had initially figured that they could at least maybe rely on hydroelectric energy from Norway, but the dry summer heat now threatens that, too, as Oslo considers cuts to its exports. And even liquified natural gas from Britain may not be exportable to the EU, since toxic and even radioactive contaminants have recently been found in the supply originally sourced from countries like the US and Qatar. The first flickers of real trouble are already evident – well ahead of the winter heating boom. The British consulting firm, Cornwall Insights, is warning of possible planned blackouts and empty shelves in Britain. Average household energy costs in the UK have reached £4,000 ($4,860) per year and are estimated to go even higher. The Bank of England is warning of a recession amid inflation which, in Germany, has just hit the highest level since reunification in 1990. Countries like Spain and Italy are imposing limits on heating and air conditioning in both public and commercial buildings. The EU’s imposition of a 15% energy cut across all member states has just come into effect, providing yet another pretext to reduce services to taxpayers. The mayor of the French town of Cabriès used it as an excuse to close the local swimming pool amid the record summer heat, citing a choice between the cost of feeding school kids increasingly pricy organic food in the cafeteria… or keeping the facility open. And whose fault is all this? It should seem obvious, no? Western officials cut themselves off from their own energy source in order to play geopolitics by pulling Ukraine into their orbit – but the blame is squarely on Russia. That’s what they said and that’s what they’re doubling down on. Britain’s Daily Mail refers in a graphic to Putin cutting the gas supply. “Putin's new gas squeeze condemns Europe to recession and a hard winter of rationing,” according to a CNBC headline. US President Joe Biden has framed it as “Putin’s tax on both food and gas.” Yet these officials did it to themselves – and to their citizens – “for Ukraine.” The problem, however, is that fewer and fewer constituents seem to be buying it. According to a recent Rasmussen poll in the US, just 11% attributed the economic crisis to Putin, while 52% blamed Biden’s own policies. And now, there are signs that a new scapegoat is being prepared. That scapegoat is populists. ""We can assume that populists and extremists will again try to influence protests to their liking,"" German Interior Ministry spokesperson, Britta Beylage-Haarmann, told Deutsche Welle. “Extremist actors and groups in Germany can lead to a growth in dangers if corresponding social crisis conditions allow for it.” It’s a troubling fact that Western officials attempt to conflate average people who oppose their radical policies – including their insistence on harming the energy supply as a matter of pro-Ukraine policy – with “extremists” when it’s their own positions that are growing increasingly radical. There had been a concerted effort in the past by Western officials to discredit any opposition to their plans by framing pushback by the average person as something brewed up in the halls of the Kremlin. And now, as they see chaos on the horizon as a result of their own insistence on pursuing social, economic, and industrial harm as a matter of policy, they’re gearing up to smear the blowback as illegitimate. French officials are not only dismissing but attacking the leader of France’s opposition party in parliament for speaking up about potential blackouts – all because she’s a populist. “Europe is going to face a blackout, notably on the question of Russian gas imports. These sanctions are simply useless. All they do is make Europeans suffer. And that, incidentally, includes French people,” said Marine Le Pen of France’s National Rally party. “You’d need a huge dose of bad faith not to realize that, contrary to the inflated claims of our government, the Russian economy is not on its knees. They are not on the brink of bankruptcy.” The French Energy Transition Minister, Agnes Pannier-Runacher, says that it’s Le Pen's remarks that are ""extraordinarily dangerous"" and ""irresponsible"", framing her legitimate concerns, which the average French can relate with, as something reckless. Populist leaders around the Western world, from Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, have been outspoken against anti-Russian sanctions, which are inherently harmful to the average Western citizen. Just because it’s populist leaders who have the courage to speak out on behalf of citizens doesn’t mean that the concerns can be dismissed or marginalized, because they are the concerns of a large swath of the silent majority. Western establishment officials are desperate to deflect accountability from a pending disaster that’s purely of their own making – either onto Putin or their own citizens."
2022-08-17,https://www.rt.com/news/561004-australia-russia-embassy-lease/,Australia terminates Russian embassy lease,"Australia has terminated the lease for a new Russian embassy in Canberra, the National Capital Authority (NCA) announced on Wednesday. Russia has been given 20 days to vacate the “premium site” in Yarralumla, not far from the Australian parliament, the NCA said in a statement. The Russian embassy in Australia is currently located in the Griffith suburb of the Australian capital, but there were plans to move it to Yarralumla, which hosts the diplomatic compounds of some other countries. “The NCA supports a policy of ‘Use it or lose it,’” Sally Barnes, the head of the agency that oversees planning and development of the capital, said, explaining the termination of the lease. She accused Moscow of showing no willingness to develop the site in Yarralumla, which it was granted back in 2008. According to the NCA, all approvals for the building were issued in 2011, with Russia promising to complete construction of the compound in the three years that followed. “While initial works have commenced, the block in question has been sitting as a building site with unfinished construction for many years now,” Barnes insisted. “Ongoing unfinished works detract from the overall aesthetic, importance and dignity of the area reserved for diplomatic missions and foreign representation in the national capital,” she added. Once the site is cleared, it will be returned to the pool of land available for diplomatic purposes in Canberra, and foreign countries will be able to file requests to use it. “The Russian Federation may submit a new application in the future which the NCA will review and assess accordingly,” the agency said. Tensions between Russia and Australia have spiked since the start of the Ukraine conflict, in which Canberra is supporting Kiev. The Australian authorities have joined international sanctions against Moscow, while providing Ukraine with armored vehicles and other military gear worth $390 million. During his visit Kiev last month, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese claimed his country was “the largest non-NATO contributor” to Kiev. On Thursday, Russia’s Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu slammed the AUKUS pact between the US, UK and Australia aimed at arming Canberra with a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, saying it could “detonate” the whole Asia-Pacific region. “The implementation of this plan will have a profound negative effect on global and regional security and create an environment for the undermining of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,” Shoigu warned."
2022-08-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/560994-ukraine-destruction-crimean-bridge/,Zelensky aide threatens Europe's longest bridge,"Russia's Crimean Bridge, the largest structure of its kind in Europe, “should be destroyed,” an aide to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has warned. “It’s an illegal construction and the main gateway to supply the Russian army in Crimea,” Mikhail Podolyak told the Guardian on Tuesday, explaining why Kiev wants to attack it. The bridge was constructed after Crimea broke away from Ukraine following an armed coup in Kiev in 2014 and voted in a referendum to join Russia. It forms a direct road and rail connection with the region, which previously could only be reached from the rest of Russia by sea or air. The bridge is predominantly used by civilian traffic. Podolyak is the latest Ukrainian official to confirm Kiev’s intention to attack the structure. The remark came as he appeared to hint that Ukraine was in the process of delivering a series of acts of sabotage in Crimea. Since last week, two separate locations on the peninsula have been rocked by powerful explosions at military sites used to store ammunition. The Russian defense ministry acknowledged the latest, which happened on Tuesday near the village of Mayskoye in northern Crimea, as an act of sabotage. Kiev has not formally claimed credit for the incidents, but many Ukrainian officials hinted that this was the case, with Podolyak following the pattern in his interview with the British newspaper. “I certainly agree with the Russian ministry for defense, which is predicting more incidents of this kind in the next two, three months. I think we might see more of those happening,” he noted. The Ukrainian presidential aide called the purported clandestine attacks a “counteroffensive” different in nature from the type of military action usually described by this term. “A Ukrainian counteroffensive looks very different [from a Russian one]. We don’t use the tactics of the 60s and 70s, of the last century,” he claimed. The Guardian suggested that Podolyak may have tacitly admitted Ukraine’s failure to amass troops and weapons for an actual pushback against Russian troops on the battlefield. Top Ukrainian officials have for weeks promised a push to recapture the city of Kherson would begin soon, with some even claiming the operation was already underway. Podolyak told the BBC last week that “all public statements” by Ukrainian officials were “psychological warfare” aimed at demoralizing the Russian army."
2022-08-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/560985-zaporozhye-nuclear-plant-fake-news/,Moscow rejects nuclear power theft claims,"Claims by Ukrainian officials and a former US embassy employee about Moscow bombing the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant in order to “steal” Ukraine’s electricity – published by the Wall Street Journal – make no sense, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. Recent artillery attacks on the Zaporozhye NPP, which Moscow controls, are a “deliberate step in Russia’s wider goal: stealing [Zaporozhye’s] power by severing its connection to Ukraine’s remaining territory,” the WSJ claimed on Sunday, citing “Ukrainian leaders, international nuclear-power experts and the plant’s staff.” Those quoted on the record include Mikhail Podolyak, adviser to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, and former “energy chief at the US embassy” in Kiev, Suriya Jayanti. The Journal also claims to have spoken with “plant workers, family members and colleagues who fled to safety” – meaning, Ukrainian-held territory. Jayanti claimed that Russia wants to disconnect the ZNPP from Ukraine’s electrical grid in order to destabilize global energy markets but also leave Kiev dependent on the EU, where electricity prices are skyrocketing – while omitting to mention that this is largely due to anti-Russian sanctions. The report is “a complete demolition of the connection between cause and effect,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday, dubbing the WSJ claims “the latest spin of the wheel of disinformation.” Ukraine has repeatedly targeted the nuclear power plant with artillery, rockets and even kamikaze drones, the ministry noted, adding that Russia has presented evidence of this to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the UN Security Council, among others. Ukrainian forces were also accused of bombing the Kakhovskaya hydroelectic power station – also under Russian control – which supplies the ZNPP with cooling water. On Tuesday, local administration member Vladimir Rogov told Russian TV that the latest Ukrainian attack came close to breaking a container storing spent nuclear fuel. A strike on the structure would amount to a “dirty bomb,” Rogov said. A release from 20-30 containers would create a radiation plume that could spread as far west as the Czech Republic and as far south as Turkey, affecting Poland and the Baltic States as well, former Soviet nuclear inspector Vladimir Kuznetsov told RT on Tuesday. “The conclusion suggests itself: by destroying the energy infrastructure, the Kiev regime is exposing the many millions of people on the European continent to the danger of a nuclear cataclysm, with the connivance of Washington,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said, noting that the WSJ, located across the ocean, clearly doesn’t seem to care."
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560972-erdogan-guterres-zelensky-lviv/,"Erdogan, Guterres and Zelensky to meet in Ukraine","Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres will meet with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Thursday. Discussions will likely include grain shipments from Ukraine and the endangered Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric announced the meeting on Tuesday, saying that Guterres was invited to Lviv by Zelensky. Guterres will also visit Odessa, a port city where grain shipments across the Black Sea recently restarted after Russia and Ukraine struck a deal with Turkey and the UN to ensure their safe passage. The three-way meeting will focus on maintaining cooperation on these shipments, and “ending the Ukraine-Russia war through diplomatic avenues,” Erdogan’s office said in a statement. After leaving Ukraine, Guterrez will visit the Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul, from where the shipments are being monitored by Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and UN officials. In addition to the trilateral meeting, Dujarric and Zelensky will hold a one-on-one meeting to discuss the situation at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. Moscow and Kiev have both accused each other of shelling the plant, although the facility has been under Russian control since the initial days of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine. Erdogan will also meet alone with Zelensky, with his office saying that the two leaders will discuss “all aspects of Turkey-Ukraine relations.” Although Turkey is a member of the NATO alliance, it has not sanctioned Russia over the conflict in Ukraine. Erdogan – who describes his position on the conflict as “balanced” – recently returned from a visit to Russia, where he and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to strengthen their trade and energy links and step up cooperation in the fight against terrorism. Back in March, Erdogan hosted peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, although this ultimately failed to stop the fighting."
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560971-ukraine-bombs-waste-containers-zaporozhye/,Ukraine bombs nuclear waste storage site – official,"The Ukrainian military has fired multiple rockets directly at coolant systems and nuclear waste storage site inside the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant in Energodar, local government administration member Vladimir Rogov told Russian media on Tuesday. He warned that a successful strike may result in a radiation release equivalent to a “dirty bomb.” “One of the guided missiles hit just ten meters” from the barrels with spent nuclear fuel,” Rogov told Soloviev Live. “Others hit a bit farther away, 50 to 200 meters.” Since the storage site is out in the open, any hit will result in the release of nuclear waste ranging from dozens to hundreds of kilograms and contamination of the area, the official explained. “In plain language, that would be like a dirty bomb,” said Rogov. While the reactor itself can only be destroyed with a tactical nuclear weapon, the coolant systems and waste storage are far more vulnerable and damage to them could easily cause a disaster, the official said. Ukrainian troops have already fired “several dozen” heavy projectiles at the cooling systems, Rogov added. If they succeed in disabling such a system, it could produce a meltdown bigger than the 1986 catastrophe at Chernobyl. Russian troops established control of the Zaporozhye NPP, Europe’s largest facility of the kind, early on in the course of military operations in Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine have been accusing each other of shelling the facility, warning that combat in the area could trigger a nuclear disaster. Russia accused Ukraine of launching artillery and drone strikes on the facility, denouncing the operations as “nuclear terrorism.” Ukrainian troops claimed that the Russians were shelling themselves to discredit Kiev. Russian requests to the UN and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect the site firsthand have been met with excuses that inspectors can only access the station via Kiev, and Ukraine can’t guarantee their safe passage. On Monday, Rogov accused the UN of blocking the IAEA visit because it was covering for Kiev. If the inspectors actually showed up, he said, they would be forced to conclude that Ukraine and not Russia was shelling the power plant. “It is obvious, it’s all been documented, and not only that, it’s also well known who is being supplied with American guided missiles. Obviously, not Russia, but the Zelensky regime,” he said."
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560957-ukraine-schools-russian-courses/,Ukraine issues new ban on Russian language,"Russian language and literature courses will no longer be taught in Ukraine, according to an updated curriculum posted by the Ministry of Education on its website on Tuesday. Among the courses excluded were ‘Russian and Foreign Literature’, ‘Russian language for general educational institutions with instruction in Russian’ for grades 5-9, and instruction in Ukrainian or Russian for grades 10-11. While nearly all Russian and Belarusian books will be dropped from the school program, the ministry notes that it will allow some works by authors who wrote in Russian but whose “life and work were closely connected with Ukraine,” such as Nikolay Gogol and Mikhail Bulgakov. According to the updated curriculum, foreign literature courses in Ukrainian schools will now focus on works by writers such as Jean de La Fontaine, O. Henry, Anna Gavalda, and Joseph Roth. The ministry also announced that it will be updating history courses in Ukrainian schools “to take into account new historiographic developments.” Specifically, it will update courses on Ukrainian and world history for grades 6 to 11 to include the ongoing military conflict between Kiev and Moscow. Last month, Ukrainian officials introduced a new stage of the law on ‘Ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as a state language’, which introduces fines for speaking Russian. The law applies to workers in institutions such as government agencies, education, science, and media. “Citizens of the country must use the Ukrainian language in all aspects of social life,” the commissioner for the protection of the state language, Taras Kremen, explained, calling on people to report offenders to local law enforcement. Russian is a native language in much of Ukraine and predominant in many cities in both the east and south of the country. However, Kiev has been taking steps to outlaw its use in most fields. Moscow has expressed concern for years over the clampdown on Russian. Last September, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that “discrimination against the Russian language in Ukraine has reached the scale of a disaster.”"
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560948-russian-military-uninterceptable-intercontinental-missile/,Russian military signs contract for ‘uninterceptable’ missiles,"The Russian military will receive state-of-the-art Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles, which, according to the manufacturer, can pierce through any existing air defense. The signing of a state contract “for the production and supply of the Sarmat strategic missile system” was announced on Tuesday during the Army 2022 forum, which is taking place in Moscow Region. The deal was signed by Russian Deputy Defense Minister Aleksey Krivoruchko and the general manager of the country’s Makeev Missile Center, Vladimir Degtyar, RIA Novosti reported. Speaking on Russian TV in May, Degtyar claimed that “it is impossible to intercept” the Sarmat missile thanks to its “incredibly complex” design, which allows it to “overcome any multi-layered missile defense.” The commander of Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces, Sergey Karakaev, said at the time that the new rocket can travel along unusual trajectories, including via the South Pole. He added that the Sarmat is the “largest military rocket in human history,” boasting a diameter of three meters and a height equal to that of a 14-story apartment block. The missile is said to weigh over 200 tons. The signing of another contract was also made public on Tuesday, in which the Russian Army will obtain the S-500 Prometheus air defense system – the latest iteration of the famed S-300 and S-400 missiles. With a range of 600km, its specialty is the interception of incoming missiles at high altitudes. The S-500 entered production by April, according to Yan Novikov, the general manager of state-owned defense company Almaz-Antey."
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560947-shoigu-aukus-detonates-region/,AUKUS deal could ‘detonate’ Asia-Pacific – Russia,"The AUKUS security pact between the US, Britain and Australia could “detonate” the Asia-Pacific region by introducing nuclear military drills, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has warned. “The AUKUS union has the potential of becoming a military-political alliance. It can’t be ruled out that NATO’s joint nuclear planning and joint nuclear exercises would be brought to the region,” Shoigu said on Tuesday. “The bringing of the practice of conducting nuclear exercises from Europe would detonate the region. Although, one can assume that this is the precise goal of the US.” The pact allows for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines with the help of the US and Britain. “The implementation of this plan will have a profound negative effect on global and regional security and create an environment for the undermining of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,” Shoigu said. Australia’s opposition leader and former defense minister, Peter Dutton, urged the government last week to acquire the submarines as soon as possible in the wake of renewed tensions between China and the US over Taiwan. Established last year, AUKUS was promoted as an agreement to deepen defense ties between three English-speaking nations and enhance interoperability. In April, AUKUS leaders released a statement, affirming “their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that Washington is not seeking to set up “an Asian NATO.”"
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560940-jewish-death-curse-putin/,Putin fears Jewish death curse – ex-Ukrainian official,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely afraid to attack the city of Dnepr due to a threat that he will be cursed to death through an ancient Jewish ritual, a former Ukrainian official claims. In an interview on Friday with the news website Novoye Vremya, Gennady Korban said he had threatened to place the curse on the Russian leader if he attacks the city. “Pulsa diNura is a complicated, difficult procedure,” he said, adding that his threat in July to curse Putin “may have contributed in some way in the sense that so far they have not struck Dnepr.” “I knock on wood not to jinx it, God forbid, but this is how it is,” he said. Pulsa diNura, roughly translated from Aramaic as ‘lashes of fire’, is a ritual that is attributed to an old Kabbalistic text, though scholars believe the term was not used in the sense of a curse invoked by man. It became a political tool among some religious Jews in the early 20th century. The ceremony is intended to compel ‘angels of destruction’ to not forgive the subject’s sins, ultimately killing him or her. Urban legend claims that Pulsa diNura was successfully used against Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by an Israeli right-wing extremist in 1995. Korban threatened to invoke the mystical threat against the Russian leader in July after a Russian missile strike hit Yuzhmash, a Soviet-built military plant in Dnepr. There was some debate in Ukrainian media whether a non-Jewish person would be a ‘valid’ target for the curse. In the interview, Korban suggested that Putin must be a superstitious man because “dictators” like Hitler and Stalin “very often believe” in such mystical things. He added that he has not actually had the ritual performed yet. “Pulsa diNura is not a procedure that you can start on a whim. Under the procedure, you have to inform the enemy or a person you want to subject to it,” he said. “I have warned Putin. Let him think and make conclusions now.” Korban entered the media spotlight this month after Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky revoked his citizenship while he was traveling to another country. Consequently, he was barred from returning to Ukraine. A number of public figures have urged Zelensky to reverse the decision. Kiev Mayor Vitaly Klitschko claimed this week that somebody in the government threatened him for publicly supporting Korban. Despite his forced absence, Korban told Novoye Vremya that he continues to perform his duty as head of staff of Dnepr’s territorial defense. The mayor, Boris Filatov, is a long-time ally of Korban and leads the campaign to reinstate his citizenship."
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560941-afghanistan-helicopters-jets-ukraine/,Moscow warns about abandoned US military aircraft,"Military aircraft flown out of Afghanistan by fleeing US-backed troops after the Taliban retook the country last year could now slip into Ukraine, Zamir Kabulov, Russia’s presidential envoy to Afghanistan, has warned. Russian news agency RIA Novosti asked Kabulov on Tuesday to comment on the fate of the Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters that the US originally purchased for the Afghan Armed Forces in the 2010s but ended up delivering to Ukraine in the spring in order to fight Russia. Kabulov did not rule out similar incidents in the future. “There can’t be any guarantees with the US because it is not capable of negotiating,” he said. “It’s important for us that helicopters and planes that were flown to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan by the fleeing Afghan commanders and servicemen do not reach Ukraine,” the Russian diplomat said. He added that around 60 aircraft were moved from Afghanistan to Tajikistan and around 40-50 to Uzbekistan after the Taliban seized power. Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February. RIA Novosti cited a diplomatic source in May as saying that Turkey was recruiting Afghan nationals in Iran in order to send them to fight against Russian forces in Ukraine. Kabulov said that the Taliban had provided assurances that they would not allow fighters from the country to travel to Ukraine. However, some former Afghan commandos have joined Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) and are fighting in Iraq and Syria, he said. “Another part of these former commandos are joining Ukrainian Nazis as mercenaries. They were apparently offered money because they need to live off of something,” Kabulov said. The envoy's comments came after Reuters cited an unreleased report by the Republicans on the US House Foreign Affairs Committee that warned that former Afghan security personnel are susceptible to recruitment by Russia, China and Iran."
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560938-ukrainian-saboteurs-targeted-nuclear-facility-russia/,Ukraine targeted operation of Russian nuclear site – Moscow,"Russia’s Federal Security Service said on Tuesday that a series of explosions earlier this month at high-voltage power lines used by the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant were carried out by Ukrainian saboteurs. The plant is located in Kursk Region, which borders eastern Ukraine. The blasts, which occurred on August 4, 9, and 12, “led to a disruption of the technological process of the nuclear power plant’s functioning,” the FSB said. Six transmission towers were targeted overall. These towers transmit power from the plant to crucial infrastructure, such as industrial sites and transportation systems. The FSB added that a terrorism investigation has been launched and that a search for the culprits is underway. Security at nuclear sites in Russia has been boosted. Earlier on Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry said that Ukrainian agents blew up a military storage facility near the town of Dzhankoy in Crimea. It added that power lines, a railway, and several homes were also damaged. International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi voiced concern last week over the “very alarming” situation around the Zaporozhye nuclear plant in southern Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine have been accusing each other of shelling the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, warning that combat in the area could trigger a nuclear disaster. The plant continues to operate with Ukrainian personnel under Russian control."
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560934-ukrainian-men-travel-restrictions/,Zelensky reveals when men will be allowed to leave Ukraine,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has announced that men without military experience will be banned from leaving the country as long as martial law is in effect. The statement was posted on the president’s website on Monday in response to a petition urging that men between the ages 18 and 60 be allowed to travel abroad. The petition, which was signed by over 27,000 people, says many Ukrainian men are unfit for military service but could be useful in other fields. The author argued that if these people were allowed to work abroad, they could help refugees and send back money to aid the military, which, the text says, already has enough capable people. “Fighting should be fought by able-bodied people. We have many IT, social, creative, technical, and other specialists who can fight on the information front and be more useful working abroad, helping our refugees and supporting the army with earned funds,” the petition reads. The author claimed that Kiev’s travel restrictions aimed at certain categories of citizens resemble “Soviet practices, which [Ukraine] is gradually getting rid of,” and offered the example of Estonia, which only prohibits travel to those who are the subjects of criminal proceedings. “Therefore, we ask the president of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky, to allow men aged 18-60 who do not have military experience and are of limited fitness to travel abroad,” the petition concludes. According to Ukrainian law, if an online petition receives more than 25,000 signatures, the president must issue a response. Zelensky replied by pointing to Article 64 of the constitution, which states that freedom of movement may be limited for Ukrainian citizens in the event of an emergency or the introduction of martial law. The president explained that according to the constitution, during a period of “martial law, the constitutional rights and freedoms of a person and a citizen… may be limited.” He went on to note that “the abolition of these restrictions is expected to be carried out after the end of the legal regime of martial law.” Ukraine’s Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, approved Zelensky’s decree introducing martial law in the country on February 24, 2022, after Moscow launched its military operation against Kiev. The Rada has since extended the period of martial law several times, most recently prolonging it for an additional 90 days, until November 21."

Describing its response, the ministry said it was “taking necessary measures to eliminate the consequences of the sabotage.” The explosions caused damage “to a number of civilian objects, including power lines, a power station, a railroad and several residential houses,” the statement said. The site hit by the apparent attack is located near the village of Mayskoye in the Dzhankoy area of the Russian region. The military used it as a temporary ammo depot, it said earlier. The ammunition detonated due to a fire. Sergey Aksyonov, the head of the Republic of Crimea, announced a region-wide state of emergency on Tuesday due to the incident. Officials in Crimea said two civilians were injured in Mayskoye. The lives of both victims are not in danger, the reports said. Train traffic was also disrupted in Crimea due to damage of the railway. The region’s government said it will deploy additional buses to transport passengers. Another fire at an ammo depot happened last week at a military airfield near the resort town of Novofedorovka. The incident left one person dead and 14 others injured. The Defense Ministry did not report any findings of foul play behind it."
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560738-wild-east-inside-russian-chinese/,The Wild East: Inside the Russian-Chinese gold-rush 'California' where women were banned and fortunes were quickly made and lost,"Hardened criminals, valiant adventurers, thrill seekers, and thousands of gold prospectors from all over the world flocking to a new virgin territory, where a young republic of free people is being born amid the glow of gold mines. No, this is not a reference to the American Wild West – what we’re talking about happened on the other side of the Pacific, on Chinese land beyond the Amur River, where a Russian Klondike blossomed in the 19th century. Local residents mined minerals, snubbed governments, and had their own flag, leaders, and laws. They called their new homeland the 'Zheltuga Republic.' The Russians made it to the Amur as early as the 17th century. Eventually, their dramatic clashes with local tribes and politicians that paid tribute to China led to the drawing of a border between the Russian and the Manchu states. In the 19th century, this frontier followed the Amur River. But neither St. Petersburg nor Beijing could effectively control the vast and sparsely populated areas on the outskirts of their empires. In the spring of 1883, a member of the indigenous Evenk people, who lived on the southern, ‘Chinese’ bank of the Amur, was going about the sad but rather prosaic business of burying his mother. As he was digging her grave, he found several gold nuggets. He realized there was some money to be made, so he went to the border village of Ignashino on the Russian side of the Amur. This tiny village still exists today, although it has less than 200 residents. With Blagoveshchensk (216,000 people) roughly 500 kilometers to the southeast and Nerchinsk (population 15,000) about the same distance to the southwest, there is still nothing that could be called a big city close by. The locals knew that Evenk man, who would sometimes come to the village to sell hides. He found a merchant called Seredkin and, in exchange for a payment, told him where the gold could be found. Seredkin sent a mining engineer to the south bank of the Amur and he found a rich goldfield close to the Mohe river, which the Russians called the ‘Zheltuga’. The first teams of prospectors were soon to follow. In the winter of 1884, a rumor swept through Siberian towns about untold riches to be found on the Zheltuga. As it usually happens, imagination was conjuring up images of a new Eldorado. A good reflection of everyone’s sentiment was a phrase coined back then: “You peel off moss and pick up gold.” People from as far as Nerchinsk, Chita, Irkutsk, Blagoveshchensk, and even Sakhalin volunteered to travel to the Zheltuga, not to mention residents of villages along the Argun and the Amur. Naturally, prospectors were followed by merchants and then by all sorts of robbers and con men. In early 1883, a mere 120 people lived on the Zheltuga; a year later, that number went up to 7,000 and it peaked between 10,000 and 15,000. Admittedly, all of these figures are approximate and different estimates have been made. The fact remains, however, that the Zheltuga valley rapidly became very populous, with the Russians far outnumbering the Chinese, who were also drawn to the area by rumors of gold. Although the gold rush was felt even by some government officials and intellectuals, it stands to reason that most of those flocking to the Zheltuga were no church choir boys. At best, they were ordinary workers and peasants who gave up their primary occupations, at worst – escaped convicts and deserters. A correspondent from the Peterburgskie Vedomosti described them as “desperate villains.” There were some remarkable characters among them, like a guy who managed to escape from prison on Sakhalin, cross the sea, and walk 1,500 kilometers to get to the goldfields. Apart from Russians and Chinese, the Zheltuga valley saw the arrival of Americans, Jews, Germans, Frenchmen, Poles, and members of all kinds of Siberian peoples. You could run into anyone here, from a branded highwayman to an impoverished aristocrat. That ragtag community mainly relied on the Russian language and sometimes used Chinese or the Kyakhta Russian-Chinese pidgin. Most of those people were actually prospectors, or ‘predators’, as they were called then. Around 100-150 newcomers would arrive in Zheltuga every day. Community life centered around California, which is what they called the rapidly growing mining village, whose main street was known as Million Street. Its name was, however, more impressive than its architecture. People lived in simple and practical log cabins chinked with moss under flat timber roofs covered with dirt. Local carpenters built a whole lot of huts like that, which ordinarily had an area of 72 square meters and a ceiling height of just 2 meters. There was a wood stove in the middle without a chimney and bunk beds lined up against the walls. The gold-seekers’ diet consisted mostly of rice and other grains, game, fish, and berries. The dwellings were very primitive but they were only used as sleeping quarters. Chinese prospectors’ houses stood apart from the rest, and they conducted their mining activities on their own. There was a large square in the middle of California, called Orlovo Pole (Eagle Field), used for town meetings. It was the location of the mining administration and had a rostrum, a bell, and even a black and yellow flag. The black color symbolized earth, while yellow stood for gold. Beyond California, mining pits stretched along the Zheltuga for about 15 kilometers. Some belonged to teams, others to individual prospectors. In Zheltuga’s heyday, there were over 700 teams and countless individual gold-seekers. Some of them made money and went back home spreading the word about the gold country, but others rushed in to take their place. After the topsoil was removed, miners worked through the gold-bearing layer and continued prospecting in underground galleries. Exploration was usually abandoned when you reached your neighbors’ galleries. Gold mining was mainly carried out in winter when the pits were not flooded. Gold digging was equally lucrative for those who served the miners. Stores, mostly selling food and tools, bathhouses, gambling houses, and taverns were booming as they charged locals for a pickaxe or a piece of dry bread several times as much as in Blagoveshchensk. California could boast 18 hotels and inns, 22 taverns, a photo lab, a zoo with a female tiger, a musical theater, two orchestras, two jewelry shops, a choir, seven bathhouses, a hospital, and a pharmacy. Pure gold was used as a means of exchange due to a shortage of banknotes and coins. Chita, the local casino, which some wisecrackers called Monte Carlo, was California’s epitome of grandeur. It had several halls dedicated to specific games, from roulette to dice and faro. The casino had its own orchestra and a café. In reality, the owners of such establishments were the ones who were breaking the bank, while many prospectors simply gambled and drank away their fortunes. Gold dealers were another group of local big shots. One of them was executed for fraud. After he circulated a fake wire about the imminent arrival of a Cossack squad, he was able to buy a lot of gold on the cheap and ruined many prospectors. The perpetrator was flogged to death. One thing they didn’t have, by the way, was brothels. The Zheltuga Republic had a rule against inviting women. The miners, mostly no gentlefolk themselves, were afraid that the presence of the fair sex would result in a spike of incidents, brawls, and murders. Out of similar concerns, the selling of liquor was prohibited in the places where actual mining took place. So-called 'alcohol carriers' tried to circumvent this ban though, much to the joy of workers, who were suffering from freezing cold. Zheltuga had important implications for the economy of the whole region. It’s hard to grow wheat in the Far East under normal circumstances, and field workers started leaving in droves to go looking for gold. As a result, the prices of food and other consumer goods in Chita, Nerchinsk, and Irkutsk skyrocketed. The local authorities’ attempts to stem migration were ineffective. It was all completely illegal. Moreover, Russian prospectors were technically on Chinese territory, so they worked without a break trying to get as much done as possible before the two governments took notice. The Chinese, however, were happy to turn a blind eye for a while because locally-mined gold was mostly sold to Chinese dealers. Zheltuga started out as a pure anarchy. Soon enough, however, the 'Californians' thought they needed an administration of some kind. At one point, the cook of one of the teams was killed with a hammer because the murderers wanted to get their hands on his gold stash. The Zheltuga community swiftly responded by electing a leader who would be responsible for law and order. The residents took an oath where they pledged to follow Christian principles and civil laws. Here’s the text of this oath: “We, the teams and owners of free enterprises in Amur, California, remembering the words bestowed upon us by our great teacher the Son of God and Our Lord, ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself’ and following this Christian teaching contained in the Holy Gospel, which leads us to peace and welfare in this worldly life and salvation and eternity in the kingdom of heaven, do undertake, with the help of the Almighty, to labor relentlessly for the benefit of our neighbors in order to show the departed the true path and, by doing so, to banish ungodly deeds which are committed by many from our midst who are wandering in the darkness of sin and have forgotten the commandments ‘Thou shalt not kill’ and ‘Thou shalt not steal’. Sending our heartfelt prayers to Our Lord so that He may not abandon us, weak as we are, on the hard path that is set for us, we place our unmitigated trust and deliver ourselves into the hands of our elected officials not as power-coveting superiors but as the worthiest people among us who remember the word of God teaching us truth and justice, which we have confirmed with our signatures and, in our thoughts, with this oath.” All the mines were divided into five districts, each of which elected two foremen resulting in a ‘parliament’ of sorts, which consisted of two Chinese men and eight Russians. Curiously, there are still questions about the identity of the first elected ‘president’ (yes, this is the word they used) of the Zheltuga Republic. Historians generally agree that he was a foreigner, but his exact origin remains a mystery. It is traditionally said that the first president of the Zheltuga Republic was Karl Ivanovich Fasse, who most researchers believe to be an Italian. Other sources claim he was an Austro-Hungarian subject born in Slovakia. According to one version, Fasse, whoever he was, came to the Amur not straight from his home country but from the ‘original’ California in the US. Another version maintains that he graduated from a law school in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and worked as a government official in Vladivostok before showing up in Zheltuga. In any case, he appears to have been an educated man, and speculations about his legal and bureaucratic background are not unfounded. A popular story about how the Zheltuga Republic was run by the so-called Cornet Savin, a famous con man, seems to be a hoax that goes against the facts. The president and foremen were paid for their work. In addition, everyone chipped in to pay for a free 'republican' hospital, a treasurer, and the fire and police services. The foremen were also the court of first instance, while more serious cases could be appealed before the president. The republic’s legislation was quite unsophisticated and mostly dealt with four areas: taxes and payments for the common good, the procedure for staking and using claims, the organization of trade and other activities, and criminal law. The latter was simple and easy to grasp. Minor crimes, such as stealing, sodomy, bringing women to the mines, disturbing the peace while being drunk, cheating at card games, etc., were punished by a certain, but always considerable, number of blows with a rod or a cane. Those guilty of murder or other serious crimes were hanged. Smaller offenses like breaking work rules that didn’t lead to grave consequences were punishable by a fine. The measures proved to be effective in maintaining order. The tax on retailers was 10% of the price of goods, and this figure went up to 25% for sellers of liquor. Establishment owners paid 20% of their monthly revenue in taxes. That idyllic situation was short-lived. In 1884, China demanded that Baron Korf, the governor general of Amur, take steps to bring Russians back to the north bank of the Amur. Russian officials shrugged and said they were powerless because they were not authorized to operate on Chinese soil. The debate around what to do with Zheltuga and whose responsibility it was lasted for years. The checkpoints put up by Russian authorities along the border didn’t really do much. One has to assume that the officials in charge liked gold no less than everyone else. The Chinese governor was essentially told by his Russian counterpart to do whatever he pleased – on his own. His predicament was that California was separated from the closest Chinese settlements by 500 kilometers of taiga. Even getting through that forest to the colony of thousands of people was a huge problem, let alone dispersing the prospectors. In August 1885, a Chinese official came to Zheltuga to tell gold-seekers to leave within a week. That sounded serious, so many decided not to play with fire and go back to Russia. Many others, however, relocated to the nearest Russian villages of Ignashino and Amazar to see if they could wait this out. Some even remained in California. On September 6, 1885, 700 Chinese soldiers showed up to the Russian colony. They burned houses and killed several people, but when they left thinking their mission was accomplished, Zheltuga prospectors came back, rebuilt California, and went on with their work as if nothing had happened. A new squad was dispatched to punish intruders two months later, in November 1885. This time, the Qing sent 1,600 troops. Californians were divided about what to do, with some arguing for a final stand and some deciding to go back home. Russian prospectors were leaving in parties of up to 100 people. The Chinese squad severely punished Chinese miners while mostly refraining from violence against Russians. Those few who dared return were intercepted by the Chinese and got a beating with bamboo rods. Prospectors tried digging along the whole of the Amur’s Russian side as well, but they couldn’t compete with big Russian gold mining companies supported by soldiers and Cossacks. Still, 'predatory' gold mining continued until the 1930s, when Soviet authorities finally suppressed illegal exploration. The Zheltuga Republic only existed for two years, but it left an interesting legacy in Russian memory. It was a moment when a group of rough but enterprising people, acting very quickly, managed to turn a gang of outcasts into a functioning, self-governing civil society united by a sense of common purpose, which made officials in St. Petersburg and Beijing take notice. This commune became not just a symbol of enrichment but a symbol of freedom as well."
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560924-russia-us-conflict-nuclear/,Russia warns of ‘direct military clash’ with US,"Washington’s behavior on the world stage risks direct conflict between the nuclear states, the Russian embassy in the US has warned. “Today, the United States continues to act with no regard to other countries’ security and interests, which contributes to an increase in nuclear risks,” the embassy said in a statement on its Telegram channel. “The [US’] steps to further engage in a hybrid confrontation with Russia in the context of the Ukrainian crisis are fraught with unpredictable escalation and a direct military clash of nuclear powers.” The embassy noted that Washington has recently withdrawn from two key arms control agreements, the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which banned certain classes of land-based missiles, and the 1992 Treaty on Open Skies, which allowed for surveillance flights over each other’s territories. The embassy urged the US to “take a closer look at its own nuclear policy instead of making unfounded accusations against the countries whose worldviews do not coincide with the American ones.” “Our country faithfully fulfills its obligations as a nuclear-weapon state and makes every effort to reduce nuclear risks,” the diplomats said. The statement comes after the US accused Moscow of using the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine as cover for its soldiers. The plant, the largest in Europe, was seized by Russian troops during the early stages of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, which was launched in late February. It continues to operate with Ukrainian personnel under Russian control. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Russia’s action at the facility “the height of irresponsibility.” Russia and Ukraine, meanwhile, have been accusing each other of shelling the plant. According to Moscow, artillery fire by Ukrainians forces caused several fires and partial power outages this month. Russia initiated a UN Security Council meeting last week regarding the situation around the Zaporozhye power plant. Russian envoy Vassily Nebenzia said that Moscow supports the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect the facility as quickly as possible."
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560922-western-superweapons-myth-dispelled/,Western ‘superweapons’ myth dispelled – Shoigu,"Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine has served to dispel the myth of Western ‘superweapons’, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said during an international security conference on Tuesday. Speaking at the forum, part of the ongoing Army 2022 expo near Moscow, Shoigu claimed that the weapons provided to Kiev have not had a significant effect on the battlefield, as has been claimed by the West. “Initially, it was about the supply of Javelin anti-tank systems and some unique drones. More recently, HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems and long-range howitzers were being promoted to the role of superweapons by Westerners. However, all of these weapons are being ground up in battle,” the minister said. Shoigu added that Russian forces are “carefully examining” the Western weapon systems seized on the battlefield in Ukraine, and are “taking into account the features and specific qualities” of these weapons when planning combat operations.The minister’s statement comes after US Defense Secretary LLoyd Austin announced last week that the weapons sent to Kiev by Washington have proven themselves effective on the battlefield and pledged to send more arms to Ukraine for “as long as it takes.” The US has approved more than $54 billion of economic and military aid to Ukraine since February, while the UK has committed nearly $3 billion in military aid alone, and the EU has spent another $2.5 billion on arms for Kiev. A large range of equipment, from rifles and grenades to anti-tank missiles and multiple launch rocket systems, has left Western armories for Ukraine, with most entering the country through Poland. Moscow, meanwhile, has repeatedly warned the West against sending weapons to Kiev, saying it only prolongs the conflict and increases the number of casualties."
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560920-russia-ukraine-nuclear-weapons/,No need for nuclear weapons in Ukraine – Moscow,"There are no targets in Ukraine that warrant a Russian nuclear strike, so claims that Russia could use nuclear weapons in its ongoing military operation are absurd, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has insisted. He was speaking during a security conference in Moscow on Tuesday. “The use [of nuclear weapons] is restricted to emergencies only, as outlined in Russian guidelines that are publicly available,” he added, noting that the weapons are meant as a deterrence against foreign aggression. Shoigu said that “claims of possible use of chemical weapons in Ukraine are absurd too,” since Russia destroyed its stockpile in an effort that was completed in 2017. False accusations of such attacks have been used by Western-backed groups in Syria in the past, he added. The Russian minister, who was speaking during the opening of the Moscow Conference for International Security, said the situation with strategic weapons reduction and control was at a difficult spot due to the ongoing confrontation between the US and Russia. “American statements that claim that Russia has to earn the right to continue dialogue with the US are beyond the pale. Weapons control is a two-way street,” he stressed. The Russian official said Washington was an unreliable partner when it came to the balance of strategic power. The US scrapped several key treaties with Russia over the years, which Moscow says seriously hurt transparency in military affairs. “I suppose the Russian experience engaging the West in the area of disarmament demonstrates that the so-called ‘rules-based order’ they promote does not provide for fulfilling treaty obligations,” Shoigu said. The lessons learned from it will direct Russia’s future international agreements on security and arms control, he said. In particular, there is a “difficult situation with” the NEW START treaty, which limits the number of nuclear weapons, the minister noted. The document needs to be renewed before 2026 to remain in force. Shoigu assessed that the security situation in Europe was worse at the moment than during the Cold War, blaming NATO for it. “The military activities of the alliance have become fully aggressive and anti-Russian in nature,” he said, citing deployments of American troops and weapons in Eastern Europe. He added that the strengthening of NATO forces began long before Russia attacked Ukraine in February. Commenting on the operation in Ukraine, Shoigu said it has disproven the notion that ‘game-changing’ Western weapon systems can turn the tide on the battlefield. “First, they spoke that way about the Javelin anti-tank missiles and ‘unique’ drones. Later, the pro-West people promoted the HIMARS multiple launch rockets system and long-range howitzers as ‘superweapons,’” he said. These weapons are destroyed just like any others and don’t affect the situation in a significant way, the minister stressed. Meanwhile, the Russian forces study the equipment that is captured on the battlefield to identify ways to counter it, he added."
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560918-putin-ukraine-us-conflict/,Putin accuses US of trying to 'prolong' war in Ukraine,"The US wants the Ukraine conflict to drag on for as long as possible, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. “The situation in Ukraine demonstrates that the US is trying to prolong this conflict,” Putin stated at a security conference in Moscow on Tuesday. Putin reiterated that Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February in order to “ensure the security of Russia and its citizens, and defend the people of Donbass from genocide.” The president said the US has “set the role of cannon fodder for Ukrainians, implemented the ‘anti-Russia’ project [in Ukraine], turned a blind eye to the spread of neo-Nazi ideology, to the mass murder of the people of Donbass,” adding that the US has been “pumping the Kiev regime with weapons, including heavy weapons, and continues to do so.” The US and its allies under NATO have been increasingly supplying Ukraine with weapons, including M142 HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, M777 howitzers, and combat drones. US President Joe Biden said in June that NATO will support for Ukraine “as long as it takes to, in fact, make sure that they are not defeated.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560912-crimea-ammo-depot-blast/,Crimean village evacuated after huge explosions,"Residents of the village of Mayskoye in northeastern Crimea were ordered to evacuate on Tuesday following powerful explosions nearby. The blasts took place at a temporary ammunition depot operated by the Russian military, the Defense Ministry confirmed. The settlement is located in the Dzhankoy region, near Ukraine, and is believed to have around 2,000 residents. This is the second incident of this nature on the Crimean Peninsula since the beginning of the month. Last week, a series of explosions occurred at the Saki military airfield, located in the resort town of Novofedorovka. As a result, 14 people were injured and one died Images on social media purportedly taken at the moment of the incident show a massive ball of fire rising into the air. According to the Defense Ministry, the ammunition exploded due to a fire at the site. It reported no serious injuries in the incident and said its causes were being investigated. The head of the Republic of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, said he was going to Mayskoye to investigate the situation on the ground. The official said that according to preliminary reports, two civilians were injured in the village, adding that their lives are not in danger. Residents are being taken at least 5km away from Mayskoye due to the risks posed by continuing explosions at the military site, Aksyonov said. Later in the day, the region’s head said rail connection between mainland Russia and western Crimea was disrupted by damage done by the incident in Mayskoye. Aksyonov pledged to organize extra buses for travelers."
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/news/560903-foreign-fighters-dpr-death-penalty/,Captured Western mercenaries could be executed – DPR,"Three Western nationals – a Swede, a Croat, and a Briton – could be sentenced to death after being accused of fighting as mercenaries for Ukraine, a court in the Donetsk People’s Republic has warned. On Monday, Russian media reported that the judge informed the three men of the punishment they could face during a hearing in Donetsk. “The court is obliged to clarify that charges against [Matias] Gustavsson, [Vjekoslav] Prebeg, and [John] Harding call for capital punishment,” the judge said. The charges include “undergoing training to seize violently power,” “violent seizure of power,” as well as “the participation of a mercenary in an armed conflict or military action.” The other two foreign fighters, Britons Andrew Hill and Dylan Healy, could reportedly face up to eight years behind bars. According to Russia's TASS news agency, all five pleaded not guilty, with Harding refusing to testify. Gustavsson insisted that he had not participated in fighting. At least some of the men were captured in the city of Mariupol, including at the Azovstal steel plant. The next hearing in their case is expected in early October. In June, a court in Donetsk sentenced to death three foreign men who served in the Ukrainian armed forces and fought for Kiev in the DPR. British citizens Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, as well as Moroccan Saadun Ibrahim, were found guilty of acting as mercenaries and attempting to seize power by force in the DPR. All three have filed appeals."
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560893-former-pentagon-adviser-russian-offensive/,Ukraine failed to mount counteroffensive – ex-Pentagon adviser,"The Ukrainian military has not been able to pull off its promised counteroffensive, and Russian forces are now likely to take over the whole of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, Colonel Douglas Macgregor, a former adviser to the secretary of defense in the Trump administration, has said. Appearing on a livestream hosted by former US judge and columnist Andrew Napolitano last Tuesday, Macgregor dismissed as “utterly nonsensical” reports in some US media outlets that the Russian military has lost some 80,000 personnel in Ukraine so far. According to the decorated Gulf War veteran, “more accurate numbers are probably thirteen to fifteen thousand dead on the Russian side,” with Ukrainian forces having lost “sixty to eighty thousand.” Commenting on these reports in late July, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described the alleged Russian casualty figures as “fake.” He also lamented that even established media outlets are publishing misleading reports these days. The last time Russia’s Defense Ministry provided an update on the number of casualties was in late March, at which time the official death toll had reached 1,351, with 3,825 service members injured. When asked to comment on the current state of affairs on the frontline, the former Pentagon official said that the majority of Russian personnel had been given rest, “refitted, reorganized,” to renew the offensive in August. Macgregor claimed that the first signs of that happening were already evident, “particularly down in the south.” He went on to predict that the Russian military would seize the key port city of Odessa, making Ukraine a “landlocked country.” “Ukrainians have been unable to put together any sort of counteroffensive. So, I don’t see much evidence that the Ukrainians can stop this,” the former Pentagon adviser claimed. Moreover, Macgregor said that the activities of Russian forces south of Kharkov in the east of Ukraine seemed to him like preliminary “shaping operations” meant to pave the way for a major offensive later on. He concluded that “first comes the operation in the south and then subsequently up in Kharkov,” pointing out once more that the Ukrainian army does not appear to be able to stop either one. Macgregor added that he expected these offensives to be over by the “end of August-beginning of September.” Last month, a number of top Ukrainian officials suggested that the country’s military would launch a counteroffensive in the south of the country in August to retake the city of Kherson. However, according to Moscow, it is the Russian military along with the forces of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics that have recently made advances and taken territory. On Saturday, Igor Konashenkov, the spokesperson for Russia’s Defense Ministry announced that the “allied forces completely liberated” the strategic village of Peski in the Donetsk People’s Republic."
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/news/560888-robot-dog-army-2022-expo/,Robot dog wields grenade launcher at Russian army expo (VIDEO),"The Russian company Intellect Machine unveiled the first prototype of the M-81 robotic system during Russia’s Army 2022 expo, which opened on Monday outside of Moscow. The dog-like robot is capable of conducting both military and civilian tasks, according to its creators. A spokesperson for the company told the RIA news agency that the robot can be used for a number of civilian applications, such as working in emergency zones and helping rescuers conduct reconnaissance, finding paths through rubble, or delivering medicine to trapped victims. However, the company representative added that the M-81 can also be adapted for combat situations, as it can conduct precision fire, identify targets, carry out patrols, and transport weapons and ammunition. During a demonstration held during the expo, the M-81 could be seen following a number of commands given by its owner all while carrying and occasionally aiming an unloaded rocket launcher on its back. As for its dog-like appearance and movement, Intellect Machine explained that the M-81 was heavily inspired by the principles of bionics in the animal world, particularly with regards to structures and mechanics. Intellect Machine says that the prototype presented at the Army 2022 expo, which was primarily built using Chinese components and technology, cost nearly 1 million rubles (~$16,000). However, the company says it hopes to launch production of these robots in Russia in the near future. Meanwhile, it’s hard not to notice the similarities between the M-81, the Boston Dynamics Spot, and the Chinese-made Go1. All such robots tend toward a dog-like appearance and are seemingly able to carry out similar tasks. The US Army has already reportedly agreed to provide one Spot robotic dog to help a charity clean up battlefields in Ukraine. HALO Trust, a US-based demining organization, said back in June that it intends to use Spot to remove mines, mortar shells and unexploded munitions from areas near the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, according to executive director Chris Whatley."
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560884-poland-crossings-border-revealed/,Poland reveals number of crossings from Ukraine,"Over 5 million people have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since Russia launched its operation in the neighboring country, the Polish Border Guard reported on Monday. The agency said on Twitter that “since February 24, the border guards have checked 5.519 million people who crossed the border from Ukraine to Poland.” Just last Sunday alone, 24,300 crossings were recorded, the agency added. The number of crossings in the other direction – from Poland into Ukraine – since the start of the conflict is approaching 3.7 million, according to the data. Most of those represent people coming back to areas considered safe, or those who didn't managed to settle abroad, media reports indicate. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) provides slightly smaller but comparable figures of just over 5.2 million crossings from Ukraine into Poland and a little more than 3.2 million crossings from Poland into Ukraine. In March, Warsaw provided Ukrainian nationals with the right to stay legally in the country for 18 months. Nearly 1.3 million Ukrainians have been granted temporary residency status in Poland – more than in any other Western country, the UNHCR statistics show. However, given the large influx of refugees, Poland stopped providing financial aid to most Ukrainians last month. Deputy Interior Minister Pawel Szefernaker explained the move by saying that “many people in Poland are able to become independent and adapt.” Meanwhile, according to a think tank called the Polish Economic Institute, the volume of aid provided by individual Poles to Ukrainian refugees has been decreasing since the first weeks of the military conflict, though it has “remained relatively high.” “The largest decrease concerned the two most popular categories of aid. Right after the start of the war, 51% of Poles bought items for refugees; after two months, this has decreased to 39%. At the beginning, 46% of Poles made cash donations; this then dropped to 33%,” the think tank said in a July report. Nevertheless, in the period between the end of February and the end of June, Poles donated almost 10 billion zlotys ($2 billion) to help Ukrainians. This amount surpasses their charitable contributions for the whole of 2021, according to the report. Earlier in August, the European Commission agreed to provide more than €31 ($31.6) million “to support people fleeing Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and for the economic recovery of four Polish regions” through its REACT-EU program."
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560842-afghanistan-us-year-after/,"The price of defeat: The US fled Afghanistan exactly a year ago, but the real consequences are yet to come","The Americans were preparing to pull their troops out of Afghanistan for months, but the operation still turned out to be a disaster. Footage of young Afghans clinging to Lockheed C-5 Galaxy cargo planes at Kabul Airport went viral all over the world. And although it seems these images have vanished from mainstream discourse, the consequences of those events are yet to come. RT asked experts what President Joe Biden’s first and most important foreign policy decision cost his administration. The Cold War was full of symbols. One of the most striking of these was footage of US military personnel pushing helicopters off the landing deck of the destroyer USS Kirk in the Mekong Gulf in 1975. The helicopters had been operated by pilots taking part in the US military mission in South Vietnam who were removing diplomatic staff from a besieged Saigon, along with their families. They no longer planned to return to the burning capital, so the expensive aircraft were sunk in the South China Sea. While the helicopters on the deck of the Kirk were a striking, albeit isolated, case of such an incident being caught on camera, the multi-day flight of thousands of people fearing the Islamist dictatorship of the Taliban, who were rapidly taking control of Kabul, was shown on all social networks. The situation was exacerbated by a terrorist attack in the now almost forgotten style of the aughts. On August 26, an explosion was heard in an airport terminal building packed with refugees. Approximately 170 civilians and 13 American servicemen were killed. At the same time, the world was innundated by videos of groups of grim men in turbans sitting at tables in the government offices of the presidential palace. Kalashnikov assault rifles from all over the world, as well as American M4s and Swiss SGs, could also be seen in the frame. George W. Bush, who started the Afghan War, promised to quickly end the scarcely comprehensible conflict launched as a response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But this did not work out for him, nor for his successors Barack Obama or Donald Trump. It was clear to both the military and politicians that it was probably impossible to do so without suffering critical losses. Trump came closest to withdrawing troops by concluding an agreement with the Taliban that was criticized in the United States, but his defeat in the presidential election prevented him from finishing the job. As a result, responsibility for the exodus of Americans from Afghanistan fell on Joseph Biden, who had already studied the problem as vice president under Obama and firmly linked his fate with this operation during the election race. Referring to a report by the Watson Institute, a Washington Post article on the troop withdrawal noted that 71,000 civilian Afghans and Pakistanis had died in the war over 20 years. The drone strike that followed the terrorist attack at the airport claimed the lives of ten civilians but was one of the last, if the recent (August 1, 2022) elimination of Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who was recognized as a terrorist, isn’t counted. The agreements with the Taliban and the chaotic evacuation from Kabul were the first significant foreign policy steps of the new Democrat administration after Trump left the White House. And, most likely, they have become a time bomb for the electoral prospects of the current cabinet and the top-tier of the Democratic Party in general. At least, experts interviewed by RT hold this view. “This was an important turning point in American history, the consequences of which will take several decades to see. In a narrower sense, the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan turned out to be the defining point of the entire policy of the Biden administration. It was a watershed moment,” Vladimir Vasiliev, chief researcher at the Institute for US and Canadian Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, said in a conversation with RT. “First of all, it caused a split in American society and the American political elite. There was polarization in the assessment of this event on the part of both parties and their leaders. In words, and maybe in deeds, the Democrats supported this initiative. Biden took full responsibility, believing that he had ended this 20-year war, which had cost the Americans a trillion dollars,” the expert added. According to Vasiliev, representatives of the Republican Party still consider the evacuation from Afghanistan comparable to the exit from South Vietnam and Southeast Asia in the mid-70s. In their pre-election narrative, this can still be used as justification to demand either the voluntary early resignation of the incumbent president, or even his impeachment, if a favorable political situation develops. According to Reuters, Biden’s current approval rating barely reaches 40%, whereas 55% of Americans are dissatisfied with his actions. The disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan could be the starting point for the downfall of the Democrats. The ongoing pandemic, tensions in Asia, and an imminent economic recession are also contributing to the president’s declining popularity. Nancy Pelosi’s recent Asian tour may just have been an attempt to rectify the situation for the party. “While before the troop withdrawal, most Americans supported Biden, maybe blindly, maybe due to inertia – Afghanistan changed everything,” Vasiliev said. “Since then, his degree of public support has fallen sharply and is now at a critically low level. And today, we could even say this trend is irreversible.” According to available data, including an analysis by auditors from the public organization Open the Books, the US military left up to 650,000 weapons to the rapidly advancing Taliban forces. This includes 350,000 modern M4 assault rifles and obsolete M16s, 65,000 machine guns, 25,000 submachine guns, and 2,500 mortar launchers. According to the organization’s estimates, the Americans left up to 22,000 Humvees and 110 UH-60 Black Hawk combat helicopters. Even if these figures are an exaggeration (as seems to be the case), it is logical to assume that withdrawing all of America’s remaining troops within just a week after pumping the entire region with weapons for 20 years would result in precisely this outcome. Army General Austin Miller, a special forces soldier who was in charge of the troops in Afghanistan, demonstratively handed over his command before the start of the troop withdrawal and now works as an adviser in a private company. “We can only call what happened a ‘withdrawal operation’ with a grain of salt. In fact, it was a genuine escape, with allies thrown under the bus. Afghans who worked for the Americans, mountains of weapons worth billions of dollars, helicopters, and vehicles were all abandoned – it’s hard to call this a ‘withdrawal operation,’” Yuri Rogulev, director of the Foundation for the Study of the United States of the Moscow State University, said. “This flight marked a turning point for the Biden administration, after which its approval rating plummeted and never rebounded. After that, no matter what the White House took on, it ended up the same way – in failure. And in this sense, it is a symbolic act that lays bare all the contradictions in America’s relations with many countries and reveals its attitude towards former allies.” According to Vasiliev, the failure in Afghanistan put an end to the administration’s domestic political ambitions. One year on, the cabinet has been unable to implement any of the major policy initiatives in its domestic agenda. Given the circumstances, the Biden administration justified the withdrawal by saying, “We are leaving Afghanistan to focus our actions on countering Russia and China.” Despite all its “adventurism and absurdity,” this line began to be implemented and provoked the Russian side to take forceful measures. “This goes to show that the United States can do this to any of the protégés, allies, or clients that they supported,” Rogulev said, pointing to a century-old tradition of US foreign policy. “They have abandoned Afghanistan completely. They don’t provide it with any financial support or even humanitarian aid. This is also an example for Pakistan to keep in mind.” According to Vasiliev, the increased tensions surrounding Taiwan and US-Chinese relations are a direct consequence of the military detente in Afghanistan. In light of the unsuccessful end of the war in Afghanistan, he questions the Democratic Party’s prospects for retaining control in both chambers of Congress in the upcoming election. “The 2020 mandate has been exhausted,” Vasiliev said. “Approval ratings are ephemeral. They can climb. But since then, we have not seen an upswing. No fluctuations. So, to say that no one noticed the setback in Afghanistan would be a mistake. I think the images of the departing plane and people falling from it are still engraved in everyone’s memory,” Rogulev noted. Comparing this with the Vietnam flight of 1975, Rogulev makes one distinction. At that time, the US troops had been truly defeated. There was no defeat here – what happened was a demonstration of a lack of any common strategy or clear position. The fact that the troops were withdrawn was not the problem. “But how it was carried out and the consequences it has led to, both for Afghanistan and the rest of the world – that’s what we need to talk about.” Rogulev believes that the troop withdrawal has weakened America’s position in the Middle East. “The general image of the United States as a country that can bring something positive has disappeared in the region.” According to Vasiliev, an investigation into the matter still lies ahead, after which there will be a big shakeup in the US State Department. “This is a problem that has been kind of put off,” he said. “So far, no one has been held accountable.” “The Republicans tried to initiate this through Congress, but only a special bipartisan commission can identify the people responsible and give a real assessment. And as of today, there’s been none. It’s like the collapse of the Soviet Union – there is the fact that it happened, but everyone has to figure out why for themselves.”"
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560873-ukraine-boosts-military-spending/,Ukraine to boost military spending,"The Ukrainian parliament approved on Monday a boost to defense spending amid the ongoing military conflict with Russia. According to the bill passed by the Rada, the country’s parliament, the government will be authorized to raise an additional 270 billion hryvnias ($7.3 billion) through domestic borrowing. This will allow an extra 241 billion hryvnias ($6.5 billion) to be allocated to the Defense Ministry and for more funds to be provided to the police, security and intelligence services. The move comes after the Wall Street Journal reported that a shortage of funds risks becoming “Ukraine’s Achilles’s heel” in the conflict. “We have to worry about winning the war. It is better to risk high inflation than not to pay soldiers’ salaries,” Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko told the WSJ last week about the National Bank of Ukraine’s strategy of printing more money. Marchenko told news agency RBC Ukraine on Monday that Kiev hopes to receive $12-16 billion from foreign lenders by the end of 2022. The exact sum will depend on negotiations with foreign partners, he said. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560862-russia-ukraine-mercenaries-killed/,Dozens of foreign mercenaries killed in Ukraine – Russia,"The Russian military has killed dozens of mercenaries in Ukraine in high-precision strikes, the Defense Ministry claimed on Monday. It said the Russian Air Force had hit a mercenary deployment point in Kharkov Region. “More than 100 militants from Poland as well as Germany were killed, with more than 50 injured,” the statement read. According to the Defense Ministry, Russian airstrikes on the combat positions of the 63rd Ukrainian Mechanized Brigade in Kherson Region resulted in the 105th and 107th battalions of the unit losing more than 160 fighters. Meanwhile, an artillery attack on the positions of the 66th Ukrainian Mechanized Brigade in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) wiped out “more than 70% of personnel in the unit’s third battalion.” Another high-precision strike near the settlements of Ugledar, Vodyanoye and Dobrovolye, in the DPR, that was conducted against the 53rd Mechanized and 68th Chaser Infantry brigades killed more than 260 fighters. In early August, the ministry claimed that it had eliminated “more than 80 foreign mercenaries and 11 units of special equipment,” that were a part of Ukraine’s ‘International Legion’ in southeastern Ukraine. Earlier, the ministry revealed that since February 24 – the day Russia began its military offensive – more than 7,100 mercenaries from more than 60 countries had arrived in Ukraine. The military says that it is actively monitoring the foreign fighters and specialists, noting that their number had been reduced to 2,190 as of early August. In April, however, Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov stated that the best thing the foreign mercenaries could expect in Ukraine was a “long term in prison.” In June, he also noted that while hundreds had been killed by Russian long-range precision weapons “shortly after their arrival,” most of the foreign fighters were eliminated “due to a low level of training and a lack of real combat experience.” Regarding its own casualties, Moscow has not updated the numbers since March, when it reported 1,351 military personnel killed and 3,825 wounded. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

Rutube said that Apple had threatened to delete the app from AppStore unless it complies. The company noted that it has already barred access to the app from all countries except for Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. “Rutube doesn’t plan to place restrictions on the Russian media because it violates the rights of the Russian-speaking population,” the company said. Launched in 2006, the platform has been described as the Russian version of YouTube. It continues to host Russian state-linked media, including TV channels Rossiya 1 and Channel One, as well as several popular podcasters and bloggers, after their videos were banned from YouTube in response to Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, which was launched in late February. Like many global brands, Apple suspended business activities in Russia in March and left the country’s market."
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560861-ukraine-ace-pilot-dies/,Ukraine’s ‘best fighter pilot’ killed,"A Ukrainian Air Force captain described by the military as an ace fighter pilot died while defending his homeland, his childhood school has reported in an obituary. It did not reveal the circumstances of his death. The institution in the city of Ivano-Frankovsk said on social media that Anton Listopad was “recognized in 2019 as the best pilot of the Ukrainian Air Force and took part in military action in the east of Ukraine.” A captain of that name was listed among those awarded with various merits by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky last month. The man has his own Wikipedia page in the Ukrainian version of the online encyclopedia, though it was only created two days before Zelensky’s order was published. The school that announced Listopad’s death published a biography of the man last year, according to which he joined the Ukrainian armed forces in 2010. He underwent two surgeries to qualify to be a combat pilot, and studied at a military aviation school in Kharkov, which he graduated from in 2018, realizing his childhood dream, the article said. Listopad was 31 at the time of his death, judging by the bio. The article included several photos of him as a student, piloting a fighter jet, and receiving the Order for Courage from Zelensky. The obituary stated that Listopad led the air parade over Kiev during last year’s celebration of the country’s independence, with “millions of Ukrainians watching with joy and pride.” The Russian military says it has virtually undisputed control of the airspace of a large part of Ukraine, making most combat missions by Ukrainian military pilots extremely dangerous. According to the latest update by the Russian Defense Ministry, more than 260 Ukrainian fighter jets have been destroyed during the conflict, both in the air and on the ground, by Russian warplanes and air defenses."

Rogov, a member of the Zaporozhye military-civil administration, insisted that the ZNPP is always prepared to welcome the atomic energy watchdog, which has repeatedly expressed a desire to visit the facility, but noted that the UN has “directly started to block the possibility of an IAEA inspection.” The official suggested that if the agency does visit the plant, it would be forced to conclude that it had been shelled by Kiev’s forces. “It is obvious, it’s all been documented, and not only that, it’s also well known who is being supplied with American guided missiles. Obviously, not Russia, but the Zelensky regime.” The Zaporozhye nuclear power plant - the largest in Europe - has repeatedly come under attack over the past few weeks. While none of the reactors have so far been struck, the shelling has partially damaged a nearby thermal power plant as well as equipment used to cool the nuclear reactors. Moscow has accused Ukraine of using rockets, artillery and drones to attack the ZNPP and has described Kiev’s actions as “nuclear terrorism” and holding the whole of Europe hostage. Rogov stated that Western countries have “completely lost their instinct of self-preservation” in an economic, geopolitical and ecological sense, as a disaster at the ZNPP would spell trouble for European countries first and foremost. ""Nevertheless, we do not hear a single adequate statement, not a single voice of reason, either from Germany or from France,"" he noted. Kiev, meanwhile, has denied responsibility for shelling the plant and insists that it is Russia that has been targeting it in a plot to discredit Ukraine. The US State Department has taken Zelensky’s side and has called for a withdrawal of Russian forces from the area and the creation of a demilitarized zone around the plant. While that solution has been supported by the UN and the EU, Rogov insists that the West should instead be working to establish a ceasefire there. Russia’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, has pointed out that if Russian forces were to leave the power plant it would be vulnerable to action by Kiev. “Those who propose the withdrawal of Russian troops should be aware of the consequences that this object will be left without protection and can be used by Kiev and nationalist groups for the most monstrous provocations,” said the Russian ambassador, stressing that Moscow does not use nuclear facilities for military purposes."
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560860-zelensky-fires-sbu-chiefs/,Zelensky fires security chiefs amid crackdown,"President Vladimir Zelensky on Monday fired the heads of three regional offices of the nation’s Security Service (SBU), Ukraine’s successor to the KGB. Earlier, he dismissed the top official in the agency, citing widespread treason among agents. The top security officials in the Kiev, Lviv, and Ternopol regions were fired by presidential decree. A new leader was immediately appointed to the SBU’s Kiev office but replacements for the other two have yet to be revealed. Zelensky’s move appears to be a continuation of the crackdown on the SBU that he launched in mid-July. At the time, he dismissed the head of the security agency, Ivan Bakanov, his deputy, and four regional SBU heads. He also sacked Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova. Zelensky claimed the shakeup was due to rampant “treason” under the leadership of the officials. The move was reportedly not perceived positively by the US government, which publicly maintains unwavering support for the Ukrainian president. But according to US media, White House officials have said privately that there is growing mistrust in Washington over Zelensky’s increasingly authoritarian rule. It has not been uncommon for Ukrainian officials to question the loyalty of citizens amid the armed conflict with Russia. Nikolaev Governor Vitaly Kim suggested he may place his region’s capital on lockdown to conduct a Bolshevik-style purge of Russian sympathizers, saying he trusts no one. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560848-space-station-russia-model-iss/,Russia unveils look of its new space station,"The Russian space agency unveiled a mockup of its new orbital station for the first time on Monday, after Moscow revealed earlier this year that it plans to leave the International Space Station (ISS) after 2024. Roscosmos showcased the model of the Russian Orbital Station (ROS) during the Army 2022 International Military-Technical Forum. According to the agency, Energia Space Corporation, which is a part of Roscosmos, is now developing a sketch of the future space station, with its deployment set to unfold in two stages. The first stage will involve four modules – a science power module, a node, a core module, and a gateway, Roscosmos said. At this stage, the crew will consist of two people. The second stage will add two more modules to the station – target and production modules – as well as a servicing platform, the agency added. After this, the crew will be increased to four. “Among the new features and capabilities of the national station, the developers single out huge energy potential for purpose-oriented tasks, unification of modules, the possibility of interaction with next-generation satellite groupings and various modes of operation,” Roscosmos said. In late July, Roscosmos chief Yury Borisov said Russia will withdraw from the ISS after 2024, adding that Moscow intends to fulfill its obligations to its foreign partners. He noted at the time that the decision has nothing to do with geopolitics, including the Ukraine conflict. Later, Sergey Krikalev, the executive director for manned space programs at Roscosmos, clarified that the timing for pulling out depends on the technical state of the ISS, and could come at any time after 2024. Last year, Vladimir Solovyov, a former Soviet cosmonaut and chief designer for spacecraft manufacturer RSC Energia, said Russia would start construction on its own space station as early as in 2028. The project will be built on the Science Power Module 1, which was originally designed for the ISS, but is now being repurposed, Solovyov said at the time. The former head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, predicted that the ISS, which NASA plans to operate until 2030, would “fall apart” by that time unless “huge amounts of money” are invested in repairs."
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560850-ukraine-budget-bankrupt-moscow/,‘Ukraine is bankrupt’ – Moscow,"Ukraine has lost its financial independence as it cannot meet its obligations to its citizens without Western help, Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin wrote on Monday. Taking to Telegram, Volodin claimed that “collected taxes form only 40% of the country's budget,” more than 60% of which covers military spending. Ukraine’s monthly deficit amounts to $5 billion, Volodin reminded. “Ukraine is bankrupt,” he said. The same numbers were reported on Friday by the Wall Street Journal. In the speaker’s opinion, “without the help of Washington and Brussels, Kiev can no longer fulfill its obligations to citizens.” “Ukraine has lost its financial independence,” Volodin concluded. On Monday, the Ukrainian government introduced draft legislation to abolish preferential taxation on fuel. An explanatory note on the Rada’s website says that “there is a significant shortage of funds for financing the road industry.” The legislation is poised to create “during the period of martial law” conditions “for the proper functioning of the economy” and increased budget revenue through excise duties. In a recent interview with RBK Ukraine, Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko said that next year's budget will be “extremely tight” due to “war conditions.” “There will be no expenses that will not be reviewed,” he said. According to Oleg Ustenko, a presidential adviser on economic issues, Ukraine’s state budget deficit is expected to reach $50 billion by the end of the year. That is about 30-35% of the country’s GDP, he said in a TV interview last month, adding that “this is a problem of war.” Kiev says it needs $5 billion a month in assistance from Western backers. However, Ustenko, quoted by the Financial Times, said in July they would need an extra $4 billion a month over the next three months to cover the cost of emergency accommodation and housing repairs for millions of people, and to fund a basic minimum income for those who had lost their jobs. The grants and loans pledged to Ukraine by the West have been arriving much slower than expected. So far, only €1 billion out of a €9 billion ($9.3 billion) long-term loan package proposed by the European Commission in May has arrived. Since February, the EU has provided €2.2 billion. The United States Agency for International Development announced in mid-July that it would send an additional $1.7 billion, bringing the agency’s total spending on Ukraine to $4 billion. Last week, Ukraine’s finance minister said that his country expects $3 billion of US financial aid to arrive in August and a further $1.5 billion in September. According to Marchenko, the payments are part of an agreed $7.5 billion financial aid package, and would be used to finance “critical spending” such as healthcare and pension costs."
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560847-klitschko-zelensky-citizenship-threat/,Kiev mayor claims Zelensky’s government threatened his citizenship,"The government of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky made a veiled threat to strip the citizenship of Kiev Mayor Vitaly Klitschko, the head of the Ukrainian capital claimed in an interview published on Monday. “I had a conversation with an innuendo: ‘Since you are so proactive, we could look into your German citizenship’. I said: ‘I’d be very surprised if somebody showed me a German passport in my name and took it away,’” he said, as cited by the website Babel. The exchange allegedly happened after Klitschko signed a public call for Zelensky to reverse his decision to revoke the Ukrainian citizenship of Ukrainian official Gennady Korban, which he ordered last month. Korban, a longtime close ally of Dnepr Mayor Boris Filatov, was among several Ukrainians whose citizenship was taken away by Zelensky. He was on a foreign trip when the move was made. Upon attempting to return to Ukraine he found himself at an impasse when the border guards would not let him cross back into his home country. Over a hundred Ukrainian public figures supported the open letter to Zelensky, which Filatov published on Facebook in late July. Klitschko declined to reveal who exactly put pressure on him, but said he supported reinstating Korban’s citizenship on principle rather than as a political favor to Filatov. “Everything must happen under universal principles, not selectively,” he explained. “In this case this is how it looks: we’ll take this one’s [citizenship] and let others keep theirs, so that they are more pliable, realizing that we can take theirs too.” Ukraine disallows dual citizenship. Under the law, Ukrainians who also hold foreign passports are treated as regular citizens but are banned from holding public office. The president may revoke the citizenship of a Ukrainian who takes another passport. In practice, however, this principle is often ignored. For instance, billionaire Igor Kolomoysky, one of the people targeted by Zelensky’s July order, had served as a governor in Ukraine despite holding the citizenship of Cyprus and Israel at the time. The fact was widely known in Ukraine, and Kolomoysky even joked that it was OK, since the law bans dual citizenship, not triple citizenship. In the interview, Klitschko provided assurance that Ukrainian citizenship is the only one he has. The official was a world-renowned boxer before going into politics and spent much of his athletic career in Germany. Korban, whose parents are Israelis, has long denied rumors that he holds a passport of the Jewish state. “I always take pleasure in vacationing in Israel. But I have no intention to ask for asylum or citizenship there since I plan to continue my career in my homeland, Ukraine,” he told the media in 2015, responding to reports that he may leave the country. The issue was brought back into the media spotlight after Zelensky’s order and remains murky. Israel’s ambassador to Ukraine, Michael Brodsky, said his nation does not normally disclose if a person has its citizenship to protect privacy. “As far as I know, no requests of that nature came from Ukraine,” he added."
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560839-ben-wallace-crimea-bridge/,British leaders discussed 'destruction' of Crimean bridge – Ukrainian MP,"A Ukrainian lawmaker says he discussed the “destruction” of Europe's longest bridge with UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace in June. Aleksey Goncharenko was responding to a claim on Russian television that Wallace was personally in charge of developing a plan to strike the strategically important crossing, linking Crimea to the Krasnodar region. The remark, which Goncharenko made on Telegram, last week, included a photo of himself with Wallace and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson during a NATO gathering. It was captioned ""Tell [host Olga] Skabeeva that Ben Wallace and I discussed a plan to destroy the Crimean Bridge back in June."" The allegation arose during a TV appearance by Russian military expert and journalist Igor Konashenko, who said that “according to some information”, the British defence minister was in charge of developing plans to attack the bridge, which connects Crimea with mainland Russia across the Kerch Strait. The bridge was built by Russia after Crimea broke away from Ukraine and voted to rejoin Russia in 2014 to ensure that there were railway and road links with the region. The Ukrainian government earlier dismissed calls for it to be destroyed, but Kiev now considers the bridge to be a primary military target that should be attacked as soon as it receives Western weapons capable of striking it. Konashenko was on air to share his thoughts on this revised position, which Ukrainian Major General Dmitry Marchenko announced last month. The UK is a major supplier of advanced heavy weapons to Kiev, most notably the M270 multiple rocket launchers. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on the general’s statement, saying that it was hardly novel. “We are certainly aware of such threats and take them into consideration,” he said at the time. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed confidence that any plans to attack the bridge would fail. Goncharenko is a controversial political figure in Ukraine who has a record of anti-Russian publicity stunts and posts. One of his latest is a picture of the Crimea Bridge with the dog from the “It’s fine” meme sitting on it. “A good remark from comments: add some fire,” he wrote under the picture. In the original work the anthropomorphic dog sits in a house engulfed by flames, ignoring the obvious threat. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560830-russia-troops-new-small-arms/,Russian troops to receive cutting-edge small arms,"Russian troops will receive cutting-edge weapons, including PPK-20 submachine guns and SVCh designated marksman rifles, by the end of the year, the Kalashnikov Group announced on Sunday. “We believe it is the best machine pistol in the world for the next 20 years,” the head of the famed arms manufacturer, Alan Lushnikov, told journalists, describing the PPK-20. Data provided by the company indicates that it is capable of firing 800 rounds per minute. According to Russian media, bullets fired from the gun have a velocity of nearly 470 meters per second and are capable of penetrating IIIA level body armor – one of the highest armor classes for concealable, lightweight soft protection. The machine pistol weighs just under 3kg, has a sound moderator, and a standardized mounting rail interface similar to the Picatinny rail used in Western weapons. The PPK-20 was first presented by Kalashnikov at the ARMY 2021 exhibition last year. The SVCh, or Chukavin Sniper Rifle, is a new generation of designated marksman rifles designed to replace the Soviet-made Dragunov Sniper Rifles (SVD). It is lighter than its predecessor, has higher precision, and is capable of hitting targets at a distance of around 1,200 meters. The small size of this semi-automatic rifle also makes it effective at middle-range distances and even in close combat. It was first demonstrated in 2017 and successfully passed state trials last year."
2022-08-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/560827-ukraine-shelling-nuclear-plant-city/,One dead in Ukrainian shelling of city hosting nuclear plant,"Ukrainian troops shelled a residential area in the city of Energodar on Sunday, a member of the local administration, Vladimir Rogov, reported in a Telegram post. A local 49-year-old resident was killed in the strike, he added. Energodar hosts the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, the largest such facility in Europe. The man was walking his dog when the shelling began, according to Rogov. A 24-year-old woman was also injured in the attack, he said, adding that she had been sent to a hospital. The Ukrainian strike also targeted an area near the city’s thermal power plant, where the shelling caused a fire close to the facility, the official said. Moscow has repeatedly blamed Ukraine for shelling the Russia-held Zaporozhye nuclear plant over the past week. On Thursday, Russia’s Ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, told the Security Council that a nuclear disaster could happen “at any moment” amid the “reckless” shelling of the plant by Kiev’s forces. “Kiev’s criminal attacks on the nuclear infrastructure facilities are pushing the world to the brink of a nuclear disaster that would rival the Chernobyl one,” Nebenzya said at that time. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also expressed concern over the developments at the plant and suggested sending an IAEA mission to the facility to assess the situation. The initiative was welcomed by Moscow. Kiev, in turn, has blamed Russia for targeting the plant in an alleged plot to discredit Ukraine – an accusation Moscow dismissed by saying it had no reason to target its own troops. Washington, meanwhile, has sided with Kiev in its demand for a demilitarized zone around the nuclear plant and the withdrawal of the Russian troops controlling the area."
2022-08-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/560820-ukraine-ambassador-crowdfunding-begging/,Russia ridicules Ukrainian ambassador for ‘begging',"Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has shamed Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, Vasily Miroshnichenko, for “begging and vagrancy,” after he launched a crowdfunding appeal to send his daughter to a top-tier London university. “It’s not a joke,” Zakharova wrote in a Telegram post on Sunday, explaining that the ambassador had posted a link to the crowdfunding page on his official Facebook and Twitter accounts. “First, he wrote how he showed his daughter American universities, and then he reported that she chose a British education after his fascinating stories,” Zakharova continued. “Begging and vagrancy are the basis of the Kiev regime’s ‘diplomacy,’” she added, remarking that Ukraine “was squandered” through such grift. In a Facebook post last month, Miroshnichenko said that he had taken his daughter, Yaroslava (Yasia), on a road trip to California to look at universities four years ago. With Yasia recently turning 19, he said that she had chosen not to attend any of the US schools, and would instead study chemistry and management at University College London, an institution rated 18th in the world on the Times Higher Education rankings. Miroshnichenko posted a link to a crowdfunding appeal by Yasia, who is seeking £30,000 ($36,400) to cover tuition and living costs for her first year in London. Yasia wrote on the crowdfunding website that she had been granted a British visa under a scheme for Ukrainian refugees and qualified for domestic tuition. At UCL, this means that she will pay the same £9,250 per year rate as British students, instead of the £31,200 charged to international students. “It’s still a huge amount of money for my family to pull off,” she wrote. “Therefore, I need your support.” Miroshnichenko has served as Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia and New Zealand since March. Although his net worth is not publicly available, it is highly unlikely that his family cannot afford Yasia’s university fees. The diplomat is the CEO of a consultancy firm in Kiev and the co-founder of a Ukrainian media NGO. He is also described by the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv as “a long-time friend and donor” of the institution."
2022-08-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/560822-poland-russia-eu-visa-ban-plan/,Poland reveals plan for EU-wide Russian visa ban,"Warsaw is currently developing a draft proposal that would allow the EU refuse visas to Russian travelers, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Piotr Wawrzyk told the nation’s PAP news agency on Sunday. A decision on the matter can be expected within the coming weeks, he added. The deputy minister did not elaborate on the exact details of the proposal, which is still in the works, but said that its purpose is to head off the potential resistance of some key EU members that are likely to oppose a blanket visa ban on all Russians. Poland is in favor of suspending the 2007 agreement between Brussels and Moscow on “the facilitation of the issuance of visas” altogether. This treaty regulates the issuance of visas “for an intended stay of no more than 90 days per period of 180 days” for the citizens of Russia and the EU. Yet, according to Wawrzyk, not all EU members are on board with such an initiative. “This is opposed by large member states, including Germany, France and the Netherlands,” he said. Since it is “impossible to overcome the resistance of these countries to suspend the agreement … Poland is working on a new solution,” he added. Warsaw has already been holding talks with some EU member states “for several weeks,” the deputy minister said, adding that Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia as well as the Czech Republic and Slovakia are aligned with Poland’s approach to the issue. “We can expect a decision on this matter in the coming weeks,” Wawrzyk said. The deputy minister welcomed the decisions of Tallinn and Riga to suspend or limit the issuance of visas to Russians. “Better late than never,” he said, adding that Poland has not been issuing tourist visas to Russians for several months already. Warsaw only admits diplomats, truck drivers traveling to Poland for work, and family members of Polish and EU citizens. Earlier this week, the Czech Republic, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, said it would push for a blanket EU ban on Russians. The bloc’s members will discuss the issue at a ministerial summit in Prague in late August. Latvia stopped issuing visas to nearly all Russian citizens earlier this month, citing security concerns. Estonia said on Thursday it would do the same. Tallinn also plans to ban current Russian holders of Estonian visas from entering starting on August 18. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas called travelling to the EU “a privilege, not a human right” last week as she called on other member states to follow suit. Finland’s government, which advocates the same measure, is expected to discuss potential limits on issuing visas to Russians on Tuesday, Finnish YLE broadcaster reported. Germany has so far been one of the few EU nations opposing such a move. Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed skepticism over a potential blanket ban, arguing it would diminish the effectiveness of other sanctions by targeting “innocent people.” Moscow has blasted the proposed measures as “flagrant nationalism” and xenophobia. The Kremlin also expressed its hope that “common sense” would prevail over time."
2022-08-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/560301-nikolai-family-regicide-urals/,The last Tsar: How Russia commemorates the brutal communist murder of Emperor Nikolai II's family,"On the night of July 16-17, 1918, the Bolsheviks shot the family of the last Russian tsar, Nikolai II. Eleven people were killed in total: The emperor, the empress, five of their children, and four royal servants. The remains were secretly buried in an abandoned mine, the location of which was hidden until the collapse of the Soviet Union. The family of Nikolai II was subsequently canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church, and for the last 30 years, in mid-July, Christians from all over the world participate in a church procession from the murder site in Ekaterinburg to a monastery in Ganina Yama. An RT correspondent learned the story of this extrajudicial massacre and talked to pilgrims about their attitude to the Holy Royal Passion-Bearers. In March of 1917, before the October Revolution, Russia’s provisional government decided to arrest the royal family. At first, the Romanov's lived at Tsarskoye Selo, but in August, they were forced to go to Tobolsk. In the spring of 1918, the group was moved to Ekaterinburg, where they stayed in the house of an engineer named Nikolay Ipatiev, which had been requisitioned by the Bolsheviks, and sometimes received food from the nuns of the Novo-Tikhvin convent. On the night of July 16-17, 1918, Nikolai II, Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, Grand Duchesses Anastasia, Tatiana, Olga, and Maria, Tsarevich Alexei, imperial doctor Evgeny Botkin, imperial cook Ivan Kharitonov, the empress’ housemaid Anna Demidova, and the tsar’s valet Aloysius Troup, were all shot by Bolsheviks under the command of Yakov Yurovsky. Shortly afterwards, the murder of the royal family was investigated by Nikolay Alekseevich Sokolov, a judicial investigator for particularly important cases with the Omsk District Court. The civil war between the Communists and their opponents was still raging in Russia in 1918. On July 25, anti-Bolshevik forces from the Siberian army occupied Ekaterinburg. At the beginning of February 1919, Sokolov was summoned by the Supreme Governor, Admiral Alexander Kolchak, and instructed to launch an investigation. After the execution of Kolchak by the Communists in the winter of 1920, the investigator left the country and continued to take testimony from witnesses in Western Europe. In Paris, he interviewed Prince Lvov, the former chairman of the provisional government’s Council of Ministers, as well as its former minister of justice, Kerensky, and minister of foreign affairs, Milyukov. Kerensky cited two main reasons for the arrest of the tsar and his family. The first was the “agitated mood” of workers and soldiers who wanted to deal with the sovereign. The second was “high-ranking officers” who thought the emperor and empress intended to conclude a “separate peace” with Germany. Sokolov’s book entitled ‘The Murder of the Royal Family’, which contains materials from the investigation, was published in Berlin in 1925. He had been one step away from solving the mystery of whereabouts of the tsar’s remains but did not have time to discover them before the Bolsheviks took the area. The key document containing details about the regicide is a note from 1920 written by Yurovsky, who had overseen the killing. According to his memoirs, on a night in July 1918, the royal family and their servants were told: “‘Due to unrest in the city, it is necessary to transfer the Romanov family from the upper floor to the lower one’… When the team entered, the commandant told the Romanovs that, since their relatives in Europe [probably meaning German troops under the leadership of the empress’ cousin, Emperor Wilhelm II – ed. note] were continuing their offensive against Soviet Russia… the [Ural] District’s executive committee had decided to shoot them. Nikolai turned his back to the team and faced his family. Then, as if coming to his senses, he turned to the commandant and asked: ‘What? What?’ The commandant hastily repeated his words and ordered the team to prepare. The team was told in advance who was to shoot at whom and ordered to aim directly at the heart in order to avoid a large amount of blood and end the affair as quickly as possible. Nikolai said nothing more and turned back to his family. The others uttered several incoherent exclamations for several seconds. Then the shooting began and lasted two to three minutes. Nikolai was killed on the spot by the commandant himself. Then, Alexandra Feodorovna and the Romanovs’ servants died immediately... Alexey, three of his sisters, the lady-in-waiting [Anna Demidova], and Botkin were still alive. This surprised the commandant, because they were aiming directly at the heart. They had to be shot again. It was also surprising that the bullets ricocheted off something, like hail, and bounced around the room. When they tried to stab one of the girls with a bayonet, the bayonet could not pierce the bodice. Thanks to all this, the whole procedure, counting the ‘check’, took 20 minutes.” According to the note, the bodies were supposed to be buried in an abandoned mine nearby. However, shortly after the murder, it turned out that no one knew where it was, and nothing had been prepared to carry out the burial. In addition, the Bolsheviks were prevented from ending the affair as soon they wished, as the perpetrators of the murder made sporadic attempts to steal valuables from their victims. A car left Ekaterinburg with the bodies and stopped near the village of Koptyaki, where another abandoned mine was found in a nearby forest. The bodies were stripped and lowered down. The Bolsheviks tried to avoid inconvenient witnesses. They even announced in the village of Koptyaki that Czechs, who were armed opponents of the Soviet government, were hiding in the forest and that it would be searched. No one was allowed to leave the village. “The idea arose to bury some of the corpses right there in the mine,” Yurovsky writes. “They began to dig a hole and had almost dug it out when a peasant friend of Ermakov [who aided in hiding the bodies] drove up and it turned out that he could see the pit.” In 2000, the monastery of the Holy Royal Passion-Bearers was established in the Ganina Yama tract. Some Orthodox consider this to be the final burial place of the royal remains. Later, at a meeting of old Bolsheviks in 1934, Yurovsky described the vicissitudes of the burial in more detail. On the morning of July 17, water covered the bodies that had been put in the mine. They wanted to blow up the mine with bombs, but nothing came of it. They decided to “transport the corpses to another place.” Yurovsky instructed his subordinates to remove the bodies. “I had a plan, in case any problems arose, to bury them in groups, in different places along the roadway.” Then they began to dig a new hole, but at some point, the already mentioned acquaintance of Ermakov saw it and the plan failed. “After waiting for evening, we loaded the cart… It was already approaching midnight when I decided it was necessary to bury them somewhere nearby, since no one could see this place… I sent them to get railroad ties to cover the place where the corpses would be buried... About two months ago, I was leafing through a book by Sokolov, the investigator on extremely important cases, and I saw a picture of these railway ties. It says that they had been laid there to help trucks pass. So, after digging up the whole area, they didn’t think to look under the railway ties.” While Sokolov was able to find traces of members of the imperial family near the Ganina Yama, he never found the bodies themselves. “A bonfire was immediately lit, and while the grave was being prepared, we burned two corpses: those of Alexei and Demidova [in fact, Grand Duchess Maria – ed. note], who we burned instead of Alexandra Feodorovna by mistake. A pit was dug near the fire. We put the bones in and covered it. Another large fire was lit on top, and all traces were hidden by ashes. Meanwhile, a mass grave was dug for the others… Before putting the rest of the corpses into the pit, we poured sulfuric acid over them. Then we lowered them into the pit, poured more sulfuric acid on them, filled in the pit, and covered it with railroad ties. The empty truck drove over them a few times to tamp them down and that was it. At 5-6am, we gathered everyone and explained the significance of what we’d done, warning that everyone should forget about what they’d seen and never talk about it with anyone. Then we went to the city.” In 2015, an investigator in the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation named Vladimir Solovyov said that Pyotr Voykov had written out a purchase order for sulfuric acid. A metro station in the north of Moscow still bears the name ‘Voykovskaya’. The imperial family’s final burial place under a platform of railway ties was not a secret for all Soviet citizens – apparently, high-ranking party functionaries knew about it. Literary critics believe that this place was even shown to the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky in 1928. The result of the visit was his poem ‘The Emperor’. The first to discover the royal remains in Soviet times was geologist Alexander Avdonin, a graduate of the Ural Mining Institute. In the 1960s, Avdonin met Gennady Lisin from the Ural Worker publishing house. Lisin claimed that he’d been a member of the Boy Scouts and had helped White investigators search for the burial site in his youth. It was he who showed Avdonin Ganina Yama. In 1976, Geli Ryabov, a screenwriter from Moscow and an honored employee of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs, went to Avdonin. A few years later, Avdonin thoroughly examined the Old Koptyakov Road, along which the Bolsheviks had once transported the bodies of the Romanovs. In the town of Porosenkov Log near Ekaterinburg, he found the same railway ties. Under them, the geologist managed to find skulls and bones. Ryabov took two skulls to Moscow in the hope of conducting an examination. However, no one agreed to help him before the collapse of the USSR. Later, Avdonin and Ryabov decided to rebury the wooden box containing the remains near the place it was discovered – until better times. In 1989, Ryabov told the Moscow News that he had found the imperial remains, and interest in the tsarist mystery grew rapidly among amateur geologists. Avdonin began to worry about the fate of the remains and wrote a letter to the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, Boris Yeltsin, who instructed the governor of Sverdlovsk Region, Eduard Rossel, to deal with the issue. In 1993, Rossel was briefly the head of the Ural Republic, a de facto entity in the Russian Federation that was not provided for by the Constitution. The governor believed that the Urals should become more independent in economic and legislative terms. In November, the initiative was finally curtailed, and Rossel was dismissed. Ural historians and journalists suspect that the governor may have been using the royal remains as a bargaining chip with the federal authorities up until that moment. In 1998, after numerous examinations, the remains were buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg in the presence of Yeltsin. At that time, the Russian Orthodox Church did not recognize the authenticity of the remains, and Patriarch Alexy II did not attend the funeral. Among the discovered remains, two of the dead were missing. In 2007, a search team found the remains of Grand Duchess Maria and Tsarevich Alexei 75 meters from the main burial site. In March 2022, ex-Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk, chairman of the Moscow Patriarchate’s Department for External Church Relations, stated that “We now have clear and sufficient evidence that the ‘Ekaterinburg remains’ are the genuine remains of members of the royal family… It seems to me that the arguments supporting the authenticity of the ‘Ekaterinburg remains’ significantly outwfeigh any arguments that could refute it.” The church could have officially recognized the authenticity of the remains at the Bishops’ Council in May, but this had to be postponed. Sixty years after the October Revolution, Ipatiev’s house was demolished. Yeltsin was then the first secretary of the Sverdlovsk Regional Committee of the CPSU. In 2003, a Church-on-Blood was erected on this site, and in 1992, the tradition of holding a penitential procession was born. Its current route was established in 1994. The Romanov Memorial is now located in the Porosenkov Log tract. Ilya Korovin, the director of the memorial, who is a supporter of Avdonin’s theory concerning the preserved remains, told RT that the procession route does not include this cultural heritage site. In 2018, Patriarch Kirill participated in the procession. After four years, believers again walk around 20 kilometers from the Church-on-Blood to the monastery of the Holy Royal Passion-Bearers in the Ganina Yama tract. This year, there were 50,000 pilgrims, according to the St. Catherine’s Foundation. In conversations with RT during the procession, believers shared their views on whether the Church should officially recognize the royal remains. Some believe this would be the right thing to do, putting an end to the ‘biggest crime’ in Russian history. Others, on the contrary, do not believe the remains found by Avdonin are authentic, holding that they were probably destroyed in Ganina Yama. The procession begins at 2:30am Ural time. It is headed by church leaders, followed by a long column of Orthodox Christians, who hail not only from Russia, but also from Western Europe, Latin America, and Asia. In less than four hours, the first pilgrims appear at the final point of the route – the monastery at Ganina Yama. Orthodox Christians in comfortable sneakers carrying bottles of water cheerfully sing “Lord, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us!” The former mine is now enclosed by a gallery filled with portraits of the royal passion-bearers and their faithful servants. RT spoke with people born in the Urals who say that they participated in the procession as children, and now help their elderly parents walk along this long route."
2022-08-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/560817-lithuania-minister-visa-ban/,Lithuania wants EU visa ban for Russian opposition,"A blanket Schengen visa ban for Russian citizens would allow more people who disapprove of the government to be kept in the country, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said on Saturday. These people would thus become a driving force of political change, he believes. In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the minister talked about what he sees as an unfair situation when Ukrainians are fleeing their country or fighting for their homes, while Russians can still enjoy traveling to the bloc. When asked if he would like to see a Schengen visa ban applied to those Russians who are against the military action in Ukraine and who might be facing persecution in their own country, Landsbergis said that he believes that “change comes from within.” Therefore, he argued, the scenario of ‘two Russias,’ one of which would be in emigration, is not vital. He stressed that even if only 5-10% people in Russia oppose the country's actions in Ukraine, that would still mean millions of people. The real change – the establishment of “democratic Russia” – will be prompted by those people, and thus it is better if they stay in their home country, the minister said. Landsbergis argued that the EU could impose a total ban on visas for Russian citizens, except for those who apply on humanitarian grounds. He said that his country, by working with various non-government organizations, has already found a good way to establish when humanitarian grounds are valid. The three Baltic countries – Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia – have been known for their harsh policies towards Russia and were among the first nations to impose visa restrictions on Russian citizens in response to Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine. They are now at the forefront of the call for an EU-wide visa ban. Germany and many EU officials, however, have been skeptical of the idea. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz cited the “very far-reaching sanctions” imposed on Russia and said that a visa ban would weaken their effectiveness “if it was directed against everyone, including innocent people.” A spokeswoman for the European Commission said that a total ban would simply be unlawful and that each application must be considered individually. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, commenting in July on the Schengen visa ban proposals, said that Moscow hopes that the EU would show common sense. However, he didn’t rule out “actions of an emotional nature.”"
2022-08-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/560809-poland-baltic-military-support/,Russia’s neighbors beg US for military help – media,"The Baltic states and Poland have been begging the US to speed up weapon deliveries and expand the presence of American troops in their countries, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. According to the outlet, the Russian military operation in Ukraine has caused Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to fear that “they will be next to come under attack.” “HIMARS, Reapers, counter-battery radars: these are what we will need most in terms of military lethal power that is imminently needed to deter Russia,” Kusti Salm, the secretary general of the Estonian Defense Ministry, was quoted as saying. He was referring to the US’ High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, combat drones, and technology used to detect incoming fire. Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks recently told reporters, the Washington Post said, that Riga needs additional financial support in order to buy new weapons and to strengthen its air and coastal defenses. Polish officials have also urged the US to speed up the delivery of weapons promised to Warsaw, according to the Post. Poland is awaiting Patriot missile batteries, HIMARS, F-16 fighter jets, and Abrams tanks, “all along multiyear schedules set before” the Russian offensive in Ukraine began, the outlet said. The Polish Embassy in the US revealed on August 4 that “efforts to strengthen the defensive capabilities of countries helping Ukraine in the ongoing war” were a key topic of a meeting between the head of Poland’s national security bureau, Pawel Soloch, and US President Joe Biden’s national security advisor, Jake Sullivan. A senior US defense official who spoke to the Post on condition of anonymity said the countries which are now providing Ukraine with weapons will need to backfill these capabilities in the future, though he did not indicate how long that would take. According to the outlet, while the Eastern European countries realize that not everyone in Congress supports the idea of moving more US personnel to Europe, many of them insist that having a greater presence of troops in Europe “is necessary to keeping Moscow at bay.” The US has said it is committed to its defense cooperation with the Eastern European NATO allies. The 2022 federal spending package included the first-ever authorization of $180 million for the Baltic Security Initiative. Earlier this week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the US will conduct more military exercises with the Baltic nations and will look to provide additional training for their troops. In June, Biden announced that the US will significantly increase its military presence in Europe for the long haul and will establish its first permanent base in Poland. Meanwhile, the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolay Patrushev, accused Washington of trying to turn Eurasia into “a conflagration space of warring nations.” He said in June that the rapid military buildup in Eastern Europe might have disturbing consequences for the region’s security."
2022-08-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/560803-ukraine-legalize-gun-control/,Ukraine to soon legalize guns – minister,"Ukraine will adopt a law legalizing firearms in the near future, amid the nation’s ongoing armed conflict with Russia, Internal Affairs Minister Denis Monastirsky told local media on Saturday. According to Monastirsky, the Ukrainian parliament may allow citizens to buy handguns and other weapons to protect their homes. While stating that he believes people should be able to do so, he said the Internal Affairs Ministry is against granting people the right to carry guns in public. “We are opposed to carrying weapons freely in public places, because we believe that the risks to public safety outweigh the benefits,” he stated, adding that the ministry has been working with Ukrainian MPs on the issue, and that a law could be adopted soon. “[It] has been approved in the first reading and is now being prepared for the second one. I think that it would be submitted to the Parliament for consideration in the near future.” A bill on gun control that was approved by the Ukrainian parliament in late February, shortly before Moscow launched its military operation, allows citizens to buy and store at home short-barreled firearms, as well as using them at shooting ranges. In March, Monastirsky revealed that the Ukrainian authorities had distributed “tens of thousands” of assault rifles, usually reserved for the trained personnel, among civilians, in a move to turn the public into a resistance force against Russian troops. At the time, Kiev also announced it would set free combat-experienced felons who agree to take up arms and fight against the Russian Army. According to media reports, on February 24 alone – the day Russia began the attack – the Kiev authorities handed out at least 10,000 automatic rifles among residents. In July, Viktor Andrusov, a former adviser to Monastirsky, announced that Ukrainians could gain the right to carry pistols for self-defense as early as next year. He also claimed, citing an unspecified poll, that 70% of Ukrainians support the move. Even before full-scale hostilities between Russia and Ukraine broke out, the number of unregistered firearms in Ukraine was estimated at between 3 and 5 million."
2022-08-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/560805-explosion-yerevan-shopping-center/,Explosion rocks Armenian capital (VIDEO),"An explosion rocked a shopping plaza in Yerevan on Sunday, resulting in dozens of casualties, according to Armenia's Ministry of Emergency Situations. Emergency services have confirmed that 3 people have died and at least 34 people were injured in the blast at the Surmalu shopping plaza in Yerevan. The city administration said that some people were stuck under the rubble while a resuce operation began. According to the ministry the explosion in the mall was followed by a fire, with videos posted on social media depicting large plumes of smoke. Eyewitnesses also reported several minor explosions, which could have come from fireworks. A building on the grounds of the plaza that housed a pyrotechnics store has reportedly collapsed. The exact cause of the blast is unclear. According to a member of the Yerevan Elders’ Council, Levon Zakaryan, a recent inspection by the fire protection authorities identified several violations, which the building was ordered to address. Four fire-fighting teams were initially dispatched to the scene, while the total number of crews has now reached 20. Several high-ranking Armenian officials have arrived at the scene, including the parliament speaker, Alen Simonyan, the head of National Security Service, Sarkis Hovhannisyan, and a deputy health minister. Despite efforts by rescuers to keep bystanders away from the danger area, many are nevertheless helping first responders to clear the debris, put out fires and attend to the victims."
2022-08-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/560796-georgia-eu-setbacks-report/,Brussels points to EU hopeful’s ‘setbacks’,"The EU on Saturday pointed out some “setbacks” on the part of Georgia over the past year in the implementation of reforms under the pair’s Association Agreement. In its annual Association Implementation Report, Brussels acknowledged that Tbilisi continues “its reform path” in tough circumstances – amid the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and the ongoing Russian military operation in Ukraine. “However, we have seen setbacks in the key areas of rule of law, governance and human rights,” Josep Borrell, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said. He urged Tbilisi, whose “European perspective” was formally recognized by the bloc in June, to take “a responsible and conscientious approach that matches its stated objectives and its citizens’ aspirations.” The EU commissioner for neighborhood and enlargement, Oliver Varhelyi, said “the ball is now in Georgia’s court.” “A serious commitment to democratic consolidation, judicial reforms, strengthening the rule of law as well as fight against corruption and organised crime will be key,” he added. The EU pledged to continue supporting Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the reform process and economic development. The Association Implementation report was published ahead of the Annual EU-Georgia Association Council, which will take place on September 6, Brussels said. Last month, the European Commission announced that it had decided to “not rush the Georgian political elite” and to give Tbilisi “sufficient time” to work on the reforms required for granting candidate status. Michael Rupp, the European Commission’s representative at the European Parliament, said that an assessment of Georgia’s implementation of the priorities set by the EU in June will not take place before 2023. The Association Agreement between the EU and Georgia entered into force on July 1, 2016. On March 3 this year, a week after Moscow launched its attack on Ukraine, Tbilisi submitted an application for EU membership. While Georgia did not receive candidate status, on June 23, the bloc recognized “the European perspective” of the country and confirmed its willingness “to grant candidate status once the outstanding priorities are addressed.” On the same day, the EU granted candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova, which had also applied for EU membership following the launch of Russia’s military operation. The European Council stated in June that the progress of each country towards membership will depend not only on meeting the criteria, but also on the “EU’s capacity to absorb new members.” Russia blasted the EU’s expansion strategy, saying that granting EU candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova proves that the bloc’s goal is to “contain” Russia."
2022-08-14,https://www.rt.com/news/560792-amnesty-ukraine-violations-review-report/,Amnesty further backtracks on Ukraine human rights report,"Independent experts will review the bombshell Amnesty International report accusing the Ukrainian armed forces of violating humanitarian law, following a backlash from Kiev, in an effort to understand “what went wrong” with the preparation of the document. In a statement released by its German section on Friday, the human rights watchdog said that the study of the document was “initiated at the international level,” and will examine the process by which the material was prepared and how the report was analyzed from the legal and political standpoints. “We want to understand what exactly went wrong and why, in order to learn a lesson and improve our work in the field of human rights,” the organization said. Amnesty International noted that “its findings were not conveyed with the delicacy and accuracy” that are expected from the organization. It also stated that its International Secretariat did not react to criticism from the international community in the correct manner. The report, the watchdog said, also “did not pay due attention to Russian aggression in violation of international law,” adding that Amnesty condemns Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine. On August 4, Amnesty released a report that accused Kiev of “a clear violation of international humanitarian law,” saying it was putting civilian lives at risk by placing its military assets close to civilian infrastructure. In 22 of the 29 schools visited by Amnesty between April and July, the human rights group said it found evidence of current or prior military activity. In five locations, they witnessed Ukrainian troops using hospitals as bases. The group also said it was “not aware” whether Ukraine tried to evacuate civilians from the areas in question. Nonetheless, the watchdog noted that no Ukrainian troops were present in some areas where it found that Russian forces had allegedly delivered strikes on residential areas, concluding that Ukraine’s unlawful military use of civilian sites does not “in any way justify indiscriminate Russian attacks.” Following backlash from Kiev, with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky slamming Amnesty for siding with “terrorists,” the organization issued an apology for its report, saying it “deeply regrets the distress and anger that our press release on the Ukrainian military’s fighting tactics has caused,” while stating that “we fully stand by our findings.”"
2022-08-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/560778-zaporozhye-kakhovskaya-nuclear-shelling/,Ukrainian nuclear site faces new threat,"The Shelling of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station by Ukrainian forces risks a “nuclear catastrophe” at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, Arseniy Zelensky, the Kakhovka facility's deputy director for reconstruction, told reporters on Saturday. According to Zelensky, as quoted by TASS, Kakhovka is now operating in a “very dangerous” emergency mode. The Kakhovka plant is located in Kherson Region in southern Ukraine, which was seized by Russian forces in the early stages of Moscow’s military operation. Together with Russia-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, the biggest in Europe, it has been attacked by Kiev’s troops – with use of Western-supplied weapons – according to the regional authorities. “In case of problems with the dam of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, there will be big troubles at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. [This] could lead to a nuclear catastrophe,” the deputy director of the Kakhovka plant said. He explained to journalists that if the dam is destroyed, the nuclear facility would be deprived of the water needed to cool its reactors. He revealed that the station has been working in emergency mode “since the first days of hostilities.” “The station's own needs, backup 6 kV, are lost, we are working in a very dangerous mode,"" he said, adding that one of the turbines had to be turned off following Ukrainian rocket attacks. If the military action ceases, Zelensky said, the plant can be “restored within a week.” “Fortunately, the station has not yet received major damage, except for hydroelectric unit number three, which burned down in March, it takes 1.5 years to complete the work,” he said. Zelensky’s remarks came the day after Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the military-civilian administration of Kherson Region, revealed that the city of Novaya Kakhovka had again been attacked by “Ukrainian nationalists” but “no tangible damage” was caused. “The hydroelectric power station was not damaged,” he said. On Thursday, Russia’s Ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, told the Security Council that a nuclear disaster can happen “at any moment” amid the “reckless” shelling of the Zaporozhye plant by Kiev’s forces. “Kiev’s criminal attacks on the nuclear infrastructure facilities are pushing the world to the brink of a nuclear disaster that would rival the Chernobyl one,” Nebenzia said. Responding to Kiev’s claims that Russia was the one targeting the plant in an alleged plot to discredit Ukraine, the diplomat said that Russia has no reason to target the facility or its own troops, and that multiple attacks on the facility have been documented from Ukrainian-held territory in Dnepropetrovsk Region. The US Department of State, however, took Kiev’s side by endorsing the demand for a demilitarized zone around the Zaporozhye nuclear plant and calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops that control the area."
2022-08-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/560779-ukraine-peace-talks-defeat-europe/,Zelensky aide explains why Ukraine won’t negotiate with Russia,"Ukraine has ruled out peace talks with Moscow under the existing circumstances, comparing any negotiations to “civilizational catastrophe.” Re-starting talks would not contribute anything to Kiev’s goals, Mikhail Podoliak, an aide to President Vladimir Zelensky, told Ukraine’s Babel news media outlet on Friday. “Today, Ukraine has no motives to hold the talks,” Podoliak said, adding that the “opportunity to win this war is much more important than any situational pause.” Starting dialogue under the present circumstances would only “formalize” the defeat of Ukraine and that of Europe, as well as “European values,” he added. Talks with Russia today will mean only one thing: Russia has won… Are you ready for that? The presidential aide warned that Ukraine’s defeat would also mark the “collapse of the global security system and the system of democratic values.” Reaching a ceasefire now would not stop further conflicts, he said, adding that Russia might launch another attack on Ukraine at some point in the future. Podoliak also compared the idea of starting peace talks with Moscow to conducting talks with Nazi Germany in 1942, when the Nazis occupied large swathes of Soviet territory, including all of Ukraine. “One cannot even imagine it. Any talks at that moment and with that [balance of power] would mean a civilizational catastrophe,” he said. In early August, the Kremlin signaled its readiness to strike a peace deal with Kiev, while warning that it would achieve the goals of its military operation in Ukraine regardless of Kiev’s willingness to concede. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at the time that the two nations were close to settling their differences in a way that was acceptable to Russia, but the draft agreement prepared during a meeting in Istanbul was torpedoed by Ukraine. Kiev broke off the talks with Moscow after accusing Russia of committing war crimes, an allegation that Russia said was based on fabricated evidence. Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who visited Moscow in early August, also said that a negotiated solution is possible and argued that the recent “initial success” of the grain export deal should be used to reach a ceasefire. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/560777-ukraine-peski-himars-right-sector/,Russia announces capture of strategic settlement in Donbass,"Russian forces have established complete control over the strategic settlement of Peski in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Russia’s Defense Ministry has said. “As a result of the offensive by the allied forces [Russian troops and DPR militia] the settlement of Peski has been fully liberated” from the Ukrainian military, the ministry’s spokesman Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov announced during his daily briefing on Saturday. Peski, located some 2km away from the Donetsk Airport, has been one of the main pillars of Ukraine’s elaborate defense line in the DPR. The settlement had been heavily fortified since 2015. A DPR militia commander told Russia’s Channel One last week that the area had been turned into “literally one big garrison,” from which all civilians were evacuated long ago. All buildings in Peski are surrounded by trenches, while Ukrainian defenses had been set up in “according to NATO standards,” he pointed out. The joint operation to seize the settlement began in late July and saw intense fighting and artillery shelling. In early August, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky described the situation in Peski and nearby Avdeevka by saying that “it’s just hell there. It can’t even be described in words.” Meanwhile, strikes against Kiev’s forces and military infrastructure continued in other parts of Ukraine over the past 24 hours, Konashenkov said. Among other things, a HIMARS multiple rocket launcher and a warehouse that stored munitions for it were destroyed near the town of Kramatorsk in the DPR, according to the spokesman. More than a hundred Ukrainian troops and members of the nationalist Right Sector group were also killed in a strike near the village of Starye Terny in the DPR, Konashenkov added. Radicals from the Right Sector played a key role during the violent coup in Kiev in 2014 and subsequently took an active part in the fighting in Donbass over the next two years."
2022-08-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/560775-russian-us-ties-normalization/,Moscow names condition for ‘normalizing’ relations with US,"The US needs to start respecting Moscow’s interests before damaged bilateral relations can be amended, a senior Russian diplomat has said. “I’ll be frank: we’re not seeing grounds for finding compromises with Washington, which is not quite capable of negotiating,” Aleksandr Darchiev, the head of the Foreign Ministry’s North American Department, told the Russian news agency TASS on Saturday. “Of course, if the American side finally turns to common sense and Washington takes a sober look at the changing geopolitical landscape, demonstrating – not with words, but with actions – the intent to respect Russian national interests, then a basis for a gradual normalization of bilateral relations will appear,” he added. The US and its allies in NATO imposed sweeping sanctions on Moscow after Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February. However, the attempt to tank the Russian economy has failed, Darchiev argued, as have “the attempts to muster an international anti-Russian coalition that would be broader than the traditional bond between the US and its vassals.” “We are reacting calmly, and not going out of our way to seek talks,” the diplomat said, adding that it was Washington’s decision to suspend wider contacts with Moscow since February. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his US counterpart Antony Blinken spoke over the phone in late July, their first conversation since Russia’s military campaign began. The conversation occurred around the same time the US Senate unanimously passed a non-binding resolution that called for the State Department to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. The Kremlin said that such a move would only further strain the relations between the countries."
2022-08-13,https://www.rt.com/news/560772-ukraine-eu-west-aid/,Ukraine struggles to find money to pay troops – WSJ,"With Western financial help apparently slow to arrive, Ukraine has been forced to print money to pay its troops in the fight against Russia, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko told the US outlet that it’s “a constant headache” for him to keep balancing the cost of the conflict and the lower tax revenues in an economy battered by almost half a year of fighting. With around 60% of the budget being spent on the fighting, the minister said he has had to cut all unnecessary expenditures. But it’s still not enough, as tax revenues only cover 40% of government spending, the WSJ reports. The Kiev authorities earlier said they needed $5 billion per month to run the country, and would not be able to cope without Western help. However, the grants and loans pledged to Ukraine by its foreign backers have been arriving slower than expected, according to the journal. For example, the EU has so far provided only €1 billion out of €9 billion it promised to Kiev, with Germany resisting the idea of offering low-interest loans backed by guarantees from the bloc’s member states. According to Marchenko, a lot of his time at work is spent trying to persuade Western governments to act faster. “Without this money, the war will last longer and it will damage economies more,” he explained. Rostislav Shurma, an economic adviser to President Vladimir Zelensky, described the situation in harsher terms. If Kiev acted as sluggishly at the West, “the Russians would be at the Polish border by now,” he told the WSJ. “They don’t feel the war. That’s the problem. The only thing they feel in the EU is high prices,” Shurma said. Due to the lack of funds, the Ukrainian Central Bank has no choice but to print more money to allow the government to pay the troops and purchase arms and ammunition in order to keep fighting. This approach has been weakening Ukraine’s national currency, the hryvnia, which has already lost 30% since the launch of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, prompting a major spike in inflation. But this is a sacrifice that Marchenko is willing to make: “we have to worry about winning the war. It is better to risk high inflation than not to pay soldiers’ salaries.” He also said the conflict will likely be prolonged, and this must be factored in as well. “This is a war of attrition. You have to think in these terms, to think about 2022 and 2023. It’s a marathon.” Earlier this week, Sergey Kiriyenko, the deputy head of the administration of the Russian president, accused the authorities in Kiev of selling out their own people to fight on behalf of NATO. “NATO will gladly fight against Russia ‘to the last Ukrainian’ as they say themselves without hesitance. Why not? They don’t feel sorry about it,” Kiriyenko said."
2022-08-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/560690-five-days-war-georgia-russia-2008/,How the ambitions of a small country's US-backed leader launched the current confrontation between Russia and the West,"Combat units of the Russian army, using old Soviet tanks that kept breaking down, made their way across mountain ranges. Their mission was to rescue a small group of peacekeepers encircled by the enemy and put an end to the shelling of a small town nestled deep in the Caucasus Mountains. The Russian troops didn’t carry any advanced weapons; they even lacked adequate military communications – and yet, thanks to high morale, they made the enemy surrender in just five days. This, in broad strokes, is the 2008 war in South Ossetia – one of the many territorial conflicts sparked by the collapse of the Soviet Union. To Moscow, this conflict was of special significance: not only did it mark the beginning of Russia's current confrontation with the West, but it also prompted a sweeping modernization of the Russian army. The Soviet Union collapsed over 30 years ago, exposing multiple simmering conflicts that had previously been kept dormant by the repressive apparatus of the state. With the dissolution of the USSR, many of these deep-rooted conflicts resurfaced, followed by numerous fresh disputes. Only a handful of them have been successfully resolved in the past 30 years. The vast majority remain ‘in stasis,’ liable to erupt at any moment, with unpredictable consequences. At the center of one of these conflicts were the Ossetians, a people living on both sides of the Greater Caucasus mountain range. They make up the majority of the population in Russia’s Republic of North Ossetia. There is, however, another sizeable community in South Ossetia, a densely populated territory separated from its northern counterpart. In the 19th century, the territories of the North Caucasus, including those of the future Georgian state, were incorporated into the Russian Empire. At that time, collective Georgian statehood was in its infancy, and the Russian empire, like any other empire, would not tolerate even bringing up the idea of separatism. It all changed after the Russian Civil War. As part of the newly formed Soviet Union, Georgia existed as a patchwork of the core plus three autonomous regions (Abkhazia, Adjara and South Ossetia) and multiple other areas (not given their own separate status) populated by Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The South Ossetian autonomous region was a backwater province, quiet and undisturbed, with Georgians and the Ossetians living alongside each other. This region was and still is a small one with an area of 50x50 km and a population of less than 50,000, most of whom live in the region's only city, Tskhinval. Unfortunately for Georgia, when the Soviet Union collapsed, a man named Zviad Gamsakhurdia became its first president. He was utterly obsessed with nationalist ideas. At the same time, a movement for national autonomy gained momentum in Ossetia. Gamsakhurdia branded the Ossetians “trash” and attempted to launch a punitive expedition into the region. His plans failed, however, as neither the Georgian nationalists nor the local militia had any experience of real combat. In the early 90's, a short-lived and pointless but bloody war ended in negotiations. South Ossetia declared itself a republic; Georgia refused to recognize it, but the conflict was put on ice, and a Russian peacekeeping battalion was deployed in the region at the consent of both sides. The following 15 years were uneventful – South Ossetia is, after all, a small region hidden deep in the mountains. It maintained contact with its sister republic of North Ossetia through the only road that led north via the Roki tunnel. The republic had no natural resources of major significance, and the great powers of the world had no interest in it whatsoever. But then, in the early 2000s, a young and ambitious Mikhail Saakashvili became Georgia’s third president, launching massive reforms and changing the country’s outlook to pro-Western and, most of all, pro-American. While Saakashvili managed to jump-start the economy to a degree, to the point that Georgia briefly became the poster child for a successful westernization, he had other interests, too, and they included restoring Georgia’s territorial integrity. The dissolution of the Soviet Union, followed by a number of local civil conflicts, had left the former Georgian SSR lacking a few territories. South Ossetia and Abkhazia had proclaimed their independence, and on top of that Tbilisi lost control of Adjara, an area of importance in the country’s southwestern corner, as well as the Pankisi Gorge and the Kodori Valley. Saakashvili began building a reformed army to achieve the goal of bringing back the provinces that had gone rogue. Georgian troops were trained by the US and its NATO partners. The president stuck to his westernization policy with regards to the army too. Georgia increased its military spending to 9.5% of GDP, which is extremely high – more typical for a nation in a state of war. What’s interesting is that the US didn’t see any of that as important or necessary, although it was happy to take Georgia under its wing. It was rather Saakashvili’s personal project. He obviously wanted to enter history as the man who restored Georgia in every possible sense of the word. In his speeches, he liked to mention conquests and heroes of the past, going back to the Middle Ages. Besides, the problem of Georgian refugees was a real one: the violent armed conflicts that broke out in the 1990s had driven many from their homes, and they never got the chance to return. Adjara didn’t put up any resistance and was reunited with Georgia peacefully. The Pankisi Gorge and the Kodori Valley followed suit. South Ossetia and Abkhazia, however, presented a challenge. Both were self-proclaimed republics that had announced their independence from Georgia and had armed forces of their own. Russia had been supportive of both republics ever since, providing military, political, and financial aid. The attempted negotiations between Georgia and the republics failed, since the violence committed by both sides in the 1990s was a major stumbling block. That’s when Mikhail Saakashvili decided it was time for a military operation. Believe it or not, neither of the patron states of the involved parties wanted a war – neither Russia nor the United States. Thanks to documents leaked by the WikiLeaks project, we know that American diplomats considered Moscow’s concerns about a possible military move on the part of Saakashvili nothing but a case of paranoia. Some experts even believe that the United States simply never consolidated its official position in regard to Saakashvili’s ambitious plans, while the president might have misinterpreted the somewhat ambivalent signals coming from Washington as a sign of support and a green light for his project of a lifetime. One big problem was that a Russian peacekeeping force was permanently deployed in South Ossetia and that Moscow had made it clear it wasn’t going to tolerate an attack. It seemed impossible for Saakashvili to simply go ahead and challenge Moscow, but he had a sort of plan. Knowing that the only road connecting South Ossetia and Russia goes over the Main Caucasian Range, making it impossible to deliver any significant reinforcements fast, Saakashvili placed his bet on taking control of the Roki Tunnel, a key passage point on that road, thus cutting off the peacekeeper force and forcing it to capitulate. He was going to rely on this advantage. South Ossetia couldn’t boast any significant military force. Whatever troops it had were commanded by an experienced Russian colonel, Anatoly Barankevich. Most of the fighters, however, didn’t have any military training or experience and lacked proper munitions, let alone artillery or armored vehicles. The republic relied heavily on Russia’s support. Since earlier in the summer of 2008, the sides had occasionally exchanged fire on the border between South Ossetia and Georgia. Tskhinval (the Ossetian name for the country’s capital, Georgians used to call it Tskhinvali) is very close to the border – only a few hundred meters separate it from the nearest Georgian village. The republic began to evacuate women and children. On the night of August 7, Tskhinval came under shell fire. Apparently, the Georgian reconnaissance units didn’t do a very good job, because the Ossetian militia fighters were hardly affected. Refugees began to flee Tskhinval. The Russians were blocked at their base and kept firing. They were able to destroy a Georgian tank, but that was the only tactical victory at that point. Over ten peacekeepers were killed, and the rest had to retreat to the basement. The Georgian plan began to malfunction on August 8. Two brigades tried to enter Tskhinval from different sides but came under fire and suffered significant losses. Colonel Brankevich, the militia commander, personally stopped one tank with a grenade launcher. Its crew is still considered missing in action – the ammunition exploded and practically turned the personnel into ash. Brankevich’s soldiers burned down a few more vehicles. At that time, the Russian military were quickly entering the republic from the north. It had become clear a few months before the events that Saakashvili was going to launch an attack, and South Ossetia had formed combat groups to prepare for it. The Georgians failed to take over Tskhinval on the first day, and now chaotic and violent street battles were raging. Nervous breakdowns and incompetence kill people faster than a premeditated crime. The Georgian soldiers mostly just shot everywhere. A scene like something out of a comedy sketch occurred in one building. The Georgians destroyed the gate with their gunfire, stormed the house and stumbled on a stunned elderly couple. “What are you doing here?” the officer asked. “We live here,” was the obvious answer. The gob-smacked warriors had no other choice but to leave. At the same time Russian jets began to bomb Georgian troops deployed to Tskhinval. The Georgians failed to get to the Roki Tunnel or destroy the Gufta bridge, which they tried to do in order to cut off enemy reinforcements. The road leading north was flooded with refugees, while Russian soldiers were moving in the opposite direction. The Russian army was in bad shape in 2008. A significant number of vehicles were lost along the way – some of them were simply pushed off the cliffs, so that they wouldn’t block the road. Communication systems were awful, with officers often switching to their regular mobile phones. But morale was surprisingly high – the troops engaged in battles right away and were very effective. There was still a significant degree of chaos, however. On the whole, the Russians were able to gain momentum during the first two days. Several battalions entered South Ossetia – they unblocked the peacekeepers, while the Georgian troops suffered significant losses. The Russian army didn’t show much in the beginning, but proved effective against Georgian artillery, and new battalions kept arriving through the tunnel. The Russians lost a few jets, but overpowered the Georgian Air Force and air defense, and destroyed several missile boats in the Black Sea. The jets bombed Georgian targets near and behind the frontline, but sometimes they made mistakes and hit civilians along with the combatants. The Georgian army collapsed after August 10. In the 4th Brigade, for example, 2,000 staff were punished for desertion – several times more than the number of its killed and wounded. The Russians simply disarmed and let go a large Georgian force blocked in the west of the country. All of that while the Russian forces were still outnumbered. On August 11, Saakashvili visited the frontline near the town of Gori. There he suddenly tried to run away, fearing an air raid, when he heard a sound of a jet. His bodyguards were there to bring him to the ground, but the media managed to take a photo of the Georgian leader with a face distorted by fear. Soon he added to that image by chewing his tie during a live broadcast. Meanwhile, the West protested the “excessive use of force” by Russia, resulting in France’s Nicholas Sarkozy meeting then-president Dmitry Medvedev to negotiate a ceasefire. The hostilities stopped as rapidly as they had erupted. The Russian army pillaged Georgian military bases, taking home or destroying 65 tanks, 3,700 small arms and a plethora of other military equipment. The war was over. The fighting took the lives of over 60 Russian and 180 Georgian soldiers, 37 Ossetian militia fighters, and more than 300 Ossetian and 200 Georgian civilians. For Ossetia, with a population of just 50,000, the blow was especially hard. Russia soon recognized the independence of the Republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Today, they are tiny and rather poor nations effectively under Russia’s protection. The war in South Ossetia was a milestone for Moscow. It exposed the Russian army’s many problems and was enough to lay out a plan for improving the military. The victory over Georgia wasn’t thanks to the army’s combat effectiveness but rather thanks to the personal quality of its staff. The next few years saw Moscow conduct major reforms. The politicians, however, had a slightly different perspective. For the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia had flexed its muscles in the global arena. Within the country, the common take on the events was as follows: the West had used its vassal state to test how Russia would react to a great infringement upon its interests. It was the first time Moscow had actively fought back against Western pressure, or what felt like pressure. The tensions only heightened over the ensuing years. The key takeaway from the Five-Day War is that opportunism and recklessness can do more harm than scheming. The clueless pursuit of a single man’s ambition cost hundreds of lives. Those deaths could have been avoided had the politicians shown just a little more restraint and wisdom at the right time."
2022-08-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/560768-ukrainian-pows-exchange-russia/,Ukrainian POWs reluctant to be exchanged – Moscow,"Ukrainian soldiers that were captured as prisoners of war by Russia have decided to remain in the territory controlled by Moscow and allied forces, expressing reluctance to continue fighting, Russia’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Saturday. “Ukrainian prisoners of war belonging to the units of the Naval infantry, National Guard, air assault and ground forces chose to stay in the territory controlled by Russia because of their reluctance to fight and fear of being sent to the frontlines again,” the ministry wrote on its Telegram channel. The Defense Ministry said the Ukrainian POWs do not want to be used as “cannon fodder” and die on the battlefield while “carrying out criminal orders” issued by Kiev. The Russian military also posted a video of what appears to be an interview with a Ukrainian POW who said he laid down his arms voluntarily and turned himself in to the allied forces. According to the prisoner, he has been treated well and does not want to return to Ukraine as part of any future swaps. Few soldiers manage to surrender voluntarily due to a crackdown by Ukraine’s nationalist battalions, the ministry claimed, noting that the nationalists threaten to shoot any soldiers that seek to abandon their combat positions. According to the ministry, the POWs have told of rampant corruption among the Ukrainian ranks, the use of intimidation tactics by Kiev, and “barbaric treatment of civilians who are used by [the] nationalists as human shields on a regular basis.” Earlier this month, Moscow claimed that it scrupulously observes the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war, while Kiev’s forces have tortured, starved, and deprived of medical care Russian POWs. At the time, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Aleksandr Fomin also condemned the West’s unwillingness to hold Kiev accountable for these violations and crimes. In July, Moscow blamed Kiev, and Ukranian President Vladimir Zelensky personally, for the fatal shelling of a detention facility in the Donetsk People’s Republic. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, a missile strike using the US-made HIMARS multiple rocket launcher killed 50 Ukrainian POWs, injuring another 73."
2022-08-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/560766-west-ukraine-biolab-shift-blame/,West will brush Ukraine biolab allegations under the carpet just like those of Kosovo organ trafficking,"In crisis after crisis, Western narrative control kicks into overdrive to shift blame, whitewash culprits, or make sure inconvenient lines of questioning are never pursued Soon after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent descent on Taiwan, the Russian Foreign Ministry’s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, called out Nicholas Burns, America’s ambassador to China, for “keeping an embarrassed silence” regarding the “insolent stunt.” The silence was quite a change from how vocal Burns had been a mere month prior at the World Peace Forum in Beijing, where he demanded that China stop relaying “Russian propaganda” by “accusing NATO of starting” the conflict in Ukraine. He used the opportunity to accuse the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s spokesperson of “telling lies about American bioweapons labs, which do not exist in Ukraine.” But that was then and this is now in the West’s ‘rules-based order’, where each occasion requires a new set of rules. Thus, it goes without saying that, for the time being, Burns will also keep an ‘embarrassed silence’ about another potentially tectonic event – the latest, even more damning statement regarding alleged US-run biolabs in Ukraine made by the Russian Defense Ministry on August 4. Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops of the Russian Armed Forces, said Moscow was assessing the possibility of US involvement in the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as investigating US-funded research of various other pathogens. The reason for Burns’ silence is not difficult to guess – the serious allegations made in Kirillov’s presentation, if properly investigated and proven true, could serve as an indictment of what could be America’s use of Ukraine as a vast pathogen testing ground. And since the Western media mostly chose to ignore it, the ambassador was certainly not going to make a statement they would have to quote, drawing attention to the issue. And now that Twitter has suspended the Russian Foreign Ministry’s account for daring to quote key parts of Kirillov’s media presentation about the possible origins of Covid-19, Burns and company don’t have to say anything at all. If it’s memory-holed by the social media, then it’s as if it never happened. That’s the modus operandi of the Western elites – it’s not the truth that matters, but successfully managing the narrative so that it doesn’t leave room for doubt in people’s minds. In other words, they think they can do whatever they want. Perhaps we should remind ourselves of the post-Cold War Western formula announced during the heady days of the early 2000s, an era marked by another famous American political quote, Karl Rove’s “we’re an empire now and, when we act, we create our own reality.” As Tony Blair’s policy adviser, Robert Cooper, nonchalantly put it on the pages of The Guardian in April 2002: “The challenge to the postmodern world is to get used to the idea of double standards. Among ourselves, we operate on the basis of laws and open cooperative security. But when dealing with more old-fashioned kinds of states outside the postmodern continent of Europe, we need to revert to the rougher methods of an earlier era – force, pre-emptive attack, deception, whatever is necessary to deal with those who still live in the 19th century world of every state for itself. Among ourselves, we keep the law but when we are operating in the jungle, we must also use the laws of the jungle.” Two decades later, despite the rise of both China and Russia and the world’s inexorable evolution to multipolarity, imperial habits die hard – usually until they hit a wall of reality, as is currently happening in Ukraine and is bound to happen in Taiwan. But back to Burns for a moment. He’s far from new in enforcing double standards in the ‘jungle’. Before his present work on poking the Dragon regarding Taiwan, and the Bear regarding just about everything, he distinguished himself as a partisan and apologist of NATO’s illegal aggression against Serbia back in the 1990s, which resulted in Kosovo’s unilateral secession. Meanwhile, in 2009, when he was the US under-secretary of state for political affairs, Burns explained to the media that the recognition of Pristina’s independence was in fact an expression of the US’ “interest in good relations with Serbia.” Will he, in due time, express himself similarly vis-à-vis China and Taiwan? Outside the West, it’s all still a jungle to Burns and his ilk, and the ‘natives’ are to be dealt with accordingly. So, in Burns-talk, Pelosi’s Taiwan sojourn and pledge of continuing US support for the island is actually a sign of America’s interest in good relations with China. Another notable Anglo-American figure visible across the Kosovo-China-Ukraine crisis landscape is the Englishman Geoffrey Nice, who gained international notoriety as a prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), whose sole purpose was to shift the blame for the Western-inspired bloody breakup of that multinational country solely onto the Serbs. In addition to his selective prosecution of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for ‘crimes against humanity’, Nice’s ICTY legacy also includes accusations of destroying evidence related to human organ trafficking in Kosovo. Nice subsequently offered his legal services to former Kosovo President Hashim Thaci, one of the main figures in not just the trafficking but the alleged “forcible extraction” of human organs of still-living, mostly Serb prisoners, as outlined in a stunning Council of Europe 2011 report, ‘Inhuman treatment of people and illicit trafficking in human organs in Kosovo’. The report also cites anti-drug agencies of “at least five countries” as saying Thaci “exerted violent control over the trade in heroin and other narcotics.” Nice’s subsequent attempt to discredit the report was, however, brilliantly dissected and exposed by American journalist Diana Johnstone as the latest attempt by a representative of “self-righteous Western democracies” to reserve the privileges of a “culture of impunity” exclusively for themselves and their clients. Of course, the clients in the ‘jungle’ still have to pay for the imperial ‘double standards’ umbrella, so in the end, Nice reportedly accused Thaci of owing him “almost a half a million euros” for his work for the Kosovo government. Zakharova just recently more fully described the house of horrors over which Thaci allegedly presided: “Kosovo is the territory of ‘black’ transplantation. People were dissected alive, taking out internal organs for sale to those people in the West… In the West they stood in line for organ transplant operations. And they began to receive these organs when Kosovo turned into a terrible black hole in which people disappeared, who were not just killed, but killed to sell their internal organs.” To paraphrase Franklin D. Roosevelt’s immortal words justifying US support for Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, they may be sons of b****es, but they’re the West’s sons of b****es."
2022-08-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/560737-ukraine-promotion-english-language/,Ukraine eyes promotion of English language,"Ukraine’s Ministry of Culture and Information Policy is working on a draft law to grant a higher status to the English language, the ministry’s vice head Rostislav Karandeev said during a press briefing on Friday. “Ukraine is still largely separated from the EU and the rest of the world by a language barrier. A change in the status of the English language is a step that could solve that problem,” Karandeev told reporters. In order to grant the language “a higher status” and help Ukrainians master it, the ministry “has started working on a draft law that would ensure English is spoken [in the country] as a language of international communication,” the official added. That means, he explained, that in future all civil servants or law enforcement officers will have to be able to speak English. Even though Article 10 of Ukraine’s constitution states that the country’s government must promote “learning of languages of international communication,” that article – as well as the legal concept of such languages – is only referenced in a single law, Karandeev explained. The new bill will grant English the status of “language of international communication,” encouraging its promotion in the country, the official said. According to Karandeev, expanding the use of English will not only speed up Ukraine’s integration into the European community, but also help the country attract more investment and tourists “once we achieve our victory.” Language issues have long been a source of tension between Russia in Ukraine, far predating the current military conflict. Even though a significant portion of Ukraine’s population speaks Russian as a first language and uses it far more than Ukrainian, some voices – especially among the country’s nationalist movements – have been calling for its use to be restricted lest it eventually supplant Ukrainian. In July 2012, Ukraine’s parliament adopted a law titled “On the principles of the state language policy,” which granted Russian and other minority languages regional status, meaning they could be used in courts, schools and other government institutions in areas where ethnic minorities exceeded 10% of the total population. However, after the 2014 Maidan revolution, Ukrainian lawmakers demanded that the law be reviewed by the country’s Constitutional Court, arguing it went against the same Article 10 which also stipulates that the government must ensure the development and functioning of the Ukrainian language in all spheres of social life throughout the entire territory of Ukraine. In 2018, the court finally ruled the law unconstitutional. Instead, in April 2019, the Ukrainian parliament voted for a new, wide-ranging piece of legislation called “On ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language.” The law made Ukrainian compulsory in many fields, including public administration, media, and education. While it provided some exemptions for the Crimean Tatar language, other languages of indigenous peoples of Ukraine, as well as English and the other official languages of the EU, Russian, Belarusian and Yiddish were not granted such exemptions. Since the start of Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine on February 24, restrictions on the Russian language and culture have been picking up pace. In June, the country’s parliament banned Russian music."
2022-08-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/560725-estonia-finland-baltic-nato/,NATO states mull closing Baltic for Russian Navy,"Tallinn and Helsinki have discussed the integration of coastal missile batteries that would enable the two Western states to blockade the Russian Navy in the Gulf of Finland, Estonia’s defense minister announced on Friday. This would turn the Baltic Sea into a “NATO internal sea,” the official said, echoing comments made earlier by Polish and Lithuanian leaders. Finland has applied to join the US-led military bloc. “We need to integrate our coastal defenses. The flight range of Estonian and Finnish missiles is greater than the width of the Gulf of Finland,” Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur told the Finnish newspaper Iltalehti. Finland’s MTO85M coastal missiles have a range of over 100 kilometers. The Gulf is about 82 kilometers across from Helsinki to Tallinn. Estonia plans to buy Israeli Blue Spear missiles later this year, which have a range of almost 300 kilometers. “The Baltic Sea will be NATO’s internal sea when Finland and Sweden have joined NATO. Compared with what it is today, the situation is changing,” Pevkur said, adding that the two countries will then be able to close the sea to the Russian Navy if need be. The applications of Finland and Sweden to join NATO were met with the greatest enthusiasm by Poland and the former Soviet republics on the Baltic Sea. Following the alliance’s summit in Spain at the end of June, Polish President Andrzej Duda and Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics both said they hoped for the Baltic to become a “NATO lake.” Pevkur said he discussed airspace with his Finnish colleague as well, though he dodged Iltalehti’s question whether the US will deploy its F-35 fighter jets to Estonia. “For me, this is one airspace,” Pevkur added. “Finnish airspace cannot be protected if Estonian airspace is not protected at the same time, and vice versa. Fighter jets cross the 80-kilometer-wide Gulf of Finland in minutes.” Estonia has been one of the most outspoken NATO members in urging a confrontation with Russia. On Thursday, Tallinn announced that it would ban entry to Russians with EU Schengen visas starting next week, and demolish all Soviet-era monuments “as soon as possible.”"
2022-08-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/560727-medvedev-prediction-zelensky-future/,Medvedev makes prediction about Zelensky,"Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky will have only two options in the end - facing a court martial or going back to his acting career, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev claimed, in an email interview published Friday. “[It will be either] a court martial or a return to supporting roles in comedy shows,” Medvedev told Russian journalist Nadana Fridrikhson, when prompted about Zelensky’s possible outcomes. Medvedev, who is now the deputy head of Russia’s National Security Council, previously called Zelensky “an unshaved fellow wearing a green shirt” and compared him to Adolf Hitler after the Ukrainian president urged Western countries to close their borders to all Russian nationals. Before becoming president of Ukraine, Zelensky was a comedian and actor. From 2015 to 2019, he played a high-school history teacher who unexpectedly became president of Ukraine in a TV series called ‘Servant of the People.’ After entering into politics, Zelensky named his party after the TV show. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/560728-ukraine-german-howitzers-broken/,Most German howitzers in Ukraine out of order – MP,"Most German PzH 2000 howitzers that have been supplied to Ukraine by the West have already broken down and are in need of repair, according to German Bundestag member Marcus Faber, who recently visited Ukraine. In a Wednesday interview with the German news outlet NTV, the politician claimed he was surprised to learn from Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense that only five of the 15 German-made PzH 2000 howitzers supplied to Ukraine by Berlin and Amsterdam were still operational. He added that the cause of the failures was not Russian fire, but the fact that the guns were “massively used” by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. While Kiev has yet to officially confirm Faber’s statements, it was reported last month by Der Spiegel that Ukraine had informed Germany that a number of PzH 2000 howitzers were malfunctioning after extensive use. According to the outlet, the German Ministry of Defense believed the issues may have resulted from high intensity firing, which may have impacted the artillery round loading mechanism. Der Spiegel said 100 shots a day was considered a “high level of shooting intensity” for the howitzer. Faber also stated that Kiev had requested more spare parts for the weapons and was “optimistic” that it could bring the howitzers back into working order. He noted that while Germany had already supplied Ukraine with spare parts packages, not all of them were “the right ones.” He pointed out that spare parts were not always enough and that larger repairs required special workshops, meaning the Ukrainians could only carry out minor repairs themselves. According to Faber, Kiev has already requested help in building their own repair facilities in order to avoid having to send the howitzers out of the country for maintenance. Germany has so far supplied Kiev with ten PzH 2000 howitzers while another five were provided by the Netherlands, who have promised another three. Meanwhile, German arms manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann struck a deal with the Ukrainian government in late July that would see the firm produce and supply Kiev with some 100 PzH 2000 howitzers, according to a Der Spiegel report. A company spokesperson was quoted as stating that the arms deal was worth $1.72 billion – almost triple the cost of all military aid Berlin has sent to Kiev’s forces since Russia launched its military operation in late February. However, Faber has pointed out that these 100 howitzers will not be delivered to Ukraine before the end of next year and has called on Berlin to send Kiev weapons out of its own reserves, which could then be replenished by Ukrainian order. Germany has previously supplied Ukrainian forces with thousands of portable anti-tank and anti-air missiles, tens of thousands of anti-tank mines, as well as millions of rounds of ammunition. However, Kiev and even the former Ukrainian ambassador to Germany have still criticized Berlin for what they called reluctance to send military aid to Ukraine and the slow pace of deliveries. Moscow has repeatedly warned the West against sending weapons to Kiev, saying it only prolongs the conflict and increases the number of casualties."
2022-08-12,https://www.rt.com/news/560720-czech-russian-visa-ban/,EU presidency advocates ‘straightforward signal’ to Russians,"The Czech government will push for an EU-wide ban on Russian travelers during a ministerial summit in late August, the country’s foreign minister, Jan Lipavsky, has said. The proposal is aimed at adding to the list of sanctions imposed on Russia over its military operation in Ukraine. Prague currently holds the bloc's rotating presidency. “We are convinced as a government that halting visas for ordinary Russian citizens gives a very clear and straightforward signal to Russian society,” Lipavsky told Politico magazine on Thursday. He said Russians “should realize that such a militant policy has consequences.” The politician said he would propose the measure at a meeting of EU foreign ministers on August 31 in Prague. “We are trying to explain to our partners that the approach is justified and effective,” Lipavsky said. He also argued that a visa ban could help “decrease the influence of the Russian secret service in the EU.” The European bloc has been imposing sanctions and cutting ties with Moscow since Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February. Prague stopped accepting visa applications from Russian citizens shortly after the hostilities began. Latvia stopped issuing visas to nearly all Russians earlier this month, citing security concerns. Estonia said on Thursday it would do the same, as well as banning Russian citizens who hold Estonian visas from entering the country from August 18. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas urged EU member states last week to stop issuing tourist visas to Russians. “Visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right,” she stated. Berlin, however, opposes a full ban on issuing visas to Russians. “Contacts with civil society, especially its part that it is open to the EU and critical of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, remains important,” the German Foreign Ministry said in a statement to newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Thursday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also voiced skepticism about a blanket ban, citing “very far-reaching sanctions” imposed on Russia and saying that a visa ban would weaken their effectiveness “if it was directed against everyone, including innocent people.” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba, meanwhile, backed the banning of all Russians from entering the EU. “Let Russian tourists enjoy Russia,” he wrote on Twitter. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the calls to ban all Russians from traveling to the EU were signs of “flagrant nationalism” and xenophobia. “I think common sense will take action over time, and those making such statements will come to their senses,” Dmity Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said on the matter this week."
2022-08-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/560714-ukraine-mineral-reserves-deindustrialization/,Ukraine may have to close down industries – WaPo,"Ukraine has lost “the building blocks of its economy” and may find it difficult to exist as an industrialized nation in the aftermath of the conflict with Russia, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday. The warning came in a feature article based on an analysis of the value of Ukraine’s hydrocarbons and valuable minerals which have come under Russian control amid the protracted conflict. Russia controls over $12 trillion-worth of the resources that used to be under Kiev’s jurisdiction before 2014, according to SecDev, an Ottawa-based analytical firm. WaPo said coal accounts for the lions’ share of the sum. Some 30 billion tons of hard coal deposits with an estimated commercial value of $11.9 trillion were identified by the Canadian researchers, the newspaper reported. “The worst scenario is that Ukraine … becomes more like one of the Baltic states, a nation unable to sustain its industrial economy,” Stanislav Zinchenko, chief executive of the Kiev-based economic think tank GMK, told the newspaper. A senior Ukrainian official with the nation’s Geological Survey told WaPo that the lost reserve may be worth even more than the estimate. SecDev, which counts various Western governments and organizations like US AID among its partners, warned that Russia’s seizure of Ukrainian natural wealth would have a profound impact on the European economic future, too. “Unless they can rapidly diversify oil and gas sources and shift to renewables and nuclear, European countries will remain dangerously dependent on Russian hydrocarbons,” it said. “Similarly, Europe will also remain highly dependent on China for rare earths, a country that already supplies the region with 98% of its current supply,” it added, referring to plans in the EU to have Ukraine develop rare-earth mineral extraction on its soil. Heavy metals like neodymium, crucial for many modern technologies, are relatively abundant in earth crust but their extraction and refining are associated with serious environmental impact. For historic reasons, China became the world-leading producer of rare earths. WaPo journalists toured a mine operated by a Ukrainian company, which, the newspaper said, conditioned the visit on an agreement not to reveal the site’s location or the surnames of workers. Extracting the fuel “has become an act of patriotism” for the workers, the report said, adding that “should the towns between the mine and the front lines fall, there is little to separate the Russian troops from [them].” The story includes multiple photos of people working at the mine, with their faces clearly visible in some. It’s not uncommon for Western officials and media to highlight potential wealth hidden in foreign nations that the US and its allies risk losing access to. During NATO’s withdrawal from Afghanistan a year ago, Pentagon officials and many news outlets cited the estimated $1 trillion to $3 trillion worth of minerals in the possession of the south-central Asian country. Those include copper, lithium, rare-earth elements, gemstones and other valuables."
2022-08-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/560711-radiation-levels-zaporozhye-nuclear-plant/,Radiation threat assessed around nuclear site ‘attacked by Ukraine’,"The Russian-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant did not sustain any critical damage as a result of shelling by Ukrainian forces this week, according to Vladimir Rogov, a member of the region’s military-civil administration. In terms of nuclear safety, everything is in order in the vicinity of the plant and background radiation levels are normal, Rogov said on Friday in an interview with Rossiya-24 news channel. “The operation of the reactors was not disrupted as a result of the shelling,” he explained. However, the official noted that the attack had destroyed part of a building belonging to the region’s emergency services and one of the shells landed just ten meters away from a radioactive waste storage site. Rogov claimed that the specific division of the Ukrainian Armed Forces responsible for the attack had been identified, and suggested that it had used Western-supplied ammunition. “It was the terrorists from the 44th artillery brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, militants of Zelensky. They fired from Nikopol with 152-millimeter guns, with the intent to strike the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant,” Rogov stated. His assessment of who was responsible for the attack has been corroborated by the Russian Defense Ministry, which released a statement on Thursday, claiming that the attack carried out by Kiev’s 44th artillery brigade had partially damaged a thermal power plant and equipment used for cooling the nuclear reactors. “Only thanks to the skillful, competent and effective actions of the units of the Russian Armed Forces to cover the nuclear power facility, the critical infrastructure of the nuclear power plant was not damaged and the operation of the reactors was not disrupted,” the ministry added. The Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, which is considered to be the largest of its kind in Europe, was seized by Russian forces in late February, when Moscow launched its military operation in the neighboring country. The facility continues to operate with Ukrainian staff under Russian control. According to the Russian military, Ukrainian forces have repeatedly fired artillery and rockets at the plant since late July, and have allegedly used drones to strike at the facility. Moscow has described Kiev’s actions as “nuclear terrorism.” Kiev has in turn claimed that Russia was the one targeting the plant in an alleged plot to discredit Ukraine and has insisted that Moscow has been using the facility as a military base, keeping troops and heavy weapons there. Russia’s permanent representative to the UN Vassily Nebenzia has in response insisted that “basic logic” suggests that Moscow has no reason to target the facility or its own troops who control it. Addressing a UN Security Council briefing on Thursday, the diplomat stated that “strikes were launched from heavy artillery and MLRS located on the Dnieper’s right bank,” the Ukrainian-held territory in Dnepropetrovsk Region. He added that the Ukrainian Armed Forces were targeting “concrete-protected storages of radioactive waste”. If a nuclear disaster does occur as a result of the shelling, all responsibility will be on “the Western sponsors of the Kiev regime,” Nebenzia said. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that the situation at the plant was under control and that there was “no immediate danger” to its safety. At the same time, he called reports his agency received from Russia and Ukraine “contradictory” and urged both sides to provide the IAEA access to the facility “as soon as possible.”"
2022-08-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/560484-ukraine-corruption-weapon-trafficking/,Afghanistan all over again: Ukraine’s rampant corruption means the Western supply of weapons is likely to eventually backfire,"Viewed from afar, the extent of Ukrainian corruption appears to go far deeper than the recent shift in the narrative might suggest, and it might come back to bite the West as weapons sent to Kiev's forces are disappearing with no account as to their whereabouts. Just as it was with America’s support for the Mujahideen in the 1980s in fighting a proxy war against the Soviets, its backing of the Ukrainian government may one day reap a whirlwind. And just like its involvement in Afghanistan, decades ago, supporting the ‘enemy of my enemy’ involves dealing with shady characters and whitewashing their wrongdoings. Following the onset of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, the media very abruptly ceased its coverage of Ukraine’s seedy political underbelly – with dirty dealings that go all the way to the top. Even America’s sweetheart, Vladimir Zelensky, did not come away unscathed in those reports. Just months prior to the conflict, mainstream publications, such as The Guardian, were reporting on Zelensky’s offshore connections, as exposed by the Pandora Papers. As detailed in the report, Zelensky, who campaigned for office on an anti-corruption platform, failed to disclose the extent of his offshore assets and his connections to some of the very oligarchs he promised to strip of political influence – and continued to treat everything as ‘business as usual’ once he came to power. Fast forward to the present day: Zelensky is a squeaky clean beacon of strength and icon of liberal democracy. Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called him a “hero,” and numerous celebrities have appeared alongside the Ukrainian leader in photo ops to promote his image. But for all the pomp and grandeur surrounding Zelensky, the issue of Ukraine’s corruption is once again rearing its head. Reality is setting in for many in the West – much of the funds and armaments directed towards Ukraine’s military are going unaccounted for, and average Americans and Europeans are paying the price for it. Literally. It’s one thing for a politician to walk back on campaign promises, but Zelensky’s apparent corruption is becoming a liability for his Western supporters. Ukrainian-born US congresswoman Victoria Spartz, one of the loudest cheerleaders for calling on the US government to support Ukraine, has been blowing the whistle on the Ukrainian authorities, including Zelensky. As detailed by CNN last week, Spartz has leveled numerous accusations against the Ukrainian government, drawing attention to its deep-seated corruption – and she’s asking questions about where all the funds are going. But her peers in Congress are reportedly tired of her “bellicose rhetoric,” arguing that her questions are making Ukraine look bad. After all, Zelensky’s image as a clean politician is one that needs to be preserved if members of Congress, especially those with personal stakes in defense contractors, want to keep milking the American taxpayer for continued support towards the proxy war against Russia. But a facade as shaky as Zelensky’s can only be maintained for so long. With the economy spiraling into recession and inflation at record highs in both the US and UK, among other NATO countries, there’s only so much politicians are willing to do to maintain the narrative, especially as numerous US Democrats are struggling to hold onto their seats in the upcoming midterm elections. Spartz isn’t alone in her criticism of the Ukrainian government and its corruption. CBS published a documentary called ‘Arming Ukraine’ detailing how much of America’s military aid to Ukraine has disappeared. Jonas Ohman, founder of the nonprofit Blue-Yellow, provides an assessment in the documentary that only as little as 30% of the military aid sent by the US ever reached the front lines. The CBS documentary prompted a massive backlash from Ukraine’s loudest supporters on social media, with many demanding that the channel retract the report – all because it made Ukraine look bad. And CBS capitulated, putting out a retraction to state that the information was old and that the “delivery has improved.” The documentary is being “updated” accordingly. It’s anyone's guess whether CBS got the call from on high, or if it simply caved in to the demands of Twitter users with Ukrainian flags in their profile. Regardless of the retraction, the concerns are valid and echo those raised by US intelligence sources who told CNN in April that Washington has no idea where the weapons it’s sending are actually ending up. “We have fidelity for a short time, but when it enters the fog of war, we have almost zero,” said one of the sources. “It drops into a big black hole, and you have almost no sense of it at all after a short period of time.” Even more recently, in July, NATO and EU states demanded accountability from Ukraine for the weapons flowing into the country, noting that everything from MANPADs and rifle ammunition, to armored vehicles aren’t being properly tracked – if at all. The Financial Times reported that NATO states called on Kiev’s leadership to establish detailed inventory lists and tracking for weapons supplied by the West. “All these weapons land in southern Poland, get shipped to the border and then are just divided up into vehicles to cross: trucks, vans, sometimes private cars,” sa Western official told the FT. “And from that moment we go blank on their location and we have no idea where they go, where they are used or even if they stay in the country.” Such an assessment belies CBS’ new claim that “delivery has improved,” which would not account for the billions in munitions and military aid sent to Ukraine since the onset of the conflict. Apart from highly-regulated armaments such as the US’ state-of-the-art HIMARS mobile artillery pieces, much of the weaponry sent to Ukraine has simply disappeared into a black hole – a fact made evident by concerns raised by Swedish police who warned that “there is probably a high risk that flows of illegal weapons will enter Sweden.” With so little accountability about where any of the weapons are going, and an unwillingness to face the facts, the West may stand to face something akin to a renewal of the War on Terror, especially with existing threats such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS already in the process of regrouping and rebuilding – and potentially rearming with Western weapons. Meanwhile, with the training provided to radical neo-Nazi extremists such as the Azov Battalion to combat the Russians, the West’s concerns with white supremacy may become manifest in something more than a few racist trolls on social media. And it’s all because the politicians needed their anti-Russian stand-in state to appear as a dishonestly presented posterboy for ‘liberalism’ and ‘democracy’."
2022-08-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/560709-estonia-parliament-absurd-visa/,MEP blasts ‘absurd’ visa ban on Russians,"The Estonian government’s move to ban entry for Russians with Schengen visas issued by the Baltic nation makes Tallinn look “a little weak-minded,” Yana Toom, member of the European Parliament from the Estonian Center Party, said on Thursday. As part of sanctions against Russia over its offensive in Ukraine, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said visiting the bloc is “a privilege, not a human right” for tourists, and urged the EU to bar Russians from receiving Schengen visas. On Thursday, Tallinn confirmed it would close its borders to Russian nationals with Schengen visas issued by the Baltic nation, starting next week. In an interview with Russian-language TV Channel ETV+, Toom called the move “absurd.” The MEP explained that as Estonia “cannot make decisions for the entire Schengen area” and has no right to ban Russians with visas issued by other Schengen states, the only thing Tallinn can do is to effectively invalidate its own visas. “I think we look a little weak-minded in this, but nevertheless this is the idea,” the MEP said. She said the Estonian authorities are now trying “to push through the European Council” the idea of a total Schengen ban for Russia, but in her opinion, “the idea is not pushable.” “Because there is a legislative definition of the sanctions regime, it has goals, stated goals, such as to maintain or restore peace, maintain democracy, and so on, I just can’t figure out in my small head how a ban on entry for Russians will restore peace in Ukraine. It just doesn’t fit in my head,” Toom said. The politician added that she sees no logic in her government’s push to “kick out” some groups of Russians living in Estonia, by halting the issuance of residence permits. “A lot of people came to us. We say that we condemn Putin’s regime, that you should not live there with this, and when people leave, we throw them back. There is absolutely no logic here,” the European Parliament member said, adding that there is no explanation for such initiatives other than the politicians’ wish to get more votes. The MEP also warned fellow Estonians of the retaliation they can expect from Moscow. “It all has another side, there will be reciprocity, we will not get to Russia. And one thing is that we are missing is St Petersburg and the Hermitage, but we also have Pechory [an area in Russia’s Pskov Region] where many people own property, homes… we can now say goodbye to it,” she said. On Thursday, a spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, when asked to comment on Tallinn’s initiatives, told journalists that while “countries have a right to implement their own visa policies,” the UN is against discrimination. Despite numerous calls from Ukraine, Estonia, Finland and Poland to impose a complete EU tourist visa ban on Russians, Germany and the EU officials have been skeptical of the idea so far. German chancellor Olaf Scholz cited “very far-reaching sanctions” imposed on Russia and said that a visa ban would weaken their effectiveness “if it was directed against everyone, including innocent people.” A spokeswoman for the European Commission, in turn, said that a total ban would be simply unlawful, as each application must be considered individually."
2022-08-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/560702-collapse-of-20th-century-crisis/,Fyodor Lukyanov: Collapse of the 20th century order means the world is in a very dangerous place,"Taiwan has been in the global spotlight this month. More specifically, attentions are fixed on US-China relations in connection with the confusing and ambiguous interpretation of the island's status. This fudge has underpinned the interaction between Washington and Beijing for 50 years. The agreement to combine the legal (Taiwan is a province of China) and de facto (Taiwan is an independent territory) state of affairs was an elegant innovation in the early 1970s. It paved the way for the development of very intensive relations between the two giant powers, first politically and then economically. The premise was a tacit agreement on the strange nature of the island's borders – real and imaginary at the same time. Now the time has come when the agreement is no longer valid. The whole history of international relations is about one side establishing borders and another trying to cross them. Both literally and figuratively. There has been no century when borders have remained immutable, at least in the spaces where international politics were concentrated at the time. And it is clear that redrawing the dividing lines has never been without the use of force, sometimes on a very large scale. The end of the twentieth century gave the impression – or the illusion – that geopolitical customs had changed. The previous 100 years were turbulent, including world wars and decolonisation – with the formation of dozens of new states. By the 1970s, however, there was a relative balance. The colonial empires came to terms with their own and others' borders. In Europe, the centre of political tension, an agreement was reached, the expression of which was the Helsinki Final Act. This was in fact a division of spheres of influence between the USSR and the USA, with the recognition of existing borders – formal (state) and informal (political). The second part contained a nuance: Moscow’s consent to general humanitarian principles, opened a loophole. It played a prominent role in subsequent processes, particularly in aggravating the crisis of the Soviet system. The latter, without a doubt, fell victim to its own problems, but there was also an external catalyst that spurred internal civic activity. Those accords marked an important milestone in formulating the rules of the game. The sides agreed not to seek to attempt to change state borders by classical force, among other things. Since then, the confrontation has evolved into attempts to shift boundaries invisibly – mentally and ideologically. The US and its allies have been more successful. The late and post-Cold War period was a time of the powerful spread of Western influence over its former opponents. National boundaries were also changed, but more moderately than might have been the case, given the scale of what was happening. And with relatively limited violence. These few decades gave rise to the view that the political geography would not change again, even if many of the borders were illogical from a historical or strategic point of view. But an important fact was not taken into account. The agreements on the inviolability of the dividing lines were negotiated in the context of an approximate balance of power. The end of the Cold War eliminated this and could not but shake the whole system of arrangements. However, things were not static, and the situation has been shifting from complete domination by the West to a greater diversity of influences. It is not only the situation in Europe that has changed. Globalisation has turned the whole world into a stage for action – far more than it was in the twentieth century. Everything has become closely intertwined. But the European principles agreed in the last quarter of the twentieth century have not been valid worldwide, including in relation to borders. Anyway, the old system has stopped working. What we are witnessing in 2022 demonstrates how the problem of borders is returning in a very classical way. The cunning compromise of the 1970s to recognise/non-recognise Taiwan could only work if there was a clear balance of interests. This arrangement has collapsed and the problem has come to the fore in the most dangerous way – a blatant ambiguity in the interpretation of the political and legal status of the extremely important territory. Today there are already calls (quietly so far) for a new Helsinki-style security conference. It is time, they say, to agree on new rules. The idea is obvious, but it does not seem realistic at the moment, because the treaty did not establish the status quo, rather it fixed it. There is nothing to solve now – everything is in flux. Helsinki covered a big space – the Euro-Atlantic – but still a limited one. Now the place of action is the whole world, and there are so many players with different interests that it is not even methodologically clear how to take it all into account. The CSCE (later the OSCE), established in 1975, was built on the principle of international regulatory institutions, which were in their heyday at the time. They are all in decline now and new ones are not emerging. And, of course, there was a desire for stabilisation back then. Today, there is no sign of it; the focus is on achieving goals by force. The conclusion is simple – there are no magic remedies. The world is in a dangerous phase that requires all major actors to be extremely cautious and to be able to accurately understand the consequences of their actions. And there is no other form of international system for the foreseeable future. Everyone is talking about it. But still they continue to act as they wish. So, the penny hasn’t dropped yet. Let’s hope that it does before it’s too late."
2022-08-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/560678-us-zaporozhye-nuclear-demilitarized/,US backs Ukrainian call over nuclear plant,"The US State Department on Thursday officially endorsed Ukraine’s demand for a demilitarized zone around the Zaporozhye nuclear power power plant (ZNPP), calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops that control the area. The statement came as the UN Security Council was meeting, at Moscow’s request, to discuss the alleged Ukrainian artillery attacks on the facility, which Russia says may result in a radioactive disaster. “Fighting near a nuclear plant is dangerous and irresponsible – and we continue to call on Russia to cease all military operations at or near Ukrainian nuclear facilities and return full control to Ukraine, and support Ukrainian calls for a demilitarized zone around the nuclear power plant,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also requested a demilitarized zone on Thursday, urging both Russia and Ukraine to “withdraw any military personnel and equipment from the plant and refrain from any further deployment of forces or equipment to the site.” On Wednesday, the US and its G7 allies demanded of Russia to “immediately hand back full control” of the ZNPP to Ukraine and enable International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) personnel to access the facility, but made no mention of a demilitarized zone. Meanwhile, the US, Canadian, and European nuclear associations published a letter calling for IAEA access to the ZNPP and the withdrawal of Russian troops, but also for a 30-kilometer “safe zone” around the site, in which both Ukrainian and Russian forces would “cease military activity.” According to the Russian military, Ukrainian forces have repeatedly fired artillery and rockets at the plant since late July, and have allegedly previously used drones to strike at the facility – the largest in Europe. The latest attack was reported on Thursday, with units of the Ukrainian 44th Artillery Brigade firing at the plant from Nikopol and damaging the reactor coolant systems, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Only the expertise of Russian troops prevented catastrophic damage to the site, the ministry said. Moscow is treating Ukrainian attacks on the ZNPP – as well as Wednesday’s shelling of the brewery in Donetsk that resulted in a major ammonia spill – as “acts of terrorism,” the Russian Defense Ministry added. Russia has asked for IAEA presence on the site, but Ukraine has objected, Moscow’s permanent representative at the UN Vassily Nebenzia reminded the Security Council on Thursday. Kiev has claimed that Russia was the one targeting the plant in an alleged plot to discredit Ukraine. Nebenzia added that “elementary logic” suggests that Russia has no reason to target the facility or its own troops, and that multiple attacks on the ZNPP have been documented from the Ukrainian-held territory in Dnepropetrovsk Region. If a nuclear disaster does occur as a result of the shelling, all responsibility will be on “the Western sponsors of the Kiev regime,” he said. China, which currently chairs the UN Security Council, has called for Russia and Ukraine to sit down at the negotiating table and peacefully resolve the situation around the ZNPP. The Zaporozhye plant is the largest in Europe and stores tens of tons of enriched uranium and plutonium in its reactor cores and spent fuel storage, according to the IAEA. The watchdog chief previously said he was alarmed that the security of the radioactive materials may be compromised amid Russian-Ukrainian hostilities."
2022-08-11,https://www.rt.com/news/560672-plan-b-iran-nuclear-deal/,Moscow speaks out on ‘Plan B’ for Iran nuclear deal,"Any ‘Plan B’ in the talks on the Iranian nuclear program would violate a “consensus decision” of the UN Security Council on the issue and have “unavoidable negative consequences” for the entire Middle East, the Russian Foreign Ministry warned on Thursday. “Any departure [from the original 2015 deal] or ‘Plans B’ that some people like to speculate about would run counter to the consensus decisions of the [UN] Security Council,” said Ivan Nechaev, the ministry’s deputy spokesman, referring to a 2015 UNSC resolution supporting that year’s agreement on the Iranian nuclear program. The revival of the existing 2015 deal through the ongoing talks in Vienna is the only “reasonable and effective way” forward, Nechaev told journalists during a briefing. He also welcomed the latest round of indirect talks between the US and Iranian delegations in Vienna, which resulted in some “progress” on issues that had earlier been a stumbling block in the negotiations. “A positive result of the talks is… achievable,” Nechaev said, adding that “there are no irreconcilable differences between the parties. Further progress would solely depend on each side’s “political will,” the diplomat said. At the same time, Moscow slammed the EU for what it called the bullying tactics. “The language of ultimatums does not work in such a sensitive and high-stakes issue,” Nechaev said as he particularly criticized Peter Stano, the spokesman for EU diplomatic chief Josep Borrell. Earlier this week, Stano told journalists that “everything that could be negotiated has been incorporated into the final version of the text” compiled after the latest round of talks between Tehran and Washington, which was mediated by the EU. “It’s yes or no,” Stano insisted, adding that “there is no more room for other compromises.” Borrell himself also called the document “the final text” at that time. On Thursday, the Russian Foreign Ministry responded by saying Stano had no authority to make such statements on behalf of all parties involved in the talks. The Iranian deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was built on “carefully measured balance of interests” and not “crude political pressure,” it added. The work on reviving the deal will only end “when interests of all parties involved are properly taken into account,” Nechaev told journalists on Thursday. Last week, Washington said it developed a proposal for a mutual return to the nuclear deal with Iran. Tehran responded by saying the revival of the agreement relies primarily on the US’ “will” and that Washington must show its readiness to achieve a long-term result. The Western media have also been publishing pieces calling on Washington and Brussels to work out a ‘Plan B’ that can be used if the Vienna negotiations yield no results. Some of the pieces openly called on Western governments to ditch the talks in favor of this option, which has apparently yet to be devised. “Enough of the ‘tenuous’ Iran nuclear deal – it’s time for Plan B,” read an opinion piece The Hill published in early July. “Biden Should Show Iran What ‘Plan B’ Looks Like,” another piece published by the Washington Post in mid-June suggested. The deal signed in 2015 by Iran, the US, the UK, France and Germany – as well as Russia, China and the EU – involved Tehran agreeing to certain restrictions on its nuclear industry in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions and other incentives. The agreement has been in limbo since 2018 when it was torpedoed by the US under then-President Donald Trump, who unilaterally withdrew from it. In response, Iran started gradually reducing its commitments under the accord, such as the level of enriched uranium it produces. On August 1, Tehran announced it has “the technical ability to build an atomic bomb,” adding, however, that such a program “is not on the agenda.”"
2022-08-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/560664-nechaev-grain-ships-countries/,Moscow slams Western hypocrisy over Ukrainian grain,"Russia’s Foreign Ministry has expressed doubt about the sincerity of Western countries’ global food security concerns, noting that grain-loaded ships from Ukrainian Black Sea ports are mostly heading to the West, rather than to starving African or Asian countries. Speaking at a press briefing on Thursday, Ivan Nechaev, the deputy director of the ministry’s information and press department, said that “so far not a single ship with grain has reached the shores of the starving countries of Africa or South Asia.” “They go mainly to Western ports, and the range of exported goods is mainly not wheat, but corn grain and sunflower oil, which casts doubt on the sincerity of these voices in the West that world food security depends on the ‘grain deal’,” Nechaev said, referring to the recent deal between Moscow and Kiev which allowed the resumption of grain exports from Ukrainian ports. Prior to the deal, Kiev and its Western supporters were accusing Moscow of deliberately preventing the food shipments and in this way threatening global food security. Moscow repeatedly denied those claims, saying that Ukraine had made the shipments impossible by laying naval mines in the waterways around the ports. The foreign ministry spokesman also touched on the situation with the Sierra Leone-flagged freighter Razoni, which sailed out of Odessa on August 1 carrying 26,000 metric tons of chicken feed destined for Lebanon. The ship was turned back from Beirut on Monday, after the Lebanese buyer refused to accept the shipment, on the grounds of it being several months too late. “As it turned out, there was not the wheat on board that the Lebanese needed, but corn, fodder corn,” Nechaev said. Nechaev’s remarks about the destinations of Ukrainian grain echo a recent article by New York Times. On Tuesday, the outlet noted that since the Istanbul deal took effect on August 1, none of ten ships which have left the Ukrainian ports, were bound for Yemen, Somalia, or other countries facing “catastrophic levels of hunger.” Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky told his counterpart Mokgweetsi Masisi of Botswana on Monday that Ukraine was committed to remaining “a reliable food exporter.” Stressing that Russia is “committed to its obligations and is looking forward to effective fulfillment of the Istanbul deal,” Nechaev noted that the deal includes agreements not only on the export of grain from the Ukrainian ports, but also on the normalization of Russian food exports to the world market. While implementation of one part of the deal has been ongoing for a week and a half now, the other element is yet to be fulfilled, Nechaev said, expressing hope that the Western countries will “create the necessary conditions” for access of Russian fertilizers and food to the global markets."
2022-08-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/560655-un-nuclear-power-plant/,UN issues nuclear appeal to Russia and Ukraine,"Risking damage to Ukraine’s Zaporozhye nuclear power plant is “unacceptable,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated on Thursday. Kiev and Moscow must negotiate on making it off-limits for any military action, he emphasized. “I urge the parties to withdraw any military personnel and equipment from the plant and refrain from any further deployment of forces or equipment to the site,” the senior official insisted. “Instead, urgent agreement is needed at a technical level on a safe perimeter of demilitarization to ensure the safety of the area.” The Zaporozhye plant, which is located in the Russia-controlled Ukrainian city of Energodar, has been subjected to a series of attacks over the past few weeks. Moscow has accused Kiev of launching artillery and drone strikes on the facility, branding these moves as “nuclear terorism.” Kiev has claimed that Russia was the one targeting the plant in an alleged plot to discredit Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russia is using it as a military base, staging troops and heavy weapons there, Ukrainian officials said. The UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has not had access to the Zaporozhye plant since before Russia attacked Ukraine in late February. The reactors and other equipment are operated by Ukrainian staff, despite being under Russian control since the early weeks of the conflict. Attempts to organize an on-site international inspection to verify the site’s safety and security have been futile so far. Moscow blamed the UN for the delay and said the organization’s department, which is responsible for security during official visits, was catering to Kiev by allowing it to continue its “provocations.” The Russian Foreign Ministry urged Guterres to intervene. The secretary-general then called on “the parties to provide the IAEA mission with immediate, secure and unfettered access to the site” in his Thursday statement. Guterres warned that military action near any nuclear power plant may result in a serious disaster affecting a large region. The sentiment is shared by Russia, which on Thursday reiterated its warnings about the situation. “Actions by the Kiev regime could lead to a disaster on a scale that would dwarf the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,” Russian Foreign Ministry deputy spokesperson Ivan Nechaev said during a news briefing. The Russian diplomat reiterated calls for an IAEA inspection of the Zaporozhye plant, saying Russia was in favor of one."
2022-08-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/560656-zaporozhye-nuclear-power-plant-shelling/,Ukraine shells Zaporozhye nuclear plant – local authorities,"Ten shells launched by the Ukrainian army landed near the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant on Thursday, according to regional authorities. The facility is located in southeastern Ukraine but is currently under the control of Russian troops. Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Zaporozhye Region military-civil administration, explained that five explosives landed near the commandant’s office at the plant, next to a welding site and a radioactive substance storage facility, causing grass in the area to catch fire. Another five shells landed near the fire station beside the power plant, preventing a shift change. Rogov said this was the second time the power plant had come under fire on Thursday and suggested that the strikes were being carried out by Ukrainian forces using multiple launch rocket systems and heavy artillery positioned in Dnepropetrovsk Region. The military-civil administration of Energodar, the city closest to the power plant, said none of the strikes had led to fires at the reactors and no casualties had been reported. The Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, which is considered to be the largest of its kind in Europe, was seized by Russian forces in late February, when Moscow launched its military campaign in the neighboring country. The facility continues to operate with Ukrainian staff under Russian control. Last week, Ukrainian forces carried out a series of strikes on the plant, according to regional authorities, leading to a short circuit at the facility and starting a fire that was eventually put out. Moscow has condemned Kiev’s attacks as “nuclear terrorism” and has accused it of holding the entirety of Europe hostage by conducting such “suicidal attacks.” The Ukrainian side has repeatedly denied targeting the plant, and President Vladimir Zelensky has in turn accused Russia of shelling the facility. Ukraine and the US have also accused Russian forces of using the plant as cover, a claim that Moscow has rejected."
2022-08-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/560647-estonia-russia-visa-ban/,Russia’s EU neighbor severely cuts entry rights,"Estonia will close its borders to Russian nationals with Schengen visas issued by the Baltic nation, the Foreign Ministry announced on Thursday. “In a week’s time, Schengen visas issued by the Republic of Estonia will be subject to a sanction,” Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu told reporters. “The sanction means that the visas will remain valid. However, visa holders will be sanctioned when entering Estonia; in other words, they will not be allowed to enter Estonia,” he said, adding that there will be several exceptions to new rules. The exceptions include those who work at diplomatic missions in Estonia and their family members, as well as individuals engaged in international cargo and passenger transportation. Moreover, the ban will not apply to those who have the right of free movement under EU law, persons whose entry into Estonia is necessary for humanitarian reasons, relatives of Estonian citizens, or relatives of permanent residents. “I would like to emphasize once again — firstly, this provision comes into force in a week. Secondly, it means that the vast majority of Schengen visas issued in Estonia actually will still be valid, but those individuals who do not fall under the exceptions are not allowed to enter Estonia,” Reinsalu said, stressing that the move would have no impact on Russian citizens with Schengen visas issued elsewhere. Meanwhile, the Estonian government intends to discuss a possible path to barring all Russian nationals that hold Schengen visas from entering the country. Earlier this month, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas urged Schengen countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens. “Visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right,” she said at the time. Her statement was echoed by Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin, who said it’s “not right” that Russians “can live a normal life, travel in Europe, be tourists”, while Moscow wages “an aggressive, brutal war of aggression.” Marin added that she would “personally like to see European solutions to this question.” Nonetheless, the EU has so far been reluctant to close its borders to Russian citizens, with one Brussels official telling the Financial Times this week that the bloc did not want a complete ban. “You don’t want to completely ban all Russians from traveling to the EU. How are we going to engage at all?” an unnamed EU official told the newspaper. “Russians not in favor of the war need to be able to travel too.” Commenting on a possible travel ban, the Kremlin described people supporting the move as “delirious” and decried the idea itself as “irrational.” “They are stooping to sentiments that we heard literally 80 years ago from certain countries in the heart of Europe,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that he hoped people who made these statements would “come to their senses”."
2022-08-11,https://www.rt.com/news/560648-latvia-sponsor-terrorism-zakharova/,Russia labels Latvian MPs 'Neo-Nazis',"Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman has slammed Latvia’s decision to brand Moscow a “state sponsor of terrorism,” calling it “absolutely groundless” and part of a long-running anti-Russia campaign by Riga. “Is it news? No,” Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram shortly after Thursday’s declaration by the Latvian parliament, which accused Russia of “acts of terrorism” in Ukraine. “Considering that there’s no factual basis to this decision, except for savage xenophobia, one must label the ideologues of this move none other than neo-Nazis,” she insisted. Earlier this week, while the latest anti-Russia declaration was still under discussion in Latvia’s parliament, Zakharova accused Latvia of plunging itself into a crisis. “It is well known that the pathological Russophobia of the ruling elites of Latvia has already caused serious economic and social problems in this Baltic country, bringing down the standard of living of its population. And it’s only going to get worse in the future,” she warned. Zakharova also called on Latvian lawmakers “to finally stop and switch from being henchmen of their overseas masters into real representatives of their people, who really care about their fate.”"
2022-08-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/560642-russia-nuclear-disaster-ukraine-chernobyl/,Russia warns of nuclear disaster ‘worse than Chernobyl’,"Ukraine’s shelling of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant is an act of terrorism that could trigger a disaster that would eclipse the 1986 Chernobyl incident, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Thursday. “In recent days, Ukrainian forces have been repeatedly shelling the territory of the Zaporozhye NPP, which is an act of nuclear terrorism. Such actions by the Kiev regime could lead to a disaster on a scale that would dwarf the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,” the Russian Foreign Ministry’s deputy spokesperson, Ivan Nechaev, told a news briefing in Moscow. According to the diplomat, should such a disaster occur, radiation would hit not only nearby regions in Ukraine, Russia, the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, but also European countries, putting millions of lives at risk. Nechaev also said he hoped the international community would pay attention to the situation at the site. “We are in favor of organizing an IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] mission to the Zaporozhye NPP, which was disrupted in June due to the decision of the UN Secretariat’s Department of Safety and Security,” he said. On Thursday, Zaporozhye officials claimed that Russian air defense systems had thwarted a missile and drone attack on the NPP and the nearby city of Energodar. “[The Ukrainian military] are trying to bombard the peaceful town and the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant with MLRS [multiple launch rocket systems], heavy artillery and strike UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles],” said Vladimir Rogov, a member of the chief council of the Zaporozhye Region military-civilian administration, adding that all the attacks were repelled and Ukrainian artillery positions hit by counter-battery fire. The Group of Seven (G7), consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US, on Wednesday called on Russia to cede the nuclear power plant, seized by Moscow’s forces in early March, back to Ukraine. The group said the move would ensure the facility’s “safe and secure operations.” The nuclear power plant has been taken over by Russian troops, but is still being operated and maintained by Ukrainian crews. The call came a day after Moscow summoned an emergency session of the UN Security Council to discuss “Ukrainian provocations,” including a series of shelling attacks on the NPP. The meeting is expected to take place on Thursday. On Monday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Kiev of holding the whole of Europe hostage, saying its government officials “apparently won’t hesitate to burn it for the sake of their Nazi idols.” At the same time, Kiev has denied all allegations, claiming it was the Russian troops that shelled the facility to frame Ukrainian forces. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Zaporozhye plant is the largest in Europe and has up to 60 tons of enriched uranium and plutonium in its reactor cores and spent fuel storage."
2022-08-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/560637-lithuania-naturalized-citizens-russia/,EU state mulls disowning its own citizens – media,"Conservative Lithuanian MPs have penned legislation that would allow stripping citizenship from people who support “aggressors,” local media reported. It comes amid a scandal in the Baltic country over two of its nationals taking part in a figure-skating show in Russia. The proposed amendment will provide for the punishment of a naturalized citizen who “supports aggressors and in that way poses a threat to Lithuania, the region and its allies,” as cited by news website Delfi on Thursday. The lawmakers said the changes were necessary due to the situation in Ukraine. The bill was sponsored by three conservative MPs and appears to be linked to a Russia-related scandal that hit the Baltic nation this week. Top Lithuanian officials were outraged after learning that former Olympic skating stars Margarita Drobiazko and Povilas Vanagas were set to star in a show in the Russian resort city of Sochi. The performance was organized by Russia’s former Olympic ice dance champion Tatiana Navka, who is married to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Drobiazko, 52, is Moscow-born and obtained Lithuanian citizenship in 1993, after she and Vanagas, 50, decided to represent the latter’s home country in international competitions. They are not only dancing partners but also husband and wife. The couple currently resides in Russia. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda announced on Wednesday that he had decided to take back the ‘Order of Gediminas,’ a merit bestowed on the two athletes back in 2000, as a punishment for their Sochi gig. He also suggested that Drobiazko could lose her citizenship, which she received by a presidential decree, siding with Lithuanian MPs calling for such a move. Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said he would support stripping Drobiazko of her citizenship and branded participation in the Russian show as a “betrayal of everything the people of Ukraine are fighting for.” Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky this week retaliated in a similar fashion against Viktor Petrenko, a Ukraine-born Olympic figure-skating champion in 1992. The athlete lost his state grant over having played a role in another Navka-organized performance in Russia."
2022-08-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/560632-russia-developing-new-world/,"Glenn Diesen: In the developing new world order, Russia’s weapons will be pointing West, and its economy directed towards the East","Cross border institutions in Eurasia were previously tasked with diversifying economic connectivity as the emerging multipolar world demanded reduced dependence on Western-centric institutions reluctant to adapt to new realities. However, the current European crisis has destabilized the world and discredited the West’s ability to facilitate economic cooperation. Subsequently, these bodies are now asserting a central role in organizing economic recovery and pragmatic cooperation. After the Second World War, the United Nations (UN) was formed as the principal authority of international law. It became a stable and enduring institution reflecting the distribution of power. The most powerful states were endowed with special privileges in its Security Council to ensure they had an interest in preserving the central role of the organization. International law prioritized sovereignty due to the balance of power, which ensured that sides were willing to sacrifice some flexibility in their foreign policy in return for reciprocity and thus predictability. Efforts to create a pan-European security architecture began with the Helsinki Accords in 1975, which sought to establish an order based on “sovereign equality” and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other states. The subsequent development of mutual trust contributed to Gorbachev and Bush declaring the end of the Cold War in Malta in 1989, and the efforts to build a pan-European security architecture continued. The Charter of Paris for a New Europe in 1990 called to overcome the “division of the continent” and to create a system of “sovereign equality” and “indivisible security” in which states would not increase their security at the expense of other states. The Budapest Document of 1994 converted the Helsinki Accords into the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). This inclusive pan-European body reaffirmed the principles of “sovereign equality” and “indivisible security”. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and Russia appeared to be in irreversible decline throughout the 1990s. Subsequently, the negotiated pan-European security order no longer reflected the balance of power that had previously existed when the Cold War ended in 1989. In the unipolar order, the US pursued a security strategy based on hegemonic peace and demanded revising the institutions and rules governing the international system. The West abandoned the pan-European security agreements signed in the early 1990s and instead embarked on an initiative of creating a new “Europe” without Russia. Continuous NATO expansion implied that the dividing lines in Europe would not be eliminated but merely moved gradually toward Russia’s borders. The principle of “indivisible security” was subsequently abandoned as the West expanded its security at the expense of Russian security. Bizarrely, the ideology of the liberal internationalists rejects the existence of a security dilemma. They believe Russia can be a threat to the West, yet NATO cannot conceivably be considered a danger as it merely advances their values. The competition over where to draw the new dividing lines in Europe resulted in NATO and Russia supporting opposing political forces in the divided societies of the shared neighborhood – Moldova, Georgia, Belarus, and Ukraine. In November 2013, Brussels rejected Kiev’s proposal for a trilateral Ukraine-Russia-EU agreement that would have made the country a bridge rather than a bastion. Instead, the West’s support for toppling President Yanukovich in February 2014 sparked a predictable crisis in Eastern Ukraine, followed by Russian intervention in Crimea. The Minsk-2 agreement of February 2015 offered a compromise, yet the agreement was undermined by the US for the next seven years without any objections from the EU. A unipolar distribution of authority also undermines the principle of “sovereign equality” as states do not constrain themselves. In the absence of a balance of power, the West promotes rules of sovereign inequality. Under the guise of advancing liberal values, NATO countries claimed the prerogative to interfere in the domestic affairs of other states, topple governments, invade, and change borders. Humanitarianism was used to decouple legitimacy from legality as NATO invaded Yugoslavia in 1999. Thereafter, a debate ensued demanding an exception from international law as liberal democracies should not be constrained by authoritarian states. Even though at least 20% of the bloc’s membership aren’t even classed as such by the US state-funded “Freedom House” NGO. An “alliance of democracies” was advocated as an alternative authority to the UN to legitimize the illegal invasion of Iraq, which was then reconceptualized as a “Concert of Democracy” or a “League of Democracies”. These ideas have developed into the “rules-based international order” as an alternative to international law. NATO takes ownership over liberal values and thus the right and “responsibility” to carve out its own exemptions from international law. Liberal international economic systems form when there is a concentration of power, such as under Britain in the 19th century and the US in the 20th century. The economic hegemon has an interest in developing predictability and trust for an international economic system under its administration. However, the system fractures if it fails to adapt to the emergence of a multipolar distribution of power. The economic hegemon in relative decline will more likely use its administrative control over the system to weaken rising rivals. The subsequent collapse unravels trust and creates a demand for alternatives. The unsustainable debt of the US and the EU has gradually weakened trust in the dollar and the Euro, while seizing the assets of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, and Afghanistan undermines trust in the entire Western-centric international financial system. The containment of rivals such as Russia and China results in the militarization of transportation corridors, while the reluctance to adequately accommodate China in the IMF has incentivized Beijing to launch parallel institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). President Trump’s economic war against China, which continued under Biden, weakened trust in the reliable supplies of American technologies and industrial products. The response was to develop greater technological sovereignty and reorganize supply away from the US. The large-scale sanctions launched against Russia are also affecting the rest of the world in the form of an energy crisis, food shortages, inflation, and overall economic instability. The funds of the Russian Central Bank have been frozen, and the EU discusses permanently confiscating them in what could become the largest bank heist in history. The rule of law is also suspended as individuals accused of having ties to the Russian government have had their assets seized in absence of any due process. The desire to ban all Russian energy is forcing it to redirect all its energy exports to the East. Moscow has been suspended from the alleged “non-political” SWIFT payment messaging system, and the Kaliningrad exclave has been placed under a partial blockade. Countries that do not abide by the unilateral sanctions of the West are threatened with economic coercion. China is likely next in line as Washington eagerly promotes the idea of artificially dividing the world into two blocs, an alleged democratic bloc versus an authoritarian bloc. The rules of the past are now non-existent and economic dependence has intolerable risks. Simply put, there is a great demand for alternative institutions that can facilitate economic recovery and pragmatic cooperation. In the East, there are rising economic giants that are more confident and determined to build international economic systems deserving of trust. Russia is no longer pursuing a Greater Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok in which Russia feeds the continent and supplies natural resources for European industries, and in return imports Western technologies and industrial products. The Greater Eurasian Partnership is no longer an instrument for merely diversifying economic connectivity but has now become a necessity for a complete economic divorce from the West. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) continues to aspire to develop further economic competencies and will likely accept Iran as a new member in September. BRICS is also ramping up for a greater role in economic recovery and is preparing to accept Argentina and Iran as new members. The Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) has developed slowly, although there are new incentives for common regulatory acts to enhance autonomy and stability in an increasingly chaotic world. The balance of power across the multipolar Greater Eurasia results in several commonalities among the Eurasian international institutions. These organizations focus on the principle of sovereign equality and international law in accordance with the UN Charter. Competing interests among the different poles of power ensure that these institutions are focused on security with other members, instead of security against non-members. The values tend to center on common prosperity as stipulated by the “Shanghai spirit,” while eschewing values that can be used to impose sovereign inequality. The multipolar international distribution of power in Greater Eurasia also prevents a centralized international economic system and instead focuses on the “integration of integrations”. For the foreseeable future, Russian weapons will be pointing towards the West, and Russia’s economic connectivity will be directed towards the East. Although, in the longer term the Eurasian international institutions should also be tasked with restoring cooperation with Western economies."
2022-08-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/560638-coronavirus-hybrid-deltacron-moscow/,‘Hybrid’ Covid-19 strain discovered in Russia,"A new hybrid strain of Covid-19, which combines the features of the Delta and Omicron variants of the virus, has been discovered in Russia, the country’s consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor has confirmed on Thursday. Six cases of the so-called ‘Deltacron’ strain have so far been registered, with five in St Petersburg and one in Moscow, the agency said, citing data uploaded on VGARus (Virus Genome Aggregator of Russia). ‘Deltacron’ is currently a non-dominant strain of the virus and doesn’t have any significant effect on the epidemiological situation in Russia, it pointed out. According to Rospotrebnadzor, all of the ‘Deltacron’ patients experienced a light form of the disease, with none of them requiring hospitalization. American genetic scientist Dmitry Pruss has earlier told RBC news agency that the hybrid virus was unique to Russia and likely originated in the country. ‘Deltacron’ was first discovered by the researchers at the Smorodintsev Institute of Influenza in St Petersburg in early July. A month later, “we’ve checked and rechecked everything and can say with confidence that it’s not a mistake, but an actual hybrid virus,” the scientist reported. Such combinations of the coronavirus variants as ‘Deltacron’ are very rare as the more severe Delta has by now been almost completely overtaken by the more contagious, but lighter Omicron strain. “We’re yet to find out if the ‘Russian Deltacron’ is dangerous,” Pruss said, adding that the spread of the hybrid virus has so far been very limited. In January, a hybrid of Delta and Omicron was reported by scientists in Cyprus, who said 25 people had been infected with it. However, the World Health Organization’s technical lead on Covid-19 Maria Van Kerkhove suggested that it was likely a lab mistake caused by the contamination of a virus sample. The reports of the discovery of ‘Deltacron’ in Russia came on the day when the country’s Sputnik V vaccine marks its two-year anniversary. On August 11, 2020 it became the first shot against coronavirus registered anywhere in the world. The Russian vaccine, which has been supplied to 71 countries, has shown one of the strongest responses to the mutated Delta and Omicron variants. A joint study by the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases and the developers of the jab at the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute, which was published in early 2022, revealed that Sputnik V was 2.6 times more effective against Omicron than the US-made Pfizer shot."
2022-08-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/560622-sputnik-vaccine-coronavirus-rdif/,Russia’s Sputnik V Covid jab marks two-year anniversary,"In the two years since its registration, Sputnik V has proven to be “one of the most effective and safe tools” against Covid-19 both in Russia and abroad, the head of the fund which financed the vaccine’s development and oversees its distribution said on Wednesday. On August 11, 2020, Sputnik V became the world’s first vaccine against the novel coronavirus to be registered, after receiving the relevant papers from Russia’s Health Ministry. Since then the jab, developed by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute, “has become the most exported drug in Russia’s history and rightfully established itself as one of the most effective and safe tools to combat coronavirus infection in the world,” Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) CEO Kirill Dmitriev said. “Sputnik V was trusted in 71 countries around the globe where more than 4 billion people reside,” he noted. In order to facilitate the access to the vaccine, RDIF organized mass production not only in Russia, but in 18 other countries, including India, China, Brazil, Argentina and Iran. The two-component Sputnik V shot has shown 97.6% efficacy during the vaccination drive in Russia, according to data from the Gamaleya Institute and the Health Ministry. Its effectiveness was also “confirmed by the results of more than 50 clinical studies and data from… national vaccination programs in various regions of the world, including Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America,” the RDIF chief said. Research on the Russian jab has been published in international peer-reviewed medical journals including The Lancet, Nature, Vaccines, Cell Reports Medicine and others, he pointed out. “The vaccine not only helped protect people from the original coronavirus strain and bring down the peak of the disease, its proven universal platform of human adenoviral vectors has shown high efficiency in combating new mutations [of Covid-19], including the Delta and Omicron strains,” Dmitriev said. A joint study by the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases and the Gamaleya Institute, which was published in early 2022, “confirmed that Sputnik V provided the strongest defense against Omicron,” he said. Among other things, that paper revealed that the Russian jab is 2.6 times more effective against Omicron than the US-made Pfizer shot. A one-component Sputnik Light vaccine was also registered in Russia in May 2021 and later supplied to more than 30 countries. It became a “universal booster for other vaccines,” providing higher protection against the Omicron strain and other mutations, according to the RDIF chief. However, Sputnik V and Sputnik Light still lack authorization from the World Health Organization and the EU’s watchdog European Medicines Agency (EMA). Russian officials have claimed the delay is due to political reasons. RDIF was also among the first Russian entities to face Western sanctions after the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine in February. “The pandemic should be an important lesson for all of humanity - when it comes to saving lives, unity and collective efforts are required. Only this path makes it possible to effectively counter future threats, including epidemiological ones,” Dmitriev concluded."
2022-08-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/560609-on-air-protester-charged-fakes-ukraine/,On-air protest Russian journalist charged,"Russian authorities have charged journalist Marina Ovsyannikova over spreading “disinformation” about the Russian military. Ovsyannikova became known to global audiences in March, when she unfurled a placard critical of Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine during a live evening-news broadcast. The journalist has since staged several more protests decrying Russia’s use of force against its neighbor. On Wednesday, Ovsyannikova’s attorney, Dmitry Zahvatov published a post on Facebook, confirming that his client had officially been charged under paragraph 207.3 of the country’s penal code, which was introduced soon after the Kremlin began its offensive against Ukraine. If found guilty, the journalist could face up to ten years behind bars. The 44-year-old is suspected of “publicly spreading disinformation on the use of the armed forces, motivated by political, ideological, racial, national or religious hatred or enmity or by hatred or enmity toward a social group.” Zahvatov revealed that the journalist had been apprehended early on Wednesday morning, with police officers “forcing their way” into her house. The residence was searched, and Ovsyannikova was taken to Moscow and interrogated, the lawyer added. So far, no decision has been made as to whether she will be kept in pre-trial detention or released on bail, the attorney added. He said that the criminal probe had been launched by Russia’s Investigative Committee over Ovsyannikova’s July 15 protest on the Moskva river embankment outside the Kremlin, where she unfurled a placard accusing Putin of being a murderer, and likened Russian soldiers to fascists. Last month a Moscow court fined her 50,000 rubles ($813). As she later explained to Russian media, that fine was imposed over her speech critical of Russia’s military offensive, which she delivered outside a court where the case of opposition Moscow municipal lawmaker, Ilya Yashin, had been heard. In early August, Ovsyannikova was slapped with one more fine, over a Facebook post criticizing Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. On March 14, by which time she was working at Russia’s 1 TV channel, Ovsyannikova walked behind a news presenter during a live broadcast and unfurled a placard, part of which was written in English, part in Russian. The message read: “No war (in English). Stop the war. Don’t believe the propaganda.” It also accused the media of lying and stated in English: “Russians against war.” The woman shouted several times, “stop the war!” The live broadcast was not interrupted and the protester was visible for several seconds. Following her on-air protest, Ovsyannikova was briefly detained and later fined, though not over the protest itself, but rather for a video message she had recorded in advance and posted on social media. In it, she called for, among other things, Russians to take part in unauthorized protests against Moscow’s “special operation” in Ukraine. Ovsyannikova’s performance quickly made her a darling of the Western media. In April, the Russian journalist was hired by Germany’s Die Welt news channel as an untenured correspondent. However, she later revealed that this contract had expired after three months. Authorities are yet to comment on the most recent charges against Ovsyannikova."
2022-08-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/560602-senate-himars-ammunition-ukraine/,US senators divided over Ukraine ammo – media,"While some US senators want to send long-range missiles to the Ukrainian forces, others would like to see military plans first, or are worried about Pentagon stockpiles running low, the Daily Beast has reported. The White House’s supposed reluctance to send ATACMS missiles for HIMARS rocket launchers is apparently further complicating matters, because the move might be seen as an escalation by Russia. So far, the Pentagon has sent Ukraine 16 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), along with Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) munitions with a range of about 70km. Kiev has been asking for Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) projectiles, however, which have a range of almost 300km. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Florida) is concerned that the US doesn’t have that many ATACMS, which take a long time to manufacture. The Pentagon currently has between 1,000 and 3,000 such missiles in its inventory, according to the Beast. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada) told the outlet she wanted to see Ukraine’s strategic plans before considering requests for longer-range ammunition. “We have to see what their strategic plan is,” said Rosen. “What we have to do, what Ukraine has to do, and what we’re working with them to do is to develop a strategic plan moving forward and then trying to be sure that we get them the appropriate help that they need in order to execute that plan,” she added. While the New York Times reported in June that Kiev is keeping Washington largely in the dark about its strategy, last week a top Ukrainian general revealed US military involvement in directing HIMARS strikes. Lieutenant Colonel Garron J. Garn, a Department of Defense spokesperson, told the Daily Beast that the US is “providing the Ukrainians [with] a range of capabilities commensurate with the fight they are executing, based on the requirements the Ukrainians have identified for us.” The currently supplied ammunition can handle “most” of Ukraine’s targets, Garn added. Some Senate Republicans, however, believe President Joe Biden is hesitant to send the longer-ranged missiles out of fear. “They think that is escalatory, but I reject that,” Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio) told the Beast. He co-chairs the Senate Ukraine Caucus, and will not seek re-election in November. His colleague Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said the administration is “risk averse” and worries too much about escalation. “We need to make sure that we’re pounding Russia,” she said. So far, the US has sent 16 HIMARS units to Ukraine, which Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl called “actually quite a lot” in a Monday briefing. The UK and Germany have provided several more launchers capable of firing the same ammunition. The Russian military said it had destroyed at least four HIMARS launchers so far, offering photographic evidence of the strikes. Both Kiev and the Pentagon have denied this, but offered no proof to back up their claims."
2022-08-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/560599-swedish-amnesty-resign-ukraine-report/,Amnesty Sweden co-founder resigns over Ukraine report,"Per Wastberg, who co-founded the Swedish branch of Amnesty International, resigned from the organization on Wednesday. The Swedish activist said his departure was due to Amnesty’s report about the conflict in Ukraine, and that the organization has gone beyond its original mandate to advocate for political prisoners. “I have been a member for over 60 years. It is with a heavy heart that, due to Amnesty's statements regarding the war in Ukraine, I am ending a long and fruitful engagement,” Wastberg told the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, where he is an occasional columnist. “From its inception, Amnesty worked for the freedom of political prisoners everywhere in the world,” said Wastberg, who co-founded the Swedish branch in 1964. “It has since gradually, sometimes debatably, expanded its mandate” and become a different kind of organization, he added. Amnesty has faced a torrent of criticism after publishing a report on August 4 that said Ukraine was deliberately placing troops and military vehicles in residential areas and hospitals. The report was based on research in eastern Ukraine, from April to July. “We have documented a pattern of Ukrainian forces putting civilians at risk and violating the laws of war when they operate in populated areas,” Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnes Callamard said at the time. Amnesty’s Ukraine director Oksana Pokalchuk resigned in the wake of the report. The government in Kiev accused the NGO of engaging in pro-Russian propaganda. President Vladimir Zelensky said anyone who casts doubt on Ukraine’s victimhood is an “accomplice of Russia” and “a terrorist themselves.” While the NGO has since apologized for the “distress and anger” caused by their press release on Ukrainian tactics, it has not disavowed the report. Callamard commented on the criticism by saying that “war propaganda, disinformation, [and] misinformation” by online trolls “won’t dent our impartiality and won’t change the facts.” Secretary General of Amnesty Sweden, Anna Johansson, said in an interview on Wednesday that “about a thousand” members have sought to leave the organization over the Ukraine report. She noted, however, that Amnesty Sweden had faced a bigger crisis when it adopted a new policy “on the rights of people who have sex for money.” While Ukraine has the right to defend itself, Johansson said, that “does not mean that it has the right to violate international humanitarian law. That is why the discussion must also cover Ukraine’s actions – otherwise we would be giving Ukraine carte blanche regardless of what it does.”"
2022-08-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/560594-zelensky-crimea-ukraine-liberation/,Zelensky predicts when Ukraine conflict will end,"Ukraine will keep fighting against Russia until it regains control of the Crimean Peninsula, President Vladimir Zelensky has promised. “This Russian war against Ukraine, against the whole of free Europe, began with Crimea and it should end with Crimea – with its liberation,” Zelensky said in a video address on Tuesday. “Crimea is Ukrainian, and we’ll never give up on it,” the president vowed, insisting that the peninsula, which overwhelmingly voted to reunite with Russia in a 2014 referendum in response to a coup in Kiev, has been “occupied” by Moscow all those years. There will be no peace in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean regions “as long as Russia is able to use our peninsula as a military base,” he claimed. However, Zelensky acknowledged that it was currently “impossible to say” when exactly will Ukraine be able to reclaim Crimea. “But we’re constantly adding new components to the formula of liberating” the peninsula, he added. Last month, Ukrainian deputy defense minister Vladimir Gavrilov claimed that Kiev is going to use Western-supplied weapons to destroy the Russian Black Sea Fleet, which is based in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, and take the peninsula back. Such an operation is going to be carried out “sooner or later,” he told the UK media. Other Ukrainian officials issued threats against Crimea recently, including Zelensky’s top aide Alexey Arestovich, who said that Kiev could strike the 19-kilometer-long Kerch Bridge connecting Crimea to Russia’s Krasnodar Region as soon as it gains technical capability to do so. Moscow has been insisting that Crimea is well-protected from any attack by the Ukrainian side. However, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of the country’s National Security Council, warned that if the leadership in Kiev really decided to use force against the peninsula “the Day of Judgment will come to them all simultaneously – a swift and hard one.”"
2022-08-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/560595-kirienko-ukraine-proxy-war/,West would fight Russia ‘to the last Ukrainian’ – Moscow,"Ukraine’s leadership has sold out its own people to fight on behalf of NATO against Russia, Sergey Kirienko, the deputy head of the administration of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said. He added that Western nations are happy to see Ukrainians die as long as it serves their interests. “We understand very well that we are not fighting against Ukraine in the Ukrainian territory, and certainly not against the Ukrainian people. The entire NATO bloc is at war with Russia in Ukraine with Ukrainians’ hands,” Kirienko said in a speech on Wednesday. He blamed the government in Kiev for the violence, accusing it of allowing the country and its people to be sacrificed in a “fundamental confrontation of the Western community against Russia.” NATO will gladly fight against Russia ‘to the last Ukrainian’ as they say themselves without hesitance. Why not? They don’t feel sorry about it. Kirienko was addressing a forum for young Russian political scientists, which launched this week in the Moscow Region. Speaking via video link, he told attendees that it will be up to them to find new ideas and narratives to help the country take a prominent place in the future world, the shape of which is being determined by the ongoing conflict. The Russia-West stand-off goes far beyond the kinetic conflict in Ukraine, the official said. Unprecedented economic sanctions imposed by the US and its allies on Moscow and “info-psychological attacks” directed at it are essential parts of the conflict too, he noted. Moscow’s opponents had miscalculated when they decided on their response to Russian military action in Ukraine, Kirienko said, citing classified Western documents. “They seriously debated in early March whether they needed five million people protesting in the streets in Russia or should better go for ten million and when to expect that: by the end of March or in mid-April at the latest,” he said. The planners believed that Russia “would be too busy to defend its geostrategic interests” when facing the anticipated protests, he added. Despite this, Kirienko advised against relaxing, saying that the pressure on Russia will remain high and may become more efficient. Moscow’s opponents “are pretty smart and competent people, who can learn from their mistakes,” he said. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/560561-ukraine-nuclear-powerplant-attack/,Ukraine and its Western backers should be held accountable for the ‘suicidal’ attack on Europe’s largest nuclear powerplant,"Even as UN Secretary-General António Guterres addressed survivors of the World War Two US atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima, halfway around the world, the armed forces of Ukraine seemed hellbent on unleashing a modern-day nuclear holocaust on Europe by firing artillery rockets at the Zaporozhye power plant. This week's assault, which damaged safety equipment and disrupted power to the facility, the continent's largest, was characterized by Guterres as “suicidal.” Kiev was quick to blame Russia for the attacks, accusing Moscow of conducting “nuclear terrorism,” and calling for the international community to send in a delegation of “international peacekeepers” to “completely demilitarize the territory.” The Zaporozhye nuclear facility has been under the physical control of Russia since its forces occupied the site back in March. Since then, the plant has been operated by Ukrainian technicians working under the supervision of Russian atomic energy experts. The facility contains six nuclear reactors which, before the start of the military operation, generated approximately one-fifth of Ukraine’s electricity. Three of these reactors ceased operation after the Russians took control the site, and another one was forced to shut down after the facility was shelled on August 5. The two remaining reactors were likewise compelled to reduce their output to half as a safety precaution. Ukraine’s ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, declared that Russian forces were attempting to cause electricity blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling the plant. The Ukrainian state nuclear agency, Energoatom, has accused the Russian military of placing explosives throughout the Zaporozhye nuclear plant, which would be detonated in the event of a Ukrainian counterattack which threatened to capture the facility. The Ukrainian military has also accused Russia of placing military equipment, including ammunition, in buildings located near the nuclear reactors. The only problem with the Ukrainian narrative is that, simply put, none of it is true. The August 5 attack on the Zaporozhye nuclear facility was carried out by artillery rockets whose impact characteristics point clearly to having originated from Ukrainian controlled territory. Moreover, Russian air defense and counter-battery radars situated in the vicinity of the plant would have detected the ballistic trajectory of the incoming rockets, providing unimpeachable evidence of the origin of the attack. So, too, would have US and NATO intelligence collection platforms operating over and around Ukraine. And, given the propaganda victory that could be achieved by releasing such evidence, one can rest assured that the US would very much take full advantage of any scenario which would reproduce the release of U-2 imagery during the Cuban missile crisis, or the release of the audio tapes of the Soviet fighter pilot downing KAL 007. This, of course, won’t happen. And given the reality that Russia is engaged in the active defense of the Zaporozhye facility, it is unlikely that it would give away important intelligence about its radar capabilities just to score cheap public relation points. Russia has long been reticent about engaging in cheap propaganda, preferring to let its performance on the battlefield do its speaking for it. Not so the United States and Ukraine, which have a track record of collaboration when it comes to disseminating information designed to undermine the Russian narrative and “get into the mind” of Russian President Vladimir Putin – even if the information being released to the public is not true. The Ukrainian attack on the Zaporozhye nuclear facility was, in typical Orwellian fashion, forecasted by the United States four days before it took place. During an August 1 news conference at the United Nations, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia of using the nuclear facility as a base from which it conducted artillery strikes against Ukraine. Blinken declared that the act of firing artillery rockets from proximity to the nuclear power plant was “the height of irresponsibility,” implying that these rockets could land on the power plant itself. Blinken also added that the Russians were using the nuclear facility as a “nuclear shield” which prevented any Ukrainian attack out of fear of striking the nuclear reactors. Blinken’s brazen parroting of Ukrainian government talking points was made more absurd by the absolute dearth of evidence to back up his powerful pronouncements. Normally, when someone of the stature of the Secretary of State speaks in such a public manner about issues of this importance, there is some intelligence information that is released – for instance, overhead imagery showing Russian troop locations near the Zaporozhye nuclear plant – to sustain the allegation. No such data was provided, however, because Blinken had ceased functioning as the head of the American diplomatic service, and instead was functioning as little more than a Ukrainian propagandist. For its part, Russia has made it clear that there were no Russian forces located in the vicinity of the Zaporozhye nuclear facility save for a small contingent of troops for security purposes (it is, after all, an active nuclear power plant.) Again, while Russia can clearly provide overhead imagery of its force disposition in the vicinity of the plant, operational security precludes it from doing so. It is, after all, the job of the accuser to provide the evidence of a crime, not the accused. Blinken’s August 1 statement served as the initiation of a public relations campaign which culminated in the Ukrainian artillery attack on the Zaporozhye nuclear facility. The goal of this campaign appears to be twofold – first, to put Russia in a bad light, and second, to allow Ukraine to accomplish that which it could not achieve through military force – the eviction of Russian troops from Zaporozhye. The calls for international intervention emanating from the West point to a concerted effort in promoting a pro-Ukrainian narrative even when all parties know the underlying facts sustaining this narrative are not true. To counteract that, Russia has extended its own invitation to IAEA monitors to visit the powerplant and summoned a UN Security Council meeting to discuss the situation. This is far more serious than simply another information warfare campaign gone bad. While the Zaporozhye nuclear facility is constructed to standards which would be able to survive a direct hit from an artillery rocket, the disruption of power and/or damage to safety equipment could lead to the kind of runaway event that preceded the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. The Russian Defense Ministry noted that the Ukrainian attack on the power plant had caused a power surge which triggered an emergency shutdown. The head of the Ukrainian company operating the plant further noted that all but one power line connecting it to Ukraine’s energy system had been destroyed, declaring that any power blackout could be “very unsafe for such a nuclear facility.” Secretary-General Guterres rightly called the attack on the Zaporozhye nuclear facility “suicidal.” However, the “nuclear terrorists” involved in this atrocity do not hail from Moscow, but rather Washington and Kiev. When the dust from Russia’s military operation finally settles, and those responsible for perpetrating crimes such as the attack on the Zaporozhye nuclear facility can be held accountable, Tony Blinken’s name should, if there were any justice in this world, be at the top of this list."
2022-08-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/560587-lithuania-helicopters-russian-trains/,NATO member boosts Russia snooping effort - WSJ,"Lithuania has quadrupled helicopter patrols along its short border with Poland due to tensions with Russia, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing the Baltic nation’s interior ministry. Vilnius is monitoring Russian trains going through the area to and from the exclave of Kaliningrad, ensuring they comply with EU restrictions, the newspaper said. The increase in surveillance activity by Lithuanian border guards was measured in comparison with that of 2020, the newspaper said, citing a spokeswoman for the ministry. Other rotorcraft are now taking part in military exercises, the official said, according to a Sunday article. Vilnius temporarily suspended Russian rail traffic to and from the exclave through Lithuanian territory in June, sparking a diplomatic crisis. Vilnius claimed it was only enforcing EU sanctions against Russian international trade, while Moscow accused it of mounting a blockade of the Kaliningrad region. The situation was partially resolved in July, after the rail connection was reopened, but not fully resolved. The region’s governor said this week that the transportation quotas, which were set by the European Commission based on traffic during previous years, have been exhausted for some goods. The helicopters follow Russian trains to ensure they don’t stop and unload any sanctioned cargo on the Lithuanian territory, according to the WSJ report. Some local residents mistook them for Russian aircraft and were scared by them, the newspaper also said. The article described the anxieties that many people living on both sides of the Polish-Lithuanian border feel. The line separating the two goes along a short land route connecting Kaliningrad to Russian ally Belarus. Polish and Lithuanian officials have long theorized that Russia could seize the so-called Suwalki Gap by force to ensure land connectivity with its exclave, likely leading to a major confrontation with NATO. Some of the locals interviewed by the WSJ claimed they were ready to flee on short notice to safer places. One, an 88-year-old Polish anti-communist activist, pledged to take up arms against Russian troops. “The [Nazi] Germans were much more civilized than the Russians,” he remarked, commenting on the Polish experience with foreign troops on its soil. “The Nazis would just shoot you, but the Russians would torture you and then kill you.” The native of Suwalki city, which lends its name to the area, was just five in 1939, when the Nazis invaded Poland and the country’s government collapsed. The Soviet Union sent its troops into Poland shortly afterwards, in what Warsaw called an equally atrocious invasion. Moscow described it as a forced measure to strengthen the USSR’s position before an inevitable showdown with Germany and argued that it saved many lives in Poland that would have been lost under a Nazi occupation."
2022-08-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/559773-ukraine-preservation-soviet-union/,"How Ukrainians voted for the preservation of the Soviet Union in 1991, but still ended up in an independent state later that year","Back in early 1991, few thought the disappearance of the Soviet Union from the political map was likely. The results of a huge national referendum held in March indicated as much. Ukraine’s vote exceeded 70%, and public discussion of the joint future for all the socialist republics mainly focused on various forms of a federation. Even the proponents of Ukrainian independence did not really believe this was within reach. But by August things started to unravel and, after a failed coup d’état in Moscow, Kiev proclaimed sovereignty. Both the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and its peers began to believe the collapse of the country was inevitable and had to be accepted as such. It was then that both Donbass and Crimea began to demand greater autonomy from the central government and more protection of their interests. In this article, RT revisits the six months between the USSR's landmark referendum and the independence vote in Ukraine that somehow turned out to be enough for the republic’s population to change their minds, and explores the reasons why this outcome both put an end to the world's largest ever country and sparked the separatist movement. After 1988, a series of conflicts broke out one after another in different parts of the Soviet Union, creating a lot of tension: in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Transnistria, among others. In politics, at just about the same time, the “parade of sovereignties” began with the Estonian Sovereignty Declaration of November 16, 1988 that proclaimed the supremacy of Tallinn’s laws over those of the USSR. This was followed by a number of other republics, including the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic declaring sovereignty in 1989 and 1990, which in the end played a crucial role in taking the Soviet Union down. The ensuing struggle between Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR Boris Yeltsin led to the formation of an alternative center of power that ultimately was able to challenge the Kremlin. The situation was spiraling and changes appeared irreversible. Lithuania became the first Soviet republic to declare independence, which was enacted on March 11, 1990 by the Supreme Council of the Lithuanian SSR. It became finally clear that all these years, the very existence of the USSR was based on a silent agreement between the republics’ elites. The agreement, however, was seriously shaken by a severe economic crisis triggered by a sudden removal of state monopoly mechanisms, as well as by the rise of separatist movements, plus ethnic conflicts and by a long-overdue need for political change. In an effort to contain the situation, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev proposed a New Union Treaty that would significantly expand the freedoms and rights of all the Union’s republics. In December 1990, the IV Congress of People’s Deputies, the equivalent of a parliament, voted to hold a referendum on the preservation of the USSR as a renewed confederation of equal sovereign republics and to pen a New Union Treaty. The idea of a confederation was proposed by the “architect of perestroika” Alexander Yakovlev. The proposal was put to a popular vote. The 1991 Soviet Union referendum remains the only example of actual democracy in the history of the USSR. The ballot was set for March 17, 1991. Citizens had to answer “Yes” or “No” to the question: “Do you consider it necessary to preserve the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a renewed federation of equal sovereign republics, where human rights and freedoms will be guaranteed to all nationalities?” A lot of criticism was voiced regarding the vague wording, which allowed the results to be interpreted very broadly. But for most Soviet citizens, the question presented a simple choice between the two options: they had to say whether they were for or against the existence of the Soviet Union. In the course of the preparation for the referendum, it became clear that the USSR as it was no longer existed, as Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Georgia, Moldova and Armenia had declared they would not hold an all-out referendum on their territory. There, votes were held in some designated areas: polling stations worked in a number of organizations, enterprises and military bases. Some of those republics that agreed to run the referendum made changes. In the Ukrainian SSR, a supplemental question was added to the main one: “Do you agree that Ukraine should be part of the Union of Soviet Sovereign States on the basis of Ukraine’s Sovereignty Declaration?”The republic’s population was en masse not bothered by the inherent conflict within the wording, between the preservation of the USSR and the republic becoming its part as a “sovereign state” based on the 1990 Sovereignty Declaration. That can be easily explained by the fact that nothing really changed after sovereignty was enacted, except some attempts to introduce a new currency. A total of 113.5 million people, or 76.4% of USSR citizens, voted for the preservation of the Soviet Union. The referendum showed that despite the growing disagreements, Soviet people wanted to continue living in one big state. 70% of the Ukrainian SSR’s population were in favor, and 80% said yes to the republic joining the union of sovereign states on the basis of the Sovereignty Declaration. In Ukraine’s western parts, around Lvov, Ivano-Frankovsk and Ternopol, however, the majority of the population voted against the preservation of the USSR. It did seem at the time that Gorbachev had received the green light to go on with the reforms and get the New Union Treaty signed. However, due to the failed coup d’état attempt by the State Committee for the State of Emergency (GKChP), undertaken between August 18 and 21, 1991, to “stop the policies leading to the liquidation of the Soviet Union,” the New Union Treaty was not signed as scheduled. These events gave impetus to the disintegration process. In a matter of days, between August 20 and 31, 1991, Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan declared their independence. Thus, the results of the Soviet Union referendum ceased to have any significance five months after it was held. The union’s republics moved on and held independence referendums, one by one. Eventually, on December 1, 1991, Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union. The leadership of the Ukrainian SSR, which until then was still a Soviet republic and part of the Communist Party’s system, had spent those few months since the August 1991 attempted coup d’état waiting for the right moment. Another factor that played a role was the fact that Gorbachev had Vladimir Ivashko moved from Kiev to Moscow as his new deputy. Ivashko was at the time chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR and head of the Ukrainian Communist Party. Gorbachev’s idea was to strengthen the ties between the leaderships this way and secure more support for himself in his fight against Yeltsin. However, the move backfired: Ivashko, who was a native of Kharkov in Eastern Ukraine, was replaced in the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR by Leonid Kravchuk, a Western Ukrainian, and this only accelerated the disintegration processes. When the State Committee for the State of Emergency made its official public announcement of attempting to change the country’s political course on August 19, Kravchuk addressed the people of Ukraine on television with an appeal to “focus on solving the most important problems of the daily life of the republic” and to maintain peace and order. In a conversation with the then Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces of the USSR General Varennikov, Kravchuk gave an assurance that he would be able to independently maintain order in the republic. With Yeltsin declaring himself Gorbachev’s “deputy” during the coup and acting like a de facto leader of the USSR calling for a “strong Russia,” Ukraine’s leaders realized that the time had come for decisive action. Events in Moscow triggered a lot of activity in Kiev. An emergency meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR was set for August 24. Deputies Levko Lukyanenko and Leonty Sanduliak wrote a draft Declaration of Independence overnight, but at the meeting it was decided the document was in need of major adjustments. A commission was set up to do this. Among its members were Alexander Moroz, the future head of the Socialist Party of Ukraine for many years to come, and Dmitry Pavlichko, who claimed that he had fought in the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA is recognized as an extremist organization and banned in Russia) and was tasked to join the Komsomol and the Communist Party as an undercover agent for the WW2 Nazi collaborators in order to help sabotage the regime from the inside. The final draft was a botched job anyway. Moroz later recounted how he’d proposed to remove any words of recognition of Yeltsin’s role from the text of the Declaration of Independence right in Kravchuk’s office: “After our meeting with Kravchuk, I said: let’s remove any wording about Yeltsin’s role in this process, because as time will pass, it will become just awkward. This is a historical document. Everyone agreed, we crossed it out and went to present it for the vote.” The support was almost unanimous. Even the Communists voted for independence. “[The Communists] voted for Ukraine’s independence because they understood that the imperial games of power in Moscow could end badly for Ukraine, and because the precedent was already set by Vilnius and Tbilisi ... It all boiled down to who would take power, Gorbachev or Yeltsin,” Moroz, who would become chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, said later. Nevertheless, most Ukrainians didn’t want to break up the country and sever economic and political ties with Russia – the two republics had close connections, including familial ones. At the March referendum that was held in the USSR the overwhelming majority of Ukrainians voted for keeping the Soviet Union. That’s why Kravchuk and his government needed to rally people’s support ahead of the referendum on Ukrainian independence to undermine the legitimacy of the USSR vote. There was another factor that contributed to the success of this scenario – Yeltsin, concerned with staying in power, benefited from Ukraine’s declared independence and the referendum. It made signing the renewed Union Treaty impossible, which would inevitably strip Gorbachev of his power and throw him out of the equation in the eyes of the Communist Party elites, as well as regular Soviet people. The plan of the Ukrainian authorities was successful. Almost 85% of registered Ukrainians voted in the referendum held on December 1, 1991. Only one question was asked – about the declaration of independence. The overwhelming majority (90%) said ‘yes’ to gaining independence. The numbers spoke for themselves. 83.9% of Donetsk residents voted ‘yes,’ 83.9% in Lugansk, 86.3% in Kharkov, and 85.4% in Odessa. Crimea had the lowest score in that respect, only 54.2% of people supported the independence scenario. To this day, Ukrainian politicians use those numbers as proof that this was a time when the people came together in their nation-building ambitions. In reality, the overwhelming support of Ukraine’s independence even in the “pro-Russian” regions came as a surprise to many at the time. There were several reasons for the massive ‘yes’ vote, however. First off, people were promised that all ties with Russia would stay intact and there would be no boundaries, cultural or otherwise, between the two states. The authorities also ensured the citizens that the Russian language would be protected. Kravchuk himself said this on a number of occasions. Nobody expected that there would be immediate borders dividing Russia and Ukraine. Subjectively, citizens of the two republics didn’t want a breakup, but they wanted strong power, which the Kremlin couldn’t demonstrate, so Ukrainians thought that there would be more order if the republic gained sovereignty. Many hoped that nothing would really change in the grand scheme of things, while Ukraine’s independence would result in its prosperity. Propaganda promised economic growth comparable to that of Germany and France. After all, before the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was the European leader in steelmaking, coal and ironstone mining, as well as sugar production. People were completely disoriented after the “parade of sovereignties” and August Coup. Another important factor is that the referendum was held at the same time as the presidential campaign, which Kravchuk won. Many didn’t necessarily vote for independence but voted for the “boss,” which was the usual MO for the Soviet people. These were the same people who said yes to keeping the Soviet Union earlier, in 1991. And nine months later they chose Kravchuk and Ukraine’s independence. The referendum on Ukraine’s independence killed the scenario of an updated Soviet Union. The USSR soon disappeared from the map. In his comments on the referendum results, Yeltsin clearly stated that “without Ukraine, the union treaty would make no sense.” At that point, 13 out of the 15 republics had already declared independence and held similar referendums (Russia and Kazakhstan were the only ones that hadn’t done so). The events in Ukraine weren’t shocking, but they put an end to the dream of another union. Ukraine was the second most important republic and without it Gorbachev or Yeltsin had no union to rule over. Nevertheless, even after the results of the December 5 referendum were announced Yeltsin met privately with Gorbachev to discuss the prospects of the Soviet Union. On the same day, during his inauguration, Kravchuk promised that Ukraine wouldn’t join any political unions, but would build bilateral relations with the former Soviet republics. He said that his country would be independent in its foreign policy and institute its own army and currency. The New Union Treaty was never signed, and on December 8, 1991, Belarus, Russia and Ukraine put their signatures under the famous Belovezh Accords, instituting the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). This was the final nail in the Soviet Union’s coffin. Later Leonid Kuchma, the second president of Ukraine, admitted that the Ukrainians had been misled ahead of the referendum: “We weren’t completely honest with the people when we said that Ukraine had been feeding Russia. In our estimates, we just used global prices on everything we manufactured, but we didn’t take into account the cost of products supplied by Russia for free. In 1989, our Economy Institute published a report about the Russia-Ukraine pay balance, and it ended up being negative for Ukraine. Ukraine paid for oil and gas less than for tea or water. The country was forced to sober up when Russia switched to the global prices in trade. This resulted in hyperinflation, the scale of which couldn’t compare to any other former Soviet republics.” Already in the beginning of the 1990s local authorities began to realize that it wasn’t just the issue of economic growth that was presented in a misleading way. During the independence campaign, it was clearly stated that Ukraine would respect the rights of Russian and Russian-speaking citizens, that everyone would be equal and there would be no discrimination. At the end of 1991, Kravchuk promised that forced “Ukrainianization” would not be allowed, and his government would “take decisive action” against any ethnic discrimination. In 1990, after the Ukrainian legislators declared sovereignty, the Crimean parliament scheduled a referendum on the peninsula’s legal status and re-establishing the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. It took place on January 20, and 94% of Crimeans voted for creating an autonomy within the USSR. However, Crimea didn’t turn into a conflict zone in 1991. The Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic even passed legislation granting the peninsula its autonomous status, but within Ukraine. Russia didn’t do anything about it because it was busy dealing with its own problems and the fight between Gorbachev and Yeltsin. The government of Crimea was also satisfied, since it got the right to its own constitution, president and guarantees for ethnic Russians. However, Crimea was not the only region striving for autonomy – other Ukrainian territories also wanted political independence. The International Movement of Donbass lobbied for autonomous status for the Donetsk region, and it even had a scenario in which the Donetsk–Krivoy Rog Republic would be re-established. This was formed in 1918 as part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and included the Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk and Donetsk regions. Ukrainian authorities were able to avert a crisis at the time by passing a law that criminalized activities aimed at undermining Ukraine’s territorial integrity – this could now cost a perpetrator up to 10 years in prison. The government also promised that the Russian language would be equal to Ukrainian in its state-language status, but this never happened; the legislation never went through, even though, according to Kravchuk, independent Ukraine “was going to be a state for Ukrainians, Russians and other ethnic groups.” In the following years, Kravchuk, Kuchma and their successors in office greatly disappointed the Russian-speaking communities of southeastern Ukraine – especially in Donbass and Crimea. After a prolonged political crisis, failed promises to Russian-speaking Ukrainians and two major Western-backed street uprisings (the 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2014 Euromaidan), 22 years and 364 days after the first referendum, the Crimean Autonomous Republic held its last referendum, during which it chose to be reunited with Russia. The Donbass had fought for autonomy since 1991, and now it decided to follow its own way as well, different from that of Ukraine."
2022-08-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/560576-zaporozhye-nuclear-plant-un/,Russia summons UN Security Council over nuclear emergency,"Russia has summoned an emergency session of the UN Security Council to discuss the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, which has been the subject of regular shelling attacks. Moscow wants the chief of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to brief the council on the situation. The move, which was reported by Russian media on Tuesday, was confirmed by the deputy head of Russia’s mission to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, who said the public needed to learn about “Ukrainian provocations.” The meeting is expected to take place on Thursday. Russia says Ukraine has been responsible for a series of drone attacks and artillery strikes at the nuclear site. The latest shelling was reported last weekend. Kiev denies the allegations and claims that Russia has shelled the facility itself to discredit Ukraine. Kiev’s National Security Council has also alleged that Moscow was using the power plant as a military base, keeping heavy weapons and personnel there. The IAEA has not had access to the site since before the Russian-Ukrainian conflict escalated in late February and relies on reports from Ukraine to assess the situation on the ground. The Zaporozhye plant is manned by Ukrainian nuclear workers despite being under Russian control. On Saturday, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi expressed the IAEA’s concern over the artillery strikes, stating that they underlined “the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond.” “I condemn any violent acts carried out at or near the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant or against its staff,” he stressed. Grossi is expected to lead an inspection of the facility for an independent assessment of the situation and verification that non-proliferation safeguards remain in place. The Zaporozhye plant is the largest in Europe and stores tens of tons of enriched uranium and plutonium in its reactor cores and spent fuel storage, according to the IAEA. The watchdog chief earlier said he was alarmed that the security of the radioactive materials may be compromised amid Russian-Ukrainian hostilities. Both Kiev and Moscow stated that they were eager for the proposed inspection to take place. However, it has yet to materialize due to security concerns. The Russian foreign ministry said on Tuesday that the delay played into Kiev’s hands by allowing it to continue its provocative attacks. Moscow called on UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to leverage his authority to speed up the IAEA visit. The UN Department of Safety and Security is acting irresponsibly by stalling the visit, foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova alleged in an interview on Wednesday. Guterres last week said that “any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing.” Russian diplomats and military officials stated that attacks on Zaporozhye power plant could result in a disaster worse than the Chernobyl reactor meltdown and steam explosion in 1986."
2022-08-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/560560-ukraine-grain-africa-problems/,Ukrainian promises on African grain not being kept – NYT,"None of the grain ships that have departed from Ukrainian ports as of Tuesday were headed for African countries most at risk of starvation, according to the New York Times. The first ship to leave via the “grain corridor” arrangement saw its cargo rejected by the buyers in Lebanon, who cited the delivery delay. Since the arrangement took effect on August 1, ten ships have left Ukrainian ports, mainly carrying animal feed. One is headed to England, another to Ireland, while several are on their way to Turkey, Italy and China. None of them are bound for Yemen, Somalia, or other countries facing “catastrophic levels of hunger,” the Times reported on Tuesday. The first ship to reach its destination was the Turkish-flagged Polarnet, which docked in Derince on Monday with 12,000 tons of maize. Celebrating its arrival, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said it “sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia,” adding, “Ukraine won’t abandon you.” Meanwhile, President Vladimir Zelensky told his counterpart Mokgweetsi Masisi of Botswana on Monday that Ukraine was “ready to continue being the guarantor of world food security.” However, most of the 20 million tons of grain held up in Ukrainian ports for the past several months is animal feed, and not intended for human consumption, according to experts quoted by AP. The first ship to leave Ukraine under the “grain corridor” arrangement carried 26,000 metric tons of chicken feed, destined for Lebanon. The Sierra Leone-flagged freighter Razoni sailed out of Odessa on August 1 to much fanfare – only to be turned back from Beirut on Monday, after the Lebanese buyer refused to accept the shipment, on the grounds of it being several months too late. Ukraine accounts for about 5% of the world’s grain exports, while Russia’s share is four times larger. Kiev accused Russia of “blockading” its ports, while Moscow argued that it was the Ukrainian military that mined the sea lanes. Eventually, the UN and Turkey mediated a deal to arrange safe passage for ships using Ukrainian ports. Outbound vessels are inspected to ensure they are carrying grain, fertilizer and food, while incoming ships are checked for weapons. The deal was also supposed to address Western sanctions against Russian shipping, which effectively prevent Moscow from delivering food, fertilizer and other goods to customers in Africa and South America. In an op-ed published last month in several major African outlets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov vowed that Moscow was “taking all measures” to ensure the delivery of contractually promised supplies."
2022-08-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/560543-crimea-air-base-blasts/,Several blasts rock Crimea (VIDEOS),"A Russian military air base was at the center of several blasts that occurred in Crimea on Tuesday, according to the country’s defense ministry. Officials in Moscow have attributed the explosions to an accidental detonation of ammunition, insisting that the installation had not been attacked. Local authorities have confirmed that at least one person was killed in the incident, with five more hospitalized. The number of injured was later updated to nine. The predominantly Russian-speaking Crimea used to be part of Ukraine, but joined Russia back in March 2014 following a referendum on reunification which came after the Maidan coup in Kiev. The first reports of explosions, accompanied by cell-phone videos of their immediate aftermath, appeared on Tuesday afternoon on the Russian Telegram channel Baza and in local media. Major Russian media outlets soon also ran reports of the blasts, with Crimean authorities later confirming the incident. The first explosion is said to have taken place at around 3pm local time, and this was followed by several more. According to eyewitnesses, the incident occurred in the village of Novofyodorovka, where a Russian military air base is situated. The initial footage that circulated on social media and was reposted by Russian news outlets shows clouds of gray smoke rising in the distance. One video apparently captured the sound of one of the explosions as well. Several media outlets, citing eyewitnesses, reported that windows in nearby buildings had been shattered as a result of the blasts. During the course of the day, Sergey Aksyonov, the governor of Crimea, posted a string of videos on his Telegram channel, updating his subscribers about the blasts at the airfield. The official said a 5km zone around the epicenter had been cordoned off by police in order to ensure that “local residents don’t get injured.” He added that paramedics as well as air medical services were working at the scene. Aksyonov, however, stopped short of issuing any comment regarding casualties at first. Later in the day, the official did confirm one death, saying that “now official information is coming in, unfortunately, we have one fatality.” He also clarified that residents in the immediate vicinity of the airfield would be relocated. Aksyonov promised that nobody who had suffered from the blasts would be left “without help.” The governor also pledged to issue updates on social media if and when more details are established, calling on his subscribers to stick to official comments issued by the defense ministry regarding the cause of the blasts. Crimea’s health ministry confirmed that five people sustained injuries in the incident, including one minor. All are said to have been hospitalized, with their condition being described as non-life-threatening. Russia’s tourism industry association posted a message on its Telegram channel, advising that “according to preliminary information, the explosion happened far away from the tourist zone,” with no casualties among holidaymakers. Later in the day, Russia’s defense ministry issued a comment on the incident. It said the blast had been caused by ammunition that had “detonated” at the Saki military air base. Moscow’s military insists that its installation did not come under fire. The statement added that the incident had not led to any casualties among personnel or any damage to military aircraft stationed at the base. “The fire is being extinguished, and the cause investigated,” the ministry said."
2022-08-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/560545-casualties-crimea-explosions/,One dead in Crimea blasts – governor,"One person has been killed in a series of explosions that rocked a Russian military airfield in Crimea on Tuesday afternoon, the region’s governor has revealed. Nine more people have sustained minor injuries as a result of the incident, according to the local health ministry. Officials in Moscow earlier put the blasts down to an accidental detonation of ammunition and denied they had been caused by an enemy attack. Sergey Aksyonov, the head of Crimea, who is at the Saki airfield, posted a video on his Telegram channel, saying that “unfortunately, now official information is coming in, unfortunately, we have one fatality.” The official pledged to issue updates on social media if and when more details are established. Crimea’s health ministry initially confirmed that five people injured in the incident, including a child, have been hospitalized, with their condition being described as non-life-threatening. That number was revised up to nine in a later update. In his latest video, Aksyonov also urged everyone to only seek and accept official comments, such as those issued by Russia’s defense ministry, regarding the cause of the blasts. The official went on to give assurances that the “number of ambulances [working at the scene] is sufficient,” with the situation there describes as “under control.” The Crimean governor also explained that householders in the immediate vicinity of the airfield will be relocated. On top of this, Aksyonov also promised that no local resident who has been affected by the blasts will be left “without help.” The first reports of several blasts in the village of Novofyodorovka, many accompanied by eyewitness footage, appeared on several Russian Telegram channels at around 3pm local time. The incident was later confirmed by Crimean authorities and eventually by the defense ministry in Moscow as well. Commenting on the explosions in Crimea on Tuesday, Ukraine’s defense ministry said that it has been unable to ascertain the cause of the fire that led to the incident. Officials in Kiev, however, did name a “violation of fire safety regulations” as the most likely reason behind the fire. The ministry added that Moscow could use the blasts in its “information war and that the Russian occupiers will ‘accidentally’ find” some clues pointing to Ukraine’s involvement."
2022-08-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/560531-ukrainian-statements-information-warfare/,Zelensky aide explains Ukraine's ‘information warfare’,"All public remarks by Ukrainian officials are part of information warfare against Russia, Mikhail Podolyak, an aide to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenksy, claimed in an interview on Tuesday. The comment came as Podolyak was discussing Kiev’s plans to take back the city of Kherson from Russia with the BBC. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly claimed that a major counterattack was looming and that Russia was concentrating its forces in return, suggesting that a major battle in southern Ukraine was about to break out. Speaking to the British broadcaster, Podolyak said that “war is a dynamic process” that entails “a constant correction of tactical goals” and that he preferred to discuss “the possibility of lifting the blockade in broad terms” rather than particular maneuvers. When pressured on the promises of a counteroffensive, he conceded that they could have been meant to deceive Russia. “Certainly, all public comments are part of information warfare. We need to demoralize the Russian army,” he said. The official erroneously called Kherson the largest city captured by Russia since attacking Ukraine in February, explaining its symbolic importance for Kiev. The port of Mariupol is bigger, the BBC noted in an editorial remark. Zelensky’s adviser claimed that Ukrainian forces were waging a “creative war,” as opposed to Russia, which he believes has little regard for its own casualties. “Russia hates us so much that it is ready to lose 100,000 of its people just to prove that it has the right to kill,” he declared. Podolyak said that Zelensky will remain in power in Ukraine for as long as the armed conflict continues, dismissing the idea that the country could hold a presidential election before the hostilities end. Responding to the widely-used assertion that the government would fight “to the last Ukrainian,” he said the fight would be “to the last Russian citizen in Ukrainian territory.” He ruled out Kiev’s military defeat as a possible scenario, predicting that Western nations will funnel weapons to Ukraine regardless of the cost. Western nations won’t negotiate a truce with Russia at the expense of Ukraine “because the reputation of President Zelensky is such that no such talks can be held behind his back,” Podolyak said. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/560535-crimea-airfield-explosions-russia/,Russian military comments on Crimea blasts,"Russia’s Defense Ministry has released an official statement on Tuesday's explosions at the Saki military airfield on the Crimean Peninsula, ruling out the idea of an attack from Ukraine. Officials explained that the incident was caused by the detonation of munitions, used in aviation, that were stored at the site. The blasts occurred near the city of Novofedorovka on Tuesday afternoon, with locals reporting hearing several explosions coming from the airfield and sharing videos online showing smoke coming from the area. According to eyewitnesses, the blasts had knocked out the windows in houses near the airfield. Moscow has stated that no one has been injured in the explosion and that none of the aviation equipment at the airfield was damaged by the blasts. “Measures are being taken to extinguish the fire and find out the causes of the explosion. According to a report from the site, there was no fire impact on the bunded ammunition storage area at the airfield,” the Defense Ministry said. Local authorities have said that all necessary measures have been strengthened to ensure the safety of infrastructure facilities and of the population near the airfield. Novofedorovka is located on the coast of Crimea about 40 kilometers northwest of the regional capital, Simferopol. The Saki air base is on the outskirts of the settlement and some personnel live in the town. During Soviet times the airfield was a training center for pilots of aircraft carrier jets. The Russian navy has been using it to train pilots since Crimea rejoined Russia in 2014."
2022-08-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/560533-zelensky-ukraine-kiev-us/,"Glenn Diesen: As the tide turns in Ukraine, is the US preparing to throw Zelensky under the bus?","In a display of support, the US has protected Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky from any criticism ever since Russia attacked Ukraine in February. As it becomes evident the war has been lost, someone will have to take the fall, and it appears that Washington is preparing to throw the leader in Kiev to the wolves. The US proxy war against Russia was beneficial for Washington as long as there was a stalemate that was draining Moscow’s military, economic and human resources, even threatening to demote Russia from the rank of a great power. For example, Congressman Dan Crenshaw justified his support for the process by arguing that “investing in the destruction of our adversary’s military without losing a single American troop strikes me as a good idea.” After more than five months of grinding down the Ukrainian military, the entire frontline is cracking. By punching through the heavily fortified defenses in Maryinka, Peski, Avdeevka, it appears that Moscow has sealed the fate of Donbass. As the fighting moves out of heavily populated industrial areas to a more open landscape, the territorial advancements of Russia will likely intensify. Furthermore, sanctions have backfired terribly on the West, causing a political crisis. Meanwhile, a new security crisis has emerged in East Asia that is more deserving of US focus and resources. The US and UK built a narrative of victory when they convinced Zelensky to abandon peace talks with Russia in March, but now Washington needs to adapt the narrative for Kiev’s pending loss. Until very recently, the US successfully upheld the international image of Zelensky as some sort of reincarnation of Winston Churchill. Washington dominated the information war in which the complexity of the proxy fight was simplified with dichotomous imagery of the two leaders. Zelensky and Putin were successfully portrayed as a virtuous democrat versus a vicious dictator, a victorious David versus a failing Goliath. Presenting conflicts as a struggle between good and evil is an ideal strategy to mobilize public support and to depict the lack of compromise as a moral position. However, when a war is lost and compromise is necessary, the narrative must be changed. President Joe Biden must defend his weak political position at home and allies must be reassured about American resolve, thus there needs to be a fall guy to take the blame for the pending disaster. While Washington will continue to send more weapons to bleed Russia, it appears to be simultaneously preparing for defeat by no longer shielding Zelensky from criticism. It has been a remarkably difficult month, so far, for Zelensky in the Western media, which had previously withheld all criticism. New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, closely linked to the White House, reported that “there is deep mistrust between the White House and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine – considerably more than has been reported.” Friedman also detailed Washington’s growing concerns about Ukrainian corruption and mismanagement, a topic that has been denounced as Russian propaganda since February. This is the same media that until recently repeated every line from Zelensky, including labeling the mass surrender in Mariupol as an “evacuation.” No more. It is seemingly also no longer taboo to report on the internal divisions in Ukraine as a source of failure. The New York Times reports on Zelensky’s reckless purge of the military and security services, while the Washington Post accuses Zelensky of sidelining mayors and centralizing control over all recovery aid “to weaken any future political rivals.” Sky News, a very anti-Russian news agency, also aired a segment with the title “Zelensky ‘not all he’s portrayed as’ by Western media.” An anchor accused Zelensky of dismantling Ukrainian democracy by seizing control of the national media, banning political opposition parties, and arresting the opposition leader. All true, but previously taboo. Piling on, Amnesty International thereafter reported that Ukraine has been breaking the rules of war and international humanitarian law by establishing military positions in heavily populated residential areas, schools, and hospitals. It later partially backed down after a Twitter onslaught from pro-Kiev media figures, but stood by its overall findings. The National Review speculates that the White House is quietly distancing itself from Zelensky to prepare a narrative to explain the shift from an uncompromising position to accepting concessions. It thus predicts that the Biden narrative will be “We did everything we could to help the Ukrainians defend themselves, but in the end, they were too incompetent, too corrupt, and too beset by infighting.” Such a scapegoating would follow the precedents set in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the inadequacy and ineptitude of the protectorate were blamed for the failure. It is worth remembering that, in late 2013, a previous government in Kiev begged Brussels to replace an EU-Ukraine deal with a trilateral EU-Ukraine-Russia deal, as then President Viktor Yanukovich recognized that forcing Kiev to choose between the West and Russia would split the country. After declining the EU’s Association Agreement, the US supported regime change in Kiev to install a more compliant government. Washington later backed the “anti-terrorist operation” against those in eastern Ukraine who opposed the new authorities in Kiev. And after the new Ukrainian authorities lost that battle, the Americans worked towards undermining the Minsk peace agreements for the next seven years. The story of Zelensky is also a case study in the tragedy of proxy conflicts. As a civilian, Zelensky often appeared on TV arguing passionately against draconian laws targeting the Russian language and culture as it would fragment Ukraine. His presidential campaign was similarly a peace platform, pledging to speak to the leaders in Donbass and seek peace with Russia. The Ukrainian people gave him an immense mandate for this by rewarding him with 73% of votes in a landslide victory. Yet, after pressure from Washington and threats from the nationalists that the US armed and empowered, Zelensky reversed his entire position. The proxy war between NATO and Russia in Ukraine has been a tragic mistake that has brought immense suffering. After goading Ukraine into a devastating conflict with Russia, the US is now demanding that Zelensky take the blame."

The blasts were caused by the detonation of ammunition at the base, the Russian defense ministry said in a statement, adding that nobody was hurt in the incident. Images posted on social media showed clouds of smoke rising behind houses and the sound of multiple explosions can be heard in the video footage. Smoke from the scene rose high enough to be seen from nearby beaches. The Head of the Republic of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov acknowledged an incident had taken place in Novofedorovka and said he would investigate the situation. Hospitals in the Saki region and the nearby resort city of Evpatoria despatched ambulances, RIA Novosti reported. Novofedorovka is located on the coast of Crimea about 40 kilometers northwest of the regional capital, Simferopol. The Saki base is on the outskirts of the settlement and some personnel live in the town. During Soviet times the airfield was a training center for aircraft carrier jet pilots.

2022-08-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/560525-russia-destroys-himars-rockets/,Russia destroys hundreds of US-made rockets in Ukraine – MoD,"Russian forces have destroyed a large amount of munitions for American-made weapon systems after striking a depot in central Ukraine, Russia’s Defense Ministry said on Tuesday. In its daily update, the ministry claimed that the strike was carried out near the village of Uman in Ukraine’s Cherkasy Region via long-range high-precision sea-based weapons and destroyed over 300 rockets for HIMARS multiple rocket launch systems. A large amount of ammunition for American M777 howitzers was also taken out, it said. The report follows an update from August 7, when the ministry claimed to have hit over 45,000 tons of NATO-supplied ammunition in southern Ukraine along with five other ammo depots. In late July, Russia reported eliminating over 100 US-made HIMARS rockets in Ukraine’s Dnepropetrovsk Region, along with 120 Ukrainian military personnel guarding the facility, as well as foreign mercenaries and technical specialists. The ministry says that it is actively monitoring foreign fighters and specialists that have arrived in Ukraine, noting that their number has been reduced to 2,190 from 2,741 in early July. It also reported that between July 8 and August 5, 175 mercenaries joined Kiev’s forces, but said that it’s not enough to cover the losses in their ranks. “During the specified period, we can reliably confirm the elimination of 335 foreign fighters,” the ministry said, adding that another 398 had left the territory of Ukraine voluntarily. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-08-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/560521-zelensky-hitler-collective-punishment/,Zelensky using Hitler’s playbook – former Russian president,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky wants the West to seek inspiration from German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev claimed on Tuesday. Medvedev, who now holds the position of deputy chair of the Russian national security council, blasted Zelensky over his call for the collective punishment of Russians. The NATO-backed leader has called for all Russians - regardless of their leanings or circumstances - to be deported from Western countries. “Adolf Hitler tried to implement such ideas about an entire people,” the Russian official remarked. “Any more questions about the nature of the Ukrainian authorities?” Nazi Germany’s extermination of undesirable groups of people, including Jews, Roma, LGBT, disabled individuals and communists, was among the most extreme examples of collective punishment in history. The rebuke, released on Medvedev’s social media, came in response to an interview with Zelensky published by The Washington Post on Monday. Speaking to the US newspaper, he called for Western nations to oust all Russians living on their soil and ban new entries. The proposed expulsions should apply even to opponents of the Russian government, Zelensky said. “The whole population can’t be held responsible, can it?’ It can. The population picked this government and they’re not fighting it, not arguing with it, not shouting at it,” the Ukrainian president was quoted as saying. Zelensky appeared to suggest that Russians abroad who would be forced to return to their home country against their will would then put pressure on the Russian government and make it reconsider its policy towards Ukraine. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-08-09,https://www.rt.com/news/560516-estonia-eu-ukraine-visa/,EU member calls for total ban on Russians,"Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas has urged Schengen countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens. “Stop issuing tourist visas to Russians. Visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right,” Kallas wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. She was apparently unaware that arounds 75% of Russia’s population are already on the continent. The EU suspended air travel from Russia following the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine in late February, but Schengen Area countries have continued to issue visas to Russians, she wrote. Estonia, Latvia and Finland, which border Russia, have therefore been forced to “carry the burden” as “sole access points” into the bloc for Russian citizens, Kallas explained — seemingly forgetting Poland and Lithuania — adding that it was “time to end tourism from Russia now.” The Schengen agreement allows for border-free travel among 26 European countries. These include most EU member states, with the exception of Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Romania and Ireland. The non-EU countries in the pact are Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The Estonian prime minister’s tweet followed a call by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky for all Russians to be banned from traveling to the West for at least a year. “The most important sanctions are to close the borders – because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land,” Zelensky told the Washington Post on Monday. The Russians should “live in their own world until they change their philosophy,” he insisted. Last week, Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu told Bloomberg that the Baltic state wanted to see an EU-wide travel visa ban on Russian citizens in the next round of the bloc’s sanctions on Moscow. Reinsalu made the remarks while in Kiev, where he said the idea had been discussed with Zelensky. Estonia has been a strong supporter of Ukraine during its conflict with Russia, advocating for an even tougher sanctions crackdown on Moscow by the EU. Tallinn stopped issuing most types of visas for Russians shortly after the outbreak of the fighting. However, Estonia can’t prevent Russian citizens from entering if they have a visa issued by another EU member state. A number of other EU nations – Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Czech Republic – have also imposed visa restrictions, but an EU-wide ban would require the approval of all of the bloc’s 27 members."
2022-08-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/560496-zelensky-travel-ban-sanctions/,Ban all Russians from the West – Zelensky,"Calling the current anti-Russian sanctions “weak,” Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky told the Washington Post on Monday that the West must impose a full embargo on all energy imports from Russia and a travel ban on all Russians for at least a year. Interviewed inside his fortified office in Kiev, Zelensky told the Post that “the most important sanctions are to close the borders – because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land.” Russians should “live in their own world until they change their philosophy.” “Whichever kind of Russian … make them go to Russia,” he said, according to the paper, arguing that collective punishment was the only way. “They’ll understand then. They’ll say, ‘This [war] has nothing to do with us. The whole population can’t be held responsible, can it?’ It can. The population picked this government and they’re not fighting it, not arguing with it, not shouting at it.” The Ukrainian leader insisted that this was “the only way to influence” Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking to the Post as if he were addressing the Russian public, he added, “You’re telling the whole world that it must live by your rules. Then go and live there.” The US and its allies – Canada, EU, Japan, South Korea and Australia – have embargoed hundreds of Russian individuals, companies and organizations over what they call an “invasion” of Ukraine. By April this year, Russia had become the most sanctioned country in the world, surpassing Iran, Venezuela, Myanmar, and Cuba combined. US President Joe Biden claimed that the embargo would wreck the Russian economy, only to later blame Putin for US inflation and skyrocketing gas prices. Zelensky’s interview came as the White House announced it was sending another $1 billion worth of weapons and military supplies to Kiev, along with $4.5 billion in cash to prop up the Ukrainian government. He vowed that as soon as Ukraine gets “enough forces and means, we’re going to de-occupy all of our territories.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

The Kremlin confirmed on Monday that President Vladimir Putin neither intends to travel to the UNGA nor address the event online. Instead, the Russian president signed a directive designating Lavrov as the head of the Russian delegation. Due to sanctions, it's unclear whether the US will allow Lavrov to enter the country, even for the global event. He will be accompanied by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin and Russian permanent representative to the UN Vassily Nebenzia, as well as Senator Grigory Karasin and Duma deputy Leonid Slutsky, who chair the foreign affairs committees of their respective parliamentary chambers. The US government sanctioned Slutsky in March 2014, over his support for Crimea rejoining Russia. Lavrov was added to the sanctions list on February 25, as Washington accused him of being “directly responsible for Russia’s unprovoked and unlawful further invasion” of Ukraine. Russia has dismissed the embargo by the US and its allies as unilateral and illegitimate. The UN General Assembly traditionally takes place in the third week of September at the world body’s New York headquarters on the East River. This year’s 77th session is scheduled to run from September 20-26. Under a series of treaties and conventions governing the US’ role as the host country of the UN, Washington is responsible for recognizing the individuals who are accredited by the UN. They are accorded full diplomatic immunity with respect to their official duties. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said last week that he planned to travel to New York and address the UNGA, even though the US sanctioned him in November 2019."
2022-08-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/560481-kiev-holding-europe-hostage/,Ukraine’s nuclear plant attacks holding Europe hostage – Moscow,"Kiev is holding all of Europe hostage by carrying out strikes on the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday, noting that the situation around the facility is growing increasingly dangerous due to heightened activity from Ukrainian forces. Russia has long been calling on the international community to condemn the unrelenting military strikes being carried out by Kiev on the grounds of the plant, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova noted in a statement posted on the ministry's website. She added that the strikes were renewed on Friday and Saturday, and that a catastrophe was avoided only thanks to the “skillful and prompt actions” of the power plant workers, as well as the Russian forces stationed there to provide “comprehensive protection” of the facility. “We can’t ignore the obvious: every day the situation becomes more and more dangerous,” Zakharova warned, noting that Russia regularly sends updated information “from the ground” to the IAEA, providing clear evidence of the “criminal actions of the Ukrainian armed forces, the command of which has finally lost the ability to think sensibly.” “They have apparently lost the basic instinct of self-preservation. After all, by pointing artillery at the operating reactors and the storage of spent nuclear fuel, the Ukrainians are aiming at themselves,” the spokeswoman said, adding that Kiev is now not only targeting the people of Russia and Ukraine, but are taking the whole of Europe hostage and “apparently won’t hesitate to burn it for the sake of their Nazi idols.” Earlier, Russia’s Defense Ministry condemned Kiev’s attack as a “new act of nuclear terrorism,” after last week’s shelling damaged a high-voltage power line, causing a short circuit at the plant and starting a fire at the facility, which was eventually put out. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the attacks on the nuclear facility could have “catastrophic consequences for a huge territory, including the territory of Europe.” “We hope that countries which have an absolute influence on the Ukrainian leadership will use this influence to rule out such shelling,” Peskov said. The Ukrainian side has denied attacking the plant, with President Vladimir Zelensky saying that it was in fact Russia that shelled the facility on Friday and called for a “stronger response” to “Russian nuclear terror.” The nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, Europe’s largest, was seized by Russian forces in late February, when Moscow launched its military operation in the neighboring state. The facility continues to operate under Russian control with Ukrainian personnel. Ukraine and the US previously accused Russian forces of using the plant as cover, a claim that Moscow has rejected. Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned the “suicidal” attacks on the plant, and expressed hope that international inspectors will be able to access the facility soon."
2022-08-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/560476-lithuania-taiwan-russia-china-mongols/,EU politician threatens Chinese and Russian ‘Mongols’,"The ‘Grand Duchy of Lithuania’ will destroy ‘Mongol’ Moscow if the ‘Mongols’ of China invade Taiwan, a ruling party MP from the small Baltic state has declared. Matas Maldeikis chairs the parliamentary committee for relations with Taiwan and has antagonized China before, by leading a delegation of lawmakers to the disputed island in 2021. “If the Mongols invade Taiwan, we will retaliate by destroying the small Mongol village called ‘Moscow,’” Maldeikis tweeted last week, as the Chinese military began exercises around the island. “The Grand Duchy of Lithuania stands with Taiwan!” he added, alongside a portrait of the 14th-century Lithuanian king Algirdas. While calling the Russians ‘Mongols’ is a common racist trope in the Baltic states and Ukraine, applying the same label to the Chinese is somewhat novel. It is on brand for Maldeikis, however, as he has been championing the cause of Taiwan ever since he was elected to the Seimas (the parliament) in 2020. In his Twitter bio, the lawmaker lists himself as the “Head of Parliamentary Groups for Relations with Taiwan and Democratic Russia.” In the first capacity, he led a delegation of Baltic lawmakers to Taiwan in November 2021, prompting Beijing to formally downgrade diplomatic relations with Vilnius. China had already withdrawn its ambassador in August, after Lithuania revealed it would open a de facto Taiwanese embassy. If the Mongols invade Taiwan, we will retaliate by destroying the small Mongol village called ""Moscow"" 🔥🔥🔥 The Grand Duchy of Lithuania stands with Taiwan!#StandWithTaiwan#SmolenskIsLithuaniapic.twitter.com/UcLXUY0zqM Beijing launched massive military drills around Taiwan last week, after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the island against China’s explicit warnings. China regards the island as part of its sovereign territory, though it has been run by the nationalists since their 1949 defeat in the Chinese Civil War and flight from the mainland. In addition to championing the causes of Taiwan and Ukraine, Maldeikis is a fan of the medieval Grand Duchy and has a fixation on the Russian city of Smolensk. Lithuania controlled it for a total of 150 years between 1414 and 1654, but eventually renounced its claims to Russia. By then, the Grand Duchy had already merged into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Eastern European mega-state was later partitioned between the neighboring empires – Austria, Prussia, and Russia – and disappeared in 1791. Maldeikis is an MP of the ruling Homeland Union TS-LKD party, led by Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. His parents were both MPs in the southernmost Baltic state as well. Modern Lithuania has a population of 2.8 million, a quarter of the size of the “small Mongol village” of Moscow."
2022-08-08,https://www.rt.com/news/560487-russia-suspends-us-inspections-nuclear-military/,Russia suspends US inspections of nuclear military sites,"Moscow has informed Washington of a “temporary withdrawal” from the inspection regime under the START nuclear disarmament treaty, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced on Monday. Citing provisions in the document for “exceptional circumstances,” Russia claims Western sanctions have prevented its inspectors from performing their duties, thus giving their US counterparts an unfair advantage. Once the principle of parity and equality is restored, the previous arrangements will resume, the statement added. Moscow cited “anti-Russian unilateral restrictive measures” imposed by the US and its allies, such as visa restrictions on Russian inspectors and a ban on Russian aircraft in US and EU airspace. These restrictions effectively make Russian inspections under the treaty impossible, while the Americans “do not experience such difficulties.” “The Russian Federation is now forced to resort to this measure as a result of Washington’s persistent desire to implicitly achieve a restart of inspection activities on conditions that do not take into account existing realities, create unilateral advantages for the United States and effectively deprive the Russian Federation of the right to carry out inspections on American soil,” the Foreign Ministry said. Russia “raised this issue with the relevant countries, but did not receive an answer.” Until these problems are resolved, “it would be premature to resume inspection activities under the START Treaty, on which the American side insists.” As justification for the measure, Moscow cited the relevant section of the treaty protocol that covers extraordinary circumstances. Washington has been officially informed through diplomatic channels. “We would like to emphasize that the measures we have taken are temporary. Russia is fully committed to complying with all the provisions of the START Treaty, which in our eyes is the most important instrument for maintaining international security and stability,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said. As soon as the “existing problematic issues” are resolved, the inspections can resume again in full, according to Moscow. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (known as New START) went into effect in 2011, and limits the number of nuclear warheads and their delivery vehicles that the US and Russia are allowed to possess. It is the only remaining arms control agreement between the two nuclear powers, after the US withdrawal from the INF and Open Skies treaties in recent years. New START almost expired before it was extended in February 2021, and is supposed to remain in effect until 2026. Though US President Joe Biden said he had offered Russia talks on a new treaty, which would include China as well, Moscow said last week that it had received only “declarative statements” and not concrete proposals."
2022-08-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/560472-german-media-zelensky-shady-affairs/,German media sheds light on Zelensky’s ‘secret deals’,"German newspaper Die Welt has put Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky’s “secret deals” under the microscope by carrying an extract from a new book which suggests the head of state may have evaded taxes at home. The paper cited parts of “Zelensky: A Biography” that deal with alleged cases of corruption involving the Ukrainian leader. It says that in 2019, Zelensky was found to have offshore accounts in Cyprus, and research by Slidstvo.info revealed that the former comedian owns companies in the British Virgin Islands and Belize, including the “previously unknown” Maltex Multicapital Corp., which owns apartments in central London worth $7.5 million. The corporation is also said to have received a total of $40 million from Ukrainian oligarch Igor Kolomoysky since 2012. Zelensky apparently transferred his shares in this company to a close friend shortly before the 2019 presidential election, which he went on to win. While it was not clear what the purpose behind the scheme was, Ukrainian investigative journalists speculated at the time that Zelensky might have used it to dodge taxes at home, or that he participated in money laundering for Kolomoysky. The excerpt also states that the airing of a documentary called ‘Offshore 95’, which centered on Zelensky’s alleged shady dealings revealed in the Pandora Papers, was canceled in Kiev at the last minute last October. The cinema’s manager had apparently received a call from the SBU, Ukraine’s security service, the extract said, citing Ukrainian media. It was only thanks to public outcry that the screening did take place later in the day, it said. Despite initially refusing to answer questions posed by Slidstvo.info, Zelensky’s office explained in October 2021 that “everyone relocated their business abroad, especially in the TV industry” during the “Yanukovich times,” a reference to former President Viktor Yanukovich. Zelensky also claimed that the tax authorities looked into his dealings “almost every day” at the time, implying that they never found any violations. He also vehemently denied involvement in any money laundering, but dodged a question about whether he had actually paid all the taxes due at all times. A journalist from Slidstvo.info was, however, apparently not satisfied with the president’s reply and suggested the next day that the mere existence of this offshore corporation pointed to the fact that Zelensky does not “trust the country in which you built up your business and which you are in charge of.” “You want to conceal something, and you have a reason for that,” she said. According to the book, on October 27, Ukraine’s National Agency on Corruption Prevention announced that it had conducted a probe into Zelensky’s business activities and found nothing illegal."
2022-08-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/560471-russia-pontoon-crossing-ukraine/,Russia unveils solution to Ukrainian bridge bombing,"Russian forces are constructing a pontoon bridge across the Dnepr river in Kherson Region in southern Ukraine amid renewed shelling from Kiev’s forces, Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the local administration, told TASS on Monday. The crossing will be used as a backup for the damaged Antonovsky bridge, which is a strategically important site. “The pontoon crossing will consist of barges which will not sink even if struck by a Ukrainian shell,” Stremousov explained. “This will be a single pontoon that people will be able to drive through,” he noted. The re-opening of the Antonovsky bridge was supposed to take place on Wednesday, but it was delayed after Ukrainian forces renewed their attempts to destroy it on Sunday night. The attack struck equipment brought to the site to repair damage from previous artillery strikes, such as a concrete mixer and a temporary shack, and has created new gaps in the bridge’s structure, Stremousov said. However, the official claims the bridge has not sustained any “critical damage” and has described the incident as “nothing terrible.” He has stated that the planned reopening of the bridge for traffic is being delayed only slightly. According to various sources, including the Ukrainian media, the attack was carried out with US-supplied HIMARS multiple-launch rocket systems. The Antonovsky bridge is a strategically crucial connection between the Russian-controlled city of Kherson and the rest of southern Ukraine. The bridge has been closed ever since Kiev’s forces launched repeated attempts to destroy the crossing several weeks ago."
2022-08-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/560473-cbs-deletes-ukraine-documentary/,CBS caves into Ukrainian pressure on weapons revelations,"CBS News has pulled a documentary and amended a story featuring claims that 70% of foreign weapons never make it to the front lines in Ukraine. The changes were made amid an outcry from the Ukrainian government and its supporters. The documentary originally featured an interview with Jonas Ohman, the founder of a Lithuania-based organization supplying the Ukrainian military. Ohman told CBS that getting foreign weapons to Ukrainian troops involves navigating a network of “power lords, oligarchs [and] political players,” and that of all the aid arriving at the border in Poland, “kind of like 30% of it reaches its final destination.” Amnesty International’s Donatella Rovera also appeared in the film, saying that “there is really no information as to where [the weapons are] going at all.” The documentary was released online on Thursday, and was set to air on CBS on Sunday evening. Pro-Ukrainian social media accounts hounded CBS over the weekend, accusing the American network of spreading “Russian propaganda.” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhail Podoliak waded in, saying there is “no proof” that weapons entering his country are unaccounted for, despite similar warnings from the Russian government, Europol, Canada, the CIA and a number of US Republicans. The documentary was pulled from CBS’ website on Sunday night, and Ohman’s quote removed from a text version of the story. Atop this story, CBS placed a note saying that arms deliveries have “significantly improved” since its filming in April, and that the US sent a senior military official to Kiev in recent days “for arms control and monitoring.” Ohman’s organization issued a statement saying that the documentary took his words “out of context,” but did not deny that 70% of incoming military aid was going missing in April. Weapons were not being “stolen” or “sold on the black market,” the organization explained, but ending up in the hands of “different power players” attempting to “solidify their positions.” Who these players were was left unexplained. CBS said that it is “updating” its documentary and will air the edited version at a later date. Rovera, already slated by the Ukrainian government and its supporters over a recent Amnesty report accusing Kiev of placing weapons in civilian areas in violation of humanitarian law, also attempted to backpedal. In a Twitter post on Sunday, she claimed that the responsibility for tracking arms shipments lies with the states providing the weapons, not with Ukraine. We removed a tweet promoting our recent doc, ""Arming Ukraine,"" which quoted the founder of the nonprofit Blue-Yellow, Jonas Ohman's assessment in late April that only around 30% of aid was reaching the front lines in Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/EgA96BrD9O The Ukrainian government welcomed the CBS retraction. Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba nevertheless declared that the US network had “misled a huge audience by sharing unsubstantiated claims and damaging trust in supplies of vital military aid to a nation resisting aggression and genocide.” “There should be an internal investigation into who enabled this and why,” he concluded. Welcome first step, but it is not enough. You have misled a huge audience by sharing unsubstantiated claims and damaging trust in supplies of vital military aid to a nation resisting aggression and genocide. There should be an internal investigation into who enabled this and why. https://t.co/kkA0boaLXX Others criticized the changes, which journalist Max Blumenthal said were made following “a coordinated freakout by the Ukraine lobby.” “Amazing how the national security state can make a news agency delete accurate information,” conservative podcaster Scott Greer tweeted. “The only counter argument was that the situation was improving, according to the Pentagon lol.” Ukraine has repeatedly argued that an uninterrupted flow of Western weapons are key to its survival on the battlefield. Since February, the US has approved more than $54 billion of economic and military aid to Ukraine, while the UK has committed nearly $3 billion in military aid alone, and the EU has spent another $2.5 billion on arms for Kiev. Despite the influx of weapons, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky remarked last week that his military remains outnumbered and outgunned by Russia’s. Describing the fighting in Donbass as “hell,” Zelensky appealed to the US and its allies for even more arms and equipment, particularly HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems."
2022-08-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/560468-russia-ukraine-nuclear-shelling/,Russia accuses Ukraine of ‘nuclear terrorism’,"Ukrainian troops have committed “a new act of nuclear terrorism” by continuing to shell the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, the Russian Defense Ministry warned on Monday. The nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, in southern Ukraine was seized by Russian forces in late February, when Moscow launched its military operation in the neighboring state. The facility continues to operate under Russian control with Ukrainian personnel. In a daily briefing, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov said that Ukraine’s 44th Artillery Brigade fired at the plant on Sunday from the village of Marganets on the opposite side of the large Kakhovka water reservoir. The shelling damaged a high-voltage power line, causing a short circuit at the plant, Konashenkov said. He added that a fire broke out at the facility, which was then put out. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, it was the second time Ukrainian shelling has caused a fire and a partial power outage at the plant since Friday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the attacks on the nuclear facility could have “catastrophic consequences for a huge territory, including the territory of Europe.” “We hope that countries which have an absolute influence on the Ukrainian leadership will use this influence to rule out such shelling,” Peskov said. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky accused Russia of shelling the Zaporozhye plant on Friday. “Russian nuclear terror requires a stronger response from the international community,” he tweeted, also warning about a potential nuclear disaster. Ukraine and the US previously accused Russian soldiers of using the plant as cover in the fight against Ukrainian troops. Russia has rejected these claims. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the “suicidal” attacks on the plant, expressing hope that international inspectors will be able to access the facility soon."
2022-08-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/560461-bayraktar-drone-factory-ukraine/,Ukraine issues update on proposed Turkish drone plant,"Ukraine’s plan to host a manufacturing facility for Turkish drone producer Baykar is progressing and will be realized despite the conflict with Russia, the country’s ambassador to Ankara, Vasily Bondar, has told journalists. A Ukrainian firm established by the Turkish defense contractor has already bought a land plot where the factory will be built, the diplomat said. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian authorities are in the process of ratifying the necessary agreement with Turkey for it to operate, he told RBK Ukraine. Baykar’s owners “are determined to see the project through because it was virtually their personal pledge to create a plant in Ukraine,” the official claimed. The firm is co-owned and co-run by the sons of its founder, Selcuk and Haluk Bayraktar. The former is the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Ukraine purchased dozens of Bayraktar TB2 strike drones before the conflict with Russia began, with officials in Kiev claiming the weapons would give them an edge on the battlefield against the Donbass forces. In early February, Kiev and Ankara signed a framework agreement on defense cooperation, which included a provision for opening a plant producing TB2s in Ukraine with Ukrainian engines. “In fact, those will be Ukrainian-Turkish Bayraktars in terms of technology and they will be deployed by the armed forces of Ukraine, Turkey and other nations that would buy them,” Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov said at the time. Since Russia began its operation in February, most of Ukraine’s fleet of TB2s has been destroyed, the Russian military has claimed. Moscow has also targeted many defense-related factories in Ukraine as part of its stated goal to “demilitarize” its neighbor. According to Bondar, despite the setbacks, a Bayraktar factory in Ukraine would be a “practical” rather than political endeavor. Ukraine remains a reliable defense supplier for Turkey despite the damage caused by Russia, he added. “We are a responsible partner that does not leave Turkey alone with its problems in terms of supplying the things they need for defense,” he claimed. The Ukrainian diplomat also commented on recent remarks by Erdogan that Russia may host a factory producing Bayraktar drones, which he made after holding talks with President Vladimir Putin. Bondar provided assurance that Baykar had no such plans and downplayed the words of the Turkish president as a joke. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/560458-ukraine-american-contractors-battlefield/,Methods US army uses to hide Ukraine involvement revealed – media,"Ukrainian forces have “had the American military at their side” from the start of the conflict with Russia, the magazine Causeur cited a “well-placed analyst” in French intelligence as saying. Pentagon-hired contractors are allegedly “everywhere on the battlefield.” The claim was published by the right-leaning outlet last week in an analysis of the five-month-long Russia-Ukraine conflict, which, it stated, “is not the fight of David against Goliath,” contrary to what many people believe. “In Ukraine, the Pentagon for the first time subcontracted large-scale warfare,” the magazine cited its source as saying. These “mercenaries” come in addition to the “gigantic” military aid provided to Kiev by Washington, and are not necessarily frontline fighters, according to Causeur. As an example of ‘subcontracted’ warfare, it cited the widely-publicized supply of SpaceX satellite internet access for Ukrainian military officials. CEO Elon Musk initially framed this as an act of charitable support, but media reports later revealed that it was paid for with US taxpayer money. The US decided not to involve its troops in Ukraine, claiming it did not want a direct confrontation with Russia. However, the French magazine said Washington is apparently ignoring the threat of escalation as it pours weapons and private manpower into Ukraine for the sake of “bleeding” Russia, which, the US government hopes, will result in a strategic defeat for Moscow. The magazine also said that Russia appears to be slowly gaining the upper hand over Ukraine as its superior firepower is prevailing over Kiev’s eight-year preparations for a fight for Donbass. The heavy damage caused by Russian artillery and aerial forces have led to dissertations and insubordination among the Ukrainian troops, it said. If the Russian forces progress beyond the heavily urbanized Donbass with its unfavorable terrain, the balance of power could quickly shift in Moscow’s favor, the report said. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-08-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/560455-ukraine-zaporozhye-referendum-russia/,Ukrainian region announces vote on joining Russia,"Zaporozhye Region will hold a referendum on whether to secede from Ukraine and request joining Russia, the head of its administration announced on Monday. Evgeny Balitskiy said that he had signed an order to organize the plebiscite during a regional forum held in the city of Melitopol. Over 700 representatives from various parts of the Ukrainian region approved the idea, according to RIA Novosti. Earlier comments by administration officials indicated the referendum may be held as soon as mid-September. Russian forces took partial control of the region during the initial offensive against Ukraine launched in late February. The eponymous city located in the north of the region on the Dnepr River remains under Ukrainian control. Officials in Kherson Region, another Russia-controlled part of Ukraine, voiced similar plans to put to a vote the proposal of breaking away from Kiev and seeking to join Russia. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky on Sunday reiterated a warning that if the two regions go through with their plans, Kiev will break off all talks with Russia. Moscow in response suggested that the Ukrainian president should address the citizens of those regions. “The thing is, this is what the residents of the region plan. It's not like we [Russia] are holding a referendum. Here, apparently, it is necessary to understand to whom Zelensky is addressing this statement – to the citizens of Ukraine of the mentioned regions or to the citizens of Russia? If it’s to the citizens and leadership of Russia, then we are the wrong address,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on Monday. There have been no peace talks between Russia and Ukraine for months, as Kiev rejected such contacts and claimed it would only negotiate after defeating Russian on the battlefield with the help of Western military aid. Before the talks broke off, the two nations appeared to have made progress in resolving their differences. During a meeting in Istanbul in late March, Kiev had pledged to become a neutral country and accept restrictions on its military. Moscow said it prepared a draft peace agreement based on those proposals, but Ukraine never responded. An indirect Russian-Ukrainian deal was mediated last month by the UN and Turkey to allow grain exports from three Ukrainian ports to resume via the Black Sea. The scheme was formalized in two separate agreements that were signed by Russia and Ukraine with the other two parties. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

The latest overnight attack hit equipment brought to the site to repair damage from previous artillery strikes, including a temporary shack and a concrete mixer, the local government told TASS on Monday. Kirill Stremousov, a Kherson administration deputy head, said the incident was “nothing terrible,” but would likely delay the planned reopening of the bridge for traffic, which was scheduled for Wednesday. Ukrainian media reported overnight artillery attacks on the bridge by Kiev’s troops, with some suggesting that US-supplied HIMARS multiple-launch rocket systems were used. Images purported to be taken during the shelling show a large fire at the massive structure with smoke billowing into the sky. The Antonovsky Bridge is a strategically important connection between the Russia-controlled city of Kherson and the rest of southern Ukraine. Kiev’s forces damaged it two weeks ago in a similar night attack, forcing the city authorities to close the bridge to all traffic. A ferry across the Dnepr was organized near the bridge to compensate for the suspension.

2022-08-07,https://www.rt.com/news/560427-zelensky-russia-nuclear-sanctions/,Zelensky wants Russia sanctioned for ‘nuclear terror’,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has called on Western governments to sanction Russia over Moscow’s supposed “nuclear terrorism.” Meanwhile, Kiev has been accused of shelling a power plant in Zaporozhye, which is controlled by Russia. Ukraine accused Russia on Saturday of firing rockets at the facility. Zaporozhskaya, which is Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, is located in Ukraine’s southern Zaporozhye Region. Officials failed to explain why Moscow's troops would aim weapons at themselves. In a Twitter post on Sunday, Zelensky said that he had spoken with European Council President Charles Michel and briefed him on the battlefield situation in Ukraine, “in particular at the Zaporozhskaya [Nuclear Power Plant]. “Russian nuclear terror requires a stronger response from the international community,” Zelensky continued, adding that he wants the West to impose “sanctions on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel.” Ukraine accused Russia on Saturday of firing rockets at the facility. Zaporozhskaya, which is Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, is located in Ukraine’s southern Zaporozhye Region. While Kiev’s claims have been echoed in the Western media, the plant has been under the control of Russian forces since late February, and Moscow on Friday accused Ukrainian forces of the shelling. Russia has appealed to the UN and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to intervene and force Ukraine to cease firing on the plant. Although the EU has passed seven successive packages of sanctions on Russia since February, it has not targeted the country’s nuclear industry. Europe relies on Russia to provide around 20% of its uranium, and the state’s nuclear energy firm, Rosatom, operates plants in Hungary, Slovakia and Finland, though cooperation with the Russian firm has been suspended at the Finnish installation. French nuclear firm EDF has also signed a series of cooperation deals with Rosatom in recent years."
2022-08-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/560414-amnesty-apologizes-report-critical-ukraine/,Amnesty apologizes after Ukrainian pressure,"Human rights group Amnesty International has issued an apology for a recent report, which, among other things, accused the Ukrainian armed forces of violating “international humanitarian law and endanger[ing] civilians.” Despite days of pressure on social media from supporters of Kiev, the organization has, however, refused to disavow its findings. The document in question was published on Thursday. While lambasting Russian forces, the investigation also took aim at the Ukrainian military, claiming that it had displayed a troubling pattern of “putting civilians at risk and violating the laws of war” by operating from residential infrastructure, including schools. In an e-mail sent to Reuters on Sunday, Amnesty said that it “deeply regrets the distress and anger that our press release on the Ukrainian military’s fighting tactics has caused,” as cited by Reuters. The rights group went on to explain that its “sole objective” in publishing the analysis was to ensure that “civilians are protected.” It also made it clear that it “fully stand[s] by our findings.” Amnesty insisted that its observers had sighted Ukrainian forces in the vicinity of residential areas in at least 19 towns and villages across the country. According to the organization, by positioning its forces in such a manner, the Ukrainian military endangered the civilian populations there by subjecting them to the danger of incoming Russian fire. Soon after the findings were published, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky accused Amnesty of trying to shift the responsibility away from Russian troops. Addressing these criticisms, the group stressed that its findings do not suggest that “Amnesty International holds Ukrainian forces responsible for violations committed by Russian forces, nor that the Ukrainian military is not taking adequate precautions elsewhere in the country.” The rights group added: “Nothing we documented Ukrainian forces doing in any way justifies Russian violations.” Commenting on the group’s findings, Agnes Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general, emphasized that “being in a defensive position does not exempt the Ukrainian military from respecting international humanitarian law.” Zelensky, however, lashed out at Amnesty, proclaiming that anyone who doubts that “Ukraine is a victim” is an “accomplice of Russia – a terrorist country – and a terrorist themselves and a participant in the killings.” Ukrainian officials have also insisted that Kiev is doing its best to evacuate civilians out of harm’s way. Russia, in turn, pointed out that it had repeatedly called out Ukrainian troops for using civilians as “human shields,” and Amnesty’s findings only serve to confirm that."
2022-08-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/560419-ukraine-weapons-lost-cbs/,70% of Western weapons sent to Ukraine don’t reach troops – CBS,"With the US and its allies pledging unprecedented levels of military support to Ukraine, a recent CBS News report suggested that only around 30% of the weapons sent by the West actually make it to the front lines. The report adds to ongoing rumors of waste, corruption, and black market profiteering. The US has approved more than $54 billion of economic and military aid to Ukraine since February, while the UK has committed nearly $3 billion in military aid alone, and the EU has spent another $2.5 billion on arms for Kiev. An entire spectrum of equipment, from rifles and grenades to anti-tank missiles and multiple launch rocket systems have left the West’s armories for Ukraine, with most entering the country through Poland. However, this rarely goes smoothly, CBS News revealed this week. “All of this stuff goes across the border, and then something happens, kind of like 30% of it reaches its final destination,” Jonas Ohman, the founder of a Lithuania-based organization supplying the Ukrainian military, told the American network. Ohman said that getting the weapons to the troops involves navigating a complex network of “power lords, oligarchs [and] political players.” The new CBS Reports documentary, ""Arming Ukraine,"" explores why much of the billions of dollars of military aid that the U.S. is sending to Ukraine doesn't make it to the front lines: ""Like 30% of it reaches its final destination."" Stream now: https://t.co/Ob7Y3EsWknpic.twitter.com/YgVbpYZkHn “There is really no information as to where they’re going at all,” Donatella Rovera, a senior crisis adviser with Amnesty International, told CBS. “What is really worrying is that some countries that are sending weapons do not seem to think that it is their responsibility to put in place a very robust oversight mechanism.” Ukraine insists that it tracks each and every weapon that crosses its borders, with Yuri Sak, an adviser to Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov, telling the Financial Times last month that reports to the contrary “could be part of Russia’s information war to discourage international partners from providing Ukraine with weaponry.” However, some officials in the West have sounded alarm bells. A US intelligence source told CNN in April that Washington has “almost zero” idea what happens to these arms, describing the shipments as dropping “into a big black hole” once they enter Ukraine. Canadian sources said last month that they have “no idea” where their weapons deliveries actually end up. Europol has claimed that some of these weapons have ended up in the hands of organized crime groups in the EU, while the Russian government has warned that they are showing up in the Middle East. An investigation by RT in June found online marketplaces where sophisticated Western hardware – such as Javelin and NLAW anti-tank systems or Phoenix Ghost and Switchblade explosive drones – was apparently being sold for pennies on the dollar. Ukraine is consistently ranked as one of the most corrupt countries in the world, scoring 122/180 on Transparency International’s 2021 ‘Corruption Perceptions Index’, where 180 represents the most corrupt and 0 the least. In Washington, drawing attention to this corruption is frowned upon by both parties in Congress. Representative Victoria Spartz, a Ukrainian-born lawmaker, has reportedly been cautioned by her colleagues and the White House for suggesting that Congress should establish “proper oversight” of its weapons shipments due to the alleged corruption within Vladimir Zelensky’s government. “If you provide supplies, or a logistics pipeline, there has got to be some organization to it, right?” Andy Milburn, a retired US Marine colonel, told CBS. “If the ability to which you’re willing to be involved in that stops at the Ukrainian border, the surprise isn’t ‘oh, all this stuff isn’t getting to where it needs to go’ – the surprise is that people actually expected it to.” Similar scenarios have played out in the world’s war zones before, with devastating consequences. “We saw a lot of weapons come in 2003 with the US-led invasion of Iraq,” Rovera told CBS, “and then 2014 happened when ISIS took over large parts of the country and took over large stocks of weapons that had been meant for Iraqi forces.” Similarly, US forces invading Afghanistan in 2001 faced fighters whose predecessors had been armed by the US in the 1980s. When the US finally withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban was left to claim billions of dollars worth of military equipment left behind. This gear had been intended for the Afghan military, although reports from more than a decade ago suggested that weapons, vehicles, and aid regularly disappeared in Afghanistan before ever reaching their end users. In Syria, US weapons intended for use by so-called ‘moderate rebels’ ended up in the hands of ISIS and Al-Nusra jihadists, while arms sold to Saudi Arabia ended up seized by Houthi rebels in Yemen. Mikhail Podoliak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, said on Sunday that there is “no proof” that weapons entering his country are unaccounted for. “Russia seeks to discredit Ukraine in the eyes of Western societies with allegations about ‘black market of weapons,’” he added, in an apparent effort to accuse CBS and others of doing Moscow’s bidding."
2022-08-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/560407-workers-washed-away-moscow-sewer/,Workers sucked into Moscow sewer (VIDEO),"All three workers who went missing in Moscow after a powerful downpour hit the Russian capital on Sunday have been found dead. The men were cleaning a sewer pipe when the water level began to rapidly rise. A total of 12 crew members were underground at the time of the accident, according to preliminary data. While some managed to make it out to safety on their own, rescuers who arrived at the scene had to extricate five who were trapped in the sewer. However, the news agency Interfax has suggested a different version of events, alleging that the workers were above ground when the downpour started. According to this report, the men were swept into the open manhole by powerful currents of water. Moscow’s public prosecutor’s office reported on its Telegram channel that “due to a rise in the water level, three [workers] were not able to make it above ground.” The authorities also posted two videos from the site, the latest of which showed rescuers arranging what looks like a hoisting mechanism above the manhole. Later in the day, the prosecutor’s office issued an update, saying that the “body of one of the workers has been located.” Two and a half hours later, the authorities posted another update, stating that the other two men had also been found dead. A probe has been launched to determine whether workplace safety regulations had been properly observed, according to the officials."
2022-08-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/560405-russia-ukraine-depot-nato-strike/,"Russia takes out 45,000 tons of NATO ammo – MoD","The Russian military has taken out a depot in southern Ukraine that stored NATO-supplied ammunition, the Defense Ministry claimed on Sunday. ""In the Voznesensk area of the Nikolaev region an arsenal that stored 45,000 tons of ammunition recently supplied to the Ukrainian Armed Forces by NATO countries has been destroyed,” the ministry stated, adding that Russian forces eliminated five other ammo depots. Meanwhile, the Russian army conducted strikes on the deployment point of units of Ukraine's 72nd mechanized brigade at an agricultural facility in the Donetsk People’s Republic city of Artemovsk, wiping out up to 130 soldiers and eight transport and armored vehicles, the ministry’s statement read. Moscow’s forces, the ministry continued, also used high-precision air-based missiles to attack a howitzer battery of Ukraine’s 95th Air Assault Brigade in the village of Dzerzhinsk in the DPR. According to the statement, the strike killed up to 70 service members, destroyed three 2S1 Gvozdika self-propelled guns and four vehicles. The Russian Defense Ministry noted that faced with high losses, “the regime of [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky is taking measures to make up for the shortage of military personnel” in Donbass. Kiev, the statement said, has decided to send to the frontline mobilized Ukrainian citizens from a training center, as well as wounded service members who did not have enough time to fully recover. On Tuesday, Zelensky said that the fighting in Donbass was “hell,” claiming that Kiev’s military remained heavily outgunned and even outnumbered by Russia. He appealed to the US and its allies for even more weapons, in particular the HIMARS rocket launchers. Moscow has repeatedly warned the West against sending weapons to Kiev, saying it only prolongs the conflict, increases the number of casualties, and will result in long-term consequences."
2022-08-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/560020-donetsk-butterfly-mines-geneva-conventions/,The West is silent as Ukraine targets civilians in Donetsk using banned ‘butterfly’ mines,"On Saturday, July 30, just after 9pm, thunderous explosions rocked central Donetsk. Shortly after, there were announcements that air defense had shot down Ukrainian-fired missiles containing 'butterfly' (or 'petal') mines. Given that over 300 of these explosives are packed into each of the Ukrainian-fired rockets, central Donetsk could literally become a minefield if they successfully landed. Social media and Telegram warnings urged residents to stay inside and wait for Emergency Services to clear the streets and sidewalks – which they began doing during the night. But come daylight, untold numbers of these tiny devices still remained. More warnings were issued to stay at home – better to be late for work than lose a leg. Residents that absolutely have to go out are advised to keep their eyes down to watch where they step, avoid grassy areas, and walk extremely carefully. While Ukraine has been using these mines on Donbass for many months, in recent days, they have intensely bombarded neighborhoods with them. Initially targeted were the hard-hit districts of Kievskiy in the north, Kirovsky in the southwest, and Kuibyshevkiy in the west. But as of Saturday night, Ukraine hammered central Donetsk with them. And now, walking in the city center is a nightmare, one I had to endure to document how widespread these mines are here: in central streets and walkways, near apartments, in parks... Even with warning, these nefarious ""petal""/""butterfly"" mines dropped by Ukraine on Donetsk are hard to see & easy to miss. Ukraine is committing war crimes against the civilians of the Donbass, and has been for 8+ years. pic.twitter.com/p5byG95GVG As it turns out, the ‘petals’ are not only widespread but often very difficult to spot – even if warning signs have been placed right next to them. Their small shape and dull color blends in with the surroundings and if you aren’t actively looking at the spot they’re in, you could easily miss them. When walking, you learn to avoid any objects that could be covering a mine, and tread only on bare streets or sidewalks. The first bunch of mines I saw were circled in chalk, a warning sign placed in front to keep cars from driving over them, and people from stepping on them. This was on a central Donetsk street, a residential area with shops and a park nearby. The entire area was littered with the ‘petals’. DPR sappers worked methodically, clearing area by area. But, given that hundreds of the mines were dropped all over the city, this is painstaking work. pic.twitter.com/F8jd9PA2Yy Near some apartment blocks, numerous mines had been found and warning signs put out: “danger, mines,” it said by the tiny explosive circled with chalk or a tire or whatever was available to draw the eye to its presence. But, on many occasions, looking at the area designated as containing a mine, it took me a good while to actually see it. Now imagine if there were no signs at all ... a bloodbath for civilians, and animals too, since it doesn’t take significant weight to set them off. Around the size of an average lighter, the ‘petals’ are tiny but still very powerful. A clip shared on Telegram illustrates this: A DPR soldier chucks a tire at one of the mines, and the tire is flung high in the air from the blast. It doesn’t take a powerful imagination to estimate what would happen if a person stepped foot on one of them. The explosives are placed via remote delivery methods – meaning they can be spread by mortar, missile, or artillery, dropped by helicopters and planes. According to DPR Emergency services, Ukraine is using Hurricane MLRS-fired rockets to spread the mines. Each contains 12 cluster munitions, each cluster has 26 mines inside. So each bomb has 312. The cluster explodes in the air, disseminating them widely, scattering in different directions. Their butterfly-like design enables them to glide and land without exploding, usually. Then they lie in wait for someone with bad luck to step on them. Some of these anti-personnel mines have a self-destruct timer. Others, including the ones Ukraine is firing, have a years-long shelf life. They do pretty much no damage to military vehicles, and therefore their use in Donbass is insidious – deliberately targeting civilians, to leave them maimed. On July 30, in a densely-inhabited working-class district of western Donetsk, in a field with garden plots for nearby apartment residents, I saw the same nefarious mines. Originally scattered, they had been collected and awaited destruction by DPR Emergency Services. In the large courtyard of an apartment complex, I watched from a safe distance as Emergency Services timer-detonated eight mines they had found around the grounds. The day prior, they destroyed 26. Another 150 were located and destroyed using a radio-controlled minesweeper. But there remains much to be done to restore the streets and courtyards to safety. Since the mines were scattered on Saturday evening, the DPR Representative Office at the JCCC has created an interactive map showing the areas most contaminated by the mines, giving residents a general warning of which areas to avoid while walking or driving in. While some cars have been lucky enough to only have a tire blown out, were the mine to detonate near the gas tank, the entire vehicle could explode. Multiple civilians have been killed by the mines since they were scattered over Donetsk, and, even now, wounded civilians are still coming to the city’s hospitals. According to Vadim Onoprienko, the deputy director of a trauma surgery center, ten amputations have been performed over the last week – victims of Saturday’s mines and ones that had been dropped earlier, one of whom was an 83-year-old man. Pro-Ukrainian commentators are, unsurprisingly, blaming Russia. Journalists claiming to care about civilians are perpetuating Ukrainian propaganda saying that Moscow’s forces are scattering the mines over civilian areas, never mind the fact that these territories are controlled by Russia’s allies. Among them is the would-be war hero Malcolm Nance, who temporarily abandoned his job as a notoriously anti-Russian MSNBC analyst to apparently actually fight the Russians in Ukraine. This is the kind of projection I have seen ad nauseam when reporting from Syria and dealing with the Western propaganda there. Ukrainian nationalists openly admit they do not see the Donbass people as human and encourage their murder. Ukraine has been killing and maiming civilians in the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republic for over eight years, including firing cluster munitions into the heart of cities, targeting hospitals, markets, schools and busy streets. Given all of this, scattering butterfly mines over Donetsk is hardly surprising. It’s criminal, but not surprising. One argument used by pro-Ukrainian commentators is that Kiev has been destroying these mines under the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, which it signed in 1999. However, out of the six million such mines Ukraine initially declared in its possession, only two million have reportedly been destroyed as of 2018. The EU and NATO were helping Ukraine destroy its petal-mine stockpiles as part of the EU-Ukraine agreements back in 2013 per Ottawa Convention. Look how well that went with Donbass suffering from these for 8 years. https://t.co/nepoVXaYnwhttps://t.co/9VbRifiwyapic.twitter.com/aVQdU0bWDn Ukraine has good reason to believe it will not be held accountable for using them against civilians, given its Western backers’ and their allies’ penchant for using prohibited weapons on civilians without repercussions – including Agent Orange in Vietnam, depleted uranium in Iraq and Syria, and white phosphorous and dart bombs in Gaza. The fact the Western media turns a blind eye is also a boon to Kiev."
2022-08-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/560389-grain-ships-ports-turkey/,Four more cargo ships leave Ukrainian ports,"Four ships loaded with food products have departed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports and are heading to Istanbul for inspection, the Turkish Ministry of Defense announced on Sunday. Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Aleksandr Kubrakov, also confirmed this. According to the ministry’s tweets, the vessel Riva Wind is carrying 44,000 tons of corn to the Turkish city of Iskenderun. The Mustafa Necati is heading to Italy with 6,000 tons of sunflower oil, the Star Helena is transporting 45,000 tons of sunflower seeds to China, and the Glory will deliver 66,000 tons of corn to Istanbul. “The ships will be anchored in the north of Istanbul and will be inspected by the Joint Coordination Center,” the ministry said. The center was set up under a deal negotiated by Ukraine and Russia and mediated by Turkey and the UN last month. It includes representatives from Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and the UN. One of the ships departed from Odessa, and three from Chernomorsk. Kubrakov, confirming the departure of the ships, said the number of vessels leaving the Black Sea ports would gradually increase. “We plan to ensure the ability of ports to handle at least 100 vessels per month in the near future,” he added. The news came one day after the Panama-flagged ship Navistar, carrying around 33,000 tons of Ukrainian corn to Ireland, dropped anchor in Istanbul. It was the first ship to depart a Ukrainian port after the recent signing of the grain deal. Two more ships left Ukraine on Friday. Ukrainian grain exports were suspended after Russia launched its military operation in the country in February, leading to growing concerns over global food supplies. Kiev accused the Russian forces of barring civilian ships from leaving the ports, while Moscow accused Ukraine of mining the waters near its harbors, which prevented maritime traffic. In late July, Moscow and Kiev agreed in Istanbul on a deal allowing the resumption of exports from Ukrainian ports. The agreement also includes shipments of Russia’s grain, as well as fertilizers and the raw materials to produce them."
2022-08-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/560380-ukraine-witch-hunt-disloyal-residents/,Ukrainian city launches witch hunt for ‘disloyal’ residents,"The southern Ukrainian city of Nikolaev resorted to drastic measures this weekend to expose what the local authorities call “collaborators” and “separatists” – people who harbor pro-Russian sentiments or help Moscow’s forces in any way. On Friday, the head of the local military administration, Vitaly Kim, placed the entire city – home to almost half a million people before the start of the Russian military operation – on a two-day lockdown. Kim announced a “prolonged curfew,” which came into force Friday evening and is expected to last until Monday. During this time, residents of Nikolaev are prohibited from going outside or visiting any public places without special permits. In case of an emergency, a police escort is provided, Ukrainian news agency UNIAN said. Law enforcement agencies will use this time to search for “collaborators” and “separatists,” Anna Zamazeeva, the head of the Nikolaev regional council, said. The operation is already in full swing, and the police will reveal the results no sooner than Monday, according to the official. “All Nikolaev residents are undergoing checks now,” she told UNIAN on Saturday. Those who planned to leave the city and bought train or bus tickets in advance were allowed to leave, the official said, adding that they were checked at security outposts on their way out. According to Zamazeeva, police are conducting door-to-door searches in apartments throughout the city. “They are searching everyone; check the ID, mobile phones, everything,” she said. The official argued that the “collaborators” would be much safer behind bars since locals could “lynch” them if the police simply reveal their identity. “It is better for them to remain in prison until we win,” she added. Earlier, Kim offered $100 to anyone that provides information about “spotters” – people that Ukrainian officials believe supply target coordinates to Russian artillery and aviation. Earlier, the local authorities reported they had detained at least four spotters. On Tuesday, Russian forces reported striking a temporary base of the Ukrainian International Legion near the city of Nikolaev, using high-precision weapons. Up to 250 foreign mercenaries were killed in the attack, according to the report. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/560376-ukraine-north-macedonia-tanks-planes/,Ukraine thanks North Macedonia for tanks and planes,"Ukraine will soon receive a new batch of military aid, this time from North Macedonia, President Vladimir Zelensky’s aide, Mikhail Podoliak, confirmed on Saturday. According to Macedonian media, the planes Skopje allegedly plans to give Kiev were bought from Ukraine in the early 2000s. On Saturday, Podoliak praised North Macedonia on Twitter for “giving Ukraine a [supportive] shoulder in the form of tanks and planes.” He also said that Skopje is demonstrating “more courage today than half of the G20.” Earlier, videos that surfaced on social media showed battle tanks loaded on trucks being moved along a road somewhere in North Macedonia. According to local media, the Defense Ministry confirmed in late July that the videos were authentic and indeed showed the tanks North Macedonia sought to ‘donate’ to Ukraine. The tanks were previously used in an army battalion that was about to be disbanded, the ministry said, adding that the heavy equipment pieces were “uncompetitive” and could not meet the nation’s defense needs anyway. According to the media, the tanks are Soviet-made T-72s that Skopje obtained from Russia in 2000 during an internal conflict with local separatist groups. It is unclear how many tanks it plans to give Kiev, but the Balkan nation possessed a total of 31. #Ukraine: North Macedonia 🇲🇰 decided to donate its tanks to Ukraine - this was confirmed by the country's Ministry of Defense. Macedonia possesses ~30 T-72A tanks, with at least 8 of them known to be currently being transported to Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/VhEHoff6gw The Russian Foreign Ministry called Skopje’s decision a “big mistake” in late July. Skopje responded by saying that North Macedonia is a member of “the most powerful military-political alliance: NATO,” adding that it “resolutely” supports the position of the US-led bloc. On Thursday, North Macedonia’s MKD news media outlet also reported that Skopje plans to hand over four Soviet-made Su-25 military aircraft to Kiev. The Defense Ministry has neither confirmed nor denied this, but said the details of decisions related to military aid for Ukraine would be “declassified and transparently published” later. According to MKD, the planes were actually purchased from Kiev in 2001. North Macedonia allegedly sought to sell them in 2004 to another nation, but apparently failed to do so. In 2011, it planned to modernize the four warplanes to make them meet NATO standards, but this also did not happen."
2022-08-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/560370-konashenkov-update-military-operation/,Russia eliminates dozens of foreign fighters in Ukraine,"Dozens of foreign fighters from Ukraine’s ‘International Legion’ have been killed by an airstrike in southeastern Ukraine, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said on Saturday. Providing a daily update on the progress of the military operation, Konashenkov revealed that “a high-precision strike” was conducted by the Russian Air Force on a stronghold of the International Legion in the village of Vyvodovo in Dnepropetrovsk Region. As a result, “more than 80 foreign mercenaries and 11 units of special equipment were destroyed,” the military spokesman said. Kiev’s international military unit was created in late February at the request of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, and is officially known as the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine. While its members consider themselves “servicemen in the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” Konashenkov earlier stated that the best thing the foreign mercenaries could expect was a “long term in prison.” He also revealed that while hundreds of foreign mercenaries in Ukraine had been killed by Russian long-range precision weapons “shortly after their arrival,” most of the foreign fighters were eliminated “due to a low level of training and a lack of real combat experience.” In April, the Russian military estimated the number of foreign fighters at around 7,000, but a recent update suggests that less than 3,000 remain in Ukraine. Apart from the International Legion members, over the past day, Russian forces have eliminated more than 400 nationalist fighters from the 46th airmobile brigade of the Ukrainian armed forces near the village of Belogorka in Kherson Region, according to Konashenkov. Over 70 fighters have been destroyed in three other Kherson Region villages, with about 150 personnel left injured, he added. Regarding its own casualties, Moscow has not updated the numbers since March, when it reported 1,351 military personnel killed and 3,825 wounded. Zelensky has conceded that his nation’s armed forces are sustaining heavy losses. In July, he said that Kiev was losing around 30 personnel in combat per day, which was significantly less than in May and June, when the death toll was around 100-200 troops per day."
2022-08-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/560358-biden-us-nuclear-proposal-start/,Russia reacts to Biden’s remarks on nuclear talks,"Russia has not received any concrete proposals to resume talks on replacing the landmark New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), despite recent remarks by US President Joe Biden on the matter, a senior Russian diplomat said on Friday. He also signaled that the negotiations should be held without any preconditions. “Saying that you’re ready doesn’t mean you are,” the deputy head of Moscow’s delegation to the UN Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) review conference, Andrey Belousov, told reporters. According to the diplomat, a real commitment to resume dialogue with Russia “should be supported by concrete proposals, concrete signals” that Moscow could view as a firm decision on the part of the US to “resume close cooperation with Russia on a wide range of issues of strategic stability.” “At the moment, we are not receiving such signals, except for these declarative statements, including those coming from the highest level,” he added. Belousov noted that the timing of the US statements on arms control should also be taken into account. “It is clear that the timing was chosen on purpose. The statement by the US president was made before the Conference [on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons] intentionally to show that the US is still a state you can cooperate with and which is ready to engage in dialogue,” the Russian representative said. According to Belousov, Moscow does not think that the US is ready for constructive talks on the New START treaty that would accommodate the interests of all parties, at least not at this stage. He also noted that Russia views the preliminary conditions for the dialogue set by Washington as “unacceptable.” “The statement by the US president, which, as we believe, reflects a softening of the US stance on resuming dialogue with Russia on a wide range of issues of strategic stability, is linked to some sort of a preliminary condition,” Belousov said, adding that it has not been formulated in black and white, but rather looks like a hint. The high-ranking diplomat recalled that previous statements on the matter were “more specific and understandable.” “There were specific conditions under which the United States would agree to resume this dialogue with us,” he said. “But in any case, no matter how these preconditions are phrased, we deem them unacceptable.” The diplomat echoed comments made by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said on Wednesday that the US had not made any “requests on reopening this negotiating process.” The West, he said at the time, “has developed a habit of making announcements on the microphone and then forgetting about them.” Earlier this month, Biden revealed that Washington was ready to negotiate “a new arms control framework” with Russia that could potentially replace the New START treaty when it expires in 2026. The landmark document, which entered into force in 2011 and was extended in 2021 after Biden’s inauguration, puts caps on the number of strategic nuclear missiles and warheads held by Russia and the US."
2022-08-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/560352-ukraine-nuclear-plant-shelling/,Ukraine risking another Chernobyl – Russia,"Russia has urged the UN and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to make Ukraine stop the “shelling” of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. Moscow accused Ukrainian troops of firing artillery shells at the Zaporozhskaya Nuclear Power Plant in the country’s southern Zaporozhye Region on Friday. The plant was seized by Russian forces in late February, when Moscow launched its military campaign in the neighboring country. The facility continues to operate with Ukrainian staff under Russian control. Igor Vishnevetsky, a senior non-proliferation and arms control official at the Russian Foreign Ministry, warned that the shelling of the plant risks triggering an event similar to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. We would like to appeal to international organizations, especially to the UN and the IAEA, as well as to the countries that have influence on the Kiev regime, so they would take action in order to make the shelling of the nuclear power plant stop immediately. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, “parts of the equipment” at the plant are out of power due to the shelling, and a fire broke out at the facility and was quickly put out. The ministry claimed that “by sheer luck,” the Ukrainian shells did not cause a bigger fire and “a possible nuclear disaster.” The ministry said that Ukrainian troops also shelled the adjacent city of Energodar, causing power outages and disruptions of water supply. The ministry called on the international community to condemn Ukraine for “the acts of nuclear terrorism.” Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky claimed that the shelling of the plant came from Russian troops. “It is not only yet another reason why Russia should be recognized as a state sponsor of terrorism, but also a reason to impose tough sanctions on all of Russia’s nuclear power industry,” Zelensky said on Friday. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Ukrainian officials earlier accused Russia of using the plant as a “shield” for its soldiers. “Russia is now using the plant as a military base to fire at Ukrainians, knowing that they can’t and won’t shoot back because they might accidentally strike a reactor or highly radioactive waste in storage,” Blinken said on Monday at a UN nuclear non-proliferation conference in New York. The Russian delegation to the conference released a statement rejecting Blinken’s claim. “The actions of our Armed Forces don’t damage Ukraine’s nuclear safety in any way and cause no obstacles to the plant’s operation.” IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told AP on Tuesday that the plant needs to be inspected for repairs and “to prevent a nuclear accident from happening.” “The situation is very fragile. Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated one way or the other and we cannot allow that to continue,” Grossi said later at an event in New York."
2022-08-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/560316-biden-renews-arms-control-talks/,"The US keeps reneging on arms control agreements, so why should Russia trust Joe Biden’s latest overtures?","This week, in an address to the Tenth Review Conference for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons – which had convened at the United Nations Headquarters in New York – US President Joe Biden made a forceful appeal to Russia regarding the need to resume arms control talks. “Today,” Biden said, “my Administration is ready to expeditiously negotiate a new arms control framework to replace New START when it expires in 2026.” But, he added, “negotiation requires a willing partner operating in good faith. And Russia’s brutal and unprovoked aggression in Ukraine has shattered peace in Europe and constitutes an attack on the fundamental tenets of international order. In this context, Russia should demonstrate that it is ready to resume work on nuclear arms control with the United States.” Biden has made arms control a central theme in his dealings with Russia. Indeed, one of his first major acts as president was to sign on to a five-year extension of the Obama-era New START treaty, which had been allowed to languish under the Trump administration. “Extending the New START Treaty,” Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, declared in a press release issued at the time, “ensures we have verifiable limits on Russian ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers until February 5, 2026. The New START Treaty’s verification regime,” Blinken noted, “enables us to monitor Russian compliance with the treaty and provides us with greater insight into Russia’s nuclear posture, including through data exchanges and onsite inspections that allow US inspectors to have eyes on Russian nuclear forces and facilities.” Blinken then added a critical statement. “The United States,” he declared, “has assessed the Russian Federation to be in compliance with its New START Treaty obligations every year since the treaty entered into force in 2011.” Unfortunately, Russia cannot say the same about the US. Since 2018, Russia has accused the United States of “converting a certain number of Trident II SLBM launchers and В-52Н heavy bombers, in the way that the Russian Federation cannot confirm that these strategic arms have been rendered incapable of employing SLBMs or nuclear armaments for heavy bombers.” The bottom line is that America accomplished its conversions in a manner which allowed them to be easily reversed, something Russia believed circumvented the intent of New START, which was the permanent reduction of each side’s nuclear arsenals. The US rejected the Russian allegation, noting that New START does not explicitly require the conversions on either the Trident II SLBM launchers or the B-52H bombers to be irreversible. As long as the treaty was in force, the US contended, Russia could use its inspection provisions to verify that the goal of “rendering incapable” was still in place. The Russians, with reason, believe that the US position violated both the spirit and intent of treaty, a position which carried over into the extension of New START. But Russia’s problems with America’s compliance are just one of the issues when it comes to judging whether to trust Washington’s good faith on arms control overall. The US has walked away from three foundational treaties in the past two decades – the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty in 2002, the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) treaty in 2019, and the Open Skies Treaty in 2020. Likewise, America’s intransigence over fairly adapting the conventional forces in Europe (CFE) treaty to reflect post-Cold War realities led to its demise. New START is the last man standing when it comes to arms control accords between Russia and the US. Biden tried to further strategic arms control with Russia, discussing the matter with President Vladimir Putin during their Geneva Summit in June 2021. The two leaders agreed to pursue “an integrated bilateral Strategic Stability Dialogue” that would “seek to lay the groundwork for future arms control and risk reduction measures.” Indeed, two such meetings were on July 28 and September 30, 2021. Following the conclusion of the second round of talks, the negotiators agreed to “form two interagency expert working groups” covering the “Principles and Objectives for Future Arms Control” and the “Capabilities and Actions with Strategic Effects.” But then came the crisis in Ukraine, and the talks gave way to the issue of security guarantees demanded by Russia in the face of NATO expansion, which threatened to bring Ukraine into the fold of the trans-Atlantic military bloc. In direct talks with the US, NATO and the OSCE in January 2022, Russia was repeatedly rebuffed in its efforts to negotiate a new European security framework that considered its national security interests, setting in motion the conditions that resulted in Russia initiating its Special Military Operation in Ukraine, prompting President Biden to terminate the strategic stability dialogue, an action which essentially froze US-Russian relations, at least in the arms control field. Biden’s announcement on restarting talks with Moscow took the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, by surprise. “No requests on reopening this negotiating process have been made,” Lavrov announced during a press conference in Myanmar, adding that the West “has developed a habit of making announcements on the microphone and then forgetting about them.” Regardless of the lack of any prior notice on the part of the US, Russia announced that it was ready to engage in arms control talks at any time, the sooner the better. Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, during a conference call with the media, declared that “Moscow has repeatedly spoken about the necessity to start such talks as soon as possible as there is little time left.” If the New START treaty expired without a replacement, Peskov said, “it will negatively impact global security and stability, primarily in the area of arms control.” For this reason, Peskov noted, “We [Russia] have called for an early launch of talks, but until that moment it has been the US that has shown no interest in substantive contacts on the issue.” Peskov further emphasized that negotiations on a new arms control pact can only be held “on the basis of mutual respect and taking into account mutual concerns.” Washington’s push for talks with Moscow, however, appear to be little more than an effort to get Russia to negotiate away the advantage in strategic nuclear weapons delivery systems that it has accrued in recent years through the development of weapons such as the Sarmat heavy intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and the Avangard hypersonic re-entry vehicle. In this way, the US would have Russia walk away from new systems which cost billions of dollars to develop and field, while the US would only be called upon to give up a handful which have not yet been fully tested and deployed (the US is poised to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming years to replace the Minuteman III ICBM, B-2 bomber, and Ohio-class submarine with a new missile (the “Sentinel”), a new bomber (the B-21), and a new submarine (the “Columbia” class). The high cost of these new weapons is likely to become an issue in a tightening economic environment, which may explain Biden's push for fresh negotiations. The current US approach to arms control negotiations appears to be one-sided in nature, premised on sacrificing existing Russian capacity for future American systems which are currently under development. In addition to this, the US has a poor track record when it comes to either treaty compliance (the ongoing controversy over New START verification of Trident and B-52 conversions comes to mind), or treaty adherence (the US withdrawals from the ABM treaty, the INF treaty, and the Open Skies treaty serve as an historical precedent). The US approach ignores the fundamental approach taken by Russia when it comes to arms control – that any such negotiations must take place as part of a comprehensive restructuring of existing security frameworks that fully integrate Moscow’s legitimate national security concerns. This includes issues pertaining to missile defense (including the two US facilities in Poland and Romania), intermediate nuclear forces (a ban on the deployment of such systems on European soil), and non-strategic nuclear weapons (the US stockpile of B-61 bombs currently stored in Europe, and releasable to non-nuclear NATO members during any potential conflict.) The White House has flipped the script when it comes to advancing the cause of arms control. Former US President Ronald Reagan appropriated a Russian saying– “Trust but Verify”– when discussing his approach to implementing the groundbreaking INF treaty back in 1987. At that time, the “trust” was assumed, and the focus was on constructing appropriate verification regimes to ensure treaty compliance. Today, there is no trust between Russia and the US, primarily because of the dismissive manner which the Biden administration has treated the issue of Moscow’s concerns over European security that has been inexorably linked to aggressive NATO expansion. But the abysmal track record of the US under existing and past arms control agreements must also be considered. Even if Biden were willing to consider Russia’s concerns, the question that must be answered for Russia is whether the Americans can be fully trusted as a partner in disarmament. As things stand today, the answer to this question is, sadly, 'No.'"
2022-08-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/560338-russia-nuclear-doctrine-ukraine/,No prospect of using nukes in Ukraine – Moscow,"Allegations about Russia threatening to use nuclear weapons against Kiev are “untenable and baseless,” the deputy head of Moscow’s delegation to the UN Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) review conference, Andrey Belousov, said on Friday in New York. “This is impossible since Russian doctrinal guidelines strictly limit emergency situations in which the use of nuclear weapons is hypothetically possible, namely in response to aggression involving weapons of mass destruction, or in response to aggression involving conventional weapons, where the very existence of the state is threatened,” Belousov explained. “None of these hypothetical scenarios is relevant to the situation in Ukraine,” he stated. The Russian diplomat also rejected insinuations about Moscow placing its nuclear deterrent on “high alert,” explaining that the current state of “increased vigilance,” with extra personnel on duty at strategic command posts, is “completely different” from an actual “state of high alert of strategic nuclear forces.” Belousov argued that any warnings about a “serious risk of nuclear war” ever voiced by Russian officials in the context of the Ukraine crisis were directed at NATO, as a way to deter Western countries from direct aggression, as they “dangerously balance on the edge of a direct armed confrontation with Russia.” While he did not name the accusers, Belousov’s response comes after the Ukrainian delegation to the NPT conference on Wednesday accused Moscow of “nuclear terrorism” and “openly threatening the world with its ability to use nuclear weapons,” while citing rhetoric by the “Russian media, think tanks and experts.” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also accused Russia of “reckless, dangerous nuclear saber-rattling” to “those supporting Ukraine’s self-defense,” in his address on Monday. Blinken claimed that the US is a much more “responsible” nuclear-armed state, and “would only consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States, its allies, and partners.” In a letter to participants of the NPT conference on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated that there would be no winners in a nuclear war, and that it must never be allowed to happen. US President Joe Biden declared this week that Washington is ready to expeditiously negotiate “a new arms control framework” with Moscow. However, according to Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the US has yet to come up with any proposals regarding an agreement that could potentially replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The landmark New START remains the only major arms control agreement between Moscow and Washington still in force. In early 2021, the deal was on the brink of expiration, but it was ultimately salvaged shortly after Biden’s inauguration, when Washington finally agreed to Moscow’s calls to prolong the deal without any preconditions. It is currently set to expire in 2026."

One of Kiev's projectiles hit a regular bus carrying people home from work, the authorities said, adding that the vehicle was “destroyed.” Photos and videos which surfaced on social media show the charred wreckage of the bus. It was apparently moving along a street in the city when it was hit by a Ukrainian projectile fired by a Grad multiple rocket launcher. Three people died in the incident and five more were injured, the local authorities said. Earlier on Friday, Donetsk authorities claimed that Ukrainian forces had shelled several areas in the city, including a hospital. At least one rocket made a direct hit through the roof, images from the scene indicate. The attacks left at least one person dead and 14 others injured, officials in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) said. Kiev denies the accusations that its forces launch daily artillery attacks on civilian targets in Donetsk. It claims the shelling is done by DPR and Russian forces to discredit the Ukrainian troops."
2022-08-05,https://www.rt.com/news/560335-putin-erdogan-meeting-sochi/,Putin and Erdogan in Sochi: What the two leaders discussed and agreed upon,"Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to Russia’s southern city of Sochi on Friday. The two leaders spent over four hours discussing a broad range of issues, ranging from grain exports to bilateral trade and counter-terrorism efforts. RT outlines the major points of the talks. The Istanbul grain deal should be fully adhered to Both Putin and Erdogan commended the roles played by each other’s countries in reaching a deal on the export of Ukrainian agricultural goods in July. Turkey and the UN helped Moscow and Kiev to negotiate an agreement to allow maritime traffic from Black Sea ports to resume after it was halted amid the Russian military operation in Ukraine. The two leaders agreed that the deal should be “fully implemented” in both “spirit and letter,” a joint statement adopted by Putin and Erdogan said. The unimpeded export of Russia’s grain, as well as fertilizers and the raw materials to produce them, should also be facilitated. The UN has specifically promised to work towards removing obstacles to Russian grain and fertilizer exports. On Friday, Moscow said that restrictions imposed by the US and its allies were still disrupting its grain harvests and could exacerbate the global food crisis. Trade and energy cooperation boost The two presidents discussed a broad bilateral agenda as they pledged to further cooperate in the fields of trade, transport, agriculture, finance, tourism and construction. Moscow and Ankara agreed to “meet halfway” when it comes to each side’s needs in the trade and energy sectors, the joint statement said. Putin praised the fact that trade volumes between the two nations grew by 57% last year and doubled in the first five months of 2022. He also noted that Russia supplies Turkey with all types of energy resources, including oil, gas and coal in a stable and predictable manner, “without any interruptions.” Russia and Turkey also agreed on a new payment mechanism that will entail Ankara paying for a part of the Russian gas it buys in rubles, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Novak told journalists after the meeting. “This is a really new stage; new opportunities, including for further development of our financial relations,” he said.

2022-08-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/560333-amnesty-stand-by-report-ukraine/,Amnesty fully ‘stands by’ report on Ukraine,"Amnesty International said on Friday that it stands by a report in which it accused Kiev of endangering civilians by placing its military assets in schools and residential areas. The investigation drew the ire of the Ukrainian government and President Vladimir Zelensky. The NGO “fully stands by our research,” Secretary General Agnes Callamard told the news agency AFP in an emailed statement. She also took to Twitter to state that her organization stands “by all victims. Impartially” and lashed out at those she called “social media mobs and trolls” that are “attacking” Amnesty’s investigations. This is called war propaganda, disinformation, misinformation. This won’t dent our impartiality and won’t change the facts. Earlier, Zelensky accused the NGO of shifting “the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim,” referring to Russia and Ukraine, respectively. The president stated that any report equating the actions of “the victim and the aggressor” in “some way” cannot “be tolerated.” The report, which was released on Thursday, accused Kiev of “a clear violation of international humanitarian law” as it documented that Ukraine was placing its military close to civilian infrastructure, thus putting civilian lives at risk. In particular, the NGO said it found evidence of current or prior military activity in 22 out of the 29 schools it visited in Ukraine between April and July. It said that Ukraine’s unlawful military use of civilian objects did not “in any way justify indiscriminate Russian attacks,” though. According to the NGO, Ukrainian troops had not been present in some residential areas which it assessed had been targeted in Russian strikes. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said that the NGO’s goal was to create “a false balance between the criminal and his victim.” Moscow responded to the report by saying it had repeatedly stated that the Ukrainian troops use civilians as “human shields” and Amnesty’s findings only confirm that. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/560319-latvia-visas-ban-russians/,EU member stops issuing visas to Russians,"The Latvian embassy in Russia announced on Thursday that it had stopped accepting visa applications from Russian citizens “for an indefinite period.” The diplomatic mission said in a tweet that the only exception would be made for those who applied for entry “to attend the funeral of a close relative.” A similar announcement was posted on the website of the Latvian visa center in Moscow. Its spokesperson told RIA Novosti on Friday that issuing visas had been suspended the day before. Latvian authorities have not specified the reasons behind the decision, but the move tightens other measures imposed on Russian citizens in the spring after Moscow launched its military offensive against Ukraine. At the time, Riga announced that it would stop processing all tourist visas. However, Russians were still allowed to apply for long-term employment and journalist visas, as well as to request entry on humanitarian grounds. Similar restrictions were imposed by some other EU member states, such as Lithuania, Estonia, Poland and the Czech Republic. On Thursday, Latvian news outlet Delfi reported that the government of Latvia planned to follow a recommendation by the State Security Service and make visa applicants from Russia and Belarus subject to some additional security background checks. On July 30, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics called for an EU-wide ban on issuing tourist visas for Russians. His Estonian colleague, Urmas Reinsalu, went even further by reportedly proposing a total EU visa ban for the citizens of Russia. According to Bloomberg, Reinsalu hopes to see the measure in the next package of EU sanctions and has already discussed it with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. Poland has previously also considered doing this, but, in a recent comment for Deutsche Welle, Germany’s foreign ministry said that the issuance of Schengen visas can be stopped only on the basis of consensus among all Schengen countries, and, at the moment, there is no such decision. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, commenting in July on Schengen visa ban proposals, said that Moscow hoped the EU would show common sense. However, he didn’t rule out “actions of an emotional nature.”"
2022-08-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/560327-western-ex-military-train-ukrainians/,Western special ops vets training Ukrainians – The Guardian,"Ukrainian recruits fighting in Donbass are undergoing ten-day intensive training courses led by a group of Western ex-military personnel calling themselves the Mozart Group, The Guardian reported on Friday. Group members told the paper Ukrainian recruits' training and combat experience was lacking to the point where weapons supplied by the West were largely going to waste. The company was founded by Andy Milburn, a retired American Marine Corps colonel, who served with the US military for 31 years, and according to The Guardian is mostly funded by “private US donors.” The group also includes other “carefully vetted” Western army veterans from the US, the UK, Ireland, and elsewhere. The Mozart Group delivers intensive crash courses for Ukrainian soldiers lasting between five and ten days, The Guardian said. The courses involve “basic weapon handling, marksmanship, fire and maneuver and battlefield tactics,” the paper reported, adding that this type of training would normally take six months. The training seems to give Ukrainian soldiers a significant boost, according to the company instructors. “Only one out of this group of 40 had zeroed his weapon before the training started,” Milburn said. Zeroing a weapon means aligning the sights so that one can aim accurately and is considered to be one of the basics of military training. The Western instructors also criticized Ukraine’s approach to training and mobilization by calling it “backwards.” “This is what it must have been like in World War One,” a company member identified only as Alex said. Another member of the Mozart Group, a former advanced paramedic from Ireland identified as Dathan, said that “the Ukrainian government doesn’t want to say that most of their military isn’t really trained.” According to the group, weapons supplied to Ukraine by Washington and its allies since the start of the conflict between Kiev and Moscow in February are simply not being used correctly due to the lack of experience on the Ukrainian side. The US-made Javelin portable anti-tank missile systems worth $178,000 each are “misused” or “redundant,” The Guardian said, citing Alex, who argued that the systems’ sophisticated sight batteries are running out before the missiles themselves are fired. “They are not getting the training they need,” Alex, who claimed to have specialized training in using Javelins and the UK-made NLAW missile systems, said. Since the start of the military conflict with Russia in February, Western backers supplied Kiev with portable anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems, as well as heavier weapons like German PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzers and the US-made HIMARS multiple rocket launchers. In July, US media outlets reported that the diversity of the arms had been creating problems for the Ukrainian military due to their complicated logistics, training, and maintenance."
2022-08-05,https://www.rt.com/news/560321-belarus-extremist-telegram-stickers/,Court declares Telegram stickers extremist,"A court in Minsk has recognized two sets of sticker packs for the popular Telegram messaging app as “extremist information products,” marking the first time such images have been branded as prohibited content in Belarus. The stickers in question are the ‘Luka’ and ‘Sasha 3%’ animated sticker packs, which feature satirical images of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. The designation was made by the court on July 25, but it only drew public attention on Friday after Belarusian authorities updated the Ministry of Information’s website to list what is considered to be extremist content. The list includes books, newspapers, websites, certain social media accounts, Telegram channels and symbols, among other things. Under a Belarusian law introduced in October, a subscription to banned Telegram channels is considered a basis for investigative action that can result in criminal liability. Subscribers to such channels can be prosecuted as participants in an extremist formation and can face up to seven years in prison. Last year, Belarusian authorities branded a number of Telegram channels, such as Radio Liberty Belarus, as extremist, arguing that they were responsible for spreading false information. Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makey stated in an interview last year that outlawing such channels and seeking criminal liability for their subscribers was “the right measure.” Such channels contain “blatant calls to commit certain illegal acts, incitements. Not only insinuations, but also specific appeals,” the minister said. “Therefore, I believe that these kinds of extremist channels should not have an impact on young people, on an unformed psychology.” The Belarusian Interior Ministry explained that Telegram channels can be recognized “as both extremist material and an extremist formation.” If a channel is recognized as a formation, all of its followers could become defendants in criminal cases. However, if the channel only posts extremist material, there may be no punishment for subscribers unless they actively promote the channel by reposting, donating money, and providing information to the channel. The ministry has advised all Belarusian citizens to unsubscribe from such channels."
2022-08-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/560305-fires-smoke-russia-region/,Russian region hit by huge fires (VIDEO),"The area engulfed by fires in Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Region in central Russia has doubled in 24 hours, with flames now covering almost 41,000 hectares (160 square miles) according to regional authorities. Smoke warnings have been issued for the entire region. According to a statement on Friday morning from the local government's environmental protection unit the fire footprint had increased by 19,500 hectares in 24 hours. Nine fires had been localized to an area of 2,800 hectares, according to the statement, as quoted by the local media on Friday. According to the regional Emergency Situations Department, as of 3pm local time, there were 56 fires in the region, with more than 1,000 personnel, 40 fire brigades and 22 aircraft mobilized to combat the blazes. The department said that while there is no threat of the fires spreading to inhabited areas, “smoke can be observed” across the region. Residents are advised to limit physical activity and time outside, use masks, keep doors and windows shut, and wipe down surfaces in their homes. Multiple videos posted on social media show a smoke-induced fog hovering over cities, including Khanty-Mansiysk, the region's capital, and Surgut, its largest city. Residents have been complaining about a strong smell of burning and extremely low visibility. Meanwhile, a video apparently filmed by a firefighter and posted on the social network VKontakte provides a sense of the conditions the emergency teams have to operate in. The footage shows firefighters on a local highway having suddenly found themselves surrounded by a blaze that had encroached right up to the road. The caption to the frightening video, however, states “all are alive.” Oil- and gas-rich Khanty-Mansi is not the only region in Russia now battling forest fires, although it is one of the most affected. According to Russia's forest protection agency, 36 forest fires were extinguished in 16 regions on Thursday. As of midnight Moscow time Thursday night, 130 forest fires were active in Russia, affecting a total of 126,400 hectare (500 square miles)."
2022-08-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/560302-donetsk-shelling-hospital-children/,Children among injured after shelling of Donetsk hospital – DPR,"A Ukrainian artillery attack on Donetsk has left at least one person dead and several others injured, officials in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) said. One of the buildings targeted on Friday was a hospital. Ten people, including children, were injured, DPR Deputy Information Minister Daniil Bezsonov said. Two neighborhoods in Donetsk came under fire by Ukrainian forces on Friday, DPR self-defense forces reported. The damaged hospital is located in the Kuibyshev district of the city. At least one rocket made a direct hit through the roof, images from the scene suggest. Local emergency services said the missile started a fire, which was quickly dealt with. Bezsonov published a video on his Telegram channel, showing one of the victims, saying that she heard at least two projectiles landing nearby as she and her child were visiting the hospital. Investigators said that a second rocket landed outside the building and that the debris from the explosion hit a car and injured a man. The victim added that she was with her son when the attack started. She shielded the child with her body, managing to save him from serious injury, while she was hit by flying debris. Kiev denies the accusations that its forces launch daily artillery attacks on civilian targets in Donetsk. It claims the shelling is done by the DPR and Russian forces to discredit Ukrainian troops. The DPR said the latest attack came from Avdeevka, a satellite city located just north of Donetsk that has become a Ukrainian stronghold. There has been intensive fighting in the area this week, with Ukrainian troops reportedly ceding territory."
2022-08-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/560286-ukraine-mayors-complain-zelensky/,Ukrainian mayors at odds with Zelensky – media,"There is growing dissatisfaction among Ukrainian mayors with President Vladimir Zelensky and his government, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. They want more say in receiving and distributing foreign aid, which is currently funneled through Kiev, several of the city heads told the newspaper. The Ukrainian government “appears to be trying to sideline mayors to maintain control of recovery aid and to weaken any future political rivals,” according to the Post. Some officials believe Kiev is backtracking on promises to decentralize the government and empower people on the local level to solve their own problems. At least three Ukrainian mayors expressed this sentiment to some degree in interviews with the Washington Post, including Boris Filatov of Dnepr, Vladislav Atroshenko of Chernigov, and Aleksandr Tretyak of Rovno. The former two have been publicly critical of Zelensky’s policies amid the hostilities with Russia. Filatov, a strongman politician who has led the city since 2015, recently took issue with the president’s move to strip Ukrainian citizenship from Gennady Korban, a longtime ally of Filatov. “I really would not want the central government taking advantage of the fact that we have a war in our country, to start, let’s say, creating an autocracy,” the Dnepr mayor wrote on social media, blasting the move. Atroshenko lashed out at the Zelensky government last month, accusing “subordinates” of the Ukrainian president of trying to subvert the mayor’s power. The statement came after he was barred from leaving the country for what he described to the Post as a fundraising trip on behalf of Chernigov. A senior aide to Zelensky warned in response that Kiev can find ways “to help cities and communities” without mayors who “complain about not being able to go abroad.” The government in Kiev serves as the “main conduit” for billions of dollars in aid pledged by Ukraine’s sponsors for reconstruction purposes, the Post noted. The central government also installed military administrations in Ukrainian regions “whose power often supersedes that of civilian local governments and which are funded directly” from the capital. The report stressed that despite their dissatisfaction with Kiev’s policies, Ukrainian mayors see fighting against Russia as a top priority. But it warned that as the conflict grinds on, Ukraine may fall back into political infighting, which marked the entire period of the country’s post-Soviet independence. Contributing to the rift is the fact that Zelensky’s Servant of the People party performed poorly during the 2020 municipal elections, allowing candidates from other parties to be elected to various offices. At the time, both the president and the ruling party were deeply unpopular among voters, who were disillusioned with his government’s policies."
2022-08-05,https://www.rt.com/news/560279-memorials-demolish-estonia-government/,EU member makes decision on Soviet-era memorials,"All Soviet-era memorials in Estonia have to be removed “as soon as possible,” the country’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said during a press conference on Thursday. She added that the government was unanimous on the matter. Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Kallas said that there are between 200 and 400 monuments with Soviet symbols in the country, a figure larger than initially thought. “We have made a key decision – all monuments with Soviet symbols must be removed from the public space, and this will be done as soon as possible,” the prime minister said. She added that “the specific dates and sequence will depend on the readiness of local governments and on logistics plans.” The government plans to involve the private sector in the removal process. Kallas also discussed the push to remove the Soviet T-34 tank displayed as a memorial in the predominantly Russian-speaking town of Narva. The town’s mayor, Katri Raik, had earlier asked the government to find a solution amid the backlash among locals against a plan to remove the monument. She said about 150 people had gathered near the memorial on Wednesday after rumors emerged that the demolition was imminent. “Since Narva is not going to do this {demolish the monument}, there is tension there, it is clear that the Estonian state and government should independently make this decision, that is to remove both this element with symbolic value and others,” Kallas said. She stressed that it is not forbidden to pay respects to the memory of the dead, but it should be done “in the right place, i.e. at the cemetery.” “A tank is a weapon that kills, it is not a memorial object. These same tanks actually kill people on the streets in Ukraine,” the prime minister explained. Claiming that the Russian “aggression” in Ukraine has opened some “long-existing wounds” in Estonian society, Kallas said that the Soviet monuments serve as a reminder of these wounds and thus should be removed. According to her, “the government is unanimous on this issue.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described the Estonian government’s decision to demolish the Soviet memorials as “outrageous” and said that this practice must be strongly condemned. “{it is} a war with a common history, getting rid of monuments is outrageous and does not make any nation, including Estonia, look better,” he said. Peskov admitted that there is no way to prevent the Estonian authorities from destroying the memorials but expressed hope that Russian historical societies would come up with proposals to save them by bringing them to Russia. Kallas' announcement came two days after the mayor of Riga, the capital of neighboring Latvia, stated that the famous ‘Monument to the Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders’ would not only be removed from the city’s Victory Park but also dismantled and recycled. World War II ended with Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia being returned to the USSR following the liberation of their territories from German troops by the Soviet forces. The Soviet-era monuments, described by some in Baltic countries as “symbols of Soviet re-occupation,” have long been targeted by local nationalists. The campaign for their removal intensified on the state level after Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February. Moscow has criticized the actions of the Baltic countries’ authorities, calling them “provocational.”"
2022-08-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/560275-vinnik-reportedly-extradited-us/,Russian cybercrime suspect extradited to US – media,"A Russian crypto entrepreneur accused by the US of laundering billions of dollars has apparently been handed over to American custody by Greece, days after Athens secured his extradition from France. Aleksandr Vinnik’s family said on Friday that he had been taken to Boston overnight on a private jet and then moved to San Francisco after making a phone call to them. “It all was staged like an abduction,” the family was cited as saying by the RIA Novosti news agency. Earlier in the week, French authorities allowed Greece to take custody of Vinnik. His French lawyer, Frederic Belo, suggested the extradition was a “deceptive maneuver” that would be followed by his transfer to the US. Vinnik was arrested in Greece in 2017 at the request of the US government, which accused him of using the now defunct BTC-e cryptocurrency trading platform to launder between $4 billion and $9 billion. France had its own money laundering case against Vinnik and secured his transfer from Greece in 2019. He stood trial and was sentenced to five years in jail. The US retracted its request to have Vinnik extradited from France last month, which made his defense team suspect that American authorities had opted for a roundabout way to get him. Russia too wants Vinnik to stand trial for allegedly illegally obtaining 750 million rubles ($12.2 million) through “computer information fraud” and stealing 600,000 rubles ($9,780). Vinnik’s lawyer said he would prefer to face justice in his home country to be closer to his family. The businessman denied any wrongdoing, saying the American charges against him were baseless. He faces up to 55 years in prison in the US if found guilty."
2022-08-05,https://www.rt.com/news/560272-iss-space-russia-withdrawal/,Moscow names trigger for ISS withdrawal,"The date of Russia’s withdrawal from the International Space Station (ISS) depends on the technical state of the project and could come at any time after 2024, a high-ranking official of the Russian space agency said on Thursday. “Regarding the statement about 2024… something may have been lost in translation. The statement on Russia’s leaving after 2024 means that there will be no abrupt moves until 2024. At the same time, 2025 follows 2024, as do 2028 and 2030. The specific decision on the withdrawal would be made based on the technical condition [of the station],” Sergey Krikalev, the executive director for manned space programs at Russian space agency Roscosmos, said at a press conference. In late July, Yury Borisov, the new head of Roscosmos, said Russia would withdraw from the station after 2024, adding that Moscow intends to fulfill its obligations to its foreign partners as part of the ISS project. Although he noted that the exact timing would depend on a number of things, including “the condition of the ISS itself and its operational performance,” Russia’s decision to leave the station “is no secret at all.” Borisov, who was appointed as director general of Roscosmos in July, also said that Russia would start putting together its own orbital station by the time it leaves the ISS, adding that the decision had nothing to do with geopolitics, including the Ukraine conflict. “As for the political aspects – I hate to disappoint you, but they simply are not there and I think they shouldn’t be,” he said, touting the ISS as a project that has enriched science and brought nations closer together. The former head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, predicted that the ISS, which NASA plans to operate until 2030, would “fall apart” by that time unless “huge amounts of money” are invested in repairs. Last year, former Soviet cosmonaut and chief designer for Russian spacecraft manufacturer RSC Energia, Vladimir Solovyov, said Russia would start construction on its own space station as early as in 2028. The project will be called ROSS (Russian Orbital Service Station) and will be built on the Science Power Module 1, which was originally designed for the ISS, but is now being repurposed, Solovyov said at the time. The International Space Station is jointly run by Russia, the US, Europe, Japan, and Canada. Launched in 1998, the station has been constantly inhabited for nearly 22 years. It serves as a platform for conducting experiments in zero gravity and trying out technology for future journeys into deep space, including the Moon and Mars."
2022-08-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/560269-zelensky-ukraine-europe-help/,Zelensky angered by lack of help from EU,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has lashed out at the EU, accusing the bloc of deliberately withholding €8 billion ($8.18 billion) in aid promised to his country amid the conflict with Russia. “Every day and in different ways, I remind some EU leaders that Ukrainian pensioners, our displaced persons, our teachers and other people, who depend on payments from the budget shouldn’t be hostages of their indecision or bureaucracy,” Zelensky said in a video address on Telegram on Thursday. The EU has suspended the allocation of €8 billion, and this “artificial delay in macro-financial aid for our country is either a crime or a mistake,” he insisted. The president did not name the nations responsible for withholding the money, but expressed hope that it’s only a mistake “and it will be corrected.” Earlier this week, the deputy head of Zelensky’s office, Igor Zhovkva, said that Ukraine has so far received just €1 billion from Brussels, while “some EU countries, including Germany” are blocking the transfer of another €8 billion. With Kiev unable to patch the holes in its budget due to the fighting and the dire economic situation, the EU promised in May to provide Ukraine with €9 billion in subsidies and low-interest loans by the end of 2022. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/560261-eu-sanctions-former-president-ukraine/,EU adds ex-Ukrainian president to sanctions list,"The European Council added former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich and his son Aleksandr to its sanctions list on Thursday. They accused the former leader, who was ousted during the 2014 'Maidan' coup, of playing a role in “undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,” as well as its “stability and security.” The council did not elaborate on why Yanukovich was added to the list, simply referring to him as “pro-Russian.” His son was accused of “conducting transactions with the separatist groups” in Donbass. Previously, the only Ukrainian nationals sanctioned by the EU were those serving in government positions in territories Russia had taken control over during the military operation in Ukraine, launched on February 24. Yanukovich was granted asylum in Russia after he was forced to flee Ukraine. In 2019, a Ukrainian court sentenced him in absentia to 13 years in prison for treason. At the time, he accused the Ukrainian authorities of placing pressure on the court, and said the decision had “nothing to do with the law.” In March this year, Ukrainian media outlets published unsubstantiated claims that Russia was planning to reappoint Yanukovich as president of Ukraine. The EU has targeted Yanukovich and his son before. In March 2021, the European Council extended personal restrictions imposed on the two in 2014 over the alleged embezzlement of Ukrainian state funds, and froze their assets. The former president won a court battle against the EC in June of that year. Yanukovich has not yet commented on the EU’s latest decision, nor has Moscow. Most of those targeted with personal sanctions by the EU and US, as well as their allies, are Russian military commanders, politicians, and businessmen (including family members) deemed to be close to the Kremlin. The latest round of sanctions adopted by the EU in mid-July involved personal restrictions against Russian actors Sergey Bezrukov and Vladimir Mashkov, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin, and the leader of the Night Wolves biker club, Aleksandr Zaldostanov, who was accused of “actively supporting Russian state propaganda through publicly denying Ukraine’s right to statehood.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/560260-zelensky-amnesty-international-report/,Zelensky accuses Amnesty International of supporting terrorism,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has accused Amnesty International of siding with “terrorists” after the organization condemned the Ukrainian military for placing weapons in civilian areas in violation of humanitarian law. “Today we saw a report by Amnesty International, which unfortunately tries to amnesty the terrorist state and shift responsibility from the aggressor to the victim,” Zelensky said in a video address on Thursday evening. “If someone makes a report that puts the aggressor and the victim on the same level, this cannot be tolerated,” he said, repeating three times that “Ukraine is a victim,” and adding that “anyone who doubts this is an accomplice of Russia – a terrorist country – and a terrorist themselves and a participant in the killings.”' The report in question was published earlier on Thursday, and detailed 22 cases of Ukrainian forces launching strikes from schools and five examples of troops using hospitals as bases. Amnesty said that it was “not aware” that Ukraine tried to evacuate civilians before occupying these non-military locations. “We have documented a pattern of Ukrainian forces putting civilians at risk and violating the laws of war when they operate in populated areas,” said Agnes Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. “Being in a defensive position does not exempt the Ukrainian military from respecting international humanitarian law.” While Amnesty has also accused Russia of breaking international law in the conduct of its military operation, the report was slated online by supporters of Zelensky’s regime, who accused the international organization of peddling “Russian propaganda.” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba has also pushed back against the report, accusing Amnesty of “creating a false reality” where everyone “is at fault for something.” Instead, he argued that the organization should focus exclusively on alleged Russian wrongdoing. Amid a torrent of criticism from pro-Ukrainian social media posters, Callamard stuck by the report. “To those who attack us alleging biases against Ukraine, I say: check our work,” she wrote on Twitter. “We stand by all victims. Impartially.” Callamard also accused “social media mobs and trolls” on both sides of the conflict of spreading “war propaganda, disinformation, [and] misinformation.” Ukrainian and Russian social media mobs and trolls: they are all at it today attacking @amnesty investigations. This is called war propaganda, disinformation, misinformation. This wont dent our impartiality and wont change the facts. https://t.co/YvMy2E3d6p In his speech, Zelensky accused the Russian military of “striking at memorials to Holocaust victims” and “at a prisoner of war camp in Yelenovka.” Zelensky was apparently referring to a strike on a Holocaust memorial in March, which actually hit a TV tower nearby. An Israeli journalist stated that the memorial itself was untouched. Russia accused Ukraine of launching a missile strike on the Yelenovka detention facility housing members of the neo-Nazi Azov regiment last week, and has asked the United Nations and Red Cross to investigate the attack. Donetsk People’s Republic officials claimed the facility was targeted to prevent the prisoners from testifying about alleged Ukrainian war crimes."
2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/560258-russia-comment-nagorno-karabakh-escalation/,Russia comments on Nagorno-Karabakh escalation,"The recent flare-up in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region has already led to casualties, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Thursday, expressing sympathies to the relatives of those killed during the latest spike in tensions between local militias supported by Armenia or Azerbaijan. The ministry also expressed its “deep concern” over the developments and said that the Russian peacekeeping force is “making every effort” to stabilize the situation on the ground. Russia is also engaged in “active” diplomatic work with both Armenia and Azerbaijan “at all levels,” including the heads of states, the ministry said in a statement. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is currently in “close contact with his Azerbaijani and Armenian colleagues,” it added. Moscow called on Baku and Yerevan to “exercise restraint” and urged them to resolve all their differences through “political and diplomatic means” in accordance with the 2020 ceasefire agreement, which was at that time also mediated by Russia. Both sides of the conflict should focus on “forming a positive agenda” while using the existing trilateral negotiating formats, the ministry added. The statement came amid the latest flare-up in the disputed region. Tensions in Nagorno-Karabakh have been running high since the beginning of the week, with Baku and Yerevan accusing each other of military provocations. On Wednesday, Azerbaijan conducted what it called a military operation launched in response to the “gross” ceasefire violations by the local militias. Baku also demanded “demilitarization” of the region. Armenia has accused Azerbaijan of demanding that Yerevan stop using the so-called Lachin Corridor linking it to Nagorno-Karabakh and to choose a different route – something it said violates the 2020 ceasefire deal. Each side also confirmed casualties resulting from clashes and shelling that have taken place since the beginning of the week. Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan. Yet, the region has a mostly Armenian population and sought independence from Baku in the 1990s. It has been de-facto self-governed and has enjoyed support from Armenia since then. In 2020, Baku and Yerevan fought a 44-day-long war over the disputed region, which ended with a Russian-brokered ceasefire that saw Russian peacekeepers deploy to Nagorno-Karabakh."

Peskov was pushing back on assertions made by NATO’s secretary-general that Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine was to blame for a major shake-up. “The real threat to the world order and the situation in the world and … in Europe comes from the coup that took place in Ukraine in 2014, which was carefully orchestrated by, among others, NATO countries, despite the guarantees that the foreign ministers of a number of countries had provided. Hence the threat and danger to the world order,” he stressed. According to Peskov, tensions in Europe have been stoked by aggressive NATO policies and encroachment toward Russia’s borders. “This situation has been maturing for several decades and in many ways it was fueled by the aggressive policies NATO pursued towards our country as they brought their infrastructure closer to Russia. This created additional threats for us,” Peskov noted, explaining that, faced with such reality, Moscow had no choice but to take action. On Thursday, NATO’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that the Ukraine conflict is the “most dangerous situation in Europe since World War Two,” and the West must do its best to stop Russia from winning. With that, he vowed to continue to support Kiev with arms and other types of aid. Moscow has repeatedly warned the West against sending weapons to Kiev, saying it only prolongs the conflict, increases the number of casualties, and will result in long-term consequences. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/560241-ukraine-bombed-donetsk-hotel-journalists/,"Today, Ukraine bombed a Donetsk hotel full of journalists – here’s what it felt like to be there","At 10:13 am today (Thursday), Ukraine began shelling central Donetsk. There were five powerful blasts in the space of ten minutes. The last explosion blew out my hotel’s ground-floor glass, including a sitting room – where journalists often congregate before and after going out to do field reporting – and the lobby. About one minute earlier, I had passed through the latter. A cameraman’s assistant who was there at the time of that fifth explosion suffered a concussion from the force of the blast. A woman walking outside the building was killed, as were at least four others, including a child. Donetsk Telegram channels are filled with videos locals have taken, of the dead, the injured and the damage, and of grief-stricken people. One such hard-to-watch Telegram post (warning: graphic footage) features a man in shock at the gruesome sight of the bodies of his murdered wife and grandchild on a street two blocks from the hotel. The total number of injured is still not known, as I write. First estimates placed the number at at least ten, among them two ambulance workers: a paramedic and a doctor. Reading the news, you have the luxury of graphic image warnings and the choice not to look at the pictures and videos of the carnage that occurred today, as well as over the past eight years of Ukraine's war on Donbass. The people here on the ground don’t get a warning, or a choice as to whether they will see the mutilated remains of a loved-one or stranger. As uncomfortable as it is to see such footage, it does need to be shown if the world is to know the truth of what’s going on in Donbass, to give voice to the locals, killed and terrorized by Ukrainian forces as Western corporate media looks elsewhere or covers up these crimes. Chronology of a bomb strike When the shelling started, I was in my room editing footage from the previous day – from the aftermath of another shelling of a Donetsk district. You wouldn’t know it from most Western media coverage but explosions are so common here that I didn’t think much of the blast other than it was louder than usual and the car alarms were going off. Seven minutes later, another explosion, much louder and much closer. From the window, smoke could be seen rising to the north, probably 200 meters away. This would have been right near the Opera House, where the funeral ceremony for Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) Colonel Olga Kachura, killed yesterday, was commencing. A minute later, another loud blast sent me running from the room, which faced the direction of incoming artillery. Luckily, the only damage ended up being a broken window. Downstairs, journalists who had been in the hotel and others who had been outside ready to go out reporting, took shelter in the hallway for the time being, ready to run to the basement if things escalated. One told me he had been preparing to go film and was about 10 meters away from where the last shell struck. “I believe they were trying to target the funeral. And journalists also,” he said. He also said there was a woman outside who had lost a leg, and that she was probably dead by now. One could assume that Kiev’s forces’ only intended target was the funeral service for Colonel Kachura, aiming perhaps to send a message to the DPR military and the civilians who support it. While that would be egregious by itself, it is likely that a hotel housing journalists was not just ‘collateral damage,’ either. Ukraine routinely persecutes, censors, imprisons, tortures, and targets media personnel, putting us on kill lists. Kiev’s forces know a lot of journalists stay at this hotel for its central location and strong wifi. Many frequently do their live reports from outside the hotel. And those staying here, as well as in other central Donetsk neighborhoods, have been loudly reporting on Ukraine’s showering of Donetsk with the insidious, internationally-prohibited ‘butterfly’ anti-personnel mines of late – the latest, until today, in the list of Kiev’s war crimes. These explosives are designed to rip off feet and legs, and Ukraine has repeatedly fired rockets containing them, intentionally dropping them on civilian areas in Donetsk and other Donbass cities. After the explosions rang out in central Donetsk today, Emergency Services arrived at the scene and, following a period of calm, journalists went out to document the damage and the dead. The woman I’d been told about lay in a pool of blood, covered with what appeared to be a curtain from one of the blown-out windows. The calm didn’t last long. Ukraine soon resumed shelling, and journalists outside ran back inside as we received another four attacks. “It’s like a common thing, they shoot one place and shoot it again. So we’re in the middle of that process right now,” a Serbian guy near me said. The chief of a local Emergency Services headquarters told me Kiev also makes triple strikes, not only double. It is said that Ukraine used NATO-standard 155mm caliber weapons in today’s attack. If that is true, this is another instance of Ukraine using Western-supplied weapons to slaughter and maim civilians in the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics. If by bombing a hotel full of journalists Kiev wanted to intimidate them away from reporting on Ukraine’s war crimes, it won’t work. Most journalists reporting from on the ground here do so because, unlike the crocodile tears of the West for conflicts they create, we actually care about the lives of people here."
2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/560228-ukraine-amnesty-kuleba-humanitarian/,Kiev blasts Amnesty report on Ukraine risking civilian lives,"Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba pushed back against an Amnesty International report that blames Kiev for placing its military assets in schools and residential areas, violating humanitarian law and putting civilians at risk. In his comments posted on social media on Thursday, the minister said that he was outraged by the NGO’s claim. “I understand that Amnesty will respond to criticism by saying that they criticize both sides of the conflict. But such behavior on Amnesty’s part is not about looking for the truth and presenting it to the world, but about creating a false balance between the criminal and his victim"", he said. Kuleba also urged the organization to stop “creating a fake reality” where everyone is “at fault for something.” Amnesty should primarily focus on what Russia is doing in Ukraine and what devastation Moscow has brought upon this country, he argued. On Thursday, Amnesty released a report accusing Kiev of “a clear violation of international humanitarian law,” saying it was putting civilian lives at risk by placing its military close to civilian infrastructure. In 22 out of the 29 schools visited by Amnesty between April and July, the human rights group said it found evidence of current or prior military activity. In five locations, they witnessed Ukrainian troops using hospitals as bases. At the same time, the group said it was “not aware” that Ukraine tried to evacuate civilians from the areas in question. However, Amnesty also noted that no Ukrainian troops were present in some areas where it assessed Russian forces had delivered strikes on residential areas. For that reason, the NGO said that Ukraine’s unlawful military use of civilian objects did not “in any way justify indiscriminate Russian attacks.” According to Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman, the NGO’s report only confirmed what Moscow has known for a long time. “We’ve been talking about this constantly, calling the actions of the Ukrainian armed forces the tactics of using civilians as a ‘human shield’,” Zakharova said."
2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/560233-eu-visa-ban-estonia/,Estonian FM wants ban on Russians traveling to EU in next sanctions round – Bloomberg,"Estonia’s Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu would like to see an EU-wide travel visa ban on the Russian citizens in the next package of the bloc’s sanctions against Moscow, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The outlet cited a phone interview with Reinsalu who is at present visiting Kiev. The country’s top diplomat said that he'd discussed the idea during a meeting with the Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky. “We have to raise the cost of Russian aggression through additional sanctions, weapons, and by increasingly isolating Russia,” Reinsalu told the agency. Posting his photo with Zelensky on Twitter, the Estonian minister didn’t mention his visa ban idea but said that he discussed with the Ukrainian leader Estonia’s continued aid to Ukraine “especially for the coming winter,” as well as “ramping up defensive aid.” “We must also start with Ukraine’s reconstruction despite Russia’s brutal war,” he wrote. Estonia is known for its tough stance on Moscow. Following the launch of the Russian military offensive in Ukraine in late February, Estonia stopped issuing most of visa types for Russians. Some other EU member states, such as Lithuania and Latvia, as well as Poland and Czech Republic, also imposed visa restrictions also imposed visa restrictions but an EU-wide ban requires approval of all 27 bloc members. Estonian Interior Minister Lauri Laanemets said recently that the Schengen visa rules make it impossible for Estonia to stop people with visas issued by other countries from entering Estonia. Therefore, he said, the issue should be discussed at EU level. On August 1, the European Commission, responding to a query from Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, clarified that consideration of visa applications as well as the issuance of short-term Schengen visas is a matter for individual EU countries. It also stressed that such decisions are being made on a case-by-case basis as there are always groups of people eligible for the visas, such as family members, journalists, dissidents and those who ask for visas on humanitarian grounds. Several countries, including Finland, have been discussing how to limit the issuing of tourist visas for Russian citizens. According to a recent survey, conducted by Yle, 58% of Finns support a total visa ban. Poland and Latvia earlier raised the idea of banning all Russians from entering the EU. Germany’s foreign ministry, however, in a recent comment for Deutsche Welle, said that the issuance of Schengen visas can be stopped only on the basis of consensus among all Schengen countries, and at the moment there is no such decision."
2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/560225-shuster-reportedly-banned-ukraine/,Ukraine bans dissident journalist – media,"Savik Shuster, a veteran journalist working in Ukraine, has reportedly been blacklisted by the government. Kiev has instructed border guards to prevent Shuster from entering the country, the news outlet Strana claimed on Thursday, citing a source. The ban was imposed under wartime emergency powers and will last for at least three years, a source in the Ukrainian authorities said, according to the report. “The instruction is not to let him in because he is a foreigner, with no further explanation,” the source said. The claim was disputed by Shuster’s studio, while the Ukrainian authorities declined to comment on it. Shuster, who was born in Lithuania while it was still the Soviet Union, has the citizenship of Canada, where his family moved in 1971, and Italy, the home country of his former wife. He started his journalistic career in the 1980s and worked, among other outlets, for the Munich-based branch of the US government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. He moved to Russia in the mid-1990s. In the mid-2000s, Shuster left Russia for Ukraine and became a fixture of the country’s media landscape, predominantly as the host of a political talk show. His career in Ukraine stalled in 2016, when the TV personality claimed that then-president Pyotr Poroshenko was persecuting him for political reasons and moved to Italy. In 2019, he returned from self-exile to bring his talk show to the Ukraine 24 TV channel. He provided a platform for many speakers who were critical of President Vladimir Zelensky, who infamously accused Shuster of “serving oligarchs” and destabilizing Ukraine during a Q&A session last November. The outlet that aired Shuster’s program was banned in July amid Zelensky’s crackdown on media outlets that his government deems to be “pro-Russian” or subservient to oligarchs. The 69-year-old now once again resides in Italy. Last month, Ukrainian media outlets reported that Zelensky had issued a secret order that revoked the Ukrainian citizenship of several people, including politician Gennady Korban, an ally of the Mayor of Dnepr – Boris Filatov. Korban was not in the country at the time and was blindsided by Zelensky’s order, as border guards refused to let him enter when he tried to return. The existence of the order was later confirmed by the government. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that the reported ouster of Shuster from Ukraine fit the pattern of persecution of critical journalism and public figures under Zelensky, which she branded “Western liberal dictatorship with a Kiev snarl.”"
2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/560231-kremlin-us-china-taiwan/,Russia blames US for Taiwan tensions,"Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi instigated the flare-up of tensions around Taiwan with her trip to Taipei, the Kremlin has said. “The tensions around Taiwan were artificially provoked. We are well aware that they were provoked by the visit of Nancy Pelosi,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. “It was a completely unnecessary trip,” Peskov said, adding that the snap military drill launched by Beijing near Taiwan was “the sovereign right of China.” Despite strong protests from Beijing, Pelosi arrived in Taipei on Tuesday evening as part of her Asian tour, becoming the highest-ranking US official to visit the self-governing island in 25 years. China considers Taiwan part of its territory and opposes any diplomatic recognition of it as an independent nation. In response to Pelosi’s trip, Beijing announced a military exercise that Chinese state media described as a rehearsal for a “reunification operation.” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova earlier said that Pelosi’s Taiwan visit risks “undermining regional stability and security.” Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, meanwhile, thanked Pelosi for her visit. “[We are] grateful to have friends in the international community standing with Taiwan to defend democracy and uphold regional security,” she wrote on Twitter on Wednesday."
2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/560213-oslo-norway-consul-tirade/,Moscow wants ‘I hate Russians’ diplomat to leave,"Moscow has summoned ambassador Rune Resaland after a Norwegian consul was filmed insulting staff in a Russian hotel. In a video published by news outlet Mash on Saturday, Elisabeth Ellingsen, who is stationed in the northern city of Murmansk, was heard saying “I hate Russians” during an argument over room service. Moscow voiced a “resolute protest” over the incident, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. She revealed that the altercation between Ellingsen and the staff occurred on July 6. Ellingsen’s “Russophobic” remarks are “unacceptable,” she reiterated. The Norwegian Foreign Ministry released a statement, saying that it “deeply regretted” the incident, and Ellingsen’s tirade did not reflect Oslo’s attitude towards Russia and the Russian people. Zakharova said on Thursday that Moscow has taken the statement into account. “At the same time, we stressed that the further presence of Elisabeth Ellingsen on the territory of the Russian Federation is impossible,” she said."
2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/560055-escalation-conflict-ukraine-nato/,"Dmitri Trenin: Russia cannot afford to lose in Ukraine, but neither can the US – is there a non-nuclear way out of the deadlock?","The threat of the conflict in Ukraine getting out of control is not just an ever-present concern, but a reality. The authors of the RAND Corporation’s recent paper, 'Pathways to Russian Escalation Against NATO From the Ukraine War', warn US policymakers to be careful in their statements and moves. This is particularly when deciding on military postures, deployment patterns, weapons capabilities, and the like, so that the steps taken by them do not provoke the Russian leadership into pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes, including using non-strategic nuclear weapons, or taking the campaign into NATO territory. This is totally in line with America's overall approach of doing the maximum to weaken Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine while avoiding being drawn directly into a war against Moscow. Seen from here, Washington is clearly escalating its participation in the conflict by constantly testing the limits of Russian tolerance of these moves. It started with the provision to Kiev of Javelin anti-tank systems; it was then amplified to include M777 howitzers and HIMARS MLRS systems; it is now moving in the direction of providing Ukraine with US-made military aircraft and training its pilots to fly them. In addition to the new packages of Western sanctions, Russia is also facing pressure on its geopolitically vulnerable outposts, whether regarding goods transit to and from its Kaliningrad exclave or the status of its forces in Transnistria, a small territory wedged between Ukraine and Moldova. Some refer to the latter as attempts by America's junior allies in Eastern Europe to open a second front against Russia. So far, Russia’s actions and inaction have sometimes appeared surprising, even puzzling to US watchers. Moscow has refrained from strikes against transport links to Poland, cyberattacks against Ukrainian – not to mention US – critical infrastructure, or even destroying bridges across the Dnieper River. As for the most concerning step of all – Russia using tactical nuclear weapons – this scenario is irrelevant in a situation where hostilities are taking place on Ukrainian territory with Russian forces slowly but steadily advancing, and a “threat to the existence of the Russian Federation” – the doctrinal condition for such deployment – is out of the question. Moscow's failure to respond immediately to high-profile Ukrainian actions, such as the constant shelling of the center of Donetsk; missile attacks against Russian villages and towns close to their shared border; or even the loss of the Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet, hit and sunk by Ukraine with the material assistance of the United States, probably demonstrates the Kremlin’s unwillingness to be provoked by the enemy. President Vladimir Putin probably prefers his revenge to be served cold, and at the time of his choosing. It would be safe to say that nothing from this conflict will be forgotten by either side, but at least the Russians have refused to be distracted from their current central task – defeating the enemy's forces in Donbass and taking control over Ukraine’s east and south. So far, US-led assistance to Kiev, whether military, financial or diplomatic, has not had a decisive impact on the battlefield. It has certainly propped up the Zelensky government and compensated for the Ukrainian forces’ losses of military equipment, thus contributing to the slowing down of Russian advances, but has not turned the tide of the war. One may conclude that the Kremlin sees no need, for now, to do things that would breach the resistance of the Biden Administration to domestic U.S. demands for a more rapid escalation of the US involvement in the conflict. Jake Sullivan’s recent comment to the Aspen Strategy Group, demonstrating the reluctance of the White House to provide ATACMS systems to Kiev, suggests that this approach has some value. Looking ahead, one should expect more US escalation in any scenario of the evolution of fighting in Ukraine – whether Russia continues to gain ground (and integrate various new territories into the Russian Federation), or Ukraine mounts a counter-offensive (which so far it has failed to do). Russian officials express concern that a Ukrainian provocation presented as Moscow’s use of chemical weapons – which makes no military or any other sense but would certainly be believed in the US as a major egregious act by the Russians – could lead to Washington climbing abruptly up the escalation ladder. Things may become even more serious, however, if the US or its NATO allies enter Ukraine, or otherwise become directly involved in the conflict; if the material assistance which they provide to Kiev starts making a major difference on the battlefield; or if those weapons are used to strike significant targets on Russia’s territory, such as the Crimean Bridge. There are parallel American concerns about Russia attacking transshipment points on NATO territory, launching significant counter-attacks against the United States or its allies, and using weapons of mass destruction. The last point has already been discussed, and as to the previous two, they could be in response to an adverse turn of events in the theater of operations. Neither Russia nor the US can afford to lose in the conflict now raging in Ukraine. However, the difference between the situations faced by Washington and Moscow is huge. For the American leadership, a failure in Ukraine would be a strategic setback, politically costly both at home and internationally; for the Russian leadership, the outcome of its special military operation is an existential matter. In an asymmetrical conflict like this one, this amounts to an escalation advantage, if not dominance. What is vital for the two countries and the rest of the world is that this fight does not cross the nuclear threshold."
2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/560210-zelensky-global-security-model/,Ukraine wants new ‘global security architecture’,"The world needs a new global security model to avoid international conflicts such as the current one between Moscow and Kiev, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said on Wednesday. Zelensky also mentioned the flare-up of tensions between Beijing and Taiwan, Serbia’s feud with Kosovo, and the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict in the south Caucasus. “All these situations seem different, although they are united by one factor, namely: the global security architecture did not work. If it worked, there wouldn't be all these conflicts,” the president said in his daily video address. Zelensky claimed that Russia “avoided immediate and tangible responsibility” in 2014, when Crimea voted in a referendum to leave Ukraine and reunite with Russia following a coup in Kiev, and a conflict broke out in Donbass. “And now many in global relations believe that they will manage to do so as well,” Zelensky said. “There must be an effective global security architecture that ensures that no state can ever again resort to terror against another state,” he stated. Speaking before the US Congress in March, Zelensky proposed setting up “a union of responsible countries,” tasked with stopping conflicts via methods ranging from sanctions to financial aid. Zelensky’s remarks on Wednesday came after China launched snap military exercises around Taiwan in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei. China, which considers the self-governed island to be part of its territory, had issued stern warnings against the trip. In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Zelensky said he wanted Beijing to pressure Russia over its military campaign in Ukraine, which was launched in late February. China, however, has refused to condemn Russia, or impose sanctions on Moscow."
2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/news/560207-ukraine-shelling-donetsk-funeral/,Moment of deadly Donetsk shelling caught on video,"The center of Donetsk was again shelled by Ukrainian forces, on Thursday, according to Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) officials. The strike came during a funeral service for a military commander. The moment was captured on video by a TV crew that was filming an interview with one of the commander’s former comrades. A memorial ceremony in honor of Olga Kachura, a commander of the DPR’s rocket artillery battalion, was taking place in the Donetsk State Academic Opera and Ballet theater, when the missles landed. Shells from the Ukrainian forces reportedly managed to hit the nearby Donbass Palace Hotel. According to RIA news, people who gathered for the service were immediately evacuated to a bomb shelter while Ukrainian forces continued shelling the city. Local authorities have so far confirmed that at least one person was killed near the Donbass Palace hotel while four others, including a child, were killed in other parts of the city. At least six others have reportedly been injured as a result of the shelling, including an RT employee."
2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/560199-donetsk-center-funeral-shelling/,Five killed as Ukraine shells Donetsk – DPR,"A drama theater – hosting a funeral ceremony for a female militia commander – came under artillery fire on Thursday morning, according to officials in Donetsk. The barrage, which also struck other targets, resulted in at least five deaths and six injuries, preliminary reports claimed. Representatives of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) said some 10 projectiles hit the city center, damaging several buildings including a hotel. Several people were injured in the shelling. One of them is an assistant cameraman working for RT, who was staying at the damaged hotel with other crew members. He was taken to hospital with a suspected concussion. At least two shells reportedly struck the theater, where people had gathered to pay their respects to militia Colonel Olga Kachura. All attendants were evacuated and the ceremony was postponed. The DPR capital regularly comes under what local authorities call shelling by Ukrainian forces, which hold positions within striking range of Donetsk. Officials blamed Kiev for the latest attack. Ukraine routinely denies attacking Donetsk, claiming that DPR or Russian forces are responsible for the strikes. An aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to Thursday’s news by reiterating the claims, saying “it makes no sense for us to strike some event in Donetsk”. Kachura was a DPR militia officer who had commanded a rocket artillery unit since 2014. Her battlefield death was announced on Wednesday and was described as a painful loss for the Russia-allied republic. Her achievements were recognized both by the DPR and by Moscow. President Vladimir Putin posthumously awarded her with the Hero of Russia title."
2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/560193-amnesty-ukraine-humanitarian-law/,Ukrainian forces ‘put civilians at risk’ – Amnesty,"Ukrainian forces appear to have a pattern of placing troops and military vehicles in residential areas, including using hospitals as de facto military bases, Amnesty said on Thursday. Such actions violate international humanitarian law and put civilian lives at risk, the human rights NGO said. The accusation is based on research that Amnesty conducted between April and July in the east of Ukraine. In 19 towns and villages, it found evidence that Ukrainian forces launched strikes from within residential areas. In several cases they were targeted by retaliatory Russian attacks, some of which killed civilians, the report said. In 22 out of the 29 schools visited by Amnesty they said they found evidence of current or prior military activity. In five locations they witnessed Ukrainian troops using hospitals as bases, which was “a clear violation of international humanitarian law.” Most residential areas inspected were far away from frontlines, and there were viable alternatives for military deployments, Amnesty noted. The rights group said it was “not aware” that Ukraine tried to evacuate civilians from those areas, as is required under international rules of war. “We have documented a pattern of Ukrainian forces putting civilians at risk and violating the laws of war when they operate in populated areas,” Agnes Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, said. “Being in a defensive position does not exempt the Ukrainian military from respecting international humanitarian law,” she added. “Militaries should never use hospitals to engage in warfare and should only use schools or civilian homes as a last resort when there are no viable alternatives.” Amnesty noted that in some places, where it assessed that Russian forces delivered unlawful indiscriminate strikes on residential areas, it did not find evidence of the presence of Ukrainian troops. Ukraine’s unlawful military use of civilian objects “does not in any way justify indiscriminate Russian attacks,” it stressed. Responding to the report, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Russia had frequently highlighted the methods described by Amnesty and had repeatedly reported that Ukraine is using civilians as human shields. Moscow claims it never targets civilian sites, contrary to accusations coming from Kiev, and that it took every precaution to mitigate risks for civilians when attacking Ukrainian forces in cities and villages."
2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/560189-yelenovka-prison-shelling-ukraine/,Ukraine asked for POWs to be placed in prison it shelled – Russia,"Russia’s Defence Ministry has accused Ukraine of deliberately targeting a prison in Donbass where it knew dozens of its own POWs were being held. The Ukrainian authorities were aware that their soldiers, who surrendered to Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant, were being held at the prison in the village of Yelenovka, as Kiev itself insisted on them being placed there, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Aleksandr Fomin said on Wednesday. The shelling of Correctional colony No.120 in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in late July killed 50 inmates and left 73 others wounded. The facility held members of the infamous Azov neo-nazi battalion, who were captured in May after being holed up for weeks at the Azovstal steelworks during the Russian siege of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. “On May 20, 2022, the surrendered servicemen of the Azov nationalist battalion were taken to the pre-trial detention center in the village of Yelenovka. The Ukrainian side insisted on this particular place for their detention,” Fomin said during a briefing for foreign military attachés in Moscow. Kiev’s attack on the prison was deliberate, with “the Ukrainian leadership giving the order to carry out the missile strike because the Azov fighters started giving testimonies exposing their crimes, including those perpetrated against peaceful civilians,” he insisted. Another reason for Ukraine hitting Yelenovka was to scare its own troops on the battlefield and “deter them from surrendering,” the Russian defense official said. Many Ukrainian soldiers have been recently laying down their arms, he added. Aleksandr Fomin denied Ukraine’s “groundless” claims that Moscow struck the prison itself to pin the blame on Kiev, saying all the evidence shows that the missiles came from the north-western direction, where Kiev’s forces were located. Last week, RIA Novosti news agency cited an unnamed high-ranking Pentagon official, who suggested that if Ukraine did shell the prison in Yelenovka, then it did so unintentionally. The Russian deputy defense minister insisted that those words were nothing but “a clumsy attempt to justify the provocation by the Kiev regime.” The attack on the detention facility was carried out with HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, supplied to Ukraine by the US, and the Americans have been claiming that those are “high-precision systems, which hit the targets they were meant to hit,” he said. Also, in planning its strikes, the Ukrainian military actively relies on space and air reconnaissance data provided by the US and its allies, Fomin added. In a bid to curb further speculation, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Sunday that it had officially invited experts from the UN and the International Red Cross Committee to carry out an impartial investigation into the incident in Yelenovka. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/560186-zelensky-china-talks-russia/,Zelensky wants talks with China,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said on Thursday he would like to speak “directly” with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as he urged Beijing to use its economic and political leverage to stop the conflict in his country. In an exclusive interview with the South China Morning Post, Zelensky noted that he had not spoken to the Chinese leader since the start of Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine. “I would like to talk directly. I had one conversation with [President] Xi Jinping that was a year ago,” he said. “Since the beginning of the large-scale aggression on February 24, we have asked officially for a conversation, but we (haven’t had) any conversation with China even though I believe that would be helpful.” According to Zelensky, Xi is one of a handful of world leaders who have been to Ukraine “at least once,” adding that the Chinese president warmly recalled his ties with Kiev during a call between the two leaders last year. Zelensky stressed that he wants to see China redefine its stance on Russia, but understands why Beijing is seeking a “balanced” approach. “This is a war on our territory, they [Russia] came to invade. China, as a big and powerful country, could come down and sort of put the Russian Federation [in] a certain place,” he said. “Of course, I would really like China to review its attitude towards the Russian Federation.” Zelensky said he believes China has the means to make Russia stop its offensive. “I’m sure that without the Chinese market for the Russian Federation, Russia would be feeling complete economic isolation,” he said. “That’s something that China can do – to limit the trade [with Russia] until the war is over.” The Ukrainian president also warned of the long-term global consequences of the conflict, which he predicted will harm food and energy security and also slash Chinese exports. According to Zelensky, due to the ongoing hostilities, many countries are spending more on food, fuel and weapons rather than other goods. “The people would have to pay for energy resources rather than for products coming from China … Exports from China would be decreasing. That’s 100 per cent,” he reiterated. China has refused to condemn Russia for the Ukraine conflict and has opposed sweeping economic sanctions that the West has slapped on Moscow. Beijing has also blamed NATO expansion for the tensions between Western powers and Russia, adding that the West has to “understand Russia’s legitimate security concerns” and “build a sustainable European security system through negotiation.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560176-london-pianist-suspended-ukraine/,UK college suspends Ukrainian pianist,"The Royal College of Music in London has suspended Alexander Romanovsky, one of its alumni and tutors, over a performance in the war-torn city of Mariupol. The conservatory cited a video on social media that showed the Ukrainian-born pianist playing a Schubert sonata outside the ruined Drama Theater, which British media described as the site of a Russian “war crime,” alongside another musician who openly supports Russia in the conflict. Romanovsky graduated from the Royal College of Music in 2008 and was teaching there, as well as the Conservatorio di Reggio Emilia in Italy. On Tuesday, however, the RCM suspended him “pending a formal disciplinary process,” according to the Times of London. The pianist’s apparent transgression was playing Franz Schubert’s Sonata No 1 in D Major outside the Mariupol Drama Theater, alongside violinist Petr Lundstrem, whom the Times described as “supporter of the Russian invasion.” The drama theater is where “more than a dozen people died in the bombing in March,” the British outlet said, further citing Amnesty International’s description of the incident as “a clear war crime.” Ukrainian authorities initially claimed more than 1,000 civilians had been killed in what they alleged was a Russian airstrike. The Russian military accused the neo-Nazi “Azov” regiment – which had held Mariupol until May – of blowing up the building with civilians inside, so it could accuse Russia of atrocities. Within two days, however, over 200 people were rescued from the rubble and only one of them had been injured. One of the major sources for the Ukrainian claims was human rights commissioner Lyudmila Denisova. She was fired by the parliament in Kiev at the end of May, for tarnishing the country’s credibility and reputation by fabricating claims of “mass rapes” by Russian soldiers. In addition to performing outside the ruins, Romanovsky’s “misconduct” seems to have been associating with Lundstrem. The Times said Romanovsky’s Telegram posts showed him and Lundstrem posing “in front of a sign for Mariupol painted in the colors of the Russian flag” and showing Lundstrem “wearing a T-shirt marked with a ‘Z’, a symbol which has become associated with the Russian invasion, and the word ‘Rus’, a nationalist term to describe a union of Slavs.” Romanovsky’s Telegram also reportedly shows him driving past the scars of war in Mariupol and talking about the power of art to bring peace and love to stricken communities. The pianist told the Times on Monday that he traveled across Europe in 2021, holding more than 40 open-air concerts to help people who suffered during the Covid-19 pandemic and promote the idea that “live music is a primary need for the society.” He felt the need to do the same thing in eastern Ukraine and said told the Times he would be “very happy to visit the other Ukraine territories if it was possible.” The Royal Music College was established in 1882. In April, it was ranked “the global top institution for performing arts.”"
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560175-azerbaijan-demand-demilitarize-nagorno-karabakh/,Azerbaijan demands ‘demilitarization’ of Nagorno-Karabakh,"The “demilitarization” of Nagorno-Karabakh remains an “absolute necessity,” the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry said on Wednesday, as Baku carried out ‘Operation Revenge’ in the disputed region amid the latest spiral of tension between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Baku has “repeatedly stated” that the continued presence of the Armenian troops and “illegal Armenian armed groups” in the “territories of Azerbaijan” remains a “source of danger,” the statement said, adding that Azerbaijan considers the “complete withdrawal” of Armenian forces and disarmament of the local militias an absolute necessity. Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan. Yet, the region has a mostly Armenian population and has been de-facto governed by the authorities of the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic – also known as the Republic of Artsakh – since the 1990s, when the region first sought to break away from Azerbaijan. The Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh and the local militias have since enjoyed support from Yerevan. The statement came as Azerbaijan conducted a military operation in the region, one which it claims was launched in response to a “gross” ceasefire violation by local militias that allegedly sought to establish new combat positions in the area. The alleged attack was repelled by the Azerbaijani forces that, in turn, seized some commanding heights in the region for themselves, the statement added. Tensions in Nagorno-Karabakh have been running high since the beginning of the week as both Baku and Yerevan accused each other of military provocations, including attacks and “intense” shelling. Armenian media outlets earlier reported that Baku had been planning an offensive on the so-called Lachin Corridor – a mountainous pathway connecting Armenia to the region. Armenian Security Council Secretary Armen Grigoryan also told the local media on Wednesday that Baku demanded Yerevan stop using the Lachin Corridor altogether and choose a different route that could link it to Nagorno-Karabakh. Grigoryan blasted the demands as violating a 2020 ceasefire accord the two sides agreed to following Russian mediation. In 2020, the world witnessed the latest major flare-up of the simmering conflict between the two neighbors as Yerevan and Baku fought a 44-day-long war, during which Azerbaijan managed to capture parts of Nagorno-Karabakh. The conflict eventually ended with a ceasefire that saw Russian peacekeepers deployed to the disputed region, including the Lachin Corridor, but the situation has remained tense ever since. Both sides have repeatedly accused each other of provoking hostilities. Since Monday, both Baku and Yerevan have confirmed military casualties in the wake of clashes in the region. The Russian peacekeeping center also said it recorded ceasefire violations, adding that the Russian troops took measures to resolve the issues peacefully in cooperation with both the Armenian and the Azerbaijani sides. On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin also discussed the situation with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. The two leaders specifically discussed the implementation of the 2020 ceasefire deal, the Kremlin said in a statement. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also discussed the tensions around Nagorno-Karabakh with Azerbaijani top diplomat Jeyhun Bayramov during his visit to Baku in June. The region remains a hot issue for both Armenia and Azerbaijan. June saw massive protests against Pashinyan in Yerevan and his government’s stance on Nagorno-Karabakh – one of the major points of contention at the time. Prior to the protests, opposition parties wanted parliament to adopt a declaration saying the region would never be part of Azerbaijan. However, pro-Pashinyan lawmakers refused to attend the parliamentary session. On Wednesday, the EU urged both sides to stop the hostilities and return to the talks. “It is essential to de-escalate, fully respect the ceasefire and return to the negotiating table to seek negotiated solutions,” it said in a statement."
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560172-soviet-stores-beryozka-return/,Legendary Soviet shops return to Russia,"The Russian government has decided to open two specialty stores in Moscow and St. Petersburg, selling alcohol, tobacco, candy, cosmetics, jewelry, smartphones and watches. The duty-free establishments will take both rubles and foreign currencies. The twist is that only people with special documents will be able to shop there, reminiscent of “Beryozka” shops in Soviet times. Though the government published the decision on July 27, it goes into effect on August 27. It is unclear whether the stores will open by then, or where the two stores will be located. “Back in Soviet times, my friends worked abroad, and there were shops for diplomats that had certain discounts. These outlets allow diplomats to freely buy goods that they cannot import or buy in the host country,” Russian Senator Vladimir Dzhabarov told the Parliamentary Gazette. Foreign diplomats, family members, and employees of international organizations will be able to shop there, so long as they have special accreditations from the Russian Foreign Ministry. Prices will be listed in rubles, euros and dollars. The Russian customs service will be in charge of the stores, which will only sell the merchandise normally subject to a duty-free regime. It did not take long for the initiative to be compared to the legendary “Beryozkas,” a chain of stores that first appeared in 1961. However, they catered not just to diplomats, but also to the military and certain Soviet workers operating abroad, who were allowed to use their foreign currency at the state-operated shops. “Beryozka” also sold food and clothes, which the new stores will not do. Also unlike the new stores, “Beryozkas” did not accept rubles. The first stores were opened at the Sheremetyevo and Vnukovo airports in Moscow, and the hotels “Ukraine” and “Leningrad” – two of Moscow’s famous “seven sisters” high-rises. The chain later branched out to the capitals of all Soviet republics, larger regional centers, and popular tourist resort cities such as Sochi, Sevastopol, and Yalta. After the USSR dissolved, the chain was privatized and went bankrupt in the mid-1990s."
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560169-ukraine-prisoners-torture-mistreatment/,Russia accuses Ukraine of mistreating POWs,"Moscow has scrupulously observed the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners, while the government of Ukraine has tortured, starved and deprived of medical care the Russian soldiers in its captivity, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Wednesday. The West’s unwillingness to hold Kiev accountable has resulted in violations and outright crimes, Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin told reporters. Russia has taken “painstaking” steps to observe the Geneva Convention on the treatment of POWs, among them holding more than 40 weekly meetings with representatives of the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and establishing a medical commission on seriously ill and injured prisoners. So far, 18 such prisoners were sent back to Ukraine, General Fomin said. There have also been 27 exchanges of POWs and the bodies of dead servicemen, while the ICRC has received more than 1,500 letters home from the Ukrainian prisoners. Detained Ukrainian soldiers can also make phone calls to their families, Fomin said, all in accordance with Article 71 of the convention. Fomin’s press conference came after the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said it was appalled by a video allegedly showing a Russian soldier castrating a bound and gagged Ukrainian captive. In a statement on Friday, the commission reminded everyone that “torture and summary executions of prisoners of war” are war crimes. The Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s office has launched an investigation into the video, to establish where and when it might have taken place. The Russian general did not address the video directly. He did, however, say that while Russia has treated its prisoners in full accordance with international law, Ukraine has not. According to a survey of exchanged service members, both Russian and those of the Donbass republics, 81% of the prisoners were subjected to beatings and other physical violence, while 55% were forced to film propaganda videos. Some 46% received no medical care, 79% were given no opportunity to contact relatives, and 19% were given poor or insufficient meals. One detention center, run by the Ukrainian security service SBU in Kiev, gave captives only 50 grams of porridge, a piece of bread and a glass of water a day, while keeping them blindfolded. Fomin also brought up videos circulating online showing “torture and abuse,” as well as extrajudicial executions and “monstrous acts of violence” against Russian and Donbass POWs. “Ukrainian Nazis” have also attempted to extort the families of captives for ransom, he said. Russia has regularly informed the international humanitarian structures of Ukraine’s behavior, with requests to influence the Kiev government, but to little or no effect, Fomin said. In addition to the mistreatment of prisoners, according to the Russian military, Ukrainian forces have been using civilians as human shields, as well as using Western-supplied weapons and banned ordnance – such as cluster munitions and landmines – to target civilians in the Donetsk and Lugansk republics. The international community has turned a blind eye to these atrocities, Fomin said, allowing them to continue."
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560171-pentagon-destroying-himars-russian-claims/,Pentagon denies Moscow’s HIMARS claims,"Claims by Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu about Russian troops having destroyed six US-made M142 HIMARS rocket systems in Ukraine since the start of Russia’s offensive there are untrue, the Pentagon said Tuesday. “We are aware of these latest claims by Minister Shoigu and they are patently false,” said the Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs and the Pentagon’s acting spokesman Todd Breasseale, as quoted by Reuters. According to him, all HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) are “fully accounted for” and the Ukrainians are employing them “with devastating accuracy and effectiveness.” Earlier on Tuesday, Shoigu said Russia had destroyed six HIMARS systems along with dozens of other American-made weapon systems supplied to Ukraine. The US has sent 16 HIMARS to Kiev in total. The system is described as a ‘game-changer’ by both Ukrainian officials and numerous Western sources due to its accuracy and long range. HIMARS can fire several types of missiles, including the GMLRS 80-kilometer-range guided rockets, which have been supplied to Ukraine, as well as the ATAMCS ballistic missiles able to hit targets 300 kilometers away. The spokesman for the army of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Eduard Basurin, claimed in mid-July Ukrainian forces may have already received ATAMCS. However, days later, national security adviser to the White House Jake Sullivan said the US wasn’t ready to supply the missiles to Ukraine, out of fear they could be used to strike Russian territory, leading to an escalation in the conflict. Moscow maintains HIMARS systems have repeatedly been used by Kiev forces to target facilities that were not legitimate military targets. The most recent example of such tactics, according to the Russian military, was an attack on a penal colony in Elenovka in the DPR, which was housing Ukrainian POWs, including fighters with the notorious neo-Nazi Azov regiment. The attack left at least 50 prisoners dead and another 73 injured. Ukraine blames Russia for this strike."
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560162-azerbaijan-launches-military-operation/,Azerbaijan 'conducted military operation' in Nagorno-Karabakh,"The army of Azerbaijan has conducted a military operation against ethnic Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh militias that sought to “establish new combat positions” in the region, the nation’s defense ministry claimed in a statement on Wednesday. The operation was launched after fighters “grossly violated” the ceasefire agreement between Yerevan and Baku, mediated by Moscow in 2020, the defense ministry insisted. Baku had earlier accused the Armenians of attacking Azerbaijani positions in the region and confirmed the death of at least one soldier. Baku’s forces seized control over some “important commanding heights” during what it called 'Operation Revenge,' it added. The operation was launched after the local militias “grossly violated” the 2020 ceasefire agreement between Yerevan and Baku, mediated by Moscow in 2020, the defense ministry added. Baku had earlier accused Nagorno-Karabakh militias of attacking Azerbaijani positions in the region and confirmed the death of at least one soldier. The ministry also published a video that appears to show an airstrike on a local militia's base housing some artillery units. Footage showed several towed artillery pieces and trucks being destroyed. Tensions have been running high in Nagorno-Karabakh for days now. Most of the region, which is officially recognized as a part of Azerbaijan, is under Yerevan’s de-facto control. It is home to a majority ethnically Armenian population. Both Yerevan and Baku have recently accused each other of military provocations in the region, and have reported casualties. Russia, which has a peacekeeping force in the area, reported “ceasefire violations” and said it took measures to “resolve” the issues arising. Each side has been accusing the other of attacks, including “intensive” shelling, since Monday, when the first reports about a flare-up appeared in local media. Armenian media reported the Azerbaijani troops attacking the local ethnic Armenian militias in several locations throughout Nagorno-Karabakh over the past days, and have accused Baku of planning an offensive in the region. The Armenian Ministry of Defense confirmed the deaths of at least two soldiers in an attack by Azerbaijan, adding that 14 other servicemen had been injured. Armenia’s Security Council Secretary, Armen Grigoryan, told local media on Wednesday that Baku wanted Armenia to stop using the so-called Lachin Corridor – a mountainous pathway that links it to the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh – and to choose another route. Grigoryan has denounced such demands as violating the 2020 agreement. Russia’s peacekeeping force stationed in the region reported three ceasefire violations by Azerbaijani troops on Tuesday and said that these resulted in at least one local militia member being injured. The peacekeepers took efforts to resolve the situation by working with both the Azerbaijani and the Armenian sides, the Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement. The authorities in the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic that control the disputed region confirmed the death of at least one local militia member and have declared a partial mobilization in the region in response to the Azerbaijani actions, according to media reports. Yerevan and Baku fought a 44-day-long war in 2020, during which Azerbaijan captured parts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a territory controlled by Armenians since the early 1990s, which de-jure remains under Baku's control. The conflict ended with a ceasefire agreement that saw Russian peacekeepers deployed to the region. The situation on the ground remained tense ever since as both sides repeatedly accused each other of provoking hostilities."
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560152-sturgeon-tweet-scandal-criticism/,Scottish leader scorched over ‘militarist’ tweet,"Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has deleted her tweet about “eliminated” Russian soldiers in Ukraine after accusations of “glorifying war”. On Tuesday, Sturgeon retweeted a Ukrainian Defense Ministry post. It claimed that the “total combat losses of the enemy” included “41,170 of eliminated personnel.” As the Ukrainian military’s post had a quote from Scottish poet Robert Burns’ 'Scots Wha Hae', once considered as Scotland’s unofficial national anthem, Sturgeon added a hashtag ‘robertburns’ to the post, along with ‘#solidarity’ and a Ukrainian flag. “The First Minister of Scotland should not be glorifying war,” Labour MSP Mercedes Villalba tweeted, adding that it is possible to oppose it without “celebrating” the deaths of people and that Sturgeon should delete the post and apologize for it. Another user wondered on Twitter how the Scottish minister can “glorify the deaths” of Russian soldiers, who are “someone’s sons, brothers, fathers.” Following the wave of negative comments on social media, the first minister removed the post, but it hasn’t stopped the flow of criticism. Villalba noted that there still “has been no explanation or apology” from Sturgeon and urged the first minister to “make it clear that celebrating lives lost to war is both reckless and wrong.” Another Twitter user called Sturgeon’s tweet “deeply disgraceful” and said that “despite its removal, this says so much about her Western militarist mindset.” Some commenters went even further, calling on Sturgeon to “resign immediately” over her “disgusting” comment. “She calls them ‘enemy’ are we at war?” one of the posts said. Moscow has not updated the numbers of its troop losses since March, when it reported 1,351 military personnel killed. In June, the head of the Russian Duma’s Defense Committee, Andrey Kartapolov, claimed that, due to changes in military strategy, the Russian Army has “practically ceased to lose people.” Kiev has not disclosed its total military losses either but claims that the figure is several times lower than Russia’s. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560029-balkans-yugoslav-wars-ukraine/,'Ukraine worst conflict since WW2' narrative allows the West to forget this horrific war which shook Europe,"Europe had “77 years of almost uninterrupted peace” until Russia chose to end it by “invading” Ukraine, according to a peculiar “analysis” published by the Associated Press (AP) over the weekend. Having thus erased Yugoslavia’s bloody destruction in the 1990s, the author contradicts himself just two paragraphs later. In a surreal opener, AP’s John Leicester argues that the conflict in Ukraine is the kind of world-changing event on the same level as the first nuclear bomb test in 1945 or the 1969 moon landing. Except the moon landing didn’t really change the world – the Apollo program arguably was NASA’s high water mark – so it’s puzzling why it would even get a mention. Perhaps to emotionally prime the reader for the following whopper, which is that on February 24 this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin “chews up the world order and 77 years of almost uninterrupted peace in Europe by invading Ukraine.” Come again? Leicester, who writes from Paris and has covered Europe for AP since 2002, clearly missed out on the Balkans Wars of the 1990s. People who did not, and live with the consequences to this day, were predictably upset. The war in Bosnia (1992-1995) certainly did not qualify as “uninterrupted peace” – unless this was considered Europe only on the maps. Nor did the 1999 “humanitarian intervention” in Kosovo, which had consequences that were on display on Sunday. The entire article basically hinges on that one word, “almost.” Almost uninterrupted peace in Europe looks like this:- civil wars- aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina - city sieges- mass graves - destroyed homes- broken families- hunger snd poverty- empty towns and villagesBut we are in Europe only on the map, right? #balkanshttps://t.co/gF5HK1BF2C It might be possible Leicester – and his AP editors – had forgotten all about these episodes. There is a curious lack of interest in the West in questioning the official narratives of the Yugoslav wars, after all. Except just two paragraphs later, Leicester cites an emotionally charged issue straight out of the Bosnian War – Srebrenica – to compare the Russians to Nazis. Taking into consideration that his “analysis” is just dripping with emotionally charged language, this suggests that either Leicester and AP don’t consider the Balkans properly “Europe,” or chose to gloss over the conflicts there in order to bend reality to their preferred narrative – that of Russia upsetting Europe’s peaceful slumber. Just look at this verbiage: “generations of Europeans who had grown up knowing only peace have been brutally awakened to both its value and its fragility.” Or this: “the need to take sides — for self-preservation and to stand for right against wrong.” Or lamenting that the world was making such “progress, with speedy vaccines against the Covid-19 global pandemic and deals on climate change, before Russia’s all-powerful Putin made it his historical mission to force independent, Western-looking Ukraine at gunpoint back into the Kremlin’s orbit, as it had been during Soviet times, when he served as an intelligence officer for the feared KGB.” Just one trope after another, strung together for maximum emotional impact. At this point it is tempting, as one online researcher did, to wonder “how quickly the once venerable AP descended into an all-out dumpster fire.” Not just when it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, either – the agency’s almost comical “don’t say recession” coverage of the US economy under President Joe Biden has prompted one pollster to describe them as “disgustingly dishonest” people who have been “shilling” for the Democrats for years. These disgustingly dishonest people are just as responsible for the recession as those who implemented the policies.He and @AP were pushing recession fears when the economy was growing at 3% under Trump, and has been shilling for Biden for two years.https://t.co/AISQ9h99Dohttps://t.co/aEBM0grSMo Another example of this is on display in AP’s coverage of the House January 6 Committee, an unusual collection of Democrats “enriched” by two rabidly anti-Trump GOP representatives. In addition to the emotional undertones, the agency insists on calling the Capitol riot an “insurrection,” a loaded term preferred by the Democrats, in order to invoke the 14th Amendment and disenfranchise the opposition. In a gripping moment, the Jan. 6 panel showed former President Trump refusing to deliver a speech the day after the Capitol insurrection declaring the election was over.@AP explains the moment’s significance. https://t.co/yMVThDR6Jepic.twitter.com/tVnjrQvKWP Compare that to AP bending over backwards not to describe the 2020 riots as “riots,” but literally anything else. Their explanation? The word “riot” would “stigmatize broad swaths of people protesting against lynching, police brutality or for racial justice, going back to the urban uprisings of the 1960s.” Instead, the AP’s Stylebook – used by most English-speaking journalists around the world – advises using different euphemisms, depending on who the violence is directed at. In other words, the What matters less than Who is doing it to Whom. If once is coincidence, twice is happenstance, and three times is enemy action, then this is a veritable onslaught on the very meaning of words, perpetrated by one of the world’s largest “news” agencies. This is about more than Ukraine, or the Balkans wars, or the Biden recession, or the “fiery but mostly peaceful” riots – it’s about reality itself and the people who try to twist it, whatever their reasons."
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560150-pelosi-taiwan-global-war/,Kremlin weighs in on risk of China-US war,"The visit that US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi paid to Taiwan this week is a “clear provocation” that has nothing to do with supporting democracy, the Kremlin believes. But despite the spike in US-China tensions that it triggered, the stunt is unlikely to lead to major hostilities, the spokesman for the Russian president’s office has said. “I would suggest not to throw around words as serious [as ‘global war’],” Dmitry Peskov told the media when asked about the situation. That said, “underestimating the level of tension sparked by this visit” is not advisable either, he added. Pelosi arrived in Taiwan in what she described as a gesture of support of its “democratic” administration against “authoritarian” nations. She went through with the visit despite objections from Beijing. China considers the self-governed island part of its territory, a position that the US formally acknowledged in the 1970s. Taiwan was the last stronghold of Chinese nationalist forces defeated by communists during the 1940s civil war. Despite recognizing the government in Beijing as the sole representative of the Chinese people, Washington has maintained an informal relationship with Taipei for decades. Beijing perceives the visit by Pelosi – a first for a speaker of the US House in 25 years – as an attack on its ‘One China’ policy. It warned that there will be consequences for it. The Chinese armed forces announced military exercises around the island after Pelosi’s arrival. Beijing has also imposed trade restrictions on Taiwan."
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560147-greater-eurasian-partnership-russia/,New Russian foreign policy priority outlined,"The promotion of free trade and regional integration across greater Eurasia may become a priority for Russian foreign policy for years to come, says Aleksey Drobinin, who is a senior strategist at the Russian Foreign Ministry. The idea behind the so-called Greater Eurasian Partnership (GEP) is to foster economic relations between nations without interfering with their domestic policies. It would serve as “a framework contour for economic integration and security, which would be open for all nations and organizations on the continent,” according to Drobinin. “Its added value would be the harmonious conjunction of integration projects, national development strategies, chains of production and logistics and energy transport corridors,” he wrote in a keynote article, published on Wednesday. GEP was first proposed by President Vladimir Putin in 2015. He promoted its merits in late May as he was addressing the leaders of the Eurasian Economic Union, a regional integration body that includes several former Soviet republics. Putin called GEP “a big civilizational project” meant to “change the political and economic architecture of the entire continent, become a safeguard of stability and prosperity that would account for the diversity of development models, cultures and traditions of all peoples.”"

One way or another, they will be fulfilled,” the official told journalists. Peskov went on to explain that back in late March the two countries were close to settling their differences in a way that was acceptable to Russia, but the draft agreement prepared during a meeting in Istanbul was torpedoed by the Ukrainian side. Kiev broke off talks with Moscow after accusing Russia of committing war crimes, an allegation that Russia said was based on fabricated evidence. The Ukrainian leadership has since insisted that negotiations can only be resumed after Russia is defeated on the battlefield with the help of Western weapons. Dmitry Peskov also commented on the recent visit to Moscow by former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who, the Kremlin spokesman confirmed, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Despite media speculation that the former German leader could serve as a mediator in the Ukraine conflict, the 78-year-old “expressed no desire” to do so, Peskov said. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560047-ukraine-lebanon-food-crisis/,"As Lebanon suffers an unprecedented food crisis, Ukraine uses Western support to block flour and wheat from its markets","A Syrian-flagged ship named the Laodicea that docked in the Lebanese port of Tripoli was detained last Saturday, preventing desperately needed flour and barley from reaching people in the Middle East. The move came after Western threats against Beirut and unsubstantiated claims from Kiev that the cargo was stolen from Ukraine. The ship, which has been on a US blacklist since 2015 for allegedly carrying shipments from sanctioned Crimea, is now under investigation. On Friday, allegations emerged in Western media, citing the Ukrainian embassy in Beirut, that “stolen” flour and barley had been transferred to the Lebanese port of Tripoli and that Kiev had warned the Lebanese government against buying the grain. The news was said to have sparked protests from Western governments “warning” Lebanon’s Foreign Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, over the allegedly stolen cargo. It later turned out that Kiev possessed no evidence that the flour and barley aboard the ship was from Ukraine. Despite this, Lebanon has now seized the ship and will act according to legal proceedings on the issue, after reported Western pressure. The Ukrainian embassy in Beirut told Reuters that ""the ship has traveled from a Crimean port that is closed to international shipping, carrying 5,000 tonnes of barley and 5,000 tonnes of flour that we suspect was taken from Ukrainian stores,"" without presenting evidence to support the claim. An official from a private firm responsible for the import of the grain, Loyal Agro Co LTD, based in Turkey, not only denied that the goods were Ukrainian, but also clarified that the ship was carrying 8,000 tonnes of flour and 1,700 tonnes of barley in total. The vessel was also said to have been seeking private buyers in Lebanon, not a sale to the Lebanese government, and was destined to travel on to Syria after its stop in Tripoli. Additionally, the Russian embassy in Beirut said that it had “no information regarding the Syrian vessel or a cargo brought to Lebanon by a private company.” An official at the Lebanese port authority also stated that there was “nothing wrong” with the cargo aboard the ship. None of this however, was enough to prevent the issue being pursued and for Lebanon to be threatened. What makes this issue troubling, is that - without evidence – Western nations and Kiev can openly pressure Lebanon to keep much needed supplies away from its people, in this case potentially forever and for at least 72 hours under detention. The country is currently suffering its worst ever economic collapse, enduring shortages in food, medicine, electricity and essential goods. According to some UN estimates, some 78% of the Lebanese population now live in poverty. The food shortage has led to long queues at bakeries, sometimes resulting in gunfire and brawls between people fighting over the limited supply of bread. The Ukraine crisis has made Lebanon’s predicament even tougher, with a lack of flow of supplies from Ukraine and difficulties bringing in Russian goods due to sanctions. The Western “Caesar Act” sanctions against Syria have also made the situation even worse, as Lebanon has historically benefited greatly from its bigger neighbor. What Kiev is doing, by threatening the future of bilateral relations between Lebanon and Ukraine over this issue, could be interpreted as blackmail. Ukraine has 20 million tonnes of wheat that it still hasn’t exported and a severing of relations with Beirut would mean that Lebanon could potentially miss out on acquiring it during a food shortage. The Lebanese government is clearly in a weak position and Kiev, backed by the power of NATO, is now attempting to bully Beirut over unsubstantiated claims that are denied by all sides, notwithstanding that officials won’t even state the allegation with certainty. Another issue here is the double-standard at play, whilst Western nations suffer economically themselves, there is no hesitation at sending billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine every other week. Yet when it comes to simply amending sanctions, after pledging to do so, in order to allow Egypt to send gas to ease the energy crisis in Lebanon, Washington still refuses to allow it, a year later. Instead, based upon unsubstantiated claims, Lebanon is forced to suffer even more by having basic food supplies dangled over its head. Whilst the West acts holier-than-thou on the issue of unsubstantiated claims of Ukraine’s grain being sold by private firms in Lebanon, it seemingly forgets that the US illegally occupies neighboring Syria’s most fertile agricultural lands, in addition to the majority of its oil and gas fields. America has repeatedly been accused of smuggling Syrian grain and oil into Iraq, resources which should belong to the Syrian government and could be part of the answer to Lebanon’s current shortage."
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560143-us-policy-nuclear-war-planning/,Nuclear conflict scenarios back on table – Moscow,"Policies enacted by the US have forced other world powers to revive their nuclear war planning, senior Russian diplomat Alexey Drobinin has claimed. The comments from Drobinin, who serves as head of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Foreign Policy Planning Department, offer an insight into Moscow's current thinking in this sphere. “Built by generations of negotiators, the framework for arms control and preservation of strategic stability is now being dismantled at the instigation of the US. The Americans have lowered the first-strike threshold in their military doctrine,” Drobinin wrote in an article for the Mezhdunarodnaya Zhizn (International Life) magazine published Wednesday. “These and other concerning factors are yet again bringing the most dangerous scenarios of conflict between nuclear powers, fraught with disastrous consequences, back into the view of military planners,” he warned. Nevertheless, the emergence of a multipolar world order – in which Russia is actively involved – will make the globe a safer place, unless the West chooses to interfere, the diplomat argues. “Everyone will benefit from the multipolarity and deglobalization – provided no-one disrupts the natural course of these objective phenomena,” Drobinin argued. “What is of crucial importance here is how the political establishment of North America and Western Europe chooses to behave… Unless they are able to suppress the pain they are feeling over losing their power over the world – however humanly understandable that pain may be – and stop ‘grabbing the gun’ every time patient diplomacy is in order, the alarming trend of the growing importance of strength in international affairs will not only endure but intensify,” Drobinin wrote. On Monday, in a letter to participants of the tenth Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated that there would be no winners in a nuclear war, and it must never be allowed to happen. The landmark New START remains the only major arms control agreement between Moscow and Washington still in force. In early 2021, the deal was on the brink of expiration, but it was ultimately salvaged shortly after Biden’s inauguration, when Washington finally agreed to Moscow’s calls to prolong the deal without any preconditions. It is currently set to expire in 2026."
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560138-un-security-council-reform-russia/,Russia calls for reform of UN Security Council,"The United Nations is in dire need of reform and the Security council must be “democratized” by expanding its representation, Russian foreign ministry official Alexey Drobinin has written in a keynote article published on Wednesday. Drobinin, the Director of the Department of Foreign Policy Planning, commented on the current state of international relations and came to the conclusion that “more conscious effort and imagination is needed” to reform the UN. He pointed out that the organization’s current agenda, which is primarily fueled by the West, is not necessarily in line with the interests of the majority of its international members. Drobinin suggested that for most UN members the most important issues are things like access to cheap energy sources rather than the transition to “green” technologies, socio-economic development rather than human rights “in an ultra-liberal interpretation,” and security and sovereign equality rather than the artificial imposition of electoral democracy according to Western patterns. He added that another topic that has once-again become relevant is the process of decolonization and ending the neo-colonial practices by transnational corporations in regards to the development of natural resources in developing countries. However, international organizations such as the UN have essentially been “privatized” by the West, Drobinin points out. He suggests that the UN Secretariat and the offices of special envoys and special representatives of the Secretary General have all been saturated with the West’s own “tested” personnel, and that this also extended to non-UN organizations as well, such as the OPCW. “The saddest thing is that this rust is eating away at the ‘holy of holies’ of the UN system – the Security Council,” Drobinin writes. “It devalues the meaning of the right of veto, which the founding fathers endowed to the permanent members of the Security Council with one single purpose: to prevent the interests of any of the great powers from being infringed, and thus save the world from a direct clash between them, which in the nuclear age is fraught with catastrophic consequences.” While there are no “clear and simple recipes for correcting the situation here,” the diplomat continues, “clearly more conscious effort and imagination is needed when it comes to UN reform.” He goes on to suggest that the Security Council needs to be “democratized,” first of all by expanding the representation of African, Asian and Latin American countries. Drobinin suggests that whatever the fate of international organizations such as the UN, WTO, IMF, World Bank or G20 is, the divisive policies of the West makes it “an absolute imperative for the coming years to form a new infrastructure of international relations.” “After their frankly perfidious decisions and actions against Russia, its citizens and tangible assets, we simply cannot afford the luxury of not thinking about alternatives. Especially since many of our friends who have lost faith in Western benevolence and decency are thinking about the same thing,” the diplomat surmised."
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560135-fire-moscow-istra-ozon/,Inferno engulfs warehouse of major Russian online retailer (VIDEO),"A huge fire has engulfed a warehouse of Russia’s leading e-commerce platform Ozon near Moscow, with hundreds of people forced to flee the site. The blaze spans an area of 55,000 square meters, according to the emergency services. Around 1,000 people have been evacuated from the burning facility. Videos from the scene circulating on social media have captured a massive pall of thick black smoke coming from the warehouse and rising high into the air. According to some reports, the roof of the building has collapsed because of the blaze. One person has died as a result of the blaze, while 13 others are injured, the emergencies services told RIA Novosti news agency. Earlier reports suggested there were only a few hospitalizations, with most of the patients receiving treatment on site. Dozens of fire trucks and ambulances have been rushed to the scene, with Russia's Emergency Situations ministry also using aviation to tackle the blaze. Helicopters have been filmed dropping water onto the burning warehouse. The Ozon warehouse building can no longer be saved, according to Moscow region Governor Andrey Vorobyov. Russia’s Investigative Committee has opened a criminal case over the alleged provision of unsafe services by the retailer, which allegedly resulted in the blaze. Petrovskoe village, which hosts the ill-fated warehouse, is located some 40 kilometers west of Moscow. Ozon is one of the largest online retailers in the country, with some 25.6 million active clients last year. The company is sometimes referred to as ‘Russia’s Amazon.’"
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560133-world-west-breakup-irreversible/,Cooperation with the West is over – Russia,"Russia's decades long attempt to integrate with the west is not only over, but even cooperation is now off the cards, a senior strategist in Moscow has warned. Aleksey Drobinin, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Foreign Policy Planning Department, believes that future dealings can only take place on a ""transactional"" basis. Drobinin, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Foreign Policy Planning Department, was writing in a keynote article published on Wednesday. He explained that the West is trying to protect its power from an emerging multipolar world, which means countries like Russia which reject Washington’s so-called “rules-based order” must resist. Thus, after the present crisis in Ukraine, there can be no return to attempts at a rapprochement with the US and its allies, he argues. Russia’s attack against Ukraine became “a milestone on the path towards a new world order,” Drobinin added. He heads a department responsible for academic research and strategic planning on behalf of the ministry. “Regardless of the duration and outcome of the special military operation, even now we can acknowledge that a three-decade-long period of mostly constructive, if problematic cooperation with the West is gone for good,” he said. The breakup dispels “the last illusions” that Russians may have about the merits of a “friendly takeover” of their country by the US and its allies after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the analyst added. He assessed that amid the current confrontation, the “irrational equation of Western with ‘progressive,’ Western with ‘attractive’” by some people in Russia was no longer “up to date.” Such moods, he said, persisted in various forms since the time of Peter the Great, who ruled the country in the late 17th and early 18th century. The 3,500-word article gives a preview of the upcoming update of Russia’s foreign-policy concept, a document that guides the work of the foreign ministry and other parts of the government. Moscow perceives as inevitable the arrival of a multipolar world order, which would replace a brief moment of US-led unipolarity that emerged in the 1990s. Several “civilizational” blocs, each led by a powerful nation like the US, China or Russia, will be the stakeholders in the future, but the exact configuration is yet to be determined, Drobinin predicted. The diplomat accused the US of actively undermining international institutions and of otherwise destabilizing the world in a fruitless attempt to delay the reduction of its power. Russia is at the forefront of opposing Washington, he said. “We have to realize that the Russophobic-minded collective West is a dangerous and motivated … opponent that remains strong, has a leading military-technological potential and controls a large portion of the global markets, financial resources, logistical chains and flows of information,” he warned. Russia will pursue closer ties with non-Western players, foster regional integration, help create new international financial and management mechanisms that would be free from Western control and otherwise ensure that it would have a say in how the future multipolar world would work, Drobinin said. “For many [nations] the acute problems are access to cheap energy (not a switch to ‘green’ technology), socio-economic development (not the ultraliberal version of human rights), security and sovereign equality (not the imposed Western-style electoral democracy),” he argued. As for dealing with nations that Russia deems “unfriendly,” it is currently “only possible on a one-shot transactional basis … in cases where Russia would benefit and where there is no suitable alternative,” the diplomat said. According to Drobinin, Moscow hopes that Europe would distance itself from Washington and become a force of its own, as political forces pursuing sovereignty and national interests gain power. Russia could “offer to Europe a scheme of future cooperation that would on the one hand support autonomist desires of the Europeans and on the other hand would ensure that our nation would not face any kinds of threats from the European direction,” he wrote. Pursuing that goal would be a challenge, he acknowledged."
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560127-russia-nuclear-biden-start-lavrov/,Russia contradicts Biden’s nuclear talks claim,"The US did not come up with any proposals regarding an arms control agreement that could potentially replace the landmark New START, or Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov explained on Wednesday. “At the current state of foreign relations development, they didn’t even propose to renew these talks… No requests on reopening this negotiating process have been made,” Lavrov told a press conference during his trip to Myanmar. He noted that the West “has developed a habit of making announcements on the microphone and then forgetting about them.” Lavrov also commented on the possible participation of China in arms control negotiations, saying that the decision will be made only by Beijing itself. “The Americans know our stance on this matter perfectly well,” he said. According to Lavrov, the latest talks on replacing New START after it expires in 2026 were held last year. After two rounds of discussions on the matter, the US side took a break, he said. The Russian foreign minister’s remarks come after US President Joe Biden said that Washington is ready to negotiate “a new arms control framework” with Russia. “Today, my administration is ready to expeditiously negotiate a new arms control framework to replace New START when it expires in 2026. But negotiation requires a willing partner operating in good faith,” Biden said on Monday, referring to the landmark document that puts caps on the number of strategic nuclear missiles and warheads held by Russia and the US. Biden also urged Beijing to join the dialogue on nuclear disarmament, saying that China “has a responsibility” as a nuclear weapons state “to engage in talks that will reduce the risk of miscalculation and address destabilizing military dynamics.” Moscow has repeatedly called on the US to unconditionally extend the deal for another five years, while Washington during Donald Trump’s presidency floated various proposals on its amendment, saying in particular, that it wants China to join. Shortly before the treaty was set to expire in February 2021, it was extended after Biden was sworn into office. Beijing, however, rejected attempts by the former US administration to drag it into the framework and declined to join talks on the expansion of the US-Russia agreement. China has argued that its nuclear arsenal is too small compared to the stockpiles maintained by the US and Russia."
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560115-lavrov-pelosi-taiwan-flashpoint/,Pelosi created 'flashpoint out of thin air' – Lavrov,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has condemned US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan, branding it a display of American disregard for international norms. “It was the drive to prove to everyone their impunity and to act accordingly. ‘I do whatever I want’, something like that,” the minister told journalists on Wednesday. “I can hardly imagine any other reason to create a flashpoint out of thin air, despite knowing what it would mean for China.” Pelosi arrived on the self-governed Chinese island on Tuesday and met its leader Tsai Ing-wen, despite repeated warnings from Beijing to stay away. The third highest-ranking US official praised Taiwan as a fellow “democracy” and pledged American support for it against “autocratic” China. Washington formally acknowledges that Taiwan is part of China, but maintains a close informal relationship with its administration despite switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. The Chinese government has repeatedly said that trips by US officials encourage separatist forces on the island and thus violate China’s territorial integrity. Amid the uncertainty last week over whether Pelosi’s then-rumored visit to Taiwan would take place, China warned that the US was “playing with fire” and that there will be consequences, if it happened. The Chinese military has since launched a massive military exercise near Taiwan – which the island’s government claimed virtually amounted to a blockade – and imposed some trade restrictions, banning Taiwanese firms from buying sand and selling some food products."
2022-08-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/560109-russia-nuclear-ukraine-nato/,Russia rejects ‘nuclear saber-rattling’ accusations,"Russia’s doctrine for the use of nuclear weapons is very clear and the current conflict in Ukraine does not meet any of its criteria, Moscow’s envoy to the UN nonproliferation review conference said on Tuesday. Alexander Trofimov also rejected a series of claims by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken as “utterly unfounded” speculation, perhaps intended to fuel “anti-Russian hysteria.” “We would also like to strongly reject the utterly unfounded, detached from reality and unacceptable speculations that Russia allegedly threatens to use nuclear weapons, particularly in Ukraine,” Trofimov said on Tuesday, using the right of reply to address the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) review conference in New York. Russia’s nuclear doctrine is “explicitly clear,” envisioning their use only in the event of attacks involving weapons of mass destruction or a conventional aggression endangering the state’s existence, Trofimov said. “Neither of these two hypothetical scenarios is relevant to the situation in Ukraine.” The Russian diplomat condemned “unscrupulous interpretations” of Moscow’s decision to put its nuclear deterrent on alert earlier this year, saying the grounds for it were “confrontational actions and provocative statements by representatives of Western nuclear powers about the possibility of NATO interference in military actions in Ukraine against Russia.” While he did not name the accusers, Trofimov’s response specifically addressed the claims by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who on Monday accused Russia of “reckless, dangerous nuclear saber-rattling,” to “those supporting Ukraine’s self-defense.” Blinken also accused Russia of violating the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which guaranteed Ukraine’s independence in exchange for giving up Soviet nuclear weapons left on its territory. According to Trofimov, “Russia has strictly fulfilled its obligations” under the memorandum, “including in recent months,” while Kiev’s statements about obtaining nuclear weapons “call into question the viability” of the 1994 document. Ukraine has also violated the memo for “many years,” in particular regarding provisions against “aggressive nationalism and chauvinism,” he added. Blinken’s interpretation of the Russian leadership’s statements as a threat to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine is “unscrupulous and does not stand up to any criticism,” Trofimov argued. They were directed at NATO, as a way to deter the West from direct aggression against Russia in the context of the Ukrainian crisis, he added, noting that the West has already “moved towards a fierce hybrid confrontation and dangerously balances on the edge of open military clash.” Such a move would be able to trigger one of the two emergency scenarios described in our doctrine. We obviously stand for preventing this, but if Western countries try to test our resolve, Russia will not back down. The Russian mission to the UN has already objected to Blinken’s accusation that Moscow is using the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant as a “human shield,” pointing out on Monday evening that the Ukrainian side has been targeting the plant, Europe’s largest, with artillery and explosive drones in recent weeks. Trofimov also felt compelled to note that “only one country in the world actually used nuclear weapons – it was the United States, which dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, even though this has not reasons from the point of view of military expediency and was in fact a testing of weapons of mass destruction on Japanese cities and their inhabitants.”"
2022-08-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/560107-zelensky-ukraine-donbass-hell/,Donbass fighting is ‘hell’ – Zelensky,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said on Tuesday that the fighting in Donbass was “hell,” claiming that Kiev’s military remained heavily outgunned and even outnumbered by Russia and appealing to the US and its allies for even more weapons such as the HIMARS rocket launchers. In a five-minute address to Ukrainians, Zelensky thanked US President Joe Biden and NATO for sending the rocket artillery, calling it “very effective” and vowing to inflict “more painful losses” on the Russians, whom he described as a “horde” of invaders. “The word ‘HIMARS’ has become almost synonymous with the word ‘justice’ for our country,” Zelensky said. The US has sent 16 of the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems to Ukraine so far. Russia said it had destroyed four of them, though Ukraine and the Pentagon have denied this. Zelensky added that he was expecting even more weapons from the West and thanked the Ukrainian diplomats trying to arrange for additional shipments. “Yet we are unable to break the Russian army’s advantage in artillery and manpower, and this is very much felt in the fighting, especially in Donbass. Peski, Avdeevka, other directions … It’s just hell there. It cannot even be described in words,” the Ukrainian president added. The two towns near Donetsk, heavily fortified since 2015, have seen heavy fighting over the past week. On Tuesday, Ukrainian journalist Yuriy Butusov, embedded with the military in Donbass, posted an expletive-laden report from Peski calling it a “meat grinder.” Butusov infamously filmed himself firing a cannon on the Donbass “separatists” last year. “There is no counter-battery fire, none at all,” he wrote on Tuesday. Russian forces were firing “6,500 shells per f****g village in less than 24 hours. It’s been like this for six days now, and it’s hard to fathom how any number of our infantry remain alive under this barrage.” Ukrainian troops were holding the line, Butusov claimed, but “without counter-battery fighting, it turns into a senseless meat grinder, where huge numbers of our infantry are chewed up in one day.” According to Butusov, a reserve platoon that tried to advance was taken apart in minutes, with only one out of 15 men left unharmed. “All the reserves are spent, the military equipment goes up in flames, and the enemy approaches and takes our positions without any problems after another barrage of artillery,” he wrote. “Right now we are losing Péski, all our human and material capabilities are almost exhausted.” While Zelensky did not go into this much detail, he did say that of the 167 service members he was decorating this week, 32 would get their awards posthumously. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/560100-sanctions-skolkovo-magnitogorsk-kabaeva/,US sanctions Russian ‘Silicon Valley’,"Washington on Tuesday announced a new round of embargoes targeting Russia’s finance and technology sectors, in particular the semiconductor industry. Among the entities sanctioned by the State Department are the Skolkovo technology park outside Moscow – Russia’s equivalent of Silicon Valley – and MMK, one of the world’s largest steel producers. The Skolkovo Foundation, Technopark Skolkovo LLC and the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) found themselves blacklisted for “operating or having operated in the technology sector of the Russian Federation economy.” Also targeted by the State Department sanctions was the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MFTI), for “operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector,” specifically developing drones for use by the Russian military. The Treasury Department said the new US sanctions were targeting “Kremlin-connected elites, a major multinational company, and a sanctions evasion operation, as well as one yacht.” The embargoed “elites” and businesses operate in “economic sectors that generate substantial revenue for the Russian regime,” the Treasury said. The sanctioned yacht is Alfa Nero, a Cayman Islands-flagged ship belonging to the newly sanctioned Andrey Guryev. He is the founder of PhosAgro, the leading Russian manufacturer of chemical fertilizer. The company itself has not been sanctioned, the Treasury hastened to note. Alfa Nero “has reportedly shut off its location tracking hardware in order to avoid seizure,” the US government added. Among the 13 individuals and 30 entities sanctioned on Tuesday is Viktor Rashnikov, majority owner and chairman of the board of MMK, along with the Magnitogorsk-based steel-maker itself. MMK’s finance division and the Turkish-based MMK Metalurji subsidiary were also embargoed. Americans who have open business with MMK have until September 1 to wrap it up, and until October 3 to divest any debts. The deadline for dealing with the Turkish company is January 31, 2023. The most notable name on the list of “elites” allegedly close to the Kremlin is Alina Kabaeva. The retired rhythmic gymnast and former lawmaker was sanctioned for having been a government official, having a “close relationship” to President Vladimir Putin, and being the head of the National Media Group, “a pro-Kremlin empire of television, radio, and print organizations.” Back in 2015, British tabloids spread the rumor that Kabaeva was Putin’s secret lover, after the Russian president was not seen in public for over a week – having been on holiday."
2022-08-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/560094-lavrov-pelosi-asia-trips/,Moscow compares Lavrov and Pelosi’s trips to Asia,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is traveling to Asia to promote cooperation, not to provoke China like US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, his spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Tuesday. Moscow’s chief diplomat is scheduled to visit Myanmar and attend the Russia-ASEAN meeting in Cambodia. “It’s hot there now, in every sense,” Zakharova said on Telegram. “Lavrov brings not provocation, like Pelosi, but cooperation. See you there!” Pelosi, the California Democrat currently presiding over the US House of Representatives, flew to Taiwan on Tuesday evening, ignoring a string of Chinese warnings and protests. She is the most senior US official to visit the island in 25 years. “Our Congressional delegation’s visit to Taiwan honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant Democracy,” she said in a statement, released after landing in Taipei. Her op-ed in the Washington Post, laying out the reasons for her visit, was published shortly thereafter, suggesting the trip was prepared in advance. Beijing has reacted with fury, denouncing Pelosi’s trip as “a serious violation of the one-China principle” and of three joint communiqués signed with the US. “It has a severe impact on the political foundation of China-US relations, and seriously infringes upon China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that Russia stands “in absolute solidarity with China,” adding that Pelosi’s trip was “purely provocative” and likely to worsen geopolitical tensions in the region. The Chinese military presence near the island has been drastically increased in recent days. Beijing has announced air, sea and missile drills off the coast of Taiwan for the rest of the week. The nationalist Kuomintang has ruled the island since 1949, after losing the Chinese civil war to the Communists and retreating there with US help. Beijing officially considers Taiwan China’s sovereign territory, which will be reintegrated in due course."
2022-08-02,https://www.rt.com/news/560071-ukraine-zelensky-us-pelosi/,‘Deep mistrust’ between US and Zelensky – NYT,"There is a “deep mistrust” between the administration of US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, a New York Times columnist claimed in an article published on Monday. The US has so far been the strongest backer of Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, providing billions of dollars in military aid along with intelligence, but according to the paper’s foreign affairs columnist Thomas L. Friedman, relations between Washington and Kiev are not as they seem. “Privately, US officials are a lot more concerned about Ukraine’s leadership than they are letting on,” Friedman, a three-time Pulitzer Prize winner, wrote. “There is deep mistrust between the White House and Ukraine President Vladimir Zelensky — considerably more than has been reported.” The NYT writer described Zelensky’s decision to fire Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova and the head of the State Security Service (SBU), Ivan Bakanov, in mid-July as “funny business going on in Kiev.” Friedman noted that he hasn’t yet seen any reporting in the US media that “convincingly explains” the reasons behind the largest shakeup in the Kiev government since the launch of the Russian military operation on February 24. “It is as if we don’t want to look too closely under the hood in Kiev for fear of what corruption or antics we might see, when we have invested so much there,” he wrote. The piece was published ahead of the then-unconfirmed visit of the US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the self-governed Chinese island of Taiwan, which Friedmn criticized as a move that would be “utterly reckless, dangerous and irresponsible.” Its negative consequences could include “a Chinese military response that could result in the US being plunged into indirect conflicts with a nuclear-armed Russia and a nuclear-armed China at the same time,” he warned. On Tuesday afternoon, despite warnings from Beijing, Pelosi’s plane landed in Taiwan, which China considers to be part of its territory. In response, China vowed to take “measures to resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Pelosi has become the most high-ranking US official to visit the island since 1997. The columnist urged Washington to “keep your eyes on the prize” instead of provoking Beijing. “Today that prize is crystal clear: We must ensure that Ukraine is able, at a minimum, to blunt — and, at a maximum, reverse — Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked invasion, which if it succeeds will pose a direct threat to the stability of the whole European Union,” he insisted. Russia sent troops into Ukraine five months ago, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-08-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/560073-us-ukrainian-war-crimes/,US responsible for Ukrainian ‘war crimes’ – Russian MoD,"Washington bears “political, criminal, and moral responsibility” for “war crimes” committed by the Ukrainian military, Russia’s Defense Ministry said on Tuesday. The statement came in response to an interview by a top Ukrainian spy, who revealed that Kiev consults with Washington before using US-made HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems and that Washington actually has veto power over decision-making. “All this irrefutably proves that Washington, contrary to the statements of the White House and the Pentagon, is directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine. It is the Biden administration that is directly responsible for all the Kiev-approved missile attacks on residential areas and civilian infrastructure in the settlements across Donbass and other regions that caused mass civilian casualties,” Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov has said. According to Moscow, US-supplied HIMARS systems have repeatedly been used by Kiev forces to target facilities that were not legitimate military targets. Arguably the most dire recent example of this strategy was an attack on a penal colony in Elenovka in the Donetsk People’s Republic, which was housing Ukrainian POWs, including fighters with the notorios neo-Nazi Azov regiment. The attack left at least 50 prisoners dead and another 73 injured. “The Biden administration, together with Zelensky, bears political, criminal, and moral responsibility for the massacre in Elenovka and other war crimes in Ukraine,” Konashenkov said. The explosive interview with a Ukrainian senior intelligence official, Major General Vadim Skibitsky, was published by The Telegraph newspaper on Monday. The spy revealed Kiev’s troops were getting feedback from Washington and London before launching HIMARS rockets. This allows “Washington to stop any potential attacks if they were unhappy with the intended target,” The Telegraph noted. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-08-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/560076-russia-terrorism-sponsor-zakharova/,Moscow warns of cutting ties with US,"If the hawks in the US Congress get their way and have Washington designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, it would likely result in a full breakdown of diplomatic relations between the two nations, The Russian Foreign Ministry warned on Tuesday. “If people in Washington decide to fully stop any interaction with Moscow, we can live with that. There should be no doubt about that,” ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova told journalists during a media briefing. The idea to add Russia to the blacklist, which already includes Iran, North Korea, Syria and Cuba, is championed by some lawmakers, like Senator Lindsey Graham. A non-binding resolution calling on the US Department of State to take such a move was passed by the Senate last week. A similar move by the House is strongly advocated by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who drew media attention this week due to her potential visit to Taiwan. China called the trip a serious provocation. “I hope that the flying speaker will soon return to her home base and discuss [branding Russia a sponsor of terrorism] with people who have at least some interest in how the diplomacy trade works,” Zakharova remarked. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reportedly resisted calls from Capitol Hill and from Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky for the terrorism designation to be slapped on Russia. The White House argued that such a move would have no practical effect in terms of anti-Russian sanctions that the US is willing to impose and may backfire in various ways. Zakharova said if the US were to label Russia a state sponsor of terrorism, it would constitute a “point of no return” for the two nations. The calls to do so are a sign of American weakness, she stated, since Washington is no longer in a position to simply bend to its will any nation whose policy it does not like for some reason."
2022-08-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/560070-us-involvement-ukraine-conflict/,US directly involved in Ukraine conflict – Moscow,"Statements made by Vadim Skibitsky, a representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, confirm that the United States is directly involved in the ongoing conflict there, according to Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. In an interview with the Telegraph published on Monday, Skibitsky refused to answer questions about whose satellites are used to confirm targets for US-made HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems. He did acknowledge, however, that they consult with Washington before launching strikes and that Washington has veto power over decision-making. “No other confirmation of the direct involvement of the United States in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine is required,” Zakharova said on Tuesday, because the US doesn’t just arm and train Ukrainian forces but essentially shoots the weapons themselves. Zakharova stressed that the US is directly involved and that its distance from the situation is irrelevant. “They are fully involved. Now Kiev representatives are talking about their military involvement not only through the supply of weapons, but through personnel management in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, direct instructions and the choice of targets,” Zakharova added. Speculation has been ongoing about Washington’s involvement in the conflict. For example, in April French journalist Georges Malbrunot went viral on social media after claiming to have seen first-hand that Americans are “in charge” of the Ukrainian war effort on the ground. However, he stressed that this was not an official involvement as it was American mercenaries that he met in Ukraine. Nevertheless, skeptics have questioned the veracity of promises by US officials to avoid direct involvement or so-called “boots on the ground.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-08-02,https://www.rt.com/news/560065-russia-pelosi-taiwan-visit/,Russia stands in 'absolute solidarity' with China – Kremlin,"Russia regards the potential visit of US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan as a “purely provocative” act and fully supports China in its dispute with Washington, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said during a press conference on Tuesday. Peskov warned that while “we can’t say for sure” whether or not Pelosi will touch down on the island, her entire tour of the region and possible visit to Taipei “provokes a situation” and “leads to tension.” “We see this, it is being recorded by all countries of the world. We stand in absolute solidarity with China here. Its sensitivity to this issue is understandable. It is justified. And instead of respecting this the US is choosing the path of confrontation. It doesn’t bode well,” the Kremlin spokesman said, adding that Washington’s decision is “only regrettable.” Peskov also noted that in the event that a military conflict breaks out as a result of the ongoing tensions between China and the US over Taiwan, Russia’s borders would be secured by its own army. “Regardless of the emergence of some provocative situations, the security of our borders is reliably ensured along the entire perimeter of these borders by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation,” Peskov proclaimed. Pelosi is expected to become the first speaker of the US House or Representatives to visit Taiwan in over two decades. Beijing said the trip would be an affront to its ‘One China’ policy, through which it lays claim to sovereignty over Taiwan, and which Washington formally acknowledges. Speaking about the possible visit by the speaker during his briefing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian warned that “if you play with fire, you will get burned. I believe the US is fully aware of the strong and clear message delivered by China.” If Pelosi “dares” to travel to Taiwan, “the [People’s Liberation Army] will not sit idly by” and will take “resolute and strong countermeasures” to protect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said. Taiwan, which officially calls itself the Republic of China (ROC), has been self-governed since 1949 but has never officially declared independence from Beijing."
2022-08-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/560050-us-directs-ukraine-attacks/,West advises Ukraine on strikes with supplied weapons – top intel official,"A senior Ukrainian military intelligence official has claimed his agency was getting advice from British and American counterparts on which targets to attack with Western-supplied weapons, such as the HIMARS multiple-launch rocket systems. The Americans can ban any selection they don’t like, the general reportedly said. The Americans can ban any strike they don’t like, the general reportedly said. The revelation came on Monday in an interview that Major General Vadim Skibitsky gave to The Telegraph newspaper. When discussing Ukraine’s reported successes in destroying Russian military targets with weapons provided by the West, he claimed Ukrainian forces were using “real-time information” to direct fire. “I can’t tell you whether [we are directly tasking] British and American satellites, but we have very good satellite imagery,” the British newspaper cited him as saying. The general did not claim that US officials were feeding targeting information directly to Ukraine, but said troops were getting feedback from Washington and London before launching rockets. This allows “Washington to stop any potential attacks if they were unhappy with the intended target,” The Telegraph said. US officials have frequently claimed that America does not have direct involvement in Russia’s hostilities with Ukraine, since it would put it at risk of escalating the conflict. Russia and its allies in Donetsk and Lugansk accused Ukraine of using the US-made launchers to strike non-military targets. In a recent incident a rocket attack hit a detention facility, where dozens of Ukrainian POWs were kept. Officials from the Donetsk People’s Republic showed images of what they described as fragments of HIMARS rockets used in the strike. Over 50 of the prisoners were reported killed in what Russia alleged to be an assassination of potential witnesses and perpetrators of war crimes committed by the Ukrainian side. Kiev denied responsibility for the incident and accused Russia of hitting the prison camp in Elenovka. Ukrainian officials claimed the attack was meant to cover up either abuse of the POWs or the embezzlement of money. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-08-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/559996-kiev-ukraine-remains-pows/,Who killed the POWs at Yelenovka? All signs on the ground point to a Ukrainian attack,"It was extremely difficult to witness the charred and twisted remains of Ukrainian POWs in the Yelenovka detention center at first hand. The stench of death was overwhelming. Bodies remained in the ruins and melted into the metal bunk beds they were on at the time of the bombing. Other corpses, presumably killed by shrapnel instead of burning to death, lay outside. A soldier was inspecting them, presumably in order to determine the exact cause, and the victims’ identities. Even if the Ukrainian side killed its own soldiers, it was the Russians who took care to identify the remains. I shared some of the gruesome photos and my thoughts on Twitter immediately after getting back from Yelenovka. The stench of death was everywhere. It's almost certain that Ukraine did this intentionally, to its own soldiers who had surrendered &, as Basurin pointed out, were confessing their murdering of Donbass civilians, which came from commanders' orders, which came from Kiev. pic.twitter.com/bq3zusjpX6 The next morning, I went around Donetsk to document the extremely dangerous “petal” mines Ukraine has dropped on the city. According to DPR Emergency Services, eight civilians had been killed by these mines just the day before. If you step on one of these tiny-but powerful-explosives, chances it will merely tear off a leg instead of outright killing you. And they are insidiously toy-like in appearance, likely to attract children’s attention. Ukraine and Western media, as would be expected, blame Russia for the bombing of Yelenovka detention center, which killed 53 people. Russia and the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), in turn, point the finger at Kiev. In addition to those killed, the 2am bombing, which DPR officials say was carried out using American-supplied HIMARS, injured at least eight employees and over 70 POWs held there. The prisoners were captured Ukrainian combatants, mainly members of the Azov neo-Nazi militia who’d surrendered in Mariupol in May. If HIMARS, or High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System, were indeed the source of the destruction and death, then it is almost certain it was Ukraine who bombed the prison, given that Kiev had the coordinates and is the only side in the conflict that possesses such weapons. Even the Pentagon admits it is possible, albeit characterizing the strike as “unintentional.” From a logical perspective, Russia had no motivation to bomb the prison. For Ukraine, on the other hand, these POWs represented a liability, in that they could testify to the alleged war crimes they committed against Donbass civilians. Ukraine has made a litany of claims meant to incriminate Russia throughout the current conflict –the Bucha massacre, the strike on the Mariupol maternity hospital, the Ghost of Kiev hoax, the supposed mass graves of civilians, the outlandish false allegations of Russian soldiers committing sexual crimes, which even saw the former Ukrainian Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights fired by Kiev’s own parliament. Russia has invited the UN and the International Red Cross to investigate the Yelenovka prison bombing. Meanwhile, observers online have used the publicly available data to put together a picture of what occurred. Here’s an insightful analysis from the Rybar Telegram channel (with more than 627,000 followers), specializing in military analytics: “The eastern part of the building suffered the most damage, where a powerful fire and explosion occurred, which blew out the windows.” Judging by the angle of impact, the analyst concludes that “the shooting was carried out from the trajectory of Marinka-Kurakhovo –the Sergeevka triangle– Pokrovsk-Udachnoe.” This is Ukrainian-controlled territory. The analysis could not conclude whether HIMARS was used, from the information at hand. Along the ‘who benefits?’ line of thinking, a number of circumstances also point to Kiev. These have also been pointed out by Russian observers and compiled into a chronology. The captured Azov Nazis were taken to the Yelenovka detention center in late May. While prisoner exchanges between Ukraine and Russia have included Azov fighters, there is a strong opposition to handing them back over to Kiev, meaning that there’s no guarantee that they would be exchanged in the future – potentially making them a liability to Kiev. By June 20 reports of Ukraine shelling the prison already appeared on Russian channels watching the conflict. On July 28 the confession of an Azov member emerged, claiming that neo-Nazis in Kharkov and Kiev had direct orders from Zelensky’s office to torture and murder Russian prisoners of war. Late that night/early next morning, Ukraine struck the very detention center holding the Azov member who confessed, as well as others who might have done so. One of many interviews of the azov. They talk about the war crimes and more things done to the citizens. https://t.co/KCMnJ7xipD Elsewhere, other neo-Nazis in captivity have confessed to deliberately murdering civilians, a PR disaster for Ukraine, made worse were the prisoners in Yelenovka to follow suit. Last but not least, just two days before the Yelenovka strike, the US Senate passed a resolution urging the State Department to recognize Russia as a “sponsor of terrorism.” By perpetrating an attack and blaming it on Moscow, Kiev could be aiming to push that decision through – even though the State Department is reportedly reluctant. And here’s the reason behind today's Ukrainian missile attack: Yermak, head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, wrote that the “Russian terrorist attack in Yelenovka” should lead to the recognition of Russia as a sponsor of terrorism. pic.twitter.com/MYFqoJhBNt Given Ukraine’s multiple attempts to incriminate Russia, and eight years of bombing Donbass civilians, killing their own soldiers is not too far-fetched. In fact, surrendered Ukrainian soldiers have claimed their commanders threatened to shoot them if they attempted desertion, and indeed Ukrainian nationalists firing on them when they attempted to surrender, in one case killing or wounding dozens . It is left to Russian and DPR doctors to preserve the lives of Ukrainian POWs – even those apparently injured by friendly fire. Outside a Donetsk hospital after the Yelenovka bombing, one of the doctors working on wounded Ukrainians said that five had already had successful surgery for their shrapnel wounds, and two more were to undergo operations. “It doesn’t matter which side you’re on, we will help you,” he said. The ghastly scenes of charred flesh and shrapnel-studded bodies I saw at the prison will remain etched in my mind for a long time. Yes, war is ugly, but Ukraine is upping the ante when it comes to both war crimes and hypocrisy."
2022-08-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/560036-russia-blinken-nuclear-shield/,Russia responds to ‘nuclear human shield’ claim,"Moscow's mission to the United Nations has rejected a claim by Washington that Russian forces are using Ukraine’s Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant as a “military base.” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made the allegation in a speech at the tenth Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) review conference, held at the UN headquarters in New York on Monday. Currently under the control of Russian forces, Zaporozhye NPP, located in the southeast Ukrainian city of Energodar, has been a target of several attempted strikes in recent months. On July 12, Ukrainian drones dropped several 120mm shells on a building located next to the power plant, injuring 11 employees, according to local authorities. On July 20 three Ukrainian “kamikaze drones” attacked the plant, with no damage to its structure reported. After Russia sent troops into Ukraine, the power plant and its surroundings were taken under guard for the exact purpose of preventing such “nuclear provocations” with potentially “unpredictable consequences,” the Russian mission to the UN explained on Monday. “There are no armed formations at the Zaporozhye NPP, except for a limited number of military servicemen, that is required to ensure safety and security at the power plant,” the statement said. Zaporozhye #NPP which is located in the zone of the Russian SMO was taken under guard with the sole purpose – prevent 🇺🇦nationalist formations & foreign mercenaries from making use of the current situation in #Ukraine to carry out a nuclear provocation.🔗https://t.co/iHwbDMLaxdpic.twitter.com/euP5DJZjpp Moscow accused “Ukrainian nationalist formations and foreign mercenaries” of repeated attempts to sabotage the power plant and ultimately “creating a threat of a nuclear disaster,” allegedly with “full support of the United States and other Western states.” Addressing the NPT conference on Monday, Blinken accused Russia of “using the plant as a military base to fire at Ukrainians, knowing that they can’t and won’t shoot back because they might accidentally strike a nuclear – a reactor or highly radioactive waste in storage.” “That brings the notion of having a human shield to an entirely different and horrific level,” the top US diplomat claimed. Russia currently controls the southern and central part of Zaporozhye Region, including Energodar. The administrative center of the region, Zaporozhye, remains under Ukrainian control. Russia sent force into neighboring state on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-08-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/560022-putin-on-nuclear-war/,Putin talks about nuclear war,"Russian president Vladimir Putin has commented on the prospects of fighting a nuclear war after his US counterpart Joe Biden called on Russia to negotiate a new arms-control deal to potentially replace the landmark New Start treaty. Putin made the remarks on Monday in his letter to participants of the tenth NPT review conference. “Russia consistently follows the letter and spirit of the Treaty. Our obligations under bilateral agreements with the United States on the reduction and limitation of relevant weapons have also been fully fulfilled,” Putin said, adding that Moscow believes “that there can be no winners in a nuclear war and it must never be unleashed.” The president said Russia believes all the countries following the NPT rules should have acess to peaceful use of nuclear energy without any conditions. “We’re ready to share our experience in the field of atomic energy with our partners,” he added. Earlier in the day, Putin’s US counterpart Joe Biden produced his statement ahead of the review conference, calling on Russia to engage in talks to produce a new arms-control agreement to replace the New START treaty, set to expire in 2026. At the same time, he accused Moscow of “shattering peace in Europe” with its ongoing military operation in Ukraine. “Negotiation requires a willing partner operating in good faith,” Biden said. “In this context, Russia should demonstrate that it is ready to resume work on nuclear arms control with the United States.” The landmark New START remains the only major arms control agreement between Moscow and Washington left standing. The deal was on the brink of collapse in early 2021, when it was set to expire. It was ultimately salvaged shortly after Biden’s inauguration, when Washington finally agreed to Moscow’s repeated calls to prolong the deal without any preconditions."
2022-08-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/560003-chubais-hospital-rare-condition/,Controversial 1990s Russian reformer hospitalized – media,"Multiple sources have reported that former Kremlin Chief-of-Staff Anatoly Chubais has been taken to hospital in Italy. He was one of the longest serving senior Russian officials before he resigned in March. Chubais, a driving force behind Russian reforms and privatizations in the 1990s, reportedly developed a serious health issue last week. The news was first broken by Russian socialite, journalist and ex-presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak, who is a family friend. He was diagnosed with Guillain–Barre syndrome, a rare neurological condition, Sobchak wrote on social media on Sunday, adding that he was in stable but moderately serious condition in an intensive care unit. The 67-year-old is being treated at a hospital in the city of Olbia on the island of Sardinia, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera said on Monday. He may have been on a vacation at the popular tourist destination when he fell ill, the publication said. Reuters cited its own sources as confirming Chubais’ health problems. It also said a European intelligence agency was “looking into the case,” which some political commentators and media outlets, like the Daily Mail in the UK, speculated may be caused by poisoning. One source cited by the agency said they did not believe foul play had been involved. The Kremlin commented on the reports by expressing sympathy for Chubais and pledging Russia's help, should he need it. “I am not aware of any requests for assistance,” Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for the Russian president’s office, told the media. “The news is definitely sad and we wish him a swift recovery.” Chubais is best known for his role in the government of President Boris Yeltsin, whom he helped usher in radical US-advised post-Soviet market reforms in the early 1990s. They concentrated state-owned property in the hands of a relatively small group of new business elites, but it came at the cost of the impoverishment and disaffection of many ordinary Russians. He kept a place in the Russian government in the post-Yeltsin era, holding several senior positions under Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev. Chubais was considered a champion of big business and liberal political circles in Russia. He resigned in late March in what many observers took as a protest against Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, which became the trigger point for an ongoing diplomatic and trade breakup between Russia and the West."
2022-08-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/559997-russia-senator-support-serbia-conflict/,Russia would help Serbia in case of conflict – senator,"If Serbia-Kosovo tensions spiral into an outright conflict, Moscow is ready to assist Belgrade without playing a direct role, a Russian senator has said. The two sides clashed on Sunday, with demonstrators building barricades and unknown gunmen reportedly firing on Kosovo police. “It is very dangerous, it is the center of Europe, and everything can end in a very sad way, because NATO forces are stationed there (in Kosovo),” Russian Federation Council member Vladimir Dzhabarov said in an interview with RIA Novosti news agency on Monday. According to the lawmaker, the situation “may end in an armed conflict, and as soon as NATO countries get in there, of course, there is a danger that other countries that are allies of Serbia will be drawn in.” His remarks were in response to a feud between Serbia and its breakaway province, officially called the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija in the Serbian constitution, which received recognition by several Western powers in 2008. The government in Kosovo planned to ban the use of Serbian-issued license plates and ID papers starting from August 1, and to prohibit entry for anyone using Serbian-issued plates or documents, while also refusing to print temporary papers for travelers. Belgrade officials have called it an attack on Kosovo’s Serb minority, and President Aleksandar Vucic accused Pristina of violating the rights of local Serbs, who “will not suffer any more atrocities.” While offering a chance for peace, he warned on Sunday that his government would not sit idly by if Serbs were targeted. Kosovo has denied a crackdown on Serbs and accused Belgrade officials of undermining “the rule of law” on their territory. Prime Minister Albin Kurti has accused local Serbs of opening fire on police, and claimed his government is facing “Serbian national-chauvinism” and “misinformation” from Belgrade. Tensions flared on Sunday on the Kosovo-Serbia border. Serbs in the north of the breakaway province set up roadblocks and rang alarm bells, as heavily armed special police under Pristina’s authority took control of two administrative crossings with Serbia. After a discussion with Washington, Kosovo officials decided to postpone the implementation of the controversial law for 30 days on the condition that Serbia remove barricades from the de facto border."
2022-08-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/559989-latvia-ukraine-eu-travel/,EU state suspends travel deal with Russia,"A border-crossing arrangement that has facilitated travel between Russia and Latvia for residents of the two countries’ border regions has been suspended by the authorities in Riga from Monday, August 1. The government of the Baltic nation made the decision a few weeks ago to freeze the agreement – which had been signed between Russia and Latvia in 2010 – and now it has officially gone into force. Riga explained its move citing the closure of the Latvian consulate in Russia’s north-western city of Pskov, which had been the only mission that issued papers to Russians in accordance with the simplified scheme. Russia shut down the consulate and declared all its staff personae non grata in April, saying that it was a tit-for-tat move and blaming Latvia and its Baltic neighbors for providing military aid for Ukraine and for whitewashing its crimes against the people of Donbass. Latvia had stopped issuing visas to Russians, including residents of border areas, after the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine on February 24. On Sunday, the country’s foreign minister Edgars Rinkevics reiterated his call on other EU members to follow Riga and ban access to the bloc for Russian nationals. The day before, Russian gas giant Gazprom said that it had halted deliveries to Latvia due to “violations of the terms of gas extraction.” The announcement followed a confession by the chairman of Latvian gas company Latvijas Gaze, Aigars Kalvitis, that Riga had continued to buy Russian natural gas from “another supplier” despite earlier refusing to comply with Moscow’s demand for payments in rubles."

The departure follows last month’s landmark deal involving Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN. The Sierra Leone-flagged vessel is said to be loaded with some 26,000 tons of maize. The ship is the first civilian freighter to carry Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea in months. Regular shipments were blocked amid hostilities with Russia. Kiev and Moscow blamed each other for the disruption. A scheme for restarting sea exports was negotiated last month with the help of Ankara and the UN. Turkey is also hosting a special center to coordinate shipping under the deal, which includes representatives from Moscow and Kiev. Ukraine is a major food producer, so it’s hoped the export will start to relieve some of the pressure on the global market, where prices have been surging for months."
2022-08-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/559971-ukraine-grain-first-ship/,Turkey reveals destination of first Ukrainian grain shipment,"A ship carrying Ukrainian grain departed from the port city of Odessa on Monday morning for the first time in months. The freighter is the first of many set to sail under a landmark deal negotiated last month with Russia. The Turkish Defense Ministry identified the vessel as the Razoni, a dry cargo ship registered in Sierra Leone. Its ultimate destination is Lebanon, the Turkish military said. According to Ankara, the ship was scheduled to depart at 8:30 am local time on Monday. Ukrainian Infrastructure Minister Aleksandr Kurbakov reported a slightly different schedule, saying the ship would leave at 09:15. The Razoni remained moored in Odessa for some time after both deadlines, according to maritime trackers, and departed at about 09:50 local time. Kurbakov also offered more details about the cargo on board. The ship is carrying 26,000 tons of Ukrainian maize to Tripoli, Lebanon, he said on social media. There have been no sea cargo shipments out of Ukraine since the Russian attack in late February. Ukraine accused Russia of imposing a naval blockade in the Black Sea, thereby contributing to a surge in global food prices. Moscow rejected the allegations, saying its navy was offering safe passage to traders on a daily basis, and arguing that Ukraine was preventing ships from leaving its ports and deploying sea mines along its shores, creating a threat to maritime traffic. The scheme to renew the export of Ukrainian grain was mediated last month by Turkey and the United Nations, with two separate agreements signed with Ukraine and with Russia. Among the terms is a commitment by the UN to promote the lifting of Western restrictions that hamper export of Russian grain, including a ban on financial transactions with Russian banks. Moscow said such a measure would relieve pressure on global food markets, which is also the key goal of resuming shipments from Ukraine. Turkey is also hosting a special center to coordinate traffic under the deal, which includes representatives from Moscow and Kiev."
2022-08-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/559970-ukraine-nato-foreign-fighters/,Russia alleges NATO’s ‘quiet’ role in recruiting foreign fighters,"Several NATO members are ‘quietly’ supporting Kiev’s efforts to sign up foreign mercenaries to fight in the ongoing conflict with Moscow, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday. “Russia is closely monitoring the recruitment of foreign citizens carried out by the Ukrainian authorities with the quiet support of some NATO countries to conduct warfare in eastern Ukraine on the side of the Kiev regime,” Vladimir Tarabrin, who heads the department of new challenges and threats at the ministry, told the RIA Novosti news agency. Tarabrin also alleged that NGOs, as well as Ukrainian diplomatic missions overseas, are involved in hiring mercenaries, adding that such actions by Kiev are a violation of international agreements, including the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Thousands of foreign fighters have responded to a call by President Vladimir Zelensky and flocked to Ukraine since the launch of Russia’s military operation on February 24. According to Moscow, almost 7,000 “mercenaries” have arrived in Ukraine since the outbreak of the conflict, with the largest numbers coming from Poland (1,831 people), Canada (601), the US (530), Romania (504) and the UK (422). Last month, the Russian Defense Ministry said only 2,741 of those foreign individuals were still fighting, with many of them killed or returned home. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov recently warned that mercenaries are not considered soldiers under international law and “the best thing that awaits them if they are captured alive is a trial and maximum prison terms.” In July, a spokesman for the International Legion, a body of foreign volunteers integrated into the Ukrainian militarily, complained about “a gradual dip in the number of arrivals over the course of the last few months,” blaming the decline on “Russian disinformation.”"
2022-07-31,https://www.rt.com/news/559959-russia-kosovo-serbia-conflict/,Russia warns Kosovo against conflict,"The government in Pristina and its backers in Brussels and Washington should stop their provocations and respect the rights of ethnic Serbs in Kosovo, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Sunday. Serbian troops were put on high alert and local residents in the north of the breakaway province erected barricades, as ethnic Albanian police prepared for a crackdown. Air raid sirens and church bells went off across northern Kosovo on Sunday, after prime minister Albin Kurti announced a police operation to ban Serb license plates and identification documents. Kurti claimed this was about equal justice and law in all the territories his government claims. Pristina’s decision is unreasonable and discriminatory, and their forced replacement of personal documents is “another step towards the expulsion of the Serb population from Kosovo, as well as the Kosovo Serb institutions that ensure the protection of the rights of Serbian residents from the arbitrary whims of radicals in Pristina,” Zakharova said. Kurti is “deliberately escalating” in order to launch an armed crackdown, not just against the Serbs in Kosovo but against Belgrade, which the West wants to “neutralize” using the ethnic Albanians as proxies, added Zakharova. Russia calls on “Pristina and the US and EU behind it to stop provocations and respect the rights of Serbs in Kosovo,” the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. Earlier in the day, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said his country had “never been in a more complex and difficult situation” and that the Pristina authorities are trying to exploit the current situation in the world to initiate a conflict while painting itself as a victim. No Serbian troops have crossed the administrative line into Kosovo yet, the Defense Ministry in Belgrade said, describing such rumors circulating on social media as “disinformation” on behalf of Pristina. Local Serb residents erected barricades at three checkpoints along the administrative line, where police answering to Kurti were deployed to stop all vehicles with Serbian plates or documents. There were unconfirmed reports of gunfire and injuries among the civilians. Kosovo was occupied by NATO in 1999, after a 78-day air war against Yugoslavia. The ethnic Albanian government in Pristina declared independence in 2008, with US backing, but has not been recognized by Serbia, Russia, China or the UN."
2022-07-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/559951-ukraine-cluster-mines-kharkov/,Ukraine scattering mines in Kharkov Region – officials,"The military-civilian administration in the Kharkov Region has accused Ukrainian forces of using cluster munitions to disperse anti-personnel mines in the village of Tokarevka. The munitions, which are banned by a 1997 agreement, have also been deployed in Donetsk, officials say. The administration announced having discovered the mines on Sunday and in a Telegram post showed a picture of a green butterfly-shaped device nestled in a patch of weeds. The object, apparently a Soviet-era PFM-1, was almost invisible among the foliage. Such munitions are typically scattered in large quantities, either by aircraft or artillery. Designed to maim rather than kill, they are capable of blowing off or disfiguring a victim’s foot. The PFM-1 is banned under the 1997 Ottawa Convention, to which Ukraine is party. The Kharkov administration accused the “Kiev regime” of planting the explosives. The same mines have been showered across the city of Donetsk, in the Donetsk People’s Republic, throughout the past week. Donetsk Mayor Alexey Kulemzin said on Sunday that two people had sustained injuries from the landmines, including a first responder who lost a foot. Photos and video footage from the city showed residents placing cardboard boxes over the mines and marking the surrounding areas with warning signs. Kulemzin said on Sunday that more than 600 such mines had been disposed of in the preceding two days."

The mayor wrote on his Telegram channel that explosive devices were again found scattered on the streets in several parts of the city. He urged residents to stay home and be vigilant, as the PFM-1s can be notoriously difficult to spot when dropped on lawns and other green areas. According to Kulemzin, two people were injured by such mines on Sunday, including a first responder who lost his foot in an explosion. Photos and videos from Donetsk show people placing cardboard boxes over the mines that lie on the ground and marking the surrounding areas with warning signs. City officials said Donetsk was repeatedly showered with mines this week. Kulemzin reported on Saturday that bomb units had disposed of more than 600 of them over the course of two days. The PFM-1s are banned under the 1997 Ottawa Convention, to which Ukraine is party. Even when they do not kill the victim when stepped on, the mines often rip the person’s foot off."
2022-07-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/559935-russia-navy-day-2022/,Historic and modern boats on display at Russia’s Navy Day (PHOTOS),"Russia celebrated its Navy Day on Sunday with annual parades across the country, including the main one in the city of St. Petersburg. This year’s event marked 350 years since the birth of Peter the Great, the 18th-century Russian emperor who created the country’s first regular Navy and founded the city that bears his name, which is now Russia’s second largest. The parade was led by a full-sized replica of the ship of the line Poltava, one of many vessels ordered by Peter the Great. The 54-gun ship was named after a major victory over the invading Swedish army during the Great Northern War (1700-1721). The landing ship Ivan Pasko was carried aboard Peter the Great’s wooden sailboat dubbed ‘The Grandfather of the Russia Navy.’ The historic vessel is normally kept at the Central Naval Museum of St. Petersburg. The four-masted barque Sedov, one of the world’s biggest sailing ships in operation, also took part in the celebration. The 100-year-old vessel, which is still used to train sailing crews, was built in Germany and handed over to the Soviet Union as part of World War II reparations. Among the modern ships in the Neva River was the stealth nuclear-powered Severodvinsk, which is designed for missions under the Arctic ice and equipped with Kalibr cruise missiles. It was the first submarine to launch a Zircon hypersonic anti-ship missile in 2021. In a speech kicking off the parade, President Vladimir Putin declared that the Navy would start receiving the Zircons “in the coming months.” The first warship to be armed with the weapon is the frigate Admiral Gorshkov, which carried out the initial test of the missile in 2020. The St. Petersburg parade concluded with flybys by dozens of naval aircraft, including a squad of Su-25 jet fighters, which painted the sky in the white, blue and red of the Russian flag."
2022-07-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/559185-himars-deadly-weapon-ukraine/,"The myth of the HIMARS 'game changer': American-supplied rocket system is effective, but it won't bring victory to Ukraine","As former US President Donald Trump proved before he was banned by the platform, there’s always a tweet. “HIMARS have arrived to Ukraine. Thank you to my US colleague and friend @SecDef Lloyd J. Austin III for these powerful tools! Summer will be hot for Russian occupiers. And the last one for some of them.” Thus wrote Aleksey Reznikov, the Ukrainian minister of defense, on June 23. He followed it up with another tweet on July 4, wishing the American people a “Happy Independence Day” while thanking them for their continued support for the Ukrainian cause. Reznikov highlighted the role being played by HIMARS, which he called “a game changer at the front lines.” In the weeks following Reznikov's announcement of the arrival of the US-made M-142 High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), the hype that accompanied the deployment of this new weapon, from both the Ukrainian and Russian sides, does not appear to substantiate the minister’s claim that Kiev now possesses “game changing” technology. The harsh reality of war is that any modern weapons system, when employed effectively, is capable of inflicting casualties on an opponent. Igor Strelkov, a pseudonym for Russian nationalist Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, whose past employers include the FSB (state security service) and the Donetsk People’s Republic's militia, reported some of the ensuing destruction on his Telegram channel. “Over the past five to seven days,” he wrote on July 10, “more than 10 large warehouses of artillery and other ammunition, several oil depots, about a dozen command posts and about the same number of personnel locations in our near and deep rear were hit. As well as several air defense and artillery positions. BIG losses in personnel and equipment have been suffered.” Alexander Sladkov, a military journalist and special correspondent for Vesti VGTRK, a Russian television channel, appeared to confirm Strelkov’s information, posting the following on his own Telegram channel: “Ukrainian missile and artillery have already struck several times at our decision-making centers. With results. The centers are not big, but important.” Both Strelkov and Sladkov were dismissive of Russia’s response for what they – correctly – describe as a major escalation on the part of Ukraine and its US-NATO supporters. A typical HIMARS battery, as employed by both the US and NATO, includes nine launchers supported by dozens of other support vehicles. The US has, to date, reportedly provided Ukraine with eight to 12 of these systems, which are manned by specially trained Ukrainian artillerymen who have undergone a three-week training course in Grafenwoehr, Germany, provided by the US Army. According to the Institute of War, a US-based think tank, “Ukrainian forces are increasingly targeting Russian military infrastructure with indirect fire and US-provided HIMARS systems deep in occupied territory.” It concludes that “the increased ability of Ukrainian forces to target critical Russian military facilities with Western-provided HIMARS demonstrates how Western military aid provides Ukraine with new and necessary military capabilities.” The Kyiv Independent, a Western state-funded propaganda outlet, reported that “by July 7, Russia had lost most of its key ammunition depots, and many of its smaller depots in occupied Donbas. Notably, many key targets as much as 50-80 kilometers into Russian-controlled territory have been successfully destroyed.” Max Boot, a Moscow-born military analyst who writes for the Washington Post, was so impressed with the performance of HIMARS that he wrote an op-ed in which he confidently announced “To shorten the War, send 60 HIMARS to Ukraine.” I mean, if eight HIMARS have brought the vaunted Russian war machine to its knees, imagine what could happen if Ukraine had 60? Wait, there is an answer to that question. In a recent interview with the Sunday Times, Reznikov revealed that Zelensky “had ordered Ukraine’s military to retake occupied coastal areas which are vital to the country’s economy.” Ukraine, it seems, is winning the war against Russia. Except, of course, it is not. Not even close. The notion that the HIMARS is a “super weapon” capable of turning the battlefield narrative in eastern Ukraine on its head is, simply put, pure nonsense. Russia has, over the course of the past three months, perfected the art of war when it comes to defeating the Ukrainian military. John Boyd, the famous American fighter-pilot-turned-military theorist, coined a concept, known as the “OODA-Loop” (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act), which represented the phases involved in military operations. The side that could master the OODA-Loop more efficiently than its opponent would “get inside their decision-making cycle,” forcing the enemy to operate in a purely reactive mode, enabling the superior party to achieve victory. Russia has got “inside the decision-making cycle” of every one of its opponents during the military operation in Ukraine, dominating the conflict economically, politically, and militarily. HIMARS does not change this reality. The Russian military, like any successful military organization, is highly adaptive – it must be to survive on the modern battlefield. The conflict in Ukraine is unlike any experienced in modern times, requiring Russian military leaders to adapt operational theory as defined by doctrine to the demanding realities of the eastern Ukrainian front. The fact that approximately 200,000 Russian forces can impose their will on over 700,000 Ukrainian defenders while achieving casualty ratios that are decisively in their favor speaks to the reality of their OODA-Loop dominance. At the end of the day, HIMARS – and other so-called “advanced Western weapons” – is but a tool wielded by the same actor who has been systematically defeated by the Russian military. This will not change, whether Ukraine employs four, eight, 12… or even 60 HIMARS systems. First and foremost, the survivability of the HIMARS is a critical factor – Russia excels at destroying Western-provided weaponry. The HIMARS footprint is a large one, with dozens of trucks needed to carry the ammunition used by the launcher. Vehicles need fuel, and ammunition needs protective storage – as do the launchers. This considerable footprint creates a signature which is detectable by any capable intelligence service – and the Russians have capable intelligence services. Indeed, the irony is that the larger the number of HIMARS brought into service by Ukraine, the greater the likelihood of detection and interdiction (i.e. destruction) by Russia. Already, Moscow has claimed to have destroyed two of the initial four HIMARS systems sent to Ukraine (this assertion has been vehemently denied by both Ukraine and the US.) It also claims to have destroyed several warehouses where HIMARS ammunition was being stored. The point is that Russia is not a passive actor on the military stage. The deployment of HIMARS was not a secret, and Russia had plenty of time to prepare for its appearance on the battlefield. This does not mean Ukraine is not inflicting casualties – HIMARS is a deadly weapon which, employed properly, can inflict death and destruction on its target. According to Kiev, the system was used in a recent attack on a Russian command post that killed a senior general officer (the Kremlin has not confirmed this result.) Pro-Russian military analysts say the effectiveness of HIMARS has been enhanced through a tactic which involves the Ukrainian military firing off several salvos of long-range multiple-launch rocket systems. This prompts Russian surface-to-air missiles to engage over the intended target. Ukrainian forces then fire off the HIMARS rockets, which are able to penetrate the overwhelmed Russian air defense network. The Russian military, however, is highly adaptive. It won’t take long for an adequate tactical answer to the HIMARS problem to be developed and employed. In the meantime, Russian military operations continue unabated throughout Donbass, with Moscow’s forces continuing their lethal domination of their Ukrainian opponents. With all due respect, Aleksey Reznikov, HIMARS is not a game changer."
2022-07-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/559714-cut-gas-russia-eu/,Failure to agree gas deal exposes how EU will make united 'Stand with Ukraine' until sacrifices have to be made,"Last week, the European Union's Commission proposed a bloc-wide reduction of gas use by 15%, starting from August 1 and extending to at least March of next year. Officials from all 27 member states convened this week to discuss and finalize the proposal, after which Commission President Ursula von der Leyen cheered on Twitter: “I strongly welcome the endorsement by Council of the regulation to reduce gas demand and prepare for the winter. It is a decisive step to face down the threat of a full gas disruption. Thanks to today’s decision, Europe [sic] is now ready to address its energy security, as a Union.” Von der Leyen’s public proclamation risks misleading the public into believing that the entire bloc is on-board with the vision set forth by EU leadership, but the only real unity on this issue is that EU countries that refuse to cut their gas use effectively agree that those who have no choice and no alternatives may need to ration their supply. So there’s really no solidarity among all 27 member states to reduce consumption by 15% voluntarily. And now the EU is forced to accept that reality, even as they try to spin it into a show of unity. This is really all about the entire EU coming to the rescue of Germany – the bloc’s top economic engine – which lacked the courage to stand up to American pressure to sanction its pipeline projects with Russia. It then stood idly by while the EU did the same – all apparently without any viable backup plan for their own national economy. Berlin made a bad strategic mistake by depending so heavily on renewables when green energy is clearly not ready for prime time. Egged on by Brussels, officials talked a tough game about being strong and independent and not needing any Russian energy. German economy minister Robert Habeck bragged about how he was whittling down his shower time over the course of the energy crisis – because apparently that’s sufficient to keep German industry humming along. But it was clearly all bluster. Berlin is still so reliant on Russian gas that it freaked out over a 10-day maintenance shutdown of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, and is now panicking again over pipeline operator Gazprom’s reduction of delivery volume by 80% starting this week, citing continued maintenance issues. It’s one thing to cry “gas blackmail,” as Brussels and Berlin are doing, but both brought this on themselves by sanctioning their own vital energy supplies. Of course, it's not exactly blackmail when you have a fight with your neighbor, cut all ties, brag about doing so to the entire world, and then get angry that they won’t just leave their shed wide open for you to continue using their lawnmower. So to give Berlin a hand, the bloc’s member states have all now agreed that if Brussels ever imposes the 15% cut as a binding measure – well, they’ll just demand to opt out. That’s the kind of “unity” over which EU officials are patting each other on the back. Malta, Cyprus, Ireland and Portugal either aren’t significantly connected to the EU internal energy supply network or aren’t reliant on gas, and want to maintain their independence. Meanwhile, France almost made the same foolish choices that Germany did by launching headlong into “green” energy, but then dodged a bullet when it successfully lobbied Brussels to reclassify nuclear power (on which it heavily relies) as “green” earlier this year. As a result, it figures that it can just fire up enough eroding and neglected nuclear energy plants again in short order to weather the current turbulence. So, as the French ecology ministry has said, Paris is not at all on board with committing economic and political seppuku in abiding by these new EU constraints. Greece and Spain also said no to the proposal, insisting on maintaining sovereign control over their own supply. And Hungary is already heading full-speed in precisely the opposite direction, inking new Russian gas deals even as other EU members wring their hands over how they can continue to keep Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky happy without completely bleeding out their own economies. That’s a tall order because even as EU states were meeting to entertain Brussels’ latest proposal for downloading even more pain onto their own citizens, Zelensky was repeating his refrain that the EU isn’t doing enough for Ukraine and needs to hit Russia with even more sanctions, apparently oblivious or unmoved by the fact that sanctions are exactly why the bloc is in an economic nosedive that could ultimately lead to political repercussions. As much as Eurocrats are paying lip service to the idea of solidarity, the reality is that the increased pressure – brought about by their own misguided decisions – is already causing cracks in the facade."

The Russian president praised the weapon on Sunday, saying that “no obstacles” can stop the rockets. “The Russian Armed Forces will start receiving them in the coming months,” Putin said during a Navy Day speech in St. Petersburg. “The first ship equipped with this mighty weapon will be the frigate Admiral Gorshkov,” he added. According to Putin, the frigate’s exact deployment will be chosen “in accordance with the interest of maintaining Russia’s security.” Putin added that Russia will defend its maritime interests “resolutely and with all its capabilities.” [Our fleet] can respond with lightning speed to anyone who has decided to encroach on our sovereignty and freedom. The missile, which can travel up to 1,500km (932 miles) when launched from surface ships, was first tested in 2020."

A total of 40 vessels of different types and more than 3,000 servicemen are slated to participate in Sunday’s main event. President Vladimir Putin is attending the event with other high-ranking officials. St. Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov noted that this year also marks the 350th anniversary of the birth of Peter the Great, the Russian ruler who founded the city and established a powerful naval force during an 18th-century war with Sweden. A naval parade was held earlier in Vladivostok in Russia’s Far East, and similar events are held in other port cities across the country. Navy Day is celebrated in Russia on the last Sunday of July."
2022-07-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/559907-putin-naval-doctrine-wartime/,Putin signs new Russian naval doctrine,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday gave his approval to a revised naval doctrine that takes into account the “change in the geopolitical and military-strategic situation in the world.” The signing ceremony took place in the State Museum of the History of St. Petersburg in the Peter and Paul Fortress, just before the start of the Navy Day parade. The president also signed a decree to approve the ship charter of the Russian Navy. The revised doctrine outlines the main “challenges and threats” Russia is facing in the naval sphere, namely “the strategic course of the US to dominate in the world oceans” and the encroachment of “NATO military infrastructure” toward the country’s borders. Other challenges include “attempts by certain nations” to change the existing legal rules regulating sea routes and straits, as well as the spread of terrorism, piracy and trafficking of highly illegal goods in the high seas. The document outlines the “risks” facing Russia’s naval activities, such as “lacking” the participation of the country’s merchant fleet in global cargo flow, the dependency of trade on freight vessels and undersea pipelines, foreign sanctions and “suddenly emerging and hard to predict” pandemics of dangerous diseases. Also included among the risks is the lack of overseas naval re-supply points and bases. However, the doctrine envisions the creation of such a facility in the Red Sea. The ultimate goal of Russia is to further develop in its role as a great naval power and reinforce its position among other such nations, according to the doctrine. The document outlines expanding both the merchant fleet and navy, and envisions, among other things, the construction of aircraft carriers. Back in May, Yury Borisov, then-deputy prime minister, explained that amid the ongoing military operation in Ukraine and “all-out hybrid war” launched by the West against Moscow, “building up capabilities to ensure and protect national interests in the world oceans” is vital for Russia. “The adjusted Naval Doctrine takes into account the change in the geopolitical and military-strategic situation in the world,” the official said back then. At the same time, Borisov, who was recently appointed as head of the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, stressed that the new version of the doctrine is not aimed at confrontation but rather seeks to strengthen national maritime security and significantly reduce the Navy's dependence on external factors and market conditions. Russia's naval doctrine was first adopted in 2001. Its previous version, which had been amended to reflect the expansion of NATO and accession of Crimea to Russia, was approved by Putin in July 2015. It provided for an increase in the Russian fleet’s presence in the Arctic, the Black and Mediterranean Seas, as well as in the Atlantic Ocean."
2022-07-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/559922-black-sea-fleet-hq-sevastopol-attack-ukraine/,Black Sea Fleet HQ in Crimea attacked by Ukraine – governor,"Russia's Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol has been attacked by Ukraine, Governor Mikhail Razvozhayev claimed on his Telegram channel on Sunday morning. Six people were injured in a strike presumably carried out by a drone, he said. The incident took place as Russia celebrates Navy Day. Razvozhayev said that all local celebrations have been canceled for safety reasons. The holiday sees military parades and other events across the country. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly voiced plans to take back Crimea, which voted to leave Ukraine and join Russia shortly after the 2014 coup in Kiev. Deputy Defense Minister Vladimir Gavrilov said this month that the Black Sea Fleet stationed in Crimea poses “a permanent threat” to Ukraine. Moreover, when asked about the use of US-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, Vadim Skibitsky, the spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence, told reporters this month that military sites in Crimea were “among the targets that must be struck in order to ensure the safety of our citizens, sites and Ukraine in general.” Crimea has “become a hub for the movement of all equipment and weapons that come from the Russian Federation,” he said."
2022-07-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/559919-whale-rescue-nets-danger/,Russian rescuers racing to save rare whale,"A rescue team has been trying to save a rare bowhead whale that became entangled in a fishing net off the Russian coast of the Sea of Okhotsk, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Russia said on Friday. According to the statement, the whale, which belongs to a species included in the Russian Red Data Book of rare and endangered animals, fell into a net set up by local fishermen near the coast and then swam away, thus becoming entangled. The stricken bowhead was first spotted by local guides during a sea outing with tourists. WWF specialists, biologists, and professional animal rescuers quickly formed a rescue team, which was also supported by guides and local fishermen. The whale was soon located but, according to the fund, did not let the rescuers approach it. “Now it is clear that the whale still managed to throw off most of the ‘plume’ from the seine, but thick ropes remain on it,” the WWF said. One of the ropes wrapped around the whale’s upper jaw has become entangled in its whiskers. This is a potentially life-threatening impediment, because it means the animal may not be able to properly feed. If the rescuers don’t manage to free the whale of the nets, the ropes might tighten on its body, resulting in injuries that could eventually weaken it and make it more prone to illnesses and parasites. “You might think: what is this news? A whale has tangled up in a net, what’s the big deal. But for the survival of a population consisting of only 300-400 animals, the death of just one whale is a tragedy,” WWF expert Boris Solovyov said. An expedition carried out by the fund last year revealed that every third bowhead whale had scars from nets and ropes. One animal observed had lost half of its tail to tightening ropes. The bowhead whale is one of the world’s largest mammals. Males generally reach a length of 14-17m, while females are a bit larger at 16-18m. Some bowheads have been recorded reaching 22m. The bowheads of the Sea of Okhotsk are considered among the most vulnerable populations of whales dwelling in the polar seas. These whales inhabit the Sea of Okhotsk year round and do not leave Russian waters. The WWF notes that the seas used to be populated with thousands of bowheads, but “predatory whaling” resulted in an almost complete extermination of them."
2022-07-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/559920-russia-pow-un-red-cross-ukraine/,Russia asks UN to investigate Ukrainian POW killings,"The Russian Defense Ministry announced on Sunday that it had officially invited independent experts from the UN and the Red Cross to investigate the shelling of a detention center in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). The bombing on Friday killed 50 prisoners, and wounded dozens more. “In the interest of conducting an objective investigation of the strike on the detention center in Yelenovka, which led to the deaths of many Ukrainian prisoners of war, the Russian Federation has officially invited experts from the UN and the International Red Cross Committee,” the ministry said. The facility in Yelenovka, south of Donetsk, housed hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners – mainly members of the “Azov” neo-Nazi militia who surrendered in Mariupol in May. According to the Russian military’s earlier statement, the strike was conducted using US-made HIMARS multiple rocket launchers. “All political, criminal and moral responsibility for the bloodbath against Ukrainians is borne personally by Zelensky, his criminal regime and Washington, which supports them,” Moscow said. The Ukrainian military released a statement on Friday, claiming that Moscow destroyed the prison in order to pin the blame on Kiev, as well as to “hide the torture of prisoners and executions."" However, the DPR military suggested it was the Ukrainian authorities who had the reason to “deliberately” target the facility. The republic’s head, Denis Pushilin, said “Azov” members had been providing testimonies about possible war crimes by their commanders. The Kiev authorities also knew exactly where the “Azov” prisoners were being held, DPR militia spokesman Eduard Basurin told reporters. Meanwhile, unlike the government in Kiev, Ukraine’s backers in Washington did not rush to blame the bombing on Moscow. “We just don’t have enough information to speak intelligently about these very early reports,” John Kirby, spokesman for the US National Security Council, told reporters. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/559911-communist-leader-yeltsin-remarks/,Russian communist leader reveals offer from Western-backed President,"Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov has slammed Russia's first president, Boris Yeltsin, as the most “drunk and perfidious” leader the country has ever had. The veteran politician also claimed that Yeltsin had offered him “any” government post, but he turned it down. Zyuganov made the remarks as he spoke at the Terra Scientia youth forum on Saturday, when one of the participants asked the party chief about his attitude toward, and the overall “relevance” of, the Yeltsin Center, a museum and educational platform commemorating Russia’s first post-Soviet leader. The center was opened in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg back in 2015 but since then has consistently drawn the ire of Yeltsin’s critics. The communist leader blasted the existence of the Yeltsin Center, claiming he had repeatedly told Russia’s current president, Vladimir Putin, as well as fellow MPs in the State Duma, that the facility “had been deliberately erected for us by the Americans.” Zyuganov also revealed that he and Yeltsin, a former Soviet Communist Party member himself, were neighbors once, and that at one point the president even offered him “any” government post, a proposal that he refused. “I am embarrassed and ashamed to say, but I have never seen a more drunk and perfidious ruler in my life. Personally, he offered me any post. I said: ‘I would rather shoot myself than accept this. You betrayed the country, history, all the achievements of [our] fathers and grandfathers,’” Zyuganov said, apparently referring to the ex-president’s role in the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin, alongside Ukraine’s first president, Leonid Kravchuk, and the speaker of the Belarusian parliament, Stanislav Shushkevich, signed the Belovezh Accords in December 1991, which formalized the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin ruled Russia until 1999 before stepping down. He died in 2007 at the age of 76."
2022-07-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/559916-evacuation-mandatory-donetsk-heating/,Kiev orders forced evacuation of Ukraine-controlled DPR areas,"Kiev has ordered mandatory evacuations from the parts of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) that remain under the control of Ukrainian forces. Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk explained on Saturday the decision by saying that it would be impossible to provide the region’s residents with heating in the cold months. Speaking during a national TV marathon, Vereshchuk, who also heads up what Ukraine calls the ‘Ministry for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories’, said that given the complete lack of gas supplies and widespread electricity outages, “there will be no heat in Donetsk region in the winter period,” and therefore about 200,000-220,000 residents will have to leave their homes. ""There is absolutely no gas supply in the Donetsk region, all the gas pipelines that could be repaired were repaired, but, unfortunately, the enemy destroys again and again everything that would help to warm people in winter,” she claimed. Even before Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine, the DPR had been accusing Ukraine of targeting civilian infrastructure. With the launch of the operation, the bombings only escalated, as have the accusations from both sides. Vereshchuk emphasized that the evacuation of households is “the duty of every adult member of the family.” “For example, there are 52,000 of our children in the Donetsk region. They must be evacuated, they cannot be exposed to danger if left without heat and light in the winter,” the minister stressed. Vereshchuk emphasized that mandatory evacuations are permitted under Ukrainian law and said that those who refuse to leave will have to sign a document confirming that they understand the consequences of their decision and take full responsibility for it. Zaporozhye Region, 65% of the territory of which is without gas supply, may be the next to be evacuated, Vereshchuk added. According to the minister, the authorities have taken all of the necessary measures to provide evacuees with accommodation and proper social services. “There is an understanding of where these people will be resettled, in which regions, where their children will study,” she said. On Friday, the government supported her ministry’s initiative to create a coordination center, which will supervise the evacuation from Donbass. “Donetsk is now on the brink of a humanitarian disaster. Active hostilities continue there, the infrastructure is destroyed. People are not only at risk of coming under fire every second – it will not be easy to survive in the absence of light, heat, medicine and food in winter. The solution – evacuation,” the government said in a statement."

Providing an update on the progress of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, Konashenkov said that on July 28, at the Krasnoarmeysk railway station in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), the Russian military conducted a direct strike “with a high-precision air-based weapon” on a train transporting “an elite assault battalion of the 1st Separate Brigade of the President of Ukraine.” “More than 140 nationalists were killed on the spot. About 250 more militants received injuries of varying severity. All military equipment that was in the echelon was disabled,” Konashenkov stated. The next day, in the area of Bogodukhov in Kharkov Region, Iskander missiles hit the hangars of a meat processing plant where the Kraken nationalist formation had set up a temporary base, according to the military spokesman. “More than 30 Nazis and 10 units of military equipment were destroyed.” Kraken calls itself a special reconnaissance and sabotage unit under the Ministry of Defense, operating separately from the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Moscow has accused the battalion of committing several war crimes since the beginning of the conflict. Also on July 29, Russian forces destroyed 30 Ukrainian servicemen, a warehouse with rockets for Grad combat vehicles, and military equipment in the settlement of Yasnobrodovka in the DPR. In the area of Artemovsk, according to Konashenkov, Ukrainian losses amounted to 50 servicemen and eight units of military equipment. “In total, since the beginning of the special military operation, the following have been destroyed: 261 aircraft, 145 helicopters, 1,644 unmanned aerial vehicles, 361 anti-aircraft missile systems, 4,190 tanks and other armored combat vehicles, 772 combat vehicles of multiple launch rocket systems, 3,217 field artillery guns and mortars, as well as 4,573 units of special military vehicles,” the general said. The Russian Defense Ministry does not provide regular updates on the numbers of Ukrainian or Russian losses. On July 4, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced that over the previous two weeks alone, Ukraine had lost almost 5,500 troops, including over 2,000 killed. Regarding its own casualties, Moscow has not updated the numbers since March, when it reported 1,351 military personnel killed. Kiev has not disclosed its total military losses since the beginning of the conflict but claims that the figure is several times lower than Russia’s. Moscow’s assessment of the numbers is the opposite."
2022-07-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/559901-ukraine-drone-attack-convoy/,Ukraine strikes humanitarian convoy – official,"Ukrainian combat drones destroyed cars that were part of a humanitarian convoy in the Russian-held southern city of Energodar early on Saturday morning, a local official has asserted. “The cars had the markings of a humanitarian mission,” Yevgeny Balitsky, the top Russia-appointed official in Ukraine’s Zaporozhye Region, wrote on his Telegram account. Balitsky said the overnight attack occurred on empty vehicles parked on the street and that there were no casualties. Three residential buildings, a grocery shop, a hotel and a dormitory were damaged, Balitsky said. Both Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of shelling civilian targets. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/559900-zelensky-donbass-shelling-pows/,Russia blames Zelensky and US for POW ‘bloodbath’,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky is personally responsible, along with the United States, for the fatal shelling of a detention facility in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed on Saturday. According to the ministry’s statement, a missile strike using US-made HIMARS multiple rocket launchers on a prison near the village of Yelenovka killed 50 POWs, while 73 were hospitalized with severe injuries. The ministry added that the remains of 48 Ukrainian prisoners of war were found and extracted from underneath the rubble, while two inmates succumbed to their wounds on the way to a medical facility. “All political, criminal and moral responsibility for the bloodbath against Ukrainians is borne personally by Zelensky, his criminal regime and Washington, which supports them,” the statement reads. Earlier this week, Eduard Basurin, the spokesman for the DPR's army, said that Kiev knew exactly where the POWs were being held, because Kiev “itself determined the place of detention.” The DPR official also noted that the prison could have been targeted by Kiev in order to hide atrocities “after the Ukrainian prisoners of war began to talk about the crimes that they had committed on the orders of their commanders.” The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed that the facility had held members of Ukraine’s Azov Battalion, whose fighters surrendered to Russian and Donbass forces during the siege of the Azovstal steel factory in Mariupol. Kiev has categorically denied these allegations and claims Russia is responsible for the strike, saying that Moscow sought to blame Ukraine for committing ‘war crimes’. Russia and allied forces have repeatedly accused Ukraine of shelling civilian infrastructure with various heavy weaponry, including HIMARS. According to the Pentagon, as of July 22, the US has provided Ukraine with 16 M142 HIMARS systems, while the UK has delivered another three launchers capable of firing the same munitions. Last week, the Russian military said it had destroyed four of the rocket launching systems, a claim that was dismissed by Kiev as “misinformation.”"
2022-07-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/559891-russia-norwegian-consul-hotel/,Moscow slams ‘I hate Russians’ Norwegian diplomat,"Russia’s Foreign Ministry has condemned a Norwegian consul for a “hateful” tirade after a video emerged allegedly showing her arguing with the staff at a Russian hotel. The clip – posted by the Russian news outlet Mash – allegedly shows Elisabeth Ellingsen, a Norwegian consul stationed in the northern Russian city of Murmansk, being rude during an argument. “I hate Russians,” the woman says in English. “You know, I’m used to [staying in] clean rooms. I’m from Scandinavia, not some Russian woman.” “The Russian Foreign Ministry is now considering options on how to respond to this outrageous act of hatred, nationalism and xenophobia,” spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on her Telegram channel on Saturday. Zakharova appeared to suggest Moscow is considering imposing penalties against Ellingsen. “Unless Norway’s Foreign Ministry beats us to it. It would be the right thing to do,” she added, apparently expecting an immediate reaction from Oslo. Norway has not commented on the matter. It was not clear when the video was made. According to Mash, Ellingsen was complaining because she had been told to wait until her room would be ready. “This is f***ing irritating,” the woman tells the staff at the front desk in a profanity-laden rant. “You’re just f***ing up everything.” “This hotel is a disgrace, and you people in general [are] also a disgrace,” she adds. According to Mash, Russian police are investigating the incident."
2022-07-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/559889-ukraine-belgium-diplomatic-spat/,Ukraine to block Belgium’s top diplomat – media,"Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry is refusing to allow Belgian’s foreign minister to visit the country due to a trip she took in 2021 to the Crimean peninsula, without consulting Kiev, local media reported on Thursday. According to the news website Evropeyskaya Pravda, while Kiev has not officially banned Hadja Lahbib from entering Ukraine, it has found itself in a tough spot. “No one wants to undermine relations with Belgium, a EU and NATO member. But such actions cannot be tolerated either, because they will create a dangerous precedent,” the report says. Lahbib, who worked as a journalist before being appointed foreign minister, attended the ‘Global Values’ festival held in July 2021 in the Crimean city of Sevastopol. She reportedly went to the peninsula not via the Ukrainian mainland but from another Russian city, which “was in violation of Ukrainian law.” As a result, the minister may be barred from visiting Ukraine for three years and slapped with a fine. “After she returned, she made a number of statements that called into question whether Crimea belongs to Ukraine,” the report says, adding that Lahbib will not be able to maintain relations with Kiev without issuing an apology. Crimea voted overwhelmingly to join Russia in a 2014 referendum after a coup in Ukraine’s capital. However, Kiev says it considers the peninsula to be Ukrainian territory occupied by Moscow. The Belgian foreign minister had promised to visit Ukraine “soon,” but given the latest backlash, it is now unclear whether she will be able to follow through on that pledge. On Thursday, Oleg Nikolenko, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, confirmed that Kiev is in talks with the Belgian side “to establish all the circumstances of the trip and make decisions regarding further bilateral contacts.” The spokesman, however, welcomed Lahbib’s “assurances regarding further support for Ukraine in its fight” against Russia. In an apparent attempt to respond to the backlash, Lahbib tweeted that her critics had missed that she was a journalist before becoming a minister. “The trip was part of my journalist work,” she reiterated."
2022-07-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/559871-gazprom-nord-stream-siemens-gas/,Russian energy giant explains gas flow reduction to EU,"Russia had to reduce its gas flow to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline due to turbine malfunctions, Gazprom Deputy Chief Executive Vitaly Markelov said on Friday. The issues are due to German company Siemens – which produces the turbines – failing to fulfill its commitments, he told Russia-24 TV. Siemens has so far eliminated only one-fourth of the total number of discovered malfunctions affecting its turbines, Markelov said. On Wednesday, the Nord Stream 1 operator Gascade reported that gas flow through the pipeline had been reduced to one-fifth of its maximum capacity. A day before that, Gazprom warned that it would have to stop the operation of its second Siemens turbine for an overhaul. After the switch-off, gas flow through Nord Stream 1 was not expected to exceed 33 million cubic meters per day. The move came as the energy giant was still waiting for another turbine for the pipeline that was due to arrive from Germany after undergoing maintenance in Canada. “Our European partners accuse us of reducing gas supply to Europe without sufficient reasons. Yet, nothing can be further from the truth,” Markelov said, adding that it was the company’s Western partners who “fail to fulfill their obligations – contractual obligations – for the compressor station maintenance.” According to an earlier report by business daily Kommersant, several turbines at the Portovaya compressor station located on Russia’s Baltic coast are in need of servicing. The current licensing agreement allows Siemens Energy to accept five more turbines for maintenance work before the end of 2024. “We call on our partners to resolve their own issues as soon as possible,” the deputy CEO said, adding that the gas supply to Europe would then “go back to normal in no time.” Markelov added that his company plans to release part of its correspondence with its Western partners to the public. Some documents were published hours later. The reduction of supply from Russia has led to a spike in gas prices in Europe, which rose by more than 20% to over $2,500 per thousand cubic meters on Wednesday. European leaders then blamed Russia for the gas price hikes. Last week, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Berlin could no longer rely on Russia when it comes to gas supplies, sparking an angry reaction from Moscow, which said that such statements “absolutely contrast with reality and with the history of supplies.” The developments follow a dispute over a Siemens turbine that had been sent to Canada for repairs, but was not returned by Ottawa on time due to the sanctions on Moscow over its military operation in Ukraine. Gazprom cited the delay as the reason for the 60% reduction in gas flow through Nord Stream 1 in June. After negotiations with Berlin, Ottawa decided to use an indirect delivery route to avoid violating sanctions."
2022-07-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/559865-us-un-elenovka-reactions/,US and UN react to Ukraine POW camp shelling,"The US on Friday declined to speculate on the shelling of the Ukrainian prisoners in Elenovka, saying it did not have enough information to do so. Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern about the incident, but his office said he lacked firsthand reports to comment further. Dozens of “Azov” fighters housed at the complex were killed in what Russia says was a strike by HIMARS rockets supplied by the US to Ukraine. “We just don’t have enough information to speak intelligently about these very early reports,” John Kirby, spokesman for the US National Security Council, told reporters. According to an unnamed senior Pentagon official, Americans “don't have any definitive information” on what happened and whether the facility was struck by Ukraine or Russia. The facility in Elenovka, south of Donetsk, housed hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners – mainly members of the “Azov” neo-Nazi militia captured in Mariupol in May. It was struck at around 2 am on Friday, as the prisoners were asleep. As of Friday afternoon, Donetsk People’s Republic authorities say 53 people were killed and 75 were injured. The government in Kiev accused Russia of carrying out the attack on the territory of its Donbass ally. DPR authorities, however, showed fragments of what they said were rockets used by HIMARS, the rocket artillery supplied to the Ukrainian military by the US. Ukrainian authorities also knew exactly where the “Azov” prisoners were being held, DPR militia spokesman Eduard Basurin told reporters, accusing Kiev of ordering the strike. He said the attack was intended to kill the “Azov” fighters who began to testify about war crimes and other atrocities Ukrainian forces had been involved in. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/559866-lavrov-blinken-speak-phone/,US and Russia hold first top level call since February,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at Washington’s request by phone on Friday, the ministry has confirmed. It was the first conversation between Moscow and Washington’s top diplomats since Russia launched its military offensive in Ukraine in February. Aside from the conflict, they discussed the Ukrainian grain export deal, signed in Turkey last week, and a potential prisoner exchange between the two nations, the ministry reported. Earlier on Friday, Blinken told a news briefing that he had “a frank and direct conversation” with the Russian minister and “pressed the Kremlin to accept the substantial proposal that we put forth on the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner.” Basketball star Brittney Griner and former US Marine Paul Whelan are currently both in Russian custody. Griner was arrested on drug smuggling charges, and Whelan was jailed for espionage. CNN reported earlier they could be exchanged for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment by a Manhattan federal court in 2012 on charges of providing aid to a US-designated terrorist organization and conspiring to kill US nationals. Moscow has not confirmed receiving any specific proposals on the matter from the US and instead said Lavrov urged the US to “return to professional dialogue in the form of ‘quiet diplomacy’ without any speculations.” The US State Department did not reveal any details about its “substantial proposal” and hasn't mentioned Bout by name so far. The minister also said that continuous Western arms deliveries to Kiev would only prolong the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and lead to further human suffering. The Russian forces in Ukraine strictly follow the norms of international law, Lavrov said, adding that Russia also undertakes “systemic efforts” to help people living on territories under its control return to normal life. The conversation came after US diplomats said they had repeatedly requested a phone call between Lavrov and Blinken to discuss the potential prisoner exchange. On Thursday, Moscow said that Lavrov would consider the request as soon as his busy schedule allowed. The Russian minister is about to take part in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ministerial summit and hold several bilateral meetings."
2022-07-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/559863-kiev-knew-prison-shelled/,Kiev knew prison it shelled held Ukrainian POWs – DPR,"Kiev knew exactly where Ukrainian prisoners of war were being held when it ordered a strike on the detention facility in Donbass, Eduard Basurin, the spokesman for the army of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), claimed. The attack on the prison near the village of Yelenovka on Friday morning claimed the lives of 53 people, with 75 more injured, according to the DPR. The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed that the facility had held members of Ukraine’s Azov Battalion, whose fighters surrendered to Russian and Donbass forces during the siege of the Azovstal steel factory in Mariupol. The battalion is notorious for having fighters with nationalist and neo-Nazi views. “I would like to note that Ukraine itself determined the place of detention of prisoners of war, so they knew exactly where they were kept and in what place,” Basurin told journalists without elaborating. The DPR’s ombudswoman, Darya Morozova, explained that Ukrainian authorities had previously insisted Yelenovka’s facility be a detention center for Ukrainian prisoners of war. “It was discussed, it was their proposal. That is, they knew perfectly well where the prisoners were being held, at their own request. That's how cynically they took the lives of 50 of their own officers and soldiers,” she told Izvestia newspaper. In Basurin's opinion, the prison was targeted “after the Ukrainian prisoners of war began to talk about the crimes that they had committed on the orders of their commanders.” As the orders to conduct those crimes, according to Basurin, had been issued by Kiev, the Ukrainian “political leadership” ordered the strike on the detention center using US-made HIMARS multiple rocket launchers “to hide those crimes about which Ukrainian prisoners of war began to speak.” “I would like to note that even the lack of ammunition did not stop them from shutting the mouths of those Ukrainian prisoners of war who began to tell how they killed, where they killed and why they killed the civilian population,” Basurin said. He echoed the earlier remarks by DPR head Denis Pushilin, who claimed that the Ukrainians “deliberately” targeted the detention center in order to kill Azov members who had been providing accounts of possible war crimes committed by their commanders. Kiev has categorically denied these allegations and accused “the Russian occupants” of carrying out the strike. According to a statement by the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Facebook, Russia’s aim was to accuse Ukraine of committing ‘war crimes’. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-07-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/559854-latvia-russians-coerced-statements/,EU member demands denunciations from visiting Russians – media,"Non-citizens entering Latvia from Russia or Belarus reportedly must sign statements condemning Moscow's military operation in Ukraine as “aggression” and will have their Schengen visas canceled if they refuse. That's according to the Latvian state broadcaster LSM, which added that foreigners will face “increased scrutiny” at border checkpoints according to the State Security Service (known by its Latvian abbreviation VDD). Foreigners who enter Latvia from “aggressor country” Russia or Belarus face “increased scrutiny” at border checkpoints, the State Security Service (known by its Latvian abbreviation VDD) told LSM public radio. “The purpose of the inspections is to identify persons who support Russia's military aggression against Ukraine and may pose a threat to Latvia's national security,” the VDD said in a statement, adding that they focus on people who may have served in the military or security forces, “publicly demonstrate symbols glorifying Russian aggression or express a negative attitude towards the Latvian state.” “A large number of foreigners who were refused entry to Latvia openly expressed their support for Russia's military aggression against Ukraine and its people, using typical Kremlin war propaganda messages,” according to the VDD. Since February, a total of 62 foreigners have been barred from entering Latvia, of which 41 were Russian nationals, 14 were from Belarus, and seven were from other countries but VDD assessed they could “pose a threat to Latvia’s national security.” Those turned back also had their Schengen visas for EU travel canceled. LSM spoke with a woman named Svetlana, whose husband – a Russian citizen and Latvian permanent resident – recently traveled to Russia for his mother’s funeral. Upon returning, he was required to sign a document denouncing Russia. “He drove up to the customs post. The border guard took the documents from him. And a man in civilian clothes came, with a sign ‘Border. Security. Safety.’ on his vest. He invited my husband inside. There he gave him the paper without any identifying marks. The paper was in Russian and English. The text was already prepared, he just had to enter his name, surname and passport data,” she told the broadcaster, her voice distorted to protect her identity. When Svetlana’s husband asked why he had to sign such a document, the official told him his residence would be revoked if he didn’t. Moscow sent a protest note to Latvia on Wednesday concerning the coerced statements. Latvia’s Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said the practice is perfectly legal. “Protesting against what we do or don’t do in our national territory, protecting our security and reducing risks, is pointless. We will continue to act in our security interests,” he told LSM. Rinkevics also urged Latvians not to travel to Russia or Belarus, saying now is “not the best time” for tourism. Just in the last two months, however, over 50,000 people left Latvia for Russia – but only 4,000 of them were subject to Latvian jurisdiction, the state border guard said. Latvia denies citizenship to its ethnic Russian population."
2022-07-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/559704-ukraine-blacklist-russian-propagandists/,"If telling the truth puts me on Ukraine’s ‘Russian propagandist’ blacklist, I’ll wear that tag proudly","In 1997, I flew into Kiev, on-mission with the United Nations Special Commission to seek the assistance of the Ukrainian government in investigating the activities of a Ukrainian citizen suspected of illegally selling ballistic missile components and manufacturing capabilities to Iraq in violation of Security Council-imposed economic sanctions. During my visit, I held several meetings with senior officials from the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, including its Secretary, Vladimir Horbulin. I left on good terms, with the Ukrainians agreeing to cooperate (they ultimately did not) and hoping that I would pass on their good attitude to US authorities in hopes that it would assist their desire for NATO membership (I did, in fact, do this.) Twenty-five years later, this same National Security and Defense Council, through its “Center for Countering Disinformation,” has published a blacklist of individuals deemed to be “promoting Russian propaganda.” My name is on this list. My “crimes” include describing Ukraine as a base of NATO, challenging the narrative surrounding the Bucha massacre, and defining the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia as a “proxy war between NATO and Russia.” I am guilty on all three charges, and more. But I am no Russian propagandist. The Center for Countering Disinformation was established in 2021 on the order of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. It is headed by Polina Lysenko, a lawyer who received her law degree in 2015, and whose resumé includes time with the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, the Office of the Prosecutor General (where she received a commendation from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation) and, up until her current appointment, as the Director of the Information Policy and Public Relations Department at a state-owned railway operator. Lysenko unveiled the work of the Center for Countering Disinformation to the ambassadors of the G7 countries, as well as to Finland, Israel, and NATO shortly after her appointment. Her boss, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Aleksey Danilov, emphasized “the importance of coordinating actions with strategic partners in combating hostile information operations and fighting disinformation,” while the head of the Office of the President, Andrey Yermak, indicated that he hoped “that the Center will become not only a Ukrainian center for countering disinformation, but also an international one.” According to Yermak, the center was “fully operational.” Polina Lysenko, in outlining the goals and mission of her organization, emphasized that “the truth will be the main weapon.” She should have started by fact-checking Yermak – two months after he’s declared her center “fully operational,” Ukrainian media was reporting that the center lacked “premises, funding, and staff.” Lysenko was the only employee, and “she has not been paid her salary for several months.” The Center was supposed to have a staff of 52, who were to be paid some $2,000 per month. The Ministry of Finance was responsible for finding the funds for the center, something it had not done as of mid-June 2021. Lysenko worked by herself from a “tiny office on the ground floor of the National Security and Defense Council building.” It's tough to tell the truth when you’re not being paid, it seems. A year later, while funding and staff do not seem to be a problem (thanks in large part to the underwriting of the Ukrainian government payroll by the US taxpayer), quality control is. Take, for example, the case outlined by Lysenko and her new agency on disinformation against me. If “describing Ukraine as a base of NATO” makes one a Russian propogandist, then I should have been joined by Ben Watson, an editor with the notoriously pro-Russian (sarcasm emphasized) web-based journal, Defense One, who in October 2017 published an article with the self-explanatory headline “In Ukraine, the US Trains an Army in the West to Fight in the East.” The article detailed the work done by US and NATO military personnel at the Joint Multinational Training Group – Ukraine’s Yavoriv Combat Training Center in western Ukraine – literally a NATO base inside Ukraine – where every 55 days a Ukrainian Army battalion was trained to NATO standards for the sole purpose of being deployed into eastern Ukraine to fight Russian-backed separatists in Donbass. Pro hint, Ms. Lysenko – when your country hosts a permanent contingent of NATO troops on its soil, that makes it a base of NATO. Lysenko’s staff of top-notch disinformation-countering analysts (again, sarcasm) likewise highlighted my assessment of the massacre of civilians in Bucha in late March-early April as having been committed by Ukrainian forces. Lysenko was in good company here – I was banned from Twitter for this same analysis. Some four months removed from the atrocities committed in Bucha, I stand by my analysis – the fact set has not changed. I am prepared to debate this issue with Polina Lysenko and her entire staff, live on Ukrainian television, anytime she likes. I’ll debate it with anyone, anywhere – that’s how confident I remain in my original analysis. Truth, after all, is my main weapon. The last charge levelled against me by Lysenko’s intrepid truth sleuths, that I’ve labelled the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia as a “proxy war between NATO and Russia,” again brings to question the professionalism of her staff. After all, the Moscow-born self-hating Russian, Max Boot, in an opinion piece published in the Washington Post on June 22, called the Ukraine conflict “our war, too.” It’s one of the few times I will agree with Max Boot on anything. Boot, however, was merely echoing US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s articulation of US policy regarding the Ukraine conflict as being focused on weakening Russia by supporting Ukraine – sort of the textbook definition of a “proxy conflict.” Do better, Polina Lysenko – at least try to score some cheap points by highlighting the fact that much of my analysis regarding Ukraine is published by Russia Today (for instance, this article.) At least then you could say that I was being paid by Russia. Of course, you’d have to wrestle with the fact that my analysis is also published in numerous non-Russian outlets – I mean, what kind of Russian propagandist gets published by American and British publishers? And then, of course, there is the tricky issue of the controlling Russian editorial staff. The following exchange serves as a guide: Me: Any interest in me doing a deep dig on Stoltenberg’s presentation on “paying the price”? Controlling Russian Editor: What’s your take? Me: I don’t think Stoltenberg understands the scope of the price tag. Controlling Russian Editor: It’s the same speech where he said ‘stop complaining’, yeah? Me: Yes. Controlling Russian Editor: Cool, let’s do it. The strategic intent of the Russian propaganda machine is well documented there. I can’t believe I fell for it. All sarcasm aside, the publication by Lysenko’s Center of a blacklist of so-called “Russian propagandists” should be an insult to anyone who believes in the concepts of free speech. I’m proud to be associated with many of those who joined me on that list – Ray McGovern, Tulsi Gabbard, Douglas MacGregor, John Mearsheimer, and others. I’m confident everyone named here would say that their motivations in taking the stance they have about the Ukraine conflict is to pursue the truth – real truth, not the confused version promulgated by Polina Lysenko and her American-paid analysts. None consider themselves to be Russian propagandists, but rather American practitioners of free speech, the kind protected by the same US Constitution many of the named individuals (and myself) have taken an oath to uphold and defend. I’ll conclude by speaking for myself – if adhering to fact-based analysis that has withstood the test of time is the new definition of 'Russian propaganda', then count me in. It certainly is better than the Orwellian version of free speech being bandied about by the US government and its proxies in Ukraine (see what I did there?)."
2022-07-29,https://www.rt.com/news/559850-iss-roscosmos-withdrawal-timeline-unclear/,Russia clarifies ISS pullout timeline,"The timeline for Russia’s withdrawal from the International Space Station (ISS) has not yet been set because the process will be lengthy and depend on multiple factors, the head of Russian space agency Roscosmos, Yuri Borisov, said on Friday. “We haven’t yet warned anyone about it, since it is unnecessary at this time. We simply said we will initiate the withdrawal process after 2024,” Borisov said in an interview with the Rossiya24 network. “The exact timeline, whether it will be in mid-2024 or in 2025, will actually depend on a number of things, including the condition of the ISS itself and its operational performance,” he said. “But the fact that we will do it is no secret at all, and I reported this to the president.” On Tuesday, in his first report to President Vladimir Putin after being appointed as Roscosmos chief in July, Borisov said the agency had made the decision to pull out from ISS after 2024, saying Russia will start putting together its own orbital station by that time. In his Friday interview, the official emphasized that Russia’s decision had nothing to do with geopolitics. “As for the political aspects – I hate to disappoint you, but they simply are not there and I think they shouldn’t be,” he said. “The ISS project enriched global science with regards to our knowledge of the universe, of the Earth, helped all of its participants make significant research gains, and, to an extent, served to bring us all closer.” In an interview with Russky Kosmos (Russian Space) magazine published back in August, former Soviet cosmonaut and chief designer for Russia’s RSC Energia spacecraft manufacturer Vladimir Solovyov said Russia would start construction on its own space station in 2028. Dubbed ROSS (Russian Orbital Service Station), the project would be based on the Science Power Module 1, a new module originally created for ISS that is now being repurposed for the new station, Solovyov revealed. Launched in 1998 as a joint effort by Russian, American, Japanese, Canadian, and European space agencies, ISS is divided into Russian and American sections, the latter being run by the US and other participants of the project."
2022-07-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/559844-lavrov-macron-insults-africa/,Macron ‘insulted’ African nations – Lavrov,"French President Emmanuel Macron’s claims that Moscow backs illegitimate regimes in Africa are insulting to the countries on the continent, said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “If I remember correctly, he said that he was concerned with Russia’s military and diplomatic activity in Africa and with what he said was not cooperation, but the support for absolutely failed, illegitimate regimes and juntas,” Lavrov told reporters during his trip to Uzbekistan on Friday. “If we look at the list of states we visited in Africa, and if that is what he said, it’s rather insulting for the African countries, which, despite everything, continue to consistently develop relations with the Russian Federation.” Lavrov visited Egypt, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda and Ethiopia during his four-day trip to the continent before arriving in Uzbekistan on Thursday. Macron was in Africa around the same time, visiting Cameroon, Benin and Guinea-Bissau. Speaking in Cameroon, a former French colony, on Tuesday, Macron called Russia “one of the last imperial colonial powers.” He accused Moscow of backing “weakened political powers” and “military juntas that have no legitimacy” in Africa. Macron also voiced concerns over the work of the Russia-linked private military company Wagner in Mali and Central African Republic. The Kremlin has denied Wagner represents the Russian government. Lavrov said last year that the private contractor had been invited by the Malian authorities to fight terrorists as the French troops stationed in the country were in the process of withdrawal."
2022-07-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/559843-ukraine-himars-missile-target-blind/,Ukraine is ‘shooting blind’ – top official,"The deliveries of US-made HIMARS rocket systems are “a good first step”, but the West did not provide Kiev with the necessary technologies to accurately hit targets, a high-ranking Ukrainian official complained in an interview published on Thursday. “HIMARS and heavy artillery are a good first step, but if we do not have the technology to find and correct targets for artillery strikes, then we’re just shooting blind,” Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser at the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs, told Newsweek magazine. Earlier this month, Vadim Skibitskiy, a spokesman for Ukraine’s Directorate of Intelligence at the Ministry of Defense, claimed that Kiev views the Crimean Peninsula as a legitimate target for long-range weaponry, including US-made М142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS, supplied by Western powers. His words were echoed by Alexey Arestovich, a top aide to President Vladimir Zelensky, who said that the Ukrainian military would target the Crimean Bridge as soon as Kiev obtains the capability to carry out such a strike. Russia pushed back on these threats, with Mikhail Sheremet, an MP who represents the region in the Russian parliament, warning Kiev that retaliation will be so harsh that Ukraine will never be able to recover from it. According to him, such a strike would be followed by “a crushing blow to decision-making centers in Kiev, military infrastructure and arms-supply logistics channels.” Crimea voted overwhelmingly to reunite with Russia in a 2014 referendum after a coup in Ukraine’s capital. However, Kiev says it doesn’t view the region as part of Russia, considering the peninsula to be Ukrainian territory occupied by Moscow. Russia and allied forces have repeatedly blamed Ukrainian troops for shelling civilian infrastructure, with the Donetsk People’s Republic accusing Kiev of using HIMARS to conduct strikes on Donetsk and other regions. On Friday, Russia’s Ministry of Defense and DPR authorities accused Kiev of using HIMARS to target a prison holding POWs, killing 53 and wounding scores more. Ukraine rejected the claim and pinned the blame on Russian troops. According to the Pentagon, as of July 22, the US has provided Ukraine with 16 M142 HIMARS systems, while the UK has provided another three launchers capable of firing the same munitions. Earlier this month, Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov said that Kiev needed about 50 HIMARS for effective defense, and a least 100 for “an effective counteroffensive.” Last week the Russian military said it destroyed four of the rocket launching systems, a claim that was dismissed by Kiev as “misinformation.”"
2022-07-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/559828-energy-gas-russia-eu/,Fyodor Lukyanov: Russia and the EU’s messy energy divorce places both sides in a race against time,"The debate over Russian gas is heating up across Europe. For instance, Nord Stream’s turbine maintenance procedures would have been a routine issue before, but now it has turned into a major political problem. And then there’s the situation regarding pumping gas through the parts of the Ukrainian pipeline system that are not currently controlled by Kiev. We will let the experts deal with the legal side of things, but as things stand, we can assume this is not the most important aspect. Europe (not just the EU, but the whole geographical region) is facing a massive force majeure situation, which normally serves as a legitimate basis for suspending any contractual obligations. The fact that the players concerned haven’t stated it officially is a political game, in which each team is trying not to lose too much (yes, some games don’t have a winner at all). Another objective is to postpone a decisive energy battle, which is not inevitable, but very likely. For over 50 years, energy partnership has served as a strategic foundation for relations between Moscow and Brussels. This partnership has been extremely beneficial for both sides. The EU received cheap gas, which helped it compete in the global markets even before the end of the Cold War, but especially afterwards. Meanwhile, Moscow gained a steady income and strategic partnership in engineering. After the USSR’s collapse, the cooperation grew stronger, since bilateral limitations in the areas of politics and security became lax. Even though these restrictions didn’t disappear altogether, mutual dependence and benefits boosted cooperation, which seemed to guarantee peace and stability. The situation began to change long before 2022. Transit countries trying to capitalize on Soviet pipelines was a major complication. New elements were at play now, something that wasn’t part of the original setup. The political logic behind the EU project with its expansion eastward and the new balance of the whole system amplified the transit factor, which began to influence decisions made by Western European leaders. On the other hand, the bloc itself started to diversify energy sources, trying to minimize the role of fossil fuels. This inevitably shook the foundation. Since late 1960s, long-term contracts had been the basis for energy cooperation. This allowed the sides to plan ahead. But from the beginning of the 21st century, this planning timeframe started to shrink, which resulted in some anxious behavior. The events unfolding in 2022 have been indicative of one thing – that political ambitions and impulses have finally trumped economic expediency, and when that happened, mutual dependence became no longer an extenuating factor in an otherwise quite naturally competitive relationship between major stakeholders on the international market, but an aggravating one. Hence the current battle of wills that puts the involved parties’ resolve and resilience to the test. There is now less incentive for flexibility. Russia and Gazprom right now are simply following the protocol: If maintenance is scheduled, maintenance is scheduled, and so on. Under normal circumstances, there would be no problem getting the procedure on track, agreeing on the details with the client, or finding workarounds if necessary. However, in circumstances that are far from normal, everything becomes a problem, on top of the fact that trust in politics and business has a very short shelf life, and is not so easy to win back, if at all. As of today, it’s impossible to imagine Russia and the EU ever returning to the same relationship in the energy sector they enjoyed before. This dynamic is now being used by Moscow for political leverage in response to the measures of economic punishment undertaken by Brussels in the spring and summer. In theory, this tit for tat could lead to a certain trade-off that could ease the pressure on both sides, but that would require some strictly pragmatic decision-making, and reason hasn’t exactly been a popular approach so far. The case of Hungary tells us that it actually is possible, but remains an exception to the rule. On the other hand, the European Commission’s call on member states to reduce gas use by 15% was met with protests, since members clearly prefer to make any rationing decisions for themselves independently. As a result, it has been agreed that any cuts will be voluntary and have no mandatory cap. The rest will depend on further developments around many fault lines, including those in Ukraine, the EU itself, and between Russia and the West in general. The short-term significance of Russian-EU relations in the energy sector is obvious – they will set the tone for the relationship in general for some time. Nevertheless, they do not seem to have the capacity to remain a priority in the long term. The EU sees its goal as finding a Russian gas-free solution for itself. Russia needs to mirror this behavior and urgently develop infrastructure for alternative consumer markets. These might include some Western European states, too, but only on the bilateral track and under conditions varying from case to case."
2022-07-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/559831-ukraine-pow-missile-strike/,Russia claims Ukraine had a reason to kill its own POWs,"Kiev’s forces shelled a detention center holding Ukrainian POWs early Friday morning to “threaten” their own troops who may want to surrender, the Russian Defense Ministry has claimed. “A large number of Ukrainian servicemen are voluntarily laying down their arms, and know about the humane treatment of prisoners by the Russian side,” the ministry said, calling the attack “outrageous.” Authorities in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) said that the death toll in the missile strike has grown to 53, while 75 were wounded. DPR Deputy Information Minister Daniil Bezsonov posted a graphic video on his Telegram channel, which shows multiple mutilated and charred bodies inside the destroyed building. According to Russia’s Defense Ministry and local authorities, Ukrainian troops used US-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launchers to strike the detention center near the village of Yelenovka. The ministry said the facility held members of Ukraine’s Azov Battalion, whose fighters surrendered to Russian and Donbass forces during the siege of the Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol. The battalion is notorious because it includes fighters with nationalist and neo-Nazi views. Speaking to Russia’s TV Channel One, DPR head Denis Pushilin claimed that the Ukrainians “deliberately” targeted the detention center in order to kill Azov members who had been providing testimonies about possible war crimes by their commanders. The Ukrainian military released a statement on Friday, accusing Russian troops of shelling Yelenovka. Moscow destroyed the prison in order to pin the blame on Kiev, as well as to “hide the torture of prisoners and executions,"" the statement alleged."

The facility reportedly housed Ukrainian fighters captured by Russian and allied forces during the siege of the Azovstal steel mill in the city of Mariupol. The reported shelling took place as Russian and DPR troops attempt to push Ukrainian soldiers out of the republic’s western areas. The DPR has repeatedly accused Ukraine of using HIMARS to shell Donetsk and other areas. On Sunday, the authorities said Ukrainian troops struck an oil refinery in Donetsk. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

The hostel was located on the first floor of a 16-story residential building. TASS news agency quoted an official source as saying the victims were migrant workers, and that the authorities were working to determine their nationality. The news outlet said that 400 residents were evacuated. A faulty electrical system is believed to be the cause of the fire, TASS reported, citing emergency sources. Andrey Rumyantsev, Moscow’s chief emergency official, told reporters that people could not escape the burning building because the windows had metal guards. He added that the building had an alarm system, but for some reason it did not work. The authorities have launched a criminal investigation into the work of the hostel. Rumyantsev said that just last month, the owner of the hostel was warned by inspectors about multiple safety violations."
2022-07-28,https://www.rt.com/news/559804-lavrov-blinken-call-time-permit/,‘Busy’ Lavrov will consider US request – Moscow,"Russia confirmed the receipt of a request from the US State Department on Thursday seeking a call between the two country’s top diplomats, Sergey Lavrov and Antony Blinken. A conversation between the pair may take place as soon as the busy schedule of Lavrov allows, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said. Lavrov will “pay attention to this request when time permits,” the ministry’s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, told journalists, referring to Washington’s request for a phone conversation between Lavrov and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Earlier on Thursday, State Department spokesman Ned Price said at a news briefing that the US “made it clear to the Russian Federation that we are seeking a conversation between State Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Lavrov.” The request was conveyed to Russia “directly” and “repeatedly,” Price said. The US expects the two top diplomats to “have an opportunity to speak in the coming days,” he added. The State Department spokesman, however, admitted that he had “no update” on any potential dates for the conversation, adding that the two sides “continue to discuss that in the appropriate channels.” Zakharova said on Thursday that the Russian foreign minister currently “has a busy schedule with international contacts,” including a Shanghai Cooperation Organization ministerial summit and some bilateral meetings. The US plans to use the call to follow up on its “substantial proposal” on the release of two Americans currently held in custody in Russia: Basketball player Brittney Griner, who was arrested on drug smuggling charges, and Paul Whelan, who was jailed on suspicion of espionage. On Wednesday, Blinken told journalists he hoped he could “advance the efforts to bring them home” in a conversation with Lavrov. CNN earlier reported that the US might be willing to swap Griner and Whelan for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison in the US in 2012 after being charged with arming a terrorist group and conspiring to kill US nationals. Blinken did not officially confirm the report and never mentioned Bout by name during his latest press briefing, despite being asked a direct question about him. Instead, he said he wanted “to make sure that the proposal that we put forward has a good chance to advance.” Moscow responded by saying there had been no results in negotiations on swapping prisoners with the US, adding that the interests of both sides should be respected during any talks on the matter."

Borrell earlier complained that his statements do not get the same attention in Western media as Lavrov’s. On a regular call with reporters on Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked to comment on Borrell’s remark. “It was fair of him to complain,” Peskov replied. “He is indeed less popular than Lavrov. He has no chance here.” Borrell lamented on Tuesday that Lavrov’s statements were gaining more traction in the media than his own. “Lavrov goes to Africa and tries to persuade the Africans that sanctions are to blame for all that’s happening... and the whole of the Western media repeats it,” Borrell told Spanish radio Cadena SER. “I go to Africa to say the opposite, that sanctions have nothing to do with it, and nobody picks it up.” Lavrov had paid visits to Egypt, DR Congo, Uganda and Ethiopia on a four-day tour before arriving in Uzbekistan on Thursday. The trip took place shortly after Russia and Ukraine reached a deal, brokered by Turkey and the UN, to resume grain exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports."
2022-07-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/559770-peskov-russia-losses-ukraine/,Kremlin comments on military casualty claims,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has rejected a New York Times report on the scale of Russia’s losses in Ukraine, accusing the paper of unquestionably repeating government talking points. “This is not a statement by the US administration, this is a newspaper report,” he said. “These days, even the most reputable newspapers do not shun spreading various fakes. Unfortunately, such practices have become increasingly common. This is the way we should treat it.” On Thursday, The New York Times reported that the Biden administration believes that Russia had lost as many as 75,000 soldiers killed or wounded in action during the Ukraine conflict. As a source, the outlet cited an anonymous legislator that had allegedly seen a classified briefing from the State Department, Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Meanwhile, The Times cautioned that casualty estimates for militaries on both sides are highly speculative, noting that figures may differ by tens of thousands. The last time Russia officially updated its losses was on March 25, when the Defense Ministry reported that 1,351 military personnel had been killed and 3,825 wounded in combat since the beginning of the offensive in Ukraine. In June, the head of the Russian Duma’s Defense Committee, Andrey Kartapolov, claimed that, due to changes in military strategy, the Russian Army has “practically ceased to lose people.” Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has conceded that his nation’s armed forces are sustaining heavy losses. Last week, he said that Kiev loses around 30 personnel in combat a day, which is significantly less than in May and June, when the death toll amounted to 100-200 troops a day. On July 4, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced that over the previous two weeks alone, Ukraine had lost almost 5,500 troops, including more than 2,000 killed. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

The mayor wrote on his Telegram channel that mines were discovered on several streets in the northwestern part of the city. “A bomb squad and rescuers have been working on the site since the early morning. A vehicle equipped with a loudspeaker is alerting local residents,” Kulemzin said, urging people to be vigilant and not approach the mines. The small butterfly-shaped PFM-1 landmines are banned under the 1997 Ottawa Convention, of which Ukraine is part. Even when they do not kill the victim when stepped on, they often rip the person’s foot off. Earlier, Lugansk People’s Republic authorities reported finding the PFM-1s in places left by Ukrainian troops after retreating. Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of using internationally banned munitions, as well as shelling residential areas and other civilian targets.

2022-07-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/559739-ukraine-threaten-attack-russian-territory/,Ukraine threatens to attack Russian territory,"Kiev will not hesitate to attack Russian soil if it deems it necessary, Aleksey Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, threatened during a live broadcast on Wednesday. The security council closely follows all the missile and air strikes Russia launches against Ukraine, Danilov said, adding that Ukrainian authorities are well aware of all the locations in Russia from which the attacks have been carried out. Kiev possesses “enough political will” to order a strike against these targets if such a need arises, he added. “If needed … anyone [in the government] will act without hesitation and sign anything that needs to be signed to destroy these objects,” Danilov said. The security council head also stated that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky’s words about Ukraine retaliating against the locations from which the strikes are launched serves as “proof” of Kiev’s determination. Earlier, some Ukrainian officials said that Kiev forces may hit targets on the Crimean Peninsula or the Crimean Bridge, which they consider to be a key supply route for Russian forces. Ukraine’s military intelligence spokesman, Vadim Skibitskiy, claimed that Crimea could be targeted by US-supplied М142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS multiple launch rocket systems. Moscow responded by saying that Ukraine would pay a heavy price if it decided to strike Crimea. Russia’s former president, Dmitry Medvedev, said in mid-July that Moscow might respond with a “massive strike” targeting the Ukrainian leadership if that happened. The US and its allies previously appeared to be reluctant to supply Ukraine with longer-range weapons capable of striking targets deep inside Russia as they were concerned about a potential escalation of the conflict. Washington has not yet agreed to send tactical ballistic missiles with a distance of up to 300 kilometers to Ukraine. Such missiles can be used by the US-made HIMARS multiple rocket launchers the US handed over to Kiev. However, according to the spokesman for the army of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Eduard Basurin, Ukrainian forces may have already received 300km-range HIMARS missiles. DPR troops have found pieces of munitions with a range of 110 kilometers to 120 kilometers, which meant that Kiev could have the 300km-missiles as well, Basurin told the Russian media last week. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday that the West’s persistence in pumping Ukraine with long-range weapons, including the HIMARS, was already making Moscow reconsider the goals of its military operation in the neighboring country. They now go beyond Donbass and include several other Ukrainian regions, he added. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/559728-ukraine-escalation-rand-report/,Think-tank advises US how to avoid war with Russia,"The US and its NATO allies need to take a series of steps to avoid a direct conflict with Russia over Ukraine, the Pentagon’s foremost think-tank advised in a report published on Tuesday. Sanctions against Russia have created conditions for one of the escalation pathways already, while the continuing flow of weapons and volunteers to Ukraine may trigger others, the RAND Corporation warned. Concerns that the conflict in Ukraine will “escalate to a Russia-NATO clash” are “warranted,” said the outfit, which has been doing research and analysis for the US military since 1948. While plausible, such escalation is not inevitable if the US and its allies take some steps to fend it off, according to the report. RAND researchers laid out “four plausible horizontal escalation pathways,” starting with the anti-Russian sanctions already implemented by the US and its allies. The other three possibilities involve Moscow coming to believe a direct NATO involvement is imminent; that weapons delivered to Ukraine are making a major difference on the battlefield; or that unrest within Russia is threatening the government. “Moscow has yet to respond directly in any substantial manner,” to Western actions, from sanctions to arming Ukraine, which RAND assumes have “immiserated Russia and led to the death of many Russian soldiers.” The researchers explain this by offering up speculation that the “Kremlin’s preoccupation with its faltering campaign in Ukraine might be consuming senior leaders’ limited bandwidth.” They also assume that Russia is running out of long-range missiles, a claim Western intelligence agencies have been making since March – and therefore may feel pressured to strike NATO territory if it feels the US-led bloc might get directly involved. The most acute risk of a Russian decision to escalate directly to a kinetic strike on NATO allies would result from Moscow perceiving that large-scale, direct NATO attacks on Russian military forces in Ukraine are imminent. Deploying long-range strike capabilities in the Baltic States, Poland, and Romania, or having volunteers from NATO member states take part in the fighting – which has already happened – would promote this conclusion, RAND warns, adding that this pathway may lead to “plausible” use of nuclear weapons. “Continue to signal that the United States and NATO allies have no plans to directly enter the conflict,” RAND advised Washington, as this is needed to counter public statements by “current or former government officials” about Russian “atrocities” and calls for regime change. NATO should still “increase force presence in the east” but focus on “defensive” capabilities and re-evaluate activities such as drills “to avoid creating a false impression of preparation for offensive action,” the researchers said. If Western weapons flowing into Ukraine begin to “turn the conflict dramatically against Russia,” Moscow might target their supply nodes, the report claims. Such attacks could start out as “covert or non-kinetic” and escalate from there; one example given is the 2014 explosion at the Czech ammunition depot, which Western media and the intelligence-adjacent outfit Bellingcat blamed on Russia, without evidence. One proposed countermeasure is to keep NATO training and supply facilities used to aid Ukraine “dispersed and covert, wherever possible.” Another admission, buried deep in the report, is that Western weapons assistance has not managed to “turn the conflict dramatically against Russia.” The last scenario envisions Moscow interpreting large-scale protests as “a non-kinetic NATO attack.” While mass demonstrations are yet to take place in Russia, “the dramatic economic contraction that has resulted from the war might well be the spark for such broader popular unrest once economic pain is felt over the medium to long term,” the RAND report said. The trouble is that Moscow might perceive such protests as “evidence of a coordinated Western campaign to topple the Russian government,” so NATO needs to “maintain the message discipline” that its objective is “the cessation of conflict, not the end of the Putin regime.” At the very end, the report cautions that the US and its allies “could be the engine of escalation as easily as Russia could,” and that any escalation spiral is as likely to start with their actions. As the report focused on possible Russian actions, however, that warning was left unexplored."
2022-07-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/559735-medvedev-ukraine-partition-maps/,Former Russian president presents future map of Ukraine,"Ukraine is more likely to be reduced to Kiev and its surroundings than to ever re-encompass Crimea and the Donbass republics, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on his Telegram channel on Wednesday. The one-time president and long-time prime minister who now heads the national security council also posted two maps helpfully illustrating his argument. The first map showed Ukraine in borders prior to the US-backed coup in 2014, including Crimea and the two eastern regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. A month after the militants backed by Washington seized power in Kiev, Crimea voted to rejoin Russia, while the two Donbass regions declared independence. “In the mind of the president of Ukraine, damaged by psychotropic substances, this is what the map of his country’s bright future will look like,” Medvedev wrote on Telegram. “Western analysts believe it will look like this, actually,” he said, posting a second map. On it, “Ukraine” is reduced to Kiev and its surroundings. Seven regions in the West have been annexed by Poland, and three in the southwest by Hungary and Romania, respectively. Everything else is marked “Russia.” He did not specify which Western experts may have envisioned such a partition. The Ukrainian government has repeatedly rejected any possibility of territorial concessions, insisting that Kiev’s objectives were a “capitulation” of Russia and “reintegration” of Donbass and Crimea. Medvedev served as president of Russia between 2008 and 2012, and then as prime minister until 2020, when he was put in charge of the national security council. Over the course of the conflict in Ukraine, he has made a name for himself with colorful Telegram posts. Just this month, he warned Kiev of “Judgment Day” if they attacked Crimea and offered a list of “Russian sins,” followed up by those of the West. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/559733-ukraine-strike-nuclear-plant-disaster/,Ukraine seeks to engineer nuclear disaster – Russia,"Drone strikes on Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant by Ukraine appear to be an attempt to engineer a massive industrial disaster, and with the connivance of the West, Deputy Spokesperson for Russia’s Foreign Ministry Ivan Nechaev said Wednesday. “Ukraine’s armed forces are obsessively staging strikes on Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, which is the largest in Europe, with total disregard for its safety or IAEA’s decisions and its resolutions,” Nechaev told a weekly news briefing, referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s numerous rulings that deem attacks against civilian nuclear facilities to be violations of international law. “It is now obvious Ukraine is deliberately going for a massive industrial disaster. And we’re seeing that both the US and their European allies are completely fine with it,” Nechaev concluded. Currently under the control of Russian forces, Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, located in Energodar, southeastern Ukraine, has been a target of several strikes in the past few weeks. On July 12, Ukrainian drones dropped several 120mm shells on a building located next to the power plant, injuring 11 employees, Energodar authorities confirmed. On July 20 three Ukrainian “kamikaze drones” attacked the plant, with no damage to its structures reported. Back in April, the head of Russia’s Radioactive, Chemical, and Biological Protection Forces, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, said a ‘false-flag operation’ could be staged on one of Ukraine’s nuclear energy facilities, including on the Zaporozhye plant. Ukrainian authorities have in turn accused Russia of attacking the plant. In early March, as Russian forces were advancing in Zaporozhye, Ukraine’s president Vladimir Zelensky said the plant was intentionally shelled by Russia in an attempt to “recreate the Chernobyl disaster.” On July 21, the president of Ukraine’s state nuclear operator Energoatom, Petro Kotin, told Ukrainian media that Russian forces have deployed heavy weapons within the machine hall of Zaporozhye’s first unit, with munitions and fuel stored nearby. According to Kotin, even though the plant’s first unit has been out of service since the start of Russia’s offensive, these weapons and munitions represented a “fire hazard.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

The list was published earlier this month by the ‘Center for Countering Disinformation’ (CCD), a department of the Ukrainian National Security Council set up last year by President Vladimir Zelensky. Since the launch of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine in February, the CCD has published regular reports analyzing coverage of the conflict in the world’s media. Among more than 75 names on the list is PS Raghavan, the former Head of India’s National Security Council. Raghavan, who also served as India’s ambassador to Russia from 2014 to 2016, is named on the list for suggesting that “Ukraine against Russia is like NATO against Russia.” Contacted by The Wire, an Indian news site, Raghavan said that he had “no comments to offer on the exercise, other than mystification at my inclusion in this list.” Sam Pitroda, a former adviser to Indian Prime Ministers Rajiv Gandhi and Manmohan Singh, is also listed, for having suggested that the world “should negotiate with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.” He said that he was “puzzled and surprised” at his inclusion. Journalist Saeed Naqvi is the third Indian mentioned on the list. Named for suggesting that Ukraine’s military “success” was an “illusion” born of Western propaganda, he said that Kiev “is paying a very heavy price for a Western misadventure, and they are entitled to their reactions in their desperation.” US Senator Rand Paul, who has condemned his fellow lawmakers for bankrolling Ukraine’s military while the US economy suffers, is included on the blacklist, as is political scientist John Mearsheimer, who has argued for years that NATO’s eastward expansion would provoke Russia into a conflict that would leave Ukraine “wrecked.” “When I was a young boy, my mother taught me that when others can’t beat your arguments with facts and logic, they smear you. That is what is going on here,” Mearsheimer told British news site UnHerd. Historian Edward Luttwak, a supporter of the West’s policy of arming Ukraine, also found himself included on the list for suggesting that Ukraine cannot hope to defeat Russia outright and depose Putin. “It is a fantasy to believe Russia can be squarely defeated,” he told UnHerd. “In Kiev they have interpreted this stance as meaning I am pro-Russia.” The CCD does not explain what inclusion on the list means for any of these people, and has not threatened any of them with reprisal. Nor is the list explicitly connected with the Mirotvorets (Peacemaker) database, another list of “pro-Russian terrorists” that names nine-year-old children as enemies of the Ukrainian state. Mirotvorets is believed to be run by the Ukrainian Security Service. RT contributors Scott Ritter and Bradley Blankenship are also listed, while independent journalist Glenn Greenwald is named for suggesting that “the USA should not provoke Russia into a nuclear war” and that “dangerous biolabs are located in Ukraine,” a fact backed up by US officials. “The Ukrainians have the absolute right to pursue whatever war policies they want,” Greenwald told UnHerd. “But when they start demanding that my country and my government use its resources to fuel their war effort, then I, along with all other Americans, have the absolute right to question that policy or to point out its dangers and risks.” Greenwald referred to Kiev’s tactic of “accusing dissidents of spreading ‘Russian propaganda’” as “standard McCarthyite idiocy.”"
2022-07-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/559725-russia-surrogate-mother-sentenced/,Surrogate mother sentenced for the first time in Russia,"A Russian court has sentenced a surrogate mother to three years in prison for allegedly engaging in human trafficking. The verdict, which is the first of its kind in Russia, was announced to the public by the press service of the Krasnoyarsk regional prosecutor’s office on Wednesday. According to case files seen by TASS news agency, Tamara Yandieva, a 29-year-old Kazakhstan citizen, allegedly tried to sell a newborn baby under the guise of a surrogacy service. The criminal investigation discovered that, in 2019, the woman posted an online resume looking for work and was subsequently offered to serve as a surrogate mother for a family in China paying a hefty fee. Yandieva agreed and traveled to Cambodia to undergo a fertilization procedure. She then returned to Russia, where she gave birth in April 2020. The woman then received a birth certificate and legally transferred ownership of the child to a surrogate motherhood company called Didilia LLC, and got paid $13,000. The newborn was supposed to be taken to China, but the procedure was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. In 2021, the woman was informed she was going to be a defendant in a criminal case on human trafficking along with the owners of the Didilia company, who are accused of offering Russian and Kazakhstan women money to give birth to children who would then be sold to Chinese citizens. Another defendant in the case is a former special investigator who is considered to be the organizer of the scheme. Back in April, a Krasnoyarsk court also sentenced the head of the legal department of the Krasnoyarsk Center for Maternal and Child Welfare to two years in prison for forging documents which were used to issue birth certificates for the transfer of newborn babies to Chinese citizens. The investigation identified 19 babies in this case, who are now being held in an infant care facility and will eventually be transferred to foster care. While surrogate motherhood is legal in Russia, and there are many clinics that offer such services, the Didilia company is being accused of selling children, which is a criminal offense under Russian law and is equivalent to human trafficking. Russian lawmakers have recently introduced a bill that aims to prohibit Russian women from acting as surrogate mothers for foreign citizens. The bill has so far passed its first reading in the State Duma (Russian Parliament)."
2022-07-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/559722-sochi-putin-erdogan-drones/,Russia and Turkey to discuss ‘military-technical cooperation’ – Kremlin,"Military-technical cooperation will be on the agenda when Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, meet in Sochi. This was the response by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday, when asked about Erdogan’s revelation that Moscow had an eye on Turkey’s Bayraktar combat drones, which are currently supplied to Ukraine. Multiple Turkish outlets reported on Tuesday that Erdogan had told his party leadership about Putin’s interest in Turkey’s military drone industry. The Russian leader reportedly raised the subject of cooperation with Baykar Makina, the makers of Bayraktar, at the July 19 meeting in Tehran. Asked about it, Peskov did not offer specifics. “Military-technical cooperation between the two countries is constantly on the agenda,” the Kremlin spokesman told reporters. “The very fact that our interaction is developing in such a sensitive area indicates that, in general, the whole range of our relations is at a very high level.” Erdogan is scheduled to meet Putin in Sochi on August 5. While implementation of the July 22 agreement for grain exports via the Black Sea is expected to dominate the agenda, it is now looking likely that the topic of drones will come up as well. Reports of Russian interest in the drones have caused quite a stir, since Baykar has been supplying the Bayraktars primarily to Ukraine. Kiev had bought a dozen TB2 strike drones prior to February, and has taken the delivery of another 50 since, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. Ankara has touted Baykar’s drones since 2020, when they were said to have helped Azerbaijan prevail in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. Turkish troops have deployed them in Syria and Libya as well. Their reputation as “wonder weapons” has suffered somewhat in Ukraine, where they fared poorly against Russian air defenses. Kiev now reportedly reserves them only for “special missions.” Baykar CEO Haluk Bayraktar went on the record to say his company would “never” sell drones to Russia, however. “There is a strategic relationship between Turkey and Ukraine, especially in the field of aviation and space,” he told CNN just last week. “Turkey supports Ukraine with armed drone technology. We did not transmit or supply anything to Russia.” Though Russia has its own drone program, the US has accused Moscow of wanting to buy “hundreds” of strike drones from Iran. Tehran has denied the claim."
2022-07-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/559712-kremlin-reacts-rt-france/,Kremlin warns West of response to RT France ban,"Moscow will apply “similar reciprocal” measures to Western media working in Russia in response to the ban of RT France from broadcasting in the EU, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. This comes after the EU’s top court on Wednesday upheld a decision to prohibit RT France from airing its shows, accusing the channel of unfair coverage of the Ukraine conflict. “The encroachment on the freedom of speech, the freedom of the media, in European states, including France, is both concerning and regrettable,” Peskov told reporters. “The Europeans are stomping out the same ideals they’re imposing across the globe.” Peskov promised “reciprocal pressure” on Western media working in Russia. “We will similarly not allow them to work in our country. There won’t be a soft approach to this issue.” Earlier in the day, the European Court of Justice upheld a ban on RT France from broadcasting its content in the bloc. The judges ruled that the channel was “not capable of demonstrating an overall balanced treatment by the latter of information” concerning the conflict. Emmanuel Piwnica, RT France’s lawyer, said the verdict demonstrates the “disregard for the freedom of expression any news media must have.” Head of RT France Xenia Fedorova said in a statement that the ruling shows that the bloc’s judiciary “cannot or will not oppose” the will of politicians. “European politicians have chosen the path that is against democratic values on which Europe is based, such as the freedom of expression and diversity of opinion,” Fedorova said. “Despite the censorship, RT France will continue to bring different perspectives on the news, wherever it is broadcast.” The European Council banned the broadcast of shows produced by RT and Sputnik, another Russian state-funded news agency, in March, citing “systematic information and manipulation and disinformation” in the coverage of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The decision was made shortly after Russia launched its military operation against the neighboring state in late February. Western politicians have long accused RT of waging a propaganda campaign at the behest of the Kremlin. RT denies these allegations. Earlier this year, the Russian authorities ordered German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle to close its office in Moscow. The move came after Berlin banned RT’s German-language sister channel RT DE from broadcasting in the country. In response to bans and restrictions introduced by Western countries on several Russian media outlets, Moscow also blocked the websites of some Western state-funded outlets, including the BBC and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL)."
2022-07-27,https://www.rt.com/news/559711-strike-destroys-himars-ammunition/,Strike destroys over 100 US-made HIMARS rockets – Russia,"Russian forces have targeted an ammunition depot in Ukraine’s Dnepropetrovsk Region, destroying over 100 US-made HIMARS rockets, according to an update from Russia’s Defense Ministry on Wednesday. “On July 24, a strike by Russia’s Aerospace Forces on an ammunition depot near the settlement of Lyubimovka, Dnepropetrovsk region, destroyed more than a hundred missiles for the US-made HIMARS Multiple launch rocket system,” the ministry’s report reads. It is also noted that up to 120 Ukrainian military personnel guarding the facility, as well as foreign mercenaries and technical specialists, were killed. The update follows a Russian Defense Ministry report on Monday claiming that Moscow had targeted and destroyed US-supplied weapons, including heavy artillery in western Ukraine, using “sea-based high-precision long-range weapons.” The US, which is Kiev’s biggest backer in its conflict with Moscow, had supplied Ukraine with 16 HIMARS systems as of July 22 while the UK has provided another three launchers capable of firing the same munitions. However, last week, the Russian military claimed to have destroyed four of these rocket launchers. Kiev officials have refuted these claims as “misinformation.” Russia’s Defense Ministry also reported on Wednesday that its forces had carried out strikes on Ukrainian military personnel and equipment in 142 districts, destroying a number of howitzers and artillery platoons. According to the ministry, Ukraine has so far lost over 760 multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and more than 3,200 artillery pieces since the beginning of hostilities in February. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/559709-ships-ukraine-grain-depart/,Timeline set for Ukraine grain exports to resume — Moscow,"Turkish officials estimate grain exports from Ukraine, as agreed under last week’s Ankara- and UN-brokered deal between Moscow and Kiev, will start this week, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. “Based upon statements by our colleagues from Turkey where the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) is located, they expect exports from Ukraine to start in the coming days,” Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko told reporters. He added, however, that, for its part, Moscow was hoping for the best but could not rule out the deal crumbling. “We always hope for the best and expect that our partners will also implement two components of the grain deal – [that] concerning the export of grain from Ukraine, and [that] regarding the removal of restrictions on the export of Russian grain in general,” the official elaborated. Turkey’s defense minister Hulusi Akar announced Wednesday the JCC had begun operations in Istanbul. According to Akar, the center will be overseeing grain exports under the leadership of the UN. Brokered by the UN and the Turkish government, the deal to unblock much-awaited grain exports from Ukraine was signed by Moscow and Kiev last Friday. The agreement, described by UN Secretary Antonio Guterres as “a beacon of hope and relief” shining on the Black Sea, was widely described as a diplomatic breakthrough that would do much to alleviate the global food crisis. There were fears that the deal might hang in the balance after two Russian missiles struck the port of Odessa Saturday. Moscow later said it had targeted a Ukrainian warship docked there as well as a warehouse storing US-supplied Harpoon anti-ship missiles. The strike was condemned by both Kiev and Guterres, who offered a reminder that both Russia and Ukraine had to implement the agreement fully if they were to ease the suffering of millions around the globe. However, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov later pointed out that the deal did not preclude Moscow from continuing its “military operation” in Ukraine and striking military targets."
2022-07-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/559598-jens-stoltenberg-calls-allies-pay/,NATO’s arsonist-in-chief Jens Stoltenberg wants the Western public to pay for a Ukrainian fire he helped to ignite,"The General Secretary of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, took it upon himself recently to lecture the members of the European Parliament about the need to “pay the price” necessary to keep Ukraine able to function and fight in its ongoing conflict with Russia. What he failed to admit was the major role he himself played in bringing about this conflict. The Norwegian has an important role. In many ways, one can liken it to that of a fire commissioner whose job is to bring together various neighborhood fire departments into a large mutual aid pact, where a fire in one district automatically causes the resources of the neighboring districts to be dispatched in response. That’s Article 5 of NATO’s Charter in a nutshell. Like any membership-based bureaucracy, joining a fire district, like joining NATO, involves a process which requires specific undertakings by all parties involved. The mutual aid pact, like Article 5, can’t be triggered unless the involved party is a member. Now imagine a scenario where a fire commissioner was pushing for the membership of a questionable fire district, and in the middle of the processes involved in making this district a member, a giant fire breaks out. The fire commissioner encourages his constituent districts to turn over equipment and resources (but not manpower) to the non-member district to fight the fire. The fire is big. The fire commissioner asks for more resources. And now imagine that it turns out that the fire commissioner is an arsonist who helped set the fire in the first place. That’s pretty much the scenario which faces NATO today, where the US-led bloc is struggling to deal with the consequences of 14 years of fundamentally flawed policy which saw it promise Ukraine eventual membership, despite knowing that Russia was adamantly opposed to such a move. NATO then watched as its constituent members helped conduct a coup in Ukraine in February 2014, replacing a duly elected president with a cohort of politicians hand-picked by Washington. The coup in question was made possible only with the involvement of radical Ukrainian right-wing nationalists whose lineage can be traced back to Nazi Germany and, post-World War Two, covert CIA backing which lasted from 1945 through the present. The involvement of these neo-Nazi elements can be likened to the fire commissioner dispatching a team of fellow arsonists to ostensibly help prepare the prospective member for joining the fire district, only to have them secretly conspire amongst themselves to instead burn down entire neighborhoods within the territory of the candidate district. For eight years Jens Stoltenberg oversaw a system which pretended to pursue peace in Ukraine post-coup through the Minsk Accords, only to secretly conspire with Ukraine, France, and Germany to prevent closure on the accords for the purpose of buying time for Ukraine to build a NATO-standard military capable of delivering a massive knockout blow to the breakaway Donbass region, and perhaps even Crimea. Stoltenberg helped light the match that set Ukraine ablaze. And now it turns out, during a meeting with members of the European Parliament, the secretary general of NATO chastised the parliamentarians to “stop complaining and step up and provide support to Ukraine”. The arsonist-in-chief was lecturing the insurance underwriters of Europe to suck it up and pay the price of his handiwork. His hypocrisy was sickening. “The price we pay as the European Union, as NATO,” he declared, “is the price we can measure in currency, in money. The price they [Ukrainians] pay is measured in lives lost every day. We should stop complaining and step up and provide support, full stop.” Left unsaid was the fact that Stoltenberg and NATO were responsible for the conflagration which has swept over Ukraine. With Kiev gearing up for an offensive against the Donbass, only Russia’s decision to launch its own special military operation prevented the NATO/Ukrainian plan from reaching fruition. But the arsonist cannot admit that he started the fire. Instead, Stoltenberg not only shifted responsibility for the Ukraine conflict onto Russia, but then had the audacity to state that the fire he started posed a threat to all of NATO. “It is in our interest to help Ukraine,” Stoltenberg declared to the European parliamentarians, “because you have to understand that if Ukraine loses this, that’s a danger for us.” Ignoring the fact that he was largely responsible for the disaster that struck Ukraine when Russia initiated its military operation, Stoltenberg planted his banner firmly onto a hill of hypocrisy, proclaiming: “If you don’t care about the moral aspect of this, supporting the people of Ukraine, you should care about your own security interests. Pay for the support, pay for the humanitarian aid, pay the consequences of the economic sanctions, because the alternative is to pay a much higher price later on.” What Stoltenberg was really saying was: “pay for my mistakes, your mistakes, our mistakes.” But admitting a mistake is not part of the moral fiber of an arsonist."
2022-07-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/559690-kherson-bridge-himars-ukraine/,Ukraine strikes key bridge with US-made HIMARS missiles – local authorities,"Traffic on the Antonovsky Bridge over the Dnepr River in Russia-controlled Kherson Region has been halted after Ukrainian attacks, according to local authorities. The 1366-meter bridge has been bombed three times by Ukrainian forces in the past 24 hours. In the latest overnight strike “the bridge was hit, but it’s not destroyed. Only some new holes have appeared,” Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Kherson Region administration, said. “We’ve halted all traffic [over the bridge] and are going to fix it now,” the official added. According to Stremousov, pontoon crossings over the Dnieper will be set up in the area pending repairs on the Antonovsky Bridge. The Ukrainian strike was carried out with use of US-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launch systems, he claimed. The attack on the only bridge over the Dnepr in the region has “only complicated the life of peaceful civilians,” Stremousov insisted, while denying that the structure had any military significance. “The hysteria in the Ukrainian media that the outcome of virtually the whole conflict will be decided on this bridge is nothing, but a bluff,” he said. There have been several strikes on the Antonovsky Bridge in recent days amid Kiev’s claims that it's preparing a major counteroffensive against Russian forces in the Kherson region. Those attacks employed HIMARS and Soviet-made systems possessed by Ukraine, with most of the projectiles being intercepted by Russian air defenses. The few missiles that made it through were only able to damage the roadway, while all the pillars of the bridge remained intact. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-07-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/559686-wagner-group-action-ukraine/,RT witnesses Wagner group fighting in Donbass (VIDEO),"RT’s Murad Gazdiev was granted a rare opportunity to embed with the Wagner Group, a secretive Russian private military company, as it fights in Donbass. The contractors, who call themselves ‘the Orchestra of Wagner’ or ‘the Musicians’, conceal their identities. The name is thought to have come from the call sign of the unit’s founder Dmitry Utkin, a veteran of two Chechen wars. Richard Wagner was a famous 19th century German composer but the name has also been used for characters in literature, computer games, comic books, and even by a motorcycle manufacturer. Before Murad joined them, the unit had recently pushed Ukrainian troops out of the village of Klinovoe in the Donetsk People’s Republic. The Wagner fighters fired mortars as Ukraine’s ultra-nationalist Aidar Battalion and the ostensibly elite 10th Mountain Assault Brigade were trying to hold them off. “Artillery and mortar duels here are deafening and endless,” Gazdiev said while reporting. During their offensive, the Wagner troops came under fire from cluster munitions and had to deal with tripwire anti-personnel mines left by the Ukrainians. “What the sappers can remove safely, they do. What they can’t – or what they deem could be a trap – they blow [up],” Gazdiev said. The fighting in Donbass intensified after Russia launched a full-scale military campaign against Ukraine in late February. Before the conflict, the outfit had reportedly been operating in the Middle East and Africa. The Kremlin has denied any ties between the Wagner Group and the Russian government. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/559676-ukraine-lend-lease-gas/,Ukraine to ask for free gas,"Ukraine will ask the US for natural gas deliveries on the same principle as applied to weapons and ammunition, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal said on Tuesday. This “gas lend-lease” will be needed for the coming winter, he said. Meanwhile, the European Union has imposed gas rationing. “The government of Ukraine has decided to apply to the government of the United States of America to provide our state with a ‘gas lend-lease’ for a stable heating season,” Shmigal announced during a cabinet meeting, according to a video posted to his Telegram channel. “Preparations for the most difficult winter in our history continue, and we are looking for all possible tools to be ready for any scenario,” he added. While Shmigal did not elaborate on how the proposed arrangement would work, his use of the term “lend-lease” suggests that Kiev expects to get deliveries of US liquefied natural gas (LNG) for free. The US has long sought to sell its LNG on the European market, but it could not compete with the Russian gas on price. Washington currently sends millions of dollars’ worth of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine under a WWII-era scheme dusted off in April. Shmigal’s proposal comes as the state-owned gas company Naftogaz has defaulted on its bonds and requested from the government in Kiev to take “full responsibility for raising the funds needed to import natural gas for the upcoming heating season.” However, former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Timoshenko on Monday accused Naftogaz of embezzlement. The company is engaging in the “scam of the century,” asking for billions to buy gas even though Ukraine doesn’t need it and may even be running a surplus, claimed Timoshenko, who headed the US-backed cabinet in 2007-2010 and now sits in the parliament as the head of the ‘Fatherland’ party. Meanwhile, the EU has announced a plan to ration gas consumption beginning in August to cope with potential shortages. Most of the bloc’s natural gas is imported from Russia, and Moscow has pledged to fulfill its contracts despite the embargoes Brussels imposed citing the conflict in Ukraine. However, repairs on the main pipeline to Germany – involving sanctioned equipment – have reduced the flow of gas in recent weeks. Berlin has categorically rejected the possibility of using the completed Nord Stream 2 expansion to bypass the problem."
2022-07-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/559674-displaced-ukrainian-returning-frontline/,Displaced Ukrainians returning to conflict zones – media,"People who fled the fighting in the east and south of Ukraine are now going back, both to towns under control of the government in Kiev and territory held by Russian troops, Euronews has reported. Testimonies suggest the returnees prefer the risks of living at home to the uncertainty of displacement. “Tens of thousands” of Ukrainians who were evacuated from the Donetsk region at the start of the conflict have since returned, Euronews’ Russian-language service reported on Monday. According to the mayor of Pokrovsk, some 70% of the evacuees have recently come back to the city, which is on the territory controlled by Ukraine but claimed by the Donetsk People’s Republic. “We were fed, there was food, but it was temporary. And then we were told to go to a nursing home. My son did not want to,” Tamara Markova, 82, told the outlet. She and her son Nikolay spent less than a week in Dnepr before deciding they’d rather take their chances at home. Karina Smulskaya, 18, who now works as a waitress to support her family, told Euronews “I understand that being in the city is very risky. But if you leave ... Who is waiting for us there? Who needs us there? And we need to earn money!” Pokrovsk, formerly known as Krasnoarmeysk, is about 60 kilometers from the front lines, near Donetsk. Moscow is offering Russian citizenship to residents of regions under its control. The government in Kiev has responded by proposing a law that could see Ukrainians who apply for Russian citizenship jailed for up to 15 years. Despite this, some people are choosing to return to Russian-held territories such as Zaporozhye. Up to 200 cars a day pass through the sole Ukrainian army checkpoint to southern Zaporozhye, according to Euronews. Some people wait up to 10 days for permission to cross. Ukrainian troops warn them of possible danger and inspect the cars for weapons and extra fuel, then reluctantly let them through. Few of the returnees are willing to talk to reporters, choose their words carefully and prefer to remain anonymous. Some say they want to reunite with their families and look for work, adding that jobs are scarce in Ukrainian-controlled territory. “My mother and sister live there,” one person told the outlet. “If they don’t bother or provoke [the Russians], they can live more or less fine.” The UN estimates that some seven million Ukrainians have been internally displaced due to the conflict. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/559386-foreign-agent-registration-document/,How professional lobbyists have worked to generate enthusiasm in Washington for a long proxy military conflict in Ukraine,"If you've wondered why so much Western media coverage of the Ukraine conflict seems to be based on ""Kiev says,"" the answer is largely down to the power of lobbying. The Ukraine is always good and Russia is always bad narrative didn't create itself. On July 11, Washington DC-based public affairs consultancy Ridgely Walsh registered as a Foreign Agent on behalf of Ukrainian interests with the US Justice Department. The company – which typically advises Silicon Valley big hitters such as eBay, Google, Snapchat, SpaceX, and Uber – is just the latest Beltway operator to enlist under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). This is archaic and abstruse legislation thrust to the forefront of the mainstream news agenda during the ‘Russiagate’ hoax of the Donald Trump presidency. Last July, just 11 US-based firms were registered as lobbyists for Ukrainian clients under FARA. Over the course of 2021, these influencers attempted to pressure Washington to kill the Nord Stream 2 project, increase lethal aid shipments to Kiev, and post ever-more US and NATO forces along Russia’s border. In the process, they amassed over 10,000 contacts with lawmakers, think tanks, and journalists. This is a staggering figure when one considers the Saudi lobby – one of the largest and most influential in the US – had just 2,834 interactions with these elements in the same timeframe. Lobbying activity on behalf of Kiev over 2022 will inevitably dwarf even that vast total. Now, the number of registered pro-Ukrainian agents in Washington stands at an unprecedented 24, with six being compelled to register in June alone. Strikingly too, many of these companies are providing their services free of charge – to the extent pro bono lobbying for Zelensky’s government has been dubbed the ‘hottest trend’ in Washington DC political circles. This phenomenon cannot be attributed to generosity of spirit, or altruism. Some lobbyists work for the Ukrainian government without remuneration for a positive PR boost, others to rehabilitate their reputations and remain in favor with US clients after enthusiastically representing Russian corporations prior to the February 24 invasion. As we shall see, there are potentially other, more spectral factors at work in some cases, too. It is likely many more firms are effectively representing Ukrainian interests than are officially recognized under FARA. Ridgely Walsh only registered in July, after Vox documented its work chaperoning two Ukrainian pilots around Washington, meeting with journalists, senators and representatives, and Defense and State Department representatives. It had been working for the Ukrainian government for over five months by that point. The FARA filing indicates that Ridgely Walsh engages directly with Yury Sak, adviser to Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov, and Lieutenant Colonel Denis Smazhny, and an appendix in the document sets out the terms of Ridgely Walsh’s work for Kiev. It states that the company “provides public relations and media relations support to Ukraine, including by engaging with US media representatives, government officials, NGOs, educational institutions, think tanks, investors, and foreign policy experts; arranging media interviews; developing and pitching op-eds; [and] organizing events.” The firm also creates “opportunities for Ukrainians to interact” with journalists, politicians, pundits, and “other sections of the US public.” These activities are provided “on a volunteer basis and without compensation,” and are “motivated by [the company’s] compassion for the Ukrainian people.” It adds that Ridgely Walsh’s team includes a Ukrainian national, a reference to its senior director, Veronika Velch. Velch’s background is colorful, to say the least. In 2013, she spent five months interning at the state-run Voice of America, an asset of US Agency for Global Media, which is funded and controlled by the US government, and openly avows that its output is directly influenced by Washington’s “national security interests.” After an unexplained seven-month gap in her CV, in May 2014, Velch joined the Center for United Actions, a Washington DC-based NGO “working for the benefit of Ukrainian citizens,” founded by Ukrainian politician and former KGB asset Oleg Ribachuk in 2009. It was one of many subversive efforts he bankrolled in the years leading up to the 2014 Maidan coup, which played a pivotal role in stirring up that insurrectionary upheaval. Two years prior, Ribachuk declared the 2004 Orange Revolution “was a miracle” – “we want to do that again, and think we will.” The constellation of troublemaking initiatives funded by Ribachuk also received significant financing from American oligarch Pierre Omidyar, and US intelligence agency fronts USAID and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which were fundamental to supporting the 2014 Maidan in Kiev. Writing in February 2014, veteran journalist Bob Parry noted that the NED had over the previous year funded 65 projects in Ukraine totaling over $20 million, amounting to “a shadow political structure of media and activist groups that could be deployed to stir up unrest when the Ukrainian government didn’t act as desired.” The National Democratic Institute, a division of the NED central to the Orange Revolution, also sponsored a campaign cofounded by Velch, ‘Follow the Money’, which battled for political campaign finance transparency in 2015-16. Tantalizingly, Ridgley Walsh’s FARA filing states that Velch “engaged with foreign policy and national security reporters in the US” regarding Ukrainians who traveled back to Kiev after February 24, while she was “outside the US” – in other words Ukraine – and coordinated directly with “US government officials and media” journeying to the country or covering the conflict. Clearly then, Velch and Ridgely Walsh have been crucial to shaping coverage of the war since it began. In this context, her professional history is important to consider – for one of the NED’s core objectives, and key successes, in the Maidan coup was presenting domestic and foreign audiences with a highly romantic narrative of the demonstrations in Ukraine, and their participants, which bore little relation to reality. Based on the output of NED-funded media outlets such as Hromadske, viewers would have been forgiven for concluding the protests were energized by concerns over human rights and democracy, and were representative of the entire Ukrainian population. In reality, as a February 2014 Washington Post op-ed exposed in forensic detail, polling data showed less than 20% of protesters were motivated by “violations of democracy or the threat of dictatorship,” only 40-45% of Ukrainians were in favor of European Union integration, soon-to-be deposed President Viktor Yanukovich remained “the most popular political figure in the country,” and no survey conducted by that time had ever indicated majority support for the uprising. Much of the public opposition to the government overthrow stemmed from the “anti-Russian rhetoric and the iconography of western Ukrainian nationalism,” which was widespread among demonstrators, “not [playing] well among the Ukrainian majority.” In all, 50% of Ukraine’s population resided in regions that “strongly identified with Russia” and had done so for over two centuries – “nearly all” of them were “alienated by anti-Russian rhetoric and symbols.” These crucial facts were otherwise hidden from view in the West at the time, and became ever-more suppressed in the months and years following Maidan, as the Ukrainian government waged all-out war on the residents of Donbass – the blood-spattered dimensions of which were barely mentioned in the media. A one-sided and utterly distorted view of events in Ukraine persists to this day, courtesy of Ridgely Walsh and its peers. With vanishingly rare exceptions, established news outlets have presented the conflict as a David and Goliath battle between unalloyed good and evil, and have unquestioningly reported extremely dubious official claims emanating from Washington and London about Ukraine’s endless heroism and triumphs on the battlefield. In fact, the vast majority of Western media coverage of the conflict has amounted to simply regurgitating Ukrainian statements, without any attempt at fact checking. Returning to the FARA filing, its last 20 pages consist of a table outlining almost 400 introductions to journalists and interviews and articles placed in media outlets arranged by Ridgely Walsh between the start of February and mid-July. Dozens of these entries are related to the aforementioned pilots, including multiple invitations for journalists to a private dinner with them in Washington. At that summit, one of the aviators is reported by Vox to have openly said: “Our main goal is self-explanatory. We’re meeting media and lawmakers in order to push the weapon flow to Ukraine.” The meal represented just one of many steps in a whirlwind tour of the US, which led to the pair being quoted widely in US media, including an appearance on CNN alongside rabidly pro-war actor Sean Penn. The aforementioned Lieutenant Colonel Denis Smazhny, an “aerial defense specialist,” also gave several interviews to various US news networks in late June, pleading for Kiev to be given fighter jets instead of drones, which the US had previously vetoed, due to major concerns about sensitive technology falling into Russian hands, and their use triggering a hostile counter-response from Moscow. In support of his entreaty, Smazhny alleged Kiev had destroyed 500 air-borne targets to date, and 150 Russian helicopters – a somewhat unbelievable claim, although it appears to have had quite an impact on US lawmakers. On July 15, Congress approved $100 million in funding to tutor Ukrainian pilots in manning American-made F-15 and F-16 fighter jets, despite it taking at least three months for pilots to be trained to an even a ‘basic’ level. Evidently, Washington and Kiev are preparing for a very long war indeed. And a vast army of lobbying firms are ready, willing, and able to make that happen, by deluging the media and legislative chambers the world over with eminently suspect narratives to maintain inexorable and ever-increasingly vast Western arms shipments to Kiev, despite prolongation of the crisis ensuring more death and destruction, mass starvation in the poorest reaches of the world, and possibly a global financial collapse."
2022-07-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/559675-ukraine-timoshenko-naftogaz-scam-century/,Ukraine's Timoshenko reveals ‘scam of the century’,"Ukraine’s state-owned Naftogaz gas company is supposedly running a massive embezzlement scheme as it seeks to get billions of dollars from the government for alleged gas purchases even though Ukraine presumably does not need additional gas for the winter, Yulia Timoshenko, an MP and the head of the ‘Fatherland’ party, claimed on Monday. According to Timoshenko, the lawmakers were about to pass several bills that would grant Naftogaz additional funding for gas purchases ahead of the winter. One of them would grant the company “compensation” from the budget that was worth 150 billion hryvnas ($4.08 billion) to purchase an additional six billion cubic meters of natural gas abroad. The government planned to use international financial aid provided to Ukraine by Western nations for that “compensation,” Timoshenko’s party wrote in a statement last week. According to Timoshenko herself, Naftogaz also sought to request another 150 billion hryvnas ($4.08 billion) from the budget to increase its authorized share capital and then use the money to buy the gas. Timoshenko, who also served as Ukraine’s prime minister between 2007 and 2010, also argued that this additional gas purchase for the upcoming winter heating season was not needed at all. According to the MP, Ukraine already produces and stores enough gas for the winter and might even get up to seven billion excessive cubic meters of gas during the upcoming heating season. On Monday, Timoshenko claimed that Naftogaz was still planning the “scam of the century” by embezzling up to 264 billion hryvnas ($7.18 billion) and “sending them to offshores.” She also called on the administration of President Volodymyr Zelensky to organize a meeting between his administration officials, MPs, and independent experts, as well as diplomats from the G7 nations to discuss the situation. “Could the president not be aware? Are you not aware of the ‘scam of the century’ that Naftogaz is currently implementing?” she wondered in her post. The lawmaker said that the Ukrainian MPs are set to discuss the relevant bills later in July. Last week, her party said it had blocked bills to supposedly prevent embezzlement by Naftogaz. RT could not independently verify Timoshenko’s claims related to the Naftogaz activities. Neither the Ukrainian presidential office nor the company itself have commented on the issue yet. Earlier on Tuesday, the Ukrainian media reported that Naftogaz creditors had rejected the company’s request for a two-year debt payment freeze. Naftogaz made the proposal earlier this month, citing “significant economic and business decline in Ukraine” caused by the ongoing conflict with Russia. Naftogaz is Ukraine’s largest state-owned oil and gas company and a major source of income, accounting for almost 17% of the country’s total state budget revenue last year."
2022-07-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/559662-ukraine-plane-hijacking-peskov/,Kremlin praises foiling of Ukrainian hijack plot,"Federal Security Service (FSB) officers deserve ‘top marks’ for uncovering and foiling a Ukrainian plot to hijack Russian warplanes, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. “Obviously, it’s a very effective job by our counterintelligence,” Peskov said on Tuesday when asked about the operation by the FSB. “That’s why it’s being evaluated so highly – it gets top marks,” he added. The FSB announced on Monday that it had foiled a sophisticated plot by Ukrainian spies – acting under NATO supervision – to hijack several jets from the Russian military. One of the leading figures in the US-government-funded investigative organization Bellingcat, Christo Grozev, was also involved in the scheme, which was aimed at bribing several Russian pilots. The airmen were promised up to $2 million, EU passports, and a comfortable life in the West for flying their planes to Ukraine. According to one of the soures, who talked to RT, Kiev was especially interested in Su-34 fighter-bombers and Tu-22M3 strategic aircraft. However, the officers weren’t tempted by the Ukrainian offer, tipping off Russian intelligence instead. The FSB operation kept the state-of-the-art aircraft safe and revealed the names of the Kiev spies and their curators, but, according to the pilot, the Ukrainians “believed in the possibility of organizing the hijacking so much they revealed the layout of their defense systems, altitude maps, and lots of other useful information to us.” This data was later used by the Russian military during its operation in Ukraine, he added."
2022-07-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/559661-coordination-center-ukraine-grain/,Ukrainian grain center launched in Turkey – Moscow,"The Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul which was established as part of the deal to resume grain exports from Ukraine, has started operations, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said on Tuesday. Moscow’s delegation is due to arrive in the Turkish city to take part in a four-way format that comprises Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Nations. The Russian group of experts is headed by Rear Admiral Eduard Luik, the ministry said. “The main task of Russian specialists in the JCC will be to promptly resolve all necessary issues for the initiative to reach the stage of practical implementation,” it noted. The Russian representatives are set to start working after Russia and Ukraine signed a UN- and Turkey-brokered deal last week to unblock much-awaited grain exports from the nation. Under this agreement, the Joint Coordination Centre in Istanbul will oversee shipments from Ukraine to elsewhere and maintain safe transit routes for these shipments across the Black Sea. Russia and the United Nations also signed a memorandum providing for the UN’s involvement in lifting international sanctions on the export of Russian grain and fertilizers to world markets. At the time, the deal was touted by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres as “a beacon of relief in a world that needs it more than ever.” He also thanked Kiev and Moscow for “putting aside [their] differences” in a move that can potentially alleviate the food crisis in developing countries. The agreement, however, soon came under question after Russia conducted a strike on the Ukrainian port city of Odessa on Saturday, saying that it had destroyed “a docked Ukrainian warship and a warehouse of Harpoon anti-ship missiles, supplied by the US to the Kiev regime.” The strike was decried by both Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky and Antonio Guterres. The latter said at the time that “the full implementation [of the deal] by Russia, Ukraine and Turkey is imperative” in order to ease the suffering of millions of people in need around the globe. Following the attack, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov pointed out that the strike did not violate the deal because “Russia did not assume any obligations that would prevent the continuation of the special military operation and the destruction of military infrastructure.” He also noted that “the grain terminal in Odessa is located at a considerable distance from military facilities.” Wheat deliveries from Ukraine, a major producer of the commodity, were disrupted after Russia launched its military operation in the neighboring state in late February. Kiev and some Western officials previously accused Russia of deliberately preventing the shipments, but Moscow repeatedly insisted that Ukraine made these impossible by laying naval mines in the waterways around the ports."
2022-07-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/559653-poland-ukraine-mercenaries-russia-strike/,Polish mercenaries killed by Russian missile strike – Moscow,"More than 40 foreign mercenaries, most of whom were Polish citizens, have been killed by a missile strike in Donbass, Russia’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Tuesday. They add to a growing list of foreign combatants who have lost their lives fighting for Ukraine. High-precision air-based missiles struck a temporary deployment point of Ukraine’s International Legion units near Konstantinovka in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), and “took out over 40 foreign mercenaries, most of them Poles,” the ministry said in a statement. Last week, Russia said its armed forces had killed up to 250 soldiers of fortune in the same settlement, destroying a number of military vehicles. The Russian military also carried out an air raid on positions of the Ukrainian Army’s 72nd Mechanized Brigade in the DPR village of Zaitsevo, taking out more than 70 “nationalists” and one ammunition depot. The Defense Ministry reported that high-precision strikes near the city of Nikolayev in southern Ukraine had destroyed one artillery battalion of the 59th Ukrainian Motorized Infantry Brigade. The brigade sustained losses of more than 70% of its personnel and military equipment, according to the ministry's briefing. Kiev’s international military unit was created in late February at the request of President Vladimir Zelensky, and is officially known as the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine. According to data from the Russian Defense Ministry, as of June 17, 6,956 foreign citizens from 64 countries have arrived in Ukraine to fight for the country since Russia attacked on February 24. Some 1,956 of those have been killed, while 1,779 have left the country, the ministry said at the time. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/559648-ukraine-morale-militray-draft/,Ukraine’s military morale in decline – NYT,"Kiev’s “secretive and arbitrary” military recruitment, which leads to the drafting of soldiers who are unwilling to serve, is affecting the morale of the Ukrainian troops fighting against Russia, the New York Times has reported. There are “signs, five grueling months into the war, that the sense of unity is fraying at the edges” within the Ukrainian military, the paper pointed out in a report on Monday. Some soldiers are unhappy that they have done “long, hard service,” while many others managed to stay away from service, it said. “There is no one to replace us. There are too few people. It’s very hard for the guys, psychologically,” a Ukrainian soldier, who’d spent months fighting, commented. There is also “disillusionment” among Kiev’s troops with the country’s draft system, which “turns away some who want to fight [due to bureaucratic reasons], while taking in others who are unwilling and unqualified,” the NYT reports. Some Ukrainian commanders have been complaining that “summoning men unwilling to serve is lowering morale among those who volunteered,” it added. The paper recalled how, in June, Kiev police announced that they had raided two nightclubs in the capital over violating a curfew, and handed a summons for service to more than 200 male partygoers. This angered Valery Markus, a senior sergeant of the 47th Armed Forces Battalion, who wrote on Facebook that he was “outraged” because the military profession is “being reduced to the level of punishment for these scumbags.” In his post, Markus slammed Ukraine’s “chaotic” draft system, arguing that poorly trained and unmotivated recruits are endangering the lives of other troops. He also recalled cases of alcoholism and other troubling issues among the newly arrived soldiers. The Ukrainian government, which has barred all men aged between 18 and 60 from leaving the country, has been undertaking a massive recruitment drive amid the conflict with Russia. Among other things, it includes recruiters handing out draft notices in the streets and other public places. The authorities claim that only those who are willing to join the military are being summoned, but witnesses report that, in many instances, this is not the case. The large-scale draft is “drawing accusations that it is secretive and arbitrary, that it violates the government’s own rules,” the NYT wrote, adding that it also “led to a cat-and-mouse game between recruiters and men trying to avoid them.” Almost 27,000 have already signed a petition on the Ukrainian president’s website, calling on Vladimir Zelensky to outlaw issuing summonses in public places and to establish a transparent process through which service personnel might be called up. In a report in late June, RT detailed how Kiev is sending people to the front without proper medical checkups and having given them only a few days of the most basic training. The ranks of the Ukrainian military, the report explained, are being replenished not only with those unfit to serve but also with convicts being released from prisons. It also revealed that groups are being created by Ukrainians on social media to share the locations of recruiters in real time, so that those trying to avoid them could do so. The NYT article also mentioned such groups. Some are unwilling to fight due to the high Ukrainian losses which, according to NYT, “peaked this spring at 100 killed and almost 400 wounded daily,” but others become draft dodgers for political reasons."
2022-07-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/558490-liberal-world-order-explained/,What is this ‘rules-based international order’ that Western elites keep talking about?,"US President Joe Biden has beaten the drum that Americans will have to pay high prices for energy for “as long as it takes” to stick it to Russia in Ukraine. A couple of months ago, when one of Biden’s advisors, Brian Deese, was quizzed about the president’s response to the price hikes on CNN, he replied: “This is about the future of the liberal world order and we have to stand firm."" In 2016, then Vice-President Joe Biden said to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during a visit to Ottawa: “The world is going to spend a lot of time looking to you Mr. Prime Minister as we see more and more challenges to the liberal international order than any time since the end of World War Two.” French President Emmanuel Macron invoked a similar concept of fighting to maintain a certain “world order” during his press conference at the conclusion of the G7 Summit this June in Germany, when he said that the Russia-Ukraine conflict upsets the principles of international rules that have been established since 1945. Macron didn’t elaborate, but that was the year the United Nations was created and France was given a permanent seat on its security council alongside the US, Russia, the UK, and China. Also in June, when European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visited New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, both leaders issued a joint statement that “reaffirmed New Zealand's and the European Union's strong commitment to multilateralism and the rules based international order.” So, what exactly is this “world order”? Why can’t Western officials stop evoking it? And what does the conflict in Ukraine have to do with it? In short, it’s a vision of a world that’s Western-led with dominant classic Western values of economic and trade freedom serving as a foothold for spreading political freedom to the ultimate benefit of the average citizen. At least in theory. The reality is much more complicated. All too often, the spreading of freedom hasn’t been free — at least for the average person. Military interventions or covert political interference are typically used to upend unwanted systems so that a compliant leadership can be installed that will primarily serve the economic and political interests of Western elites. The concern for the people and their personal economic situation generally ends there, even if they end up worse off than before, as is often the case. The “world order” has also historically implied an unequal East-West bipolarity, with the West historically seen as dominant. So why are Western elites so worried about the state of all of this now? Well, let’s face it — the sands are shifting. And it has been a long time coming. More people are starting to question the benefit to the average person of military interventions sold under the guise of spreading of freedom and democracy. Instead, they’re exploiting globalization and economic liberalism by living, working, or selling abroad. They’re doing so using the technological tools initially funded and created by Western governments for the purpose of global mercantilism and Big Brother surveillance. With the growing independence of the average person comes an increased distaste for big government interference. Their independence also allows for a more clear-eyed view of the not-so-invisible hand of the state and the mess that it has made in recent years under the control of Western establishment elites who can seem almost comically detached from everyday priorities and realities. The conflict in Ukraine risks creating the ultimate nightmare for Western elites: an alternative group of allies over which the West has no control, but which has the capacity to offer citizens of the world economic opportunities that are competitive with what their own governments or countries are offering. Or as former CIA director and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently told a Washington think-tank: “By aiding Ukraine, we undermined the creation of a Russian-Chinese axis bent on exerting military and economic hegemony in Europe.” Events in Ukraine and the Western sanctions resulting from it are serving to catalyze the development and implementation of a parallel Eastern or South-Eastern offer with alternative systems and structures. The result is even greater freedom of choice for the average Western citizen who can even further lessen their reliance on their own government. Good luck trying to sell or leverage the conventional “us versus them” concept that underpins the old world order to citizens who are enjoying the benefits of access to “them”. As Western governments lose control, they’re cracking down on those who advocate in favor of greater sovereignty and independence — two concepts which the elites love to invoke for manipulative purposes but see almost as dirty words when coming from the mouths of actual people seeking to assert their own rights. The rise of populism is also a symptom of the problem that Western governments created for themselves by failing to reverse course on their own systemic corruption and increasingly authoritarian tendencies. Western elites are doubling down in Ukraine to save the world order that protects their own selfish interests, thinking that it’s the way to prevent a parallel option from emerging. It’s as simple as that. And they don’t care if it’s the average citizen who has to pay the price."
2022-07-26,https://www.rt.com/news/559651-israel-russia-stance-unconstructive/,Russia issues rebuke to Israel,"Moscow considers Israel’s anti-Russian stance on the Ukrainian conflict regrettable, according to Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. During a TV talk show appearance on Tuesday, she noted that West Jerusalem’s recent rhetoric was “absolutely unconstructive” and “unobjective.” Relations between Russia and Israel have soured since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, and Zakharova drew attention to the fact that this “did not happen by itself.” “In recent months we have heard absolutely unconstructive and, most importantly, biased rhetoric from Tel Aviv,” Zakharova stated. She noted that anti-Russian assessments coming from various levels of authority in Israel raised serious questions in Moscow, especially since they were being framed in an exclusively pro-Ukrainian manner. “And this was not in terms of supporting the Ukrainian people, but only in support of the Kiev regime,” the diplomat noted, adding that the rhetoric was “absolutely in tune with the strange and wild voice of the West.” Zakharova also emphasized that the “impulse” to complicate bilateral relations with Israel did not come from Russia. “When we now hear comments from the leadership of this country that some of Russia’s actions on the bilateral track may affect relations, I would like to ask if these same people do not think that their actions and statements over these months have already affected bilateral relations,” she said. The spokeswoman’s statements come after Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid ordered his country’s foreign ministry to prepare a set of reactionary measures in the event of the Russian branch of the Jewish Agency being shut down. The prime minister warned on Sunday that the closure of the quasi-governmental agency, which promotes the immigration of people with Jewish heritage to Israel, would have a “grave” impact on ties between Moscow and West Jerusalem. In the Tuesday interview, Zakharova stated that the fate of the organization in Russia was in the hands of Russia’s justice ministry and was solely a matter of law. Last week, a Moscow court said it had received a formal request from the Justice Ministry to liquidate the Russian branch of the agency, citing alleged violations of local laws related to data storage and protection. A pretrial hearing on the case is set to be held on Thursday. The Kremlin has also insisted that the situation around the Jewish Agency was a matter of law and has warned against politicizing the issue. “Indeed, there are questions for the Jewish Agency regarding adherence to Russian laws. But this situation should not be politicized or projected onto the entirety of Russian-Israeli relations,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Relations between Moscow and West Jerusalem have considerably worsened since Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February. Israel has condemned the operation as a “breach of international law,” however it has so far refrained from joining international sanctions against Moscow. It has also only sent humanitarian assistance and non-lethal aid to Ukraine, unlike other backers that have supplied Kiev with weapons."
2022-07-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/559652-space-station-quit-timeframe/,Russia to quit International Space Station after 2024,"Russia will withdraw from the International Space Station (ISS) project with the West after 2024, the new head of the country’s space agency Roscosmos, Yury Borisov, said on Tuesday. Moscow intends to fulfill all its obligations to foreign partners as part of the ISS project, but “the decision to withdraw from this station after 2024 has been made,” Borisov told President Vladimir Putin during a meeting at the Kremlin. “I think, by that time, we’ll start putting together a Russian orbital station,” the space boss added. According to Borisov’s vision, Russia’s manned space flights should form part of a systematic scientific program, so that each mission would provide the country with new knowledge. The previous head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, had predicted that the ISS, which NASA plans to operate until 2030, would “fall apart” by that time unless “huge amounts of money” are invested in its repair. But efforts to keep the station in orbit are no longer effective for Russia due to the current geopolitical environment, he pointed out. Borisov also acknowledged in April that the Russian station modules have exhausted their lifespans. The ISS was launched in 1998 as a joint effort by Russian, American, Japanese, Canadian and European space agencies. It’s divided into Russian and American sections, with the latter being run by the US and other participants of the project. Roscosmos had earlier shared the sketches of its replacement for the ISS, the Russian Orbital Service Station (ROSS). It’s planned to make the station automated, with the cosmonauts only arriving there to service and replace the equipment. ROSS will consist of four modules and a spacecraft-maintenance platform. It’s being designed to host a crew of two to four people."
2022-07-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/559640-bryansk-drone-attack-ukraine/,Ukrainian drone strikes Russian border checkpoint – governor,"A Ukrainian drone dropped an explosive device onto a border checkpoint in Russia’s Bryansk Region on Tuesday, according to the local governor. Four people were wounded in the attack, with one of them later dying of his injuries in hospital, Aleksandr Bogomaz said. The wounds of the other victims have been described as moderate and light. The Troebortnoye checkpoint was hit by a quadcopter UAV, with its bomb striking a warehouse building, the governor wrote on Telegram. The same checkpoint had already been targeted with mortar attacks by the Ukrainian forces in April and May. In late June, two Ukrainian kamikaze drones smashed into an oil refinery in southern Russia’s Rostov Region, damaging the facility and causing a large fire. Since the start of Moscow’s military offensive in Ukraine, Kiev’s forces have carried out numerous strikes on settlements and border checkpoints in Russia’s Bryansk and Belgorod Regions. The attacks, which mainly involved drones and mortars, have hit both infrastructure and residential areas, resulting in destruction, injuries, and several civilian deaths."
2022-07-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/559628-bellingcat-ukraine-warplanes-plot/,Bellingcat confirms involvement in Ukrainian plot to steal Russian jets,"Christo Grozev, self-styled ‘lead Russia investigator’ with Bellingcat, confirmed on Monday his involvement in a Ukrainian intelligence plot to incite Russian military pilots to defect and hijack their planes. The senior member of the controversial Western-funded group, however, challenged the story told by the Russian side. Russia’s Security Service (FSB) has presented “a traditional mix of forged ‘evidence’ and loosely interpreted facts” on the affair, Grozev claimed, rejecting allegations of being directly involved in the plot. According to a middleman detained by Russian intelligence, he had been receiving orders directly from Grozev on how to deliver cash to the pilots in exchange for videos proving they actually have access to warplanes. “What is true, however, is I was involved in this crazier-than-fiction story of triple-agents, fake passports and faux girlfriends – as a documentary film maker,” he said, in a lengthy Twitter thread about the matter. Grozev did not, however, directly address the claims made against him by the detained suspect. “Grozev… did not actually explain anything to me, he just told me the name of the courier who would deliver the money by train,” the suspect claimed. Grozev also insisted the whole affair ultimately became a “serious blunder” for Russian intelligence rather than a success. He claimed that the intelligence has disclosed “unintentionally [the] identities of dozens of counter intel officers, their methods of operation, and their undercover assets.” One of the pilots, for instance, abruptly decided to flee Russia with his alleged “lover” instead of his wife, immediately raising suspicion of the team. Primarily, the alleged “lover” was deemed being “waaay too hot” for the pilot, while her phone contacts suggested she was in touch with FSB counter intelligence officers, according to Grozev. The whole operation ultimately devolved into the two parties feeding each other misinformation on air defenses, flight paths, altitude corridors and so on. “This bizarre mutual-deceipt (sic) game came to an end when the FSB realized no one will show up at any of the suggested meet-ups (FSB were keen to identify Ukrainian agents), realizing they’ve been burned. And the Ukrainians realized they're likely not getting a real pilot either,” Grozev wrote. He also claimed that the operation was staged by “maverick ex operatives” and not active Ukrainian intelligence services. “If it were, there’d be no way we would – or want to – get access to it,” he stressed. Bellingcat just “found out about the initiative” taken by the supposedly independent “operatives” it knew from before and “assured ourselves a front seat,” Grozev explained. He also strongly denied the involvement of any Western intelligence agencies in the plot, elegantly dismissing such allegations as “unadulterated bollocks.” Russia has repeatedly questioned the independence and credibility of Bellingcat. Despite advertising itself as an investigative group specializing in fact-checking and open-source intelligence, with both professional and citizen journalists contributing, it has been receiving state funding from multiple Western states. The group was labeled “undesirable” in Russia earlier in July, with the designation effectively prohibiting any operations in the country for it. Last year, Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) chief Sergey Naryshkin squarely accused Bellingcat of working closely with Western intelligence services with the sole goal to “put pressure on either [Russia] or on individuals and entities.” “They use dishonest methods. And the information that is used in such cases is false, unverified, it has its own goals… They are ready to perform any task, because they do it for money, not objectively,” Naryshkin asserted."
2022-07-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/559447-zelensky-ignoring-critical-issue/,"Maksim Artemyev: Public opinion seems to be turning against the military draft in Ukraine, how will the Zelensky regime respond?","Five months into Russia's military offensive in Ukraine many in the latter state are starting to vocalise their objection to the draft imposed by the regime in Kiev. Especially as the propaganda about victory, any day now, starts to lose its power. Popular Ukrainian blogger and activist Yury Kasyanov recently made a post on his Facebook page, in which he complained: “Let’s stop the mobilization, open the borders, and dissolve all the military recruitment offices... Let the professionals do the fighting – after all, they get paid for it – and let the volunteers join in, because they want to fight. But I am an untrained civilian, unfit for war, I’m going to get myself killed. And I pay my taxes, too!” With this provocative post, Kasyanov intended to spark a discussion about mandatory conscription in Ukraine. But the results of the debate came as a shock to the blogger: “Judging by the comments on the previous post, nine out of ten Ukrainians have no intention to fight; they oppose nationwide mobilization, as well as the ban on men leaving the country.” It should be noted that Kasyanov’s followers, like himself, are fierce supporters of the idea that Ukraine must fight Russia to the bitter end. And yet, even among them, the vast majority have no desire to die for the glory of Ukraine. Modern civilization is built on a very self-conscious attitude toward one’s health. The first thing you see when you go online are banner ads that read ‘10 Warning Signs That You Have Cancer’ or ‘How to Relieve Joint Pain’, etc. Other core values include bodily integrity, the right to privacy, and of course, everyday comfort and convenience. None of these go together well with the squalid realities of the front line. One might say that the whole ethos of war stands in opposition to the values of today's society. Ukraine is a country largely populated by one or two-child families. How many of its citizens would voluntarily go to war to be killed or crippled? It should come as no surprise, therefore, that Ukrainians do not want to go to war. Yes, if you listen to what they say, the majority of Ukrainians are patriots. But when it comes to getting up from the couch and actually going to the front, very few are willing to ‘walk the talk’. And I don’t imagine that, after 30,000 more Ukrainian soldiers have perished on the battlefield, anyone would feel more motivated to join the cause. In fact, it would likely produce the opposite effect: ‘I don’t want to die like all the others’. It is much safer to engage in fiery debates on social media from home, or to follow the fighting on YouTube. What’s more, Ukraine is going through a demographic crisis with its population shrinking from 52 million in 1991 to barely more than 30 million, even before the conflict erupted in February. The situation is so bad that the state has avoided holding a census for over two decades. I read Ukrainian mass and social media daily, which is heavily censored by the regime in Kiev. It's output is rather different from the reality on the ground. The internet is flooded with videos of Ukrainian soldiers refusing to fight, complaining that their fleeing commanders are throwing them at tanks as cannon fodder – without any equipment or training. There are hundreds of these videos and new ones are uploaded every day. They are shot by Ukrainians in military fatigues, not Russian state media. Also, the number of videos showing Ukrainian women refusing to let their men be taken by the police or recruiters is also growing. Despite this, the Ukrainian media and elite bloggers avoid commenting on this. They, of course, want to silence a phenomenon which is key to understanding what is happening to the country. Over the course of numerous addresses to his people, not once has President Vladimir Zelensky mentioned the countless instances of soldiers refusing to obey orders, which is mostly the case with mobilized men and volunteers on the front line who thought they were going to serve near their home areas. The reasoning is often that they are not willing to risk their lives so that Russian won't become a second official language, or Kiev can become a formal ally of the US. The price is too high for what is at stake. There is little wonder why Ukrainian media pretends the issue doesn’t exist. The mere acknowledgement of the fact that so many soldiers are discontented would shatter the carefully constructed image of a nation united in selfless patriotism. The gag order from the Ukrainian government preventing publication of any data on the army’s losses – unquestioned by Western media – is no accident either. The authorities prefer to keep their people in the dark when it comes to the number of those who have already been killed. This policy has been fruitful so far. The May and June polls by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology and NORC at the University of Chicago commissioned by the Wall Street Journal indicate that 90% of the population in Kiev-controlled territory trust the Ukrainian Army, and 85% trust Zelensky, who has banned the real opposition. Curiously enough, while 89% of the respondents voted against ceding any territory, only 66% said they believe that Ukraine can reclaim the territories already lost. All of this provides a clear answer as to why Kiev is actively recruiting foreign mercenaries. Since they are better motivated than Ukraine’s own recruits, they can be deployed to the more dangerous zones. It’s possible that the regime's main problem is that it does not know how to deal with the fact that citizens en masse are trying to avoid being drafted and sent to the front lines. The official ban for all male citizens between 18 and 60 years old to leave the country is itself indicative of Zelensky's line of reasoning that those who are allowed to exit would hardly want to come back and fight. It doesn’t provide a solution though. Instead, it increasingly demotivates people. Military enlistment offices are extremely disorganized. Recruitment campaigns are run in the streets, shopping malls, and even on public beaches. Recruiters have also been reported using their power to draft eligible males as leverage against them or a means of revenge or punishment. This again shows that many perceive the prospect of joining the army to protect the homeland as undesirable rather than an honor. It’s not impossible that in the absence of civilian jobs with a decent paycheck, many will volunteer to join the forces just to feed themselves and their families. However, the budget is not big enough to fill the gaps with volunteers. A certain number of recruits will have to be drafted. It remains unclear how Kiev plans to tackle this pressing issue, when so many seem to feel the cause is not worth risking their own lives for."
2022-07-25,https://www.rt.com/news/559608-himars-tochka-ukraine-budanov/,Ukraine eyes American replacement for Soviet missiles,"Kiev sees US-made HIMARS multiple rocket launchers as the best substitute for its Soviet-era Tochka-U missile systems, the head of intelligence at Ukraine’s Defense Ministry, Kirill Budanov has said. During an interview with the Washington Post on Sunday, Budanov pointed out that the Tochka-U currently remained the longest-range option in the Ukrainian military's arsenal. However, he complained that “very few of them are left” after five months of fighting with Russia. Tochka-U (NATO name ‘SS-21 Scarab’) is a tactical ballistic missile platform, which has been around since the 1970s. It carries a single missile and has a range of 120 kilometers (75 miles). According to the Russian military, Kiev had some 40 Tochka-U launchers at the beginning of the conflict with Moscow. But now the Ukrainian forces have HIMARS, which had been supplied to Kiev by the Americans, and “we’ll fight with these,” the intelligence chief said. As of July 22, Kiev had received 16 high-mobility multiple rocket launchers from Washington. The HIMARS that have been provided have a range of 85 kilometers (53 miles). But the system can also be fitted with the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) munition, which make it capable of hitting targets up to 300 kilometers (almost 186 miles) away. So far, the Biden administration has been reluctant to supply the Ukrainian military with ATACMS over concerns that they could be used for attacks on Russian territory, further escalating the conflict. “If we get the longer-range [munitions for HIMARS], we’ll use those. And the Russians know that either way, it’s the end for them with these weapons,” Budanov insisted. He also rejected Moscow’s claims that between July 5 and 20 its forces had blown up four of the US-supplied launchers in Ukraine. “We haven’t lost a single HIMARS, despite what the Russians have claimed,” he said. On Monday, Russia’s Defense Ministry also announced that it had destroyed a stockpile of ammunition for HIMARS and American-made M777 howitzers in western Ukraine. During a visit to Kiev at the weekend, the head of the Armed Forces Committee of the US House of Representatives, Adam Smith, said that America and its allies plan to provide Ukraine with an additional 25-to-30 rocket systems, including both high-mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS). However, even those supplies are unlikely to satisfy Kiev’s demands. Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov said last month that the country’s military would require 50 HIMARS to organize an effective defense, and a least 100 for “an effective counteroffensive.”"
2022-07-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/559617-russian-passport-ukraine-jail/,Seeking Russian passport could mean jail for Ukrainians,"Ukraine is seeking to introduce heavy penalties for receiving Russian citizenship. A bill that is currently being considered by Kiev proposes fines and lengthy prison terms for doing so, Deputy Minister for the Re-integration of Temporarily Occupied Territories Anatoly Stelmakh revealed on Monday. “Considering the legislation we’re currently working on, some of its articles introduce penalties … ranging from a fine to 15 years in prison,” Stelmakh said on Ukrainian TV. The idea of criminalizing obtaining Russian citizenship was backed by Ukrainian Deputy PM and Minister for the Re-integration of Temporarily Occupied Territories Irina Vereschuk. The official openly admitted the legislation was driven more by political rather than legal motives. “On the one hand, the occupant’s passport helps common folk survive during the occupation. On the other hand, how could we explain that to our citizens, who are fighting to the death at the frontline? Including the fact that Russian passports will never be on our land,” she said in a Telegram post on Friday. Early in June, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree granting all Ukrainians the right to apply for Russian citizenship under a simplified procedure. By doing so, he extended the simplified procedures that had previously been rolled out for citizens of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics as well as residents of Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, which are largely controlled by Russian forces. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/559606-lavrov-grain-deal-operation/,Grain deal won’t affect offensive in Ukraine – Moscow,"The recently signed deal to unblock grain exports from Ukraine doesn't forbid Moscow from destroying military infrastructure in the country, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday. “Under the grain deal, Russia did not assume any obligations that would prevent the continuation of the special military operation and the destruction of military infrastructure,” Lavrov said, referring to the missile strike conducted by Russian forces on Saturday in the port city of Odessa. “The grain terminal in Odessa is located at a considerable distance from military facilities,” the top diplomat noted, adding that Russia did not create any obstacles for the export of grain. He also mentioned that, as a result of Russia’s strike, US-supplied Harpoon anti-ship systems located in the city no longer posed a threat to Russian forces. On Friday, representatives of Russia, Ukraine, the UN, and Turkey signed a deal to unblock exports of grain, food, and fertilizers from Ukrainian ports. The deal also included a memorandum providing for the UN’s involvement in lifting international sanctions on the export of Russian grain and fertilizers to world markets. One day after the agreement was signed, Kiev claimed that Russia had launched at least four cruise missiles, allegedly targeting grain silos in the port of Odessa. Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky described the strike as “barbarism” and insisted “Russian Kalibr missiles destroyed the very possibility of statements” on the need for dialogue and any agreements with Moscow. Moscow has denied targeting port infrastructure and insists that the strike was carried out against a docked Ukrainian warship and a warehouse of US-supplied Harpoon anti-ship missiles. Russian Defense Ministry officials also reported that the strike crippled a Ukrainian navy repair facility."
2022-07-25,https://www.rt.com/news/559593-ukraine-himars-m777-strike/,Missiles for US-made HIMARS destroyed – Moscow,"Moscow has destroyed US-supplied weapons, including heavy artillery, during a strike on Sunday in western Ukraine, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Storage facilities containing missiles for HIMARS multiple rocket launchers and shells for M777 howitzers were targeted, the ministry announced on Monday. A shipment station outside Bogdanovtsy village, which hosted the munitions, was hit with “sea-based high-precision long-range weapons,” it added. The US is Kiev’s biggest backer in its conflict with Moscow and has supplied Ukraine with 16 HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, as of July 22. Last week, the Russian military said that it had destroyed four of those systems between July 5 and 20. However, Ukraine refuted these claims as “misinformation.” The head of the Armed Forces Committee of the US House of Representatives, Adam Smith, who visited Kiev during the weekend, said that Washington and its allies plan to provide Ukraine with an additional 25-to-30 rocket systems, including both high-mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS).

2022-07-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/559591-ukraine-crimes-bastrykin-shelling/,Russia accuses Ukrainian troops of war crimes,"Preliminary probes have found that more than 200 members of the Ukrainian military have been involved in “crimes against the peace and security of mankind,” the head of Russia’s Investigative Committee said on Monday. A total of 92 commanders and subordinates have already been charged with the offenses, he revealed. More than 1,300 criminal cases, involving over 400 individuals, have been launched over violations committed by the Ukrainian side since the start of Russia’s military operation on February 24, Alexander Bastrykin told newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta. According to the Investigative Committee chief, it had already been established that more than 220 suspects, “including representatives of the high command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and commanders of military units which fired at civilians, had been involved in crimes against the peace and security of mankind, which don’t have a statute of limitations.” Charges have been filed against 92 Ukrainian commanders and subordinates to date, with 96 suspects being placed on the wanted list, he added. “There can be no justification for the use of force by the Ukrainian nationalists,” Bastrykin insisted. “They are intensively shelling the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. They brutally and cynically target peaceful citizens, civilian infrastructure, including children’s institutions.” He also accused the Ukrainian forces of having struck their own territory “in order to blame the Russian military for this.” During the conflict, Moscow has insisted that its troops never target civilians, only striking Ukrainian forces and military infrastructure. More than 7,000 civilian facilities have been destroyed in attacks by the Ukrainian side, including homes, schools and kindergartens, with over 91,000 people being designated as victims, the Investigative Committee chief said. Сriminal cases have also been launched against citizens of the UK, the US, Canada, Georgia and the Netherlands for their involvement in the conflict as mercenaries, while Ukrainian nationalist units have been accused of torturing Russian POWs, attacking Russian embassies in foreign countries, and other acts, he said. “It’s paramount to keep objectively informing the international community about what has been happening [in Ukraine] in recent months,” Bastrykin insisted."
2022-07-25,https://www.rt.com/news/559586-lavrov-photos-egypt-west/,Russia reveals Western attempts to censor photo-ops,"Western countries have tried to bar Arab officials from photo opportunities with Russian counterparts, the Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during a visit to Egypt on Sunday. Lavrov revealed that before heading to Cairo he was shown a document from the Arab League, which has its HQ in the Egyptian capital, speaking about “an initiative … by a group of ambassadors from the US, France, Germany, the UK and a representative of the EU.” “It demanded our Arab friends, firstly condemn, secondly, reject certain actions by Russia. And this initiative especially stressed that they shouldn’t sign any documents with us and take pictures with us,” the Russian FM pointed out after talks with his Egyptian colleague, Sameh Shoukry. He also recalled how German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock recently described a photo of Turkish Presidet Recep Tayyip Erdogan with his Russian and Iranian counterparts Vladimir Putin and Ebrahim Raisi as a “challenge.” Baerbock added that such an image was “incomprehensible” to her. “They have an obsession with those photos,” Lavrov said of the West. “This is not an issue from the sphere of diplomacy; it’s a different branch of studying the human nature,” he added. Later in the day, the Russian FM met with the Secretary General of the Arab League Ahmed Aboul Gheit, telling photographers: “Guys, I’ve heard you shouldn’t take pictures of me.” The remark prompted laughter in the room, according to Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, who shared the moment on her Telegram channel. Zakharova advised the photographers to send their pictures straight to the US State Department, which she said is especially concerned that Moscow could use the images for propaganda purposes. “They may use them themselves,” she added."
2022-07-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/559528-fsb-ukraine-spies-hijack-warplanes/,Ukrainian plot to hijack Russian warplanes exposed by Moscow,"Russian intelligence has claimed that it foiled a sophisticated plot from Ukrainian spies to hijack several military jets. A security official official and a pilot, who is said to have been targeted by Kiev's agents, have shared details of the operation with RT. Russia's Federal Security Service (the FSB) has sensationally added that a leading figure from the US-government funded investigative organization Bellingcat – which presents itself as a journalistic grouping – was also involved in the scheme, which it believes was ""supervised by NATO intelligence agencies."" The FSB specifically pointed the finger at British operatives. It explained that Russian pilots were promised passports from EU members states, and substantial cash rewards in order to participate in the plot. Early in the ongoing conflict, the Ukrainians compiled a list of Russian military hardware, using publicly available information. They promised monetary rewards for potential defectors who managed to bring the equipment with them. The more elaborate the weapons were, the better the rewards that were promised, with warplanes, helicopters and tanks fetching the top payment of up to $1 million. When the public call for defectors fell flat, Ukraine’s security service targeted individual Russian servicemen – pilots in particular – directly. They apparently traced and identified the airmen through the digital trail they left online, an operative with the Russian Security Service (the FSB) told RT TV reporter Maria Finoshina. Kiev appeared to be specifically interested in Russian Su-34 fighter-bombers and Tu-22M3 strategic aircraft, according to the source. A Su-34 pilot targeted in the plot told RT that he was initially reluctant to speak with the Ukrainian spies, believing the promise of $1 million for stealing warplanes and defecting to Kiev to be a prank. After realizing his interlocutors were serious about the proposal, he tipped off Russian intelligence, which then monitored subsequent conversations. “Initially, of course, I took it as a joke, but after a period of talking it became clear that I was dealing with representatives of the Ukrainian intelligence service and their Western partners,” the pilot said. “Also, I was supposed to get passports of European states and a comfortable life abroad was promised.” Kiev's intelligence operatives apparently believed the Russian pilots who they contacted were ready to commit treason and hijack their own warplanes, putting them in touch with a Ukrainian pilot to discuss technical details. “They believed so much in the possibility of organizing the hijacking that they revealed the layout of their defense systems, altitude maps, and lots of other useful information to us,” the Russian airman said, adding that the information obtained from the Ukrainians was used during the military operation. To prove that the pilots were actually able to pull off the hijacking and had access to the specific warplanes, Ukrainian intelligence demanded video proof from them. The pilots were paid between $4,000 and $7,000 per video, which showed them getting into the planes while holding pieces of paper with specific numbers. Since most financial transactions between Russia and foreign countries has been heavily restricted under Western sanctions, the pilots were to be paid in cash through an elaborate network of couriers. The FSB says it has detained the man who had allegedly hired the couriers to deliver the money, and the suspect made a rather unexpected revelation. The middleman claimed he had received orders directly from Christo Grozev, the Bulgarian ‘lead Russia investigator’ with Bellingcat, a controversial Western state-funded organization that was labeled “undesirable” in Russia earlier in July. Moscow has repeatedly questioned the independence of the investigative group, citing its close ties with intelligence agencies. “Grozev… did not actually explain anything to me, he just told me the name of the courier who would deliver the money by train,” the suspect claimed. The alleged involvement of Grozev is not the only suggestion of Western influence in hijacking the planes. During the negotiations with the pilots, Ukrainian intelligence was able to procure two legitimate EU passports – one Slovakian and one Romanian – for wives of the pilots, as a guarantee for the would-be ‘defectors’. Leaving Russia with such documents would have immediately turned the pilots’ families into “hostages” of Ukrainian intelligence, the FSB operative told RT, as “methods of blackmail, threats and pressure on relatives” have long been standard practice for them. “Obviously, the operation itself was carried out with the support of Western and, primarily, British intelligence services. We know about Grozev’s involvement and MI6 not only from these statements,” he added, claiming that Ukrainian intelligence had recently “ceased hiding” its ties with foreign spies. The plot also described an even a darker element, as the would-be-defectors were supposed to somehow deal with their fellow crew members, it was revealed. While the Su-34 has two crew members, the Tu-22M3 has four. Ukrainian intelligence reportedly suggested that Russian pilots should drug their comrades with Clophelin (Clonidine), a medication used to treat high blood pressure and other ailments. In high doses, however, it has a strong sedative effect, which makes the drug ‘popular’ among criminals wishing to knock out their victims to rob them. Very high doses can also be lethal. Since the medication is not easy to come by in Russia, Ukrainian intelligence is said to have arranged a dead drop involving the substance. The FSB says it later recovered a stash of the product. “As the pilot, I was asked to knock out my co-pilot, and what would happen to him after that is not clear – even whether he would be kept alive,” the Russian serviceman said. According to the FSB’s information, the Ukrainian side insisted the betrayed crew members would be safe and exchanged as POWs later on. The Russian pilot, however, expressed strong doubts about that."
2022-07-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/559573-ukrainian-governor-spy-hunt/,Ukrainian governor ‘suspects everybody’ of helping Russia,"The southwestern Ukrainian city of Nikolayev is set to be put into a full lockdown in the coming days, governor Vitaliy Kim has revealed. The extreme measure is needed to catch alleged spies and saboteurs believed to be colluding with Russia, he told The Telegraph in an interview. So far, the city’s authorities and the military have detained twelve individuals believed to be working for Russia amid the ongoing conflict, Kim revealed. Asked about the numbers of alleged “spies,” the governor admitted he suspects literally everybody in the city of being a traitor. “I suspect everybody,” Kim stated, adding that he has a “hidden strategy” to uncover and catch the purported spies. In order to remain strong in the face of Russian forces one needs to keep “a clear head as well as a heated heart,” the official asserted. The remark came as an apparent nod to a saying, commonly attributed to Bolshevik revolutionary and the head of early Soviet state security bodies, Felix Dzerzhinsky, that a true security agent should have “clear head, heated heart and clean hands.” The latter, apparently, does not apply to Ukrainian spy-hunters. Earlier this week, Kim announced a $100 bounty for tips about alleged saboteurs and spies. The compensation will come in exchange for information on “those who reveal to the occupiers the places of deployment of Ukrainian troops,” he said, adding that the $100 tip will be paid only for credible reports. Multiple Ukrainian officials have repeatedly sounded alarm over allegedly rampant “collaboration” and “treason” among the country’s citizens and employees of security agencies. The issue led to the downfall of Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova and the head of the country’s top security agency, Ivan Bakanov. The two officials were fired during the week by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who said that “some 651 criminal cases have been registered on high treason and collaboration activities of employees of the prosecutor’s office, pre-trial investigation bodies, and other law enforcement agencies.”"
2022-07-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/559569-bandera-grave-vandals-report/,Grave of Ukraine’s Nazi ‘hero’ defaced in Germany,"The grave of Ukrainian Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera has been targeted by vandals in Munich, Germany, Belarusian opposition activist Ales Caicyc claimed on Saturday. Caicyc published four photos showing the grave covered in purple graffiti on Facebook. “The tomb of Stepan Bandera in Munich, damaged by vandals. I decided to visit it for the first time, and there are police and this sight,” he wrote. The images show the Soviet symbol of a hammer and sickle in spray paint on the grave, along with a number of anarchist emblems and swastikas. Bandera’s name was also heavily daubed in paint. It’s not the first attack on the grave of the hardcore nationalist, who collaborated with the Nazis during World War II, and is considered a hero in present-day Ukraine. On March 7, then-Ambassador of Ukraine Andrey Melnik reported “a daring act of vandalism” and called on local police to find and punish the “disgusting scum” who had covered the monument with an unknown substance. “What a shame that the demonization of S.Bandera is not only carried out by Moscow propaganda, but also by respected German historians,” he wrote on Twitter at the time. During his almost eight-year tenure as his country’s top diplomat in Germany, Melnik, known for his deep sympathy for the controversial Ukrainian national hero, found himself at the center of several scandals. Last month, speaking to German podcaster Tilo Jung, Melnik repeatedly denied that Bandera was implicated in the mass murder of Jews and Poles during WWII on the territory of modern-day Ukraine. The ambassador’s statements prompted criticism from both Poland and Israel. The international outrage forced Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry to step in to explain that the remarks did not represent Kiev’s official stance. On July 9, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky relieved Melnik of his post."
2022-07-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/559566-us-designating-russia-terrorism/,US comments on designating Russia ‘terrorism sponsor’,"The US is considering the matter of recognizing Russia as “a state sponsor of terrorism,” US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink has said, emphasizing that the issue must be carefully analyzed from a legal point of view. “With regard to designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, this is something we are looking at and reviewing. Any such designation requires a careful review in accordance to our own laws,” she said. In a Sunday interview with Radio Liberty, Brink also emphasized that the US is already using all available means to keep pressure on Russia, including the ones normally applying to state sponsors of terrorism. She promised that Joe Biden’s administration will “continue to hold Russia to account” in accordance with US law. The envoy echoed remarks made in April by US State Department spokesman Ned Price, that the government was looking into the potential steps it could take against Moscow and noted that already-imposed anti-Russia sanctions are the same steps that “would be entailed by the designation of a state sponsor of terrorism.” Countries daubed with this status – currently Cuba, North Korea, Iran and Syria – are subject to harsh sanctions. Russia, though not on the list, has already become the most sanctioned country in the world, amid its military offensive in Ukraine. Over the last months, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has been regularly urging his country’s allies to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism, citing atrocities against civilians allegedly committed by Russian forces (Moscow vehemently denies these claims). Earlier this month, he welcomed the initiative of US senators Richard Blumenthal and Lindsey Graham to introduce a Senate resolution directing Secretary of State Antony Blinken to designate Russia with this status. Earlier this week, Politico reported that the speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi had made the same request to the country’s top diplomat, warning that if Blinken didn’t do it, Congress would step in. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded to this report, saying Moscow “very negatively assesses the consequences for relations with Washington if the US Congress recognizes the Russian Federation as a ‘state sponsor of terrorism.’” He added, however, that it would be difficult to do anything that could damage the relations between the two nations any further."
2022-07-24,https://www.rt.com/news/559560-ukraine-mercenaries-us-canada/,Ukrainian commander reports more deaths of foreign fighters,"A Ukrainian commander of pro-Kiev foreign fighters has disclosed the circumstances of the death of two Americans, a Canadian and a Swede during clashes with Russian forces in Donbass. US citizens Luke ‘Skywalker’ Lucyszyn and Bryan Young, Canada’s Emile-Antoine Roy-Sirois and Edvard Selander Patrignani of Sweden were killed on July 18, their commander Ruslan Miroshnichenko told news outlet Politico on Saturday. The four men were part of a special operations unit within the Ukrainian territorial defense forces in the town of Seversk, which has recently been the scene of heavy fighting. On Monday, the fighters were part of a group sent on a mission to the village of Grigorovka, some three kilometers northwest of Seversk, where advancing Russian forces attempted a river crossing, Miroshnichenko said. They had completed their task but “at the end of the mission they were ambushed by Russian tanks,” he recalled. “The first shell injured Luke. Three guys, Edward, Emile, and Bryan, they immediately attempted to help Luke, to do first aid and evacuate him from this spot. Then the second shell killed them all,” the commander revealed. The US State Department confirmed the deaths of the two Americans, but declined to mention them by name “out of respect to the families during this difficult time.” Politico has also obtained a situation report on the events in Grigorovka, which stated that, besides the fatalities, a fighter named Finn “was injured in his left arm and leg,” while his counterpart, named Oskar, had “received numerous injuries [and] both moved to the evacuation point independently.” The group of mercenaries was faced with at least six Russian tanks, four armored personnel carriers and up to 70 infantrymen, according to the document. The foreign fighters were also bombarded with heavy artillery “corrected by drones” for more than two hours, it added. Thousands of foreign fighters have arrived in Ukraine since the start of the conflict, forming the so-called “International Legion,” after a call by the country’s president Vladimir Zelensky. In April, the Russian military estimated their numbers at almost 7,000 but, earlier this month, it said that only 2,741 soldiers of fortune remained in Ukraine. Many of them were eliminated while others fled abroad, some complaining about disorder in the ranks of the Kiev forces, and about poor equipment. Russia’s defense ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov has recently warned that foreign mercenaries aren’t viewed as combatants under international law and “the best thing that awaits them if they are captured alive is a trial and maximum prison terms.” Earlier this week, the International Legion’s spokesperson Damien Magrou revealed to NBC News that “there’s been a gradual dip in the number of arrivals over the course of the last few months,” blaming such state of affairs on “Russian disinformation.”"
2022-07-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/559553-odessa-port-grain-ukraine/,Moscow reveals target of strike on key Ukrainian port,"The Russian Ministry of Defense has confirmed striking targets in the major Ukrainian port of Odessa on Saturday, claiming that its missiles hit military infrastructure and arms stockpiles. “In the seaport of Odessa, on the territory of a shipyard, a docked Ukrainian warship and a warehouse of Harpoon anti-ship missiles, supplied by the US to the Kiev regime, have been destroyed by sea-based high-precision long-range missiles,” the ministry said on Sunday. The attack also crippled a repair facility where vessels of the Ukrainian navy have been fixed, it added. The strike on the target in Odessa, which is a major trade hub in the southwest of Ukraine, came a day after the signing of a UN-brokered deal to unblock grain exports from Ukrainian ports. During the conflict that has been underway since February 24, Moscow has insisted that its troops only fire at Ukrainian forces and military infrastructure, not civilian facilities. According to Kiev officials, four cruise missiles were used in the attack on the port of Odessa, allegedly targeting grain silos located there. Two of the missiles were intercepted and two made it through, but failed to inflict significant damage, they said. Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky described the strike as “barbarism” and insisted “Russian Kalibr missiles destroyed the very possibility of statements” on the need for dialogue and any agreements with Moscow. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “unequivocally condemns” the attack on the port of Odessa, his spokesman said. According to Guterres, “the full implementation [of the deal] by Russia, Ukraine and Turkey is imperative” because the products that are covered by it are “desperately needed to address the global food crisis and ease the suffering of millions of people in need around the globe,” he added. The Russia-Ukraine agreement, which had been agreed on Friday with the mediation of Turkey and the UN, sets out a framework for resuming Ukrainian grain exports via the Black Sea ports, which had been disrupted by the fighting. In addition, Russia and the United Nations signed a memorandum providing for the UN’s involvement in lifting international sanctions on the export of Russian grain and fertilizers to world markets."
2022-07-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/559547-ukraine-odessa-zakharova-grain/,Russia explains strike on major Ukrainian port,"Russia says it hit a military target during a Saturday strike on the Ukrainian port city of Odessa. The attack came a day after the signing of a UN-brokered deal to unblock grain exports from Ukrainian ports. “The Kalibr missiles destroyed part of the military infrastructure in the port of Odessa,” Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram on Sunday. The high-precision strike sent a Ukrainian military vessel to the bottom of the Black Sea, she added. Zakharova was responding to comments by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who described the attack as “barbarism” and claimed “Russian Kalibr missiles destroyed the very possibility of statements” on the need for dialogue and any agreements with Moscow. The Russian Defense Ministry has yet to officially comment on the explosions that rocked Odessa, which is a major trade hub in the southwest of Ukraine. Throughout the conflict with Kiev, Moscow has insisted that it does not target civilians, only Ukraine’s armed forces and military infrastructure. Turkey, which helped broker the agreement on releasing Ukraine’s grain supplies, said it has received assurances from the Russian military that “they had absolutely nothing to do with this attack and that they were examining the affair very closely and in detail.” Kiev officials have claimed that four cruise missiles – two of which were intercepted – were used in the attack on Odessa. They allegedly targeted grain silos at the port, but failed to do significant damage. Saturday’s incident came just a day after Russia and Ukraine, along with the UN and Turkey, signed a deal in Istanbul to unblock exports of grain, food, and fertilizers from Ukrainian ports that had been held up by the ongoing conflict. As part of the agreement, which is seen as a way of averting a global food crisis, the UN also promised to help lift obstacles to the export of Russian grain, food and fertilizers created by international sanctions against Moscow."

Orban said on Saturday that the decision to impose sanctions on Moscow and supply Kiev with heavy weapons had turned the EU and NATO member states into de facto participants in the conflict, while failing to deliver results. Responding in a Facebook post, Nikolenko said the idea that “sanctions did not shake Russia” represent “a classic example of Russian propaganda.” The Foreign Ministry spokesman claimed that sanctions are effective, as they have “significantly reduced” the capabilities of the Russian military, while Western arms supplies have helped to save the lives of Ukrainians. He claimed that if sanctions and weapons were ineffective, the Kremlin would not have used “crazy resources” to stop them. Moscow has been warning the West against supplying Kiev with weapons, saying it will not prevent Russia from achieving its military goals, but will lead to extra casualties. Russian officials have also pointed to the boomerang effect of Western sanctions. In a speech in the Romanian city of Baile Tusnad on Saturday, Orban said the conflict could put an end to Western supremacy and “create a multipolar world order.” The Hungarian leader argued that the West needs to develop “a new strategy.” Nikolenko countered that “Europe is in an economic crisis not because of sanctions, but because of Russia's hybrid war.” Moscow, meanwhile, categorically denies accusations of using energy supplies as a political weapon. The Ukrainian official said Russian President Vladimir Putin “will not stop until he destroys the European order based on democratic values,” meaning that “joint decisive action” is needed. “Together, we will surely defeat Russia, even despite the head of the Hungarian government’ fears that the Russian army has an ‘asymmetrical advantage,’” Nikolenko said, referring to Orban’s claim that Ukraine cannot win the war due to the disparity of forces. Nikolenko has lambasted Western politicians in the past. Earlier this month, Nikolenko accused US Congresswoman Victoria Spartz of attempting to bring “Russian propaganda” into American politics. Spartz called for a mechanism to track military aid provided to Kiev, and expressed doubts over the reliability of President Vladimir Zelensky’s chief of staff. Nikolenko advised Spartz “to stop trying to earn extra political capital on baseless speculation around the topic of war” and “stop undermining the existing mechanisms of providing US military assistance to Ukraine.”"
2022-07-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/559534-sochi-storm-flood-emergency/,Flash floods devastate Russia's Sochi,"Torrential rains have wreaked havoc in southern Russia, triggering flash floods and causing significant property damage. Authorities in the former Winter Olympic host city of Sochi activated an emergency alarm system on Saturday night, warning residents to shelter at home and be ready for possible evacuations. Emergency sirens were heard across Sochi around 11pm local time, as the storms battering the area for a second day intensified, causing more flooding and chaos. Multiple videos shared online have shown the extent of the calamity, with one clip captured by a family showing them trapped inside a half-flooded vehicle as it's swept along a major street. Further down the road, a number of people were trapped inside a bus, as rescue services rushed to help them and others were caught off-guard in the open. At least one woman is believed to have died, apparently wedged between a taxi cab and a street railing, with one disturbing video showing rescuers carrying away her unresponsive body. Emergency service crews spent Saturday dealing with the consequences of a similar storm on Friday night, warning that the worst was likely yet to come. Authorities strongly advised Sochi residents to avoid staying in the streets or using personal vehicles. As flood waters slowly receded by around 1am Sunday, witnesses started sharing videos of the aftermath, depicting numerous destroyed cars as well as damaged roads and sidewalks."
2022-07-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/559519-johnson-training-ukrainians-support/,Scandal-plagued UK PM trains with Ukrainian troops (VIDEO),"Outgoing UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has revealed that earlier this week he joined Ukrainian troops for a training session, his second military exercise in two weeks. On Saturday, Johnson tweeted out a video showing him in full camouflage as he tested out various weapons, including an anti-tank missile launcher and grenade machine gun. He is also seen throwing a grenade. “This week I visited Ukrainian troops being trained by British Armed Forces in North Yorkshire,” the prime minister said, adding in the video that he had met “some of the 400 Ukrainian troops” who are being trained by UK forces as part of a “huge” initiative. The program, which was announced during Johnson’s visit to Kiev last month, provides for the training of up to 10,000 service members in the coming months. This week I visited Ukrainian troops being trained by British Armed Forces in North Yorkshire. The UK is committed to doing all we can to help Ukraine continue to repel Russian aggression. pic.twitter.com/HMTClRFST5 UK military support for Ukraine has already amounted to £2.3 billion ($2.8 billion) and includes, Johnson said, 6,900 anti-tank weapons and 120 armored vehicles. Moscow has warned the West against sending weapons to Ukraine, saying that it would only prolong the conflict. In the video, Johnson paid tribute to the “bravery and heroism” of the Ukrainian soldiers, shouting “Glory to Ukraine” in Ukrainian to the troops. Last week, the prime minister took part in a demonstration flight at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, England. In a video released by the government, Johnson is shown at the controls of a Typhoon fighter jet giving the thumbs-up to two air-to-air refueling aircraft. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Johnson “seems to show that he likes exorbitant fuel prices, and that refueling is only for celestial beings.” “English humor,” she said, amid the worsening world energy crisis caused in part by Western sanctions on Russia."
2022-07-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/559515-ukraine-odessa-port-attack/,Ukraine claims Russia targeted major port city,"Ukraine has claimed that Russia launched a cruise missile strike on the port of Odessa, a major trade hub in the country's southwest. The claim, made by the Ukrainian military and officials, comes a day after a UN-brokered deal to unblock the nation's grain exports was reached. At least four cruise missiles were used to target the facility, a spokesman for the Odessa military administration, Sergey Bratchuk, said. Two of the projectiles were intercepted, while the two others hit the port’s infrastructure, he claimed. Footage circulating online purports to show a plume of smoke rising above the port, as well as an object appearing to be a small boat on fire. Other images show an apparent explosion of an anti-aircraft rocket in the sky above the city. Russia deliberately targeted the grain silos at the port, a spokeswoman for Ukraine’s ‘South’ command, Natalya Gumenyuk, claimed. Still, the grain storage was not damaged and the port did not sustain “significant damage.” Moscow has so far remained silent on the latest claims from Kiev. Russia has repeatedly stated that it exclusively strikes military targets in the ongoing conflict, which broke out in late February. Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said Ankara had discussed the incident with both Moscow and Kiev. “Russians told us that they had absolutely nothing to do with this attack and that they were examining the affair very closely and in detail,” Akar revealed. Ukraine’s accusations come one day after representatives of Ukraine, Russia, the UN, and Turkey signed a deal to unblock exports of grain, food, and fertilizers from Ukrainian ports. The “reported strikes” have already been “unequivocally” condemned by the UN. “Yesterday, all parties made clear commitments on the global stage to ensure the safe movement of Ukrainian grain and related products to global markets. These products are desperately needed to address the global food crisis and ease the suffering of millions of people in need around the globe,” Farhan Haq, a spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. The EU has condemned the alleged strike as well, with the bloc’s top diplomat Josep Borrell taking to Twitter to call out Moscow. “Striking a target crucial for grain export a day after the signature of Istanbul agreements is particularly reprehensible and again demonstrates Russia’s total disregard for international law and commitments,” Borrell asserted."
2022-07-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/559514-losses-ukraine-russia-zelensky/,Zelensky makes claim about Ukraine’s combat losses,"Ukraine’s combat losses have decreased to around 30 fatalities a day from the previous 100-200, President Vladimir Zelensky told the Wall Street Journal. In an interview published on Friday, Zelensky said he always knows the exact numbers because he lives with this “every day.” Checking his smartphone for the latest figures supplied to him by the military, Zelensky said that at the peak of the fighting in May and June, Ukraine was losing 100-200 troops a day, while now it’s around 30 soldiers killed per day and around 250 injured. The president, citing military policy, refused to disclose the country’s total military losses since the beginning of the Russian military operation, but claims that the figure is a few times lower than Russia’s. Moscow’s assessment of the numbers is the opposite. Zelensky partially attributed Ukraine’s supposed success to the Western weapons being sent to the country, particularly to the HIMARS multiple-launch rocket systems and howitzers. Moscow has consistently warned the West against providing Kiev with weapons, saying it would only lead to unnecessary casualties and would not prevent the Russian military from achieving its goals. On July 4, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced that over the previous two weeks alone, Ukraine had lost almost 5,500 troops, including over 2,000 killed. Regarding its own military casualties, Moscow has not been updating the numbers since March, when it reported 1,351 military personnel killed. In June, the head of the Russian Duma’s Defense Committee, Andrey Kartapolov, claimed that, due to changes in military strategy, the Russian Army has “practically ceased to lose people.”"
2022-07-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/559511-putin-health-iran-lookalike/,Ukraine’s intel chief peddles Putin lookalike theory,"Russian President Vladimir Putin may have used a lookalike for his trip to Iran this week, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence service (GUR) has suggested. During an interview on Ukrainian TV channel TSN on Friday, Major General Kirill Budanov was asked to comment on Putin’s health during the Russian leader’s recent trip to Iran. “I will not give you a direct answer, but will give you a hint,” Budanov replied. “Look, please, at the moment when the supposed Putin is leaving the plane. Is he Putin at all?” Budanov did not elaborate, offered no evidence for his assertion, but Ukrainian media said he was referring to rumors that Putin occasionally uses lookalikes for public events. They also said that Budanov was talking about claims that Putin was limping while exiting the plane in Tehran. While giving a speech in Moscow on Wednesday, Putin explained that he was coughing due to the strong air conditioning in Tehran, where he had a number of meetings the previous day. The Kremlin later stated that the president’s health is fine."
2022-07-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/559510-erdogan-photo-germany-putin/,Erdogan’s photo with Putin branded ‘challenge’ to NATO,"German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has branded a recent joint photo of Vladimir Putin with Recep Tayyip Erdogan a challenge to NATO. The image was shot during a meeting between the Russian and Turkish leaders in Iran. The photo features the three presidents, with host Ebrahim Raisi in the middle, holding hands and smiling. In an interview with Bild published on Saturday, Baerbock noted that this picture is “more than incomprehensible” for her, “especially from the point of view of a NATO member.” While being part of the alliance, Turkey has deviated from other member states in choosing a neutral stance in the Ukraine conflict. NATO as a whole officially considers Russia a threat. “The fact that the Turkish president is in this photo is a challenge, to put it mildly,” she said. In her opinion, the photo proves the importance of standing together “with value partners” who “not only believe in the international rules, but stand up for them.” “Because there are other actors who do not stand up for our values, and when in doubt they also join forces,” she explained. The trilateral negotiations in the Iranian capital were held earlier this week as part of the so-called Astana Peace Process, which was launched by Moscow, Tehran and Ankara in 2017 with the aim of achieving a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Syria. Putin also held bilateral talks with each of his counterparts. The situation in Ukraine was on the agenda of both meetings. Meanwhile, Turkey, along with the UN, played the role of mediator in brokering the deal between Russia and Ukraine to unblock grain exports from Ukrainian Black Sea ports. The agreement, dubbed by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres as “a beacon of hope, possibility & relief,” was signed on Friday in Istanbul, in the presence of Erdogan."
2022-07-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/559445-macron-dictatorship-fifth-republic/,Monsieur général: How France's Macron is trying to distract from the economic crisis by impersonating a military tough-guy,"At the Paris military event in honor of Bastille Day on July 14, infantry troops from nine countries – France’s NATO allies Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria – were the first to march along the Champs-Elysees. The French state-run radio broadcaster RFI called this event a “parade under the banner of Ukraine.” By inviting states from the Bucharest Nine to open the celebrations, “France is demonstrating its support for these countries as members of the EU and NATO,” the French Ministry of Defense stressed. “The countries in the Bucharest Nine are now concerned about Russian aggression and the immediate threat it poses {to them}.” Colonel Vincent Mingue, commander of an 800-strong French-Belgian detachment stationed in Romania, said: “We must be ready for all scenarios,” explaining that there is no sense at the moment of how far the conflict in Ukraine will go. Such a vague statement from a French army colonel, combined with the sensational statements Macron made about France’s transition to a “war economy” at the opening of the Eurosatory exhibition in Villepinte, is cause for concern. Is France headed down the path to war? Will its support for Kiev end with the supply of CAESAR self-propelled artillery and Milan anti-tank missiles? The revision of Paris’ existing military programming law (LPM 2019-2025, unveiled in July of 2018), which was announced by the prime minister, Elizabeth Bourne, appears to be a large-scale project. “Now, on entering a period of war, we must be able to produce certain types of equipment more quickly and intensively. This is a deep reorganization,” Macron said at the end of June, commenting on the work set out for the French Armed Forces Minister and Chief of Defense Staff. Macron’s strategy regarding the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, in the early stages, consisted of an attempt at a diplomatic settlement, which was accompanied by numerous calls to Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, at the end of April, a decision was made to send Ukraine CAESARs, followed by a batch of Milans. The French government thus replaced humanitarian support with military aid. By June 7, Paris had sent Ukraine military equipment totaling over €162 million since the beginning of Russia’s military offensive, according to the Kiel Institute of World Economy. This is mainly howitzers and ATGMs. Interestingly, this selective assistance to Kiev in the form of 155mm howitzers directly corresponds to the recommendations of the British Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) lobby group, which is funded by the arms industry. In a special report released in July entitled ‘Ukraine at War: Paving the Road From Survival to Victory’, it is noted that Western countries should streamline the support they provide to Kiev and move from supplying large amounts of weapons requiring special training to more targeted ones. Thus, the Institute’s specialists note that Ukraine needs 155mm howitzers in particular “to prevent Russian troop concentration and support.” “France is supporting the Ukrainian army not only in the form of verbal commitments, but also through the deployment of equipment on site… accompanied by effective training and, above all, rapid deployment,” Marcon said in Madrid at the end of the NATO summit, last month. Thus, the military frontier has moved from Africa to the borders of Eastern Europe. On June 14, the president visited French soldiers stationed at a NATO base in Romania. This was followed by statements about the need to increase the number of the country's military personnel in the region and even equip the contingent with Leclerc tanks in the second half of 2022. Macron’s image of a diplomat has been replaced by that of a military commander. Over the past two months, his ‘militarization’ and increasing commitment to the conflict have become noticeable. Earlier frequent calls for dialogue between Russia and Ukraine have given way to regular statements asserting that “Kiev is a democracy” (despite the fact that it isn't) and “Russia cannot and should not win.” At a press conference following the G7 summit, the French president said that “support for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia will continue as long as necessary and with the necessary intensity over the next weeks and months.” Since the beginning of June, he has increasingly used his speeches to exhort the Ministry of Defense to revise the military spending law for 2019-2025. In an interview with the TV channel TF1 on July 14, Macron said that France needs to continue recruiting for the army and that such efforts should be boosted as much as possible. Perhaps, given his rising disapproval rating, Macron has rolled out this ‘General’ style to save his presidency. Meanwhile, it’s worth recalling that relations between Macron and the army have been quite tense from the very beginning of his tenure in the Élysée Palace, a time when he skillfully played the role of the clever banker and former economy minister by focusing on European integration. In 2017, at the very beginning of his term, Macron had quite a quarrel with the then chief of the French defense staff, Pierre De Villiers. The reason for the row was Macron’s intention to reduce the military budget and it ended up leading to the resignation of De Villiers (the first chief of defense to resign in the history of the Fifth Republic). In the end, following a wave of protest from the Ministry, Macron ended up not cutting funding for the military. The generals, who were determined to form a long-term foreign policy strategy, were then outraged by Macron’s statement addressed to De Villiers that “I’m your boss.” The president’s relations with the army frankly did not go well. Later in 2021, more than a hundred retired French generals published an open letter in the magazine Valeurs Actuelles that called for “saving the country from disintegration.” “Our senior comrades are fighters who deserve respect... You’ve treated them like rebels, although their only fault is that they love their country and mourn its obvious fall,” the letter stated. The military stressed that a “civil war” was brewing and called on the president to pay more attention to internal security. The generals pointed to Macron’s oblivious migration policy, which could lead to the strengthening of Islamists, and drew attention to the possible beginning of a “race war” in France, a kind of “clash of civilizations” – French and Islamic. “Violence is growing every day. Who would have predicted ten years ago that a professor would someday be beheaded upon leaving his college?” the authors of the letter wondered. Moreover, they contended that a coup d’etat was possible in the event of inaction by Macron. The letter was supported by Marine Le Pen, who has been criticizing the French leadership’s ‘open borders’ policy for a decade and called upon the generals to join her election campaign. The conflict with the military came to a head in March of 2022, when the president dismissed the head of French military intelligence, General Eric Vido, for “shortcomings in the work of intelligence during the Ukrainian crisis.” Meanwhile, the lack of a unified coordinated strategy in Africa led to the shameful withdrawal of troops from Mali, where anti-French sentiment reached a boiling point even in the media sphere with a ban on state-controlled France 24 and RFI radio. But now Macron, who had always been far from military affairs and has butted heads with the army’s top brass on many occasions, has begun to position himself as an ultra-militarist, calling for the introduction of a ‘war economy’. This is quite an interesting and abrupt change of persona. Given the reduction in Russian oil and gas supplies, not to mention the anti-Russian sanctions that have hit the French economy like ‘hara-kiri’, as aptly put by Marine Le Pen, the idea of transitioning to a war economy seems less than wise for the French population. Macron’s disapproval rating is growing rapidly. In a recent survey conducted by the IFOP international polling and market research firm, 63% of the respondents said they disapproved of the job the president is doing. And the lack of an absolute majority for Macron’s party in parliament indicates a decrease in the legitimacy of the president’s agenda. It is extremely symbolic that, having lost popular support, three ministers appointed by Macron failed to win their districts. In French politics, a situation when the president does not have an absolute parliamentary majority is called ‘cohabitation’. This means the president’s legislative agenda cannot be fully implemented because it can be rebuffed by parliament. A similar situation arose in the Fifth Republic in 1988, when the main legislative acts were forced through in an expedited fashion via an appeal to Article 49.3 of the French Constitution, which allows the government to take responsibility for implementing a bill and to adopt the text of a law without a vote. Michel Rocard, the prime minister at the time, invoked this article 28 times between 1988 and 1991. However, after France’s constitutional reform of 2008, the application of Article 49.3 was significantly limited. The bet on an aggressive foreign policy agenda has played a cruel joke on the president: the conflict in Ukraine worries the French less than pension reforms and their declining purchasing power. Given this, the NUPES bloc led by the Melenchon movement and Le Pen’s National Rally party, which have focused on solving the country’s difficult post-pandemic economic issues, have turned out to be more attractive to voters. Melenchon’s and Le Pen’s admonishment of NATO’s expansion to the east and their more balanced foreign policies have also found support among the portion of the French population that still preserves the memory of the ‘golden times of Gaullism’ and the general’s continentalist, anti-American political stance. Major scandals have also had a negative impact on the president’s approval rating: the sale of the French company Alstom to the American firm General Electrics and the McKinsey case, as well as the Ubergate scandal, which is gaining momentum. All three are symbolically connected with American corporations. The McKinsey case, which appeared on the eve of the presidential election, was highlighted by a report from the French Senate that described the affair as a threat to national sovereignty. The American consulting firm had been working with Macron since 2017, and by 2021 it had received a contract to develop a number of pieces of legislation with a remuneration of $1 billion. The report from the French Senate stated: “Consulting firms interfere in public policy, which raises two main issues: – What is our vision of the state and its sovereignty in the face of private firms? – Is this a proper use of public funds. The recent scandal with Uber once again exposed Macron’s lobbying mission in promoting the interests of the American corporation. When he was the economy minister, Macron supported the legalization of the company’s activities in France and helped circumvent the difficulties that arise in various regions when the taxi services market is dominated by a large monopoly. Bastien Lachaud, a deputy in the left-wing France Unconquered movement, described Macron as “serving the interests of scammers, not the people.” And a representative of the National Rally party, Jean-Philippe Tanguy, said that Macron is “a representative of the business oligarchy” who mixes “his functions as a high-ranking official and foreign interests with his personal ones.” So now we have growing uncertainty in foreign policy, a sharp turn from a diplomatic to a military image, increased military support for the Kiev regime, the introduction of a ‘war economy’ for France (despite ongoing friction with a number of army generals), soaring inflation, the energy crisis, unpopular reforms, and numerous scandals. Macron has five years to go in his current term. A half decade of ‘Macronie’ and a war economy? How will that go down?"
2022-07-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/559491-estonia-trucker-drones-ukraine/,EU country jails Russian trucker,"A Russian long-haul trucker was sentenced on Friday by an Estonian court to a year behind bars for supporting what they called “Russian aggression” in Ukraine. Vladimir Shilov collected money to buy three small quadcopters he intended to give to elite Russian paratroopers, the Baltic state’s prosecutors claimed. Two other men were also convicted for contributing to Shilov’s crowdfunding drive. A court in the northern county of Harju sentenced Shilov to four months in prison right away, with the remaining eight to be suspended, unless he violates the law again over the next four years. He was also told to pay over €1,600 in court costs. Prosecutor Melinda Ulend accused Shilov of “buying equipment needed for combat operations, such as drones” and “aiding aggression” by collecting funding for the Russian military, in violation of Article 91-1 of the Estonian criminal code. The maximum sentence under the statute is five years in prison. Estonian prosecutors said Shilov used some of his own money, as well as funds from an online fundraiser, to buy three small drones. He then tried to transport them to Russia, but was detained at the Koidula border crossing on May 28. Estonia’s Criminal Police (KaPo) wouldn’t say if their arrest warrant was based on the photo Shilov had posted on the VK social network, showing the drones in the cab of his truck. The 43-year-old trucker’s social media feed also features statements in support of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, a photo of him in a T-shirt that says “I am Russian,” and videos of him singing at various venues in Pskov Region, where he is a permanent resident. Shilov is a dual citizen of Russia and Estonia. Two other long-haulers, Ilya and Ruslan Golembovsky, were found guilty of donating money to Shilov. They were given five-month suspended sentences and told to pay around €1,200 in court costs each. Prosecutors said that Shilov and his confederates were trying to smuggle drones to Pskov, which happens to be where Russia’s elite airborne forces are based. There are several VK groups in Pskov that crowdfund for commercial drones that can be donated to the Russian military. One such group consists of fans of the 76th Airborne Strike Division, but its administrators told the Russian newspaper Kommersant that Shilov had no ties to them whatsoever. A former Soviet republic and now a member of the EU and NATO, Estonia has around 1.3 million citizens, of which almost a quarter are ethnic Russians. The government in Tallinn recently decided to abolish Russian-language instruction in elementary schools. Disagreements on how to implement this led to the downfall of the ruling coalition and the resignation of Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, an outspoken supporter of Ukraine."
2022-07-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/559489-himars-destroyed-ukraine-claims/,Russia claims it destroyed American rocket system,"Four of the US-supplied HIMARS rocket artillery launchers and one of their support vehicles have been destroyed over the past three weeks of fighting in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defense said on Friday. The US sent 12 launchers earlier this month, and said on Friday it would provide Kiev with four more. “High-precision strikes with land- and air-based missiles destroyed four HIMARS multiple rocket launch systems and one ammunition and reloading vehicle between July 5 and July 20,” General Igor Konashenkov said in a daily briefing. Two of the launchers were destroyed near the settlement of Malotaranovka, south of Kramatorsk. Another, alongside the support vehicle, was destroyed near Krasnoarmeysk – known in Ukraine as Pokrovsk. The final one was destroyed on the eastern outskirts of Konstantinovka, the Defense Ministry specified. All three locations are on territory claimed by the Donetsk People’s Republic but under the control of Ukrainian troops. The US provided Kiev with eight High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) last month, to replace rocket artillery lost in the conflict with Russia. The Malotaranovka strike was widely publicized on July 5, but the subsequent two strikes had not been previously mentioned. Earlier on Friday, the White House confirmed that four additional HIMARS launchers, 580 suicide drones and thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition would be sent to Ukraine as part of the $270 million “security assistance” package. One US official, who spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity, insisted that no HIMARS launchers sent to Ukraine had been destroyed. Meanwhile, the government in Kiev has accused Moscow of spreading “misinformation” calculated to dissuade the West from sending Ukraine more weapons. “Russia is trying to stop the supply of weapons from the West and intimidate Ukraine’s allies with the fictional power of Russia’s armed forces,” Sergey Leshchenko, an aide to President Vladimir Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andrei Yermak, told reporters. Washington has sent Kiev a total of 16 wheeled HIMARS launchers, with London providing another three or so tracked rocket artillery vehicles capable of launching the same munitions. The HIMARS came with medium-range, satellite-guided GLMRS projectiles, which Ukraine claims to have used to great effect against ammunition storage facilities and infrastructure objects. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Ukraine has lost over 760 multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and more than 3,100 artillery pieces since the beginning of hostilities in February."
2022-07-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/559490-russian-passports-crime-ukraine/,Ukraine to make seeking Russian passport a crime,"Trying to obtain Russian citizenship as a Ukrainian could soon become a criminal offense, the country's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Irina Vereschuk warned on Friday. In a Telegram post, Vereschuk said that the matter had previously been discussed during a closed interdepartmental meeting. “Work on the draft law continues, there will be discussions, but the direction has been determined,” the deputy prime minister said. She admitted that there could be “a long and difficult discussion” about the legal aspects of obtaining a Russian passport, about human rights, and “the need to survive under occupation.” “But let’s not forget: There is a lot of Ukrainian blood on the red Russian passport – military and civilian, women’s and children’s,” Vereschuk said. Two days ago, she wrote on Facebook that passports and referendums were being used by Moscow as “weapons, more dangerous than missiles.” In her opinion, these “weapons” enable Russia to create a “live shield” of Ukrainian citizens in the territories it controls. Therefore, the deputy prime minister argued, Kiev should take “a clearer and stricter stance” on Ukrainians who obtain citizenship from the “aggressor state” and vote in referendums. “I understand that it's tough, but it's about the existence of the Ukrainian state,” Vereschuk said. On June 11, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree granting all Ukrainians the right to apply for Russian citizenship under a simplified procedure. By doing so, he extended the procedures that had previously been reserved for citizens of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as residents of Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, which are under the control of Russian forces. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that Moscow’s move was nothing short of an “encroachment on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/559486-zelensky-talks-russia-reasons/,Zelensky refuses peace talks,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, explaining the reasons behind his country’s refusal to negotiate with Moscow, compared Russia to an insatiable “cachalot” who would not understand the language of diplomacy. In a Friday interview with the Wall Street Journal, Zelensky responded to the recent remarks of his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, who said earlier this week that Russia and Ukraine could have ended their conflict in March if Kiev had not withdrawn from negotiations. Calling this statement “total delirium,” the Ukrainian leader said that, prior to Moscow’s offensive, he had been trying to talk to Putin for a long time but he couldn’t be bothered to take a phone call. “He came here without talking, killed people, displaced 12 million, and now says Ukraine doesn’t want to negotiate. They just murder people, destroy cities, enter them, and then say: ‘Let’s negotiate’. With whom can they talk? With rocks? They are covered in blood, and this blood is impossible to wash off. We will not let them wash it off,” Zelensky said. Now, five months into the military conflict, Ukrainians believe that all of the country’s territories must be “liberated” before any negotiations can resume, according to him. Zelensky stressed that he would prefer to conduct ‘de-occupation’ in a non-military manner but, in his opinion, Russia would not understand anything until it got “smashed in the face.” Moreover, he believes there is another reason conducting talks no longer makes sense. Russia will never stop seizing Ukrainian territories, he claimed. “It is a cachalot that has swallowed two regions and now says: Freeze the conflict. Then it will rest and, in two or three years, it will seize two more regions and say again: Freeze the conflict. And it will keep going further and further. One hundred percent,” the Ukrainian leader said. Meanwhile, Putin said that back in March, Moscow and Kiev had “actually reached an agreement, the only thing left to do was to sign it.” “In order to create these conditions, our troops withdrew from central Ukraine, from Kiev, but the Kiev authorities refused to implement these agreements” and have no desire to do so even now, the Russian president added. Moscow and Kiev started peace talks four days into the Russian military offensive in Ukraine in late February. The sides held several rounds in person in Belarus and then continued the talks via video link. In late March, delegations from Russia and Ukraine met once again, in Istanbul. Since then, however, the talks have stalled completely. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/559484-grain-deal-key-provisions/,‘Beacon of hope’: A look inside the Russia-Ukraine grain deal,"Russian and Ukrainian officials on Friday individually signed a UN and Turkey-brokered deal for the resumption of grain shipments from Black Sea ports to world markets. The agreement, which has been described in a tweet by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as “a beacon of hope, possibility & relief,” consists of two documents. The memorandum, which is valid for three years, addresses the issue of sanctions on Russian agricultural products and fertilizers. The second document, which is valid for 120 days with the possibility of extension, defines the mechanism for the export of Ukrainian agricultural products from ports controlled by Ukraine. According to Guterres, the deal “will help avoid a food shortage catastrophe for millions worldwide.” Here, we take a look at some key provisions in the much-anticipated agreement. The UN’s role The memorandum assigns the UN the task of ensuring restrictions on the export of Russian agricultural products and fertilizers are lifted. “It is, in particular, about removing the obstacles that the US and the EU have created in the areas of finance, insurance, and logistics, to achieve specific exemptions for these products from the restrictive measures imposed against our country,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a statement. He was pleased that Washington and Brussels had “stopped obstructing the achievement of today’s agreements” and added that signing the memorandum displays the “purely artificial character of the West’s attempts to shift the blame on Russia for problems with the supply of grain to world markets.” Security guarantees for the ships Dry cargo ships have been provided with security guarantees and will now be allowed to leave the ports. Grain-carrying vessels will not have a military escort, but the parties to the deal pledged not to attack them. Green corridors The deal provides for the creation of safety corridors from Odessa, as well as Chornomorsk and Yuzhny. Ships will navigate through these corridors in the Black Sea under the direction of Ukrainian pilots, and then pass through the Bosphorus Strait. Inspection An inspection of all grain-carrying ships will be carried out by Russian, Ukrainian, and Turkish officials at the ports chosen by Ankara in order to prevent the smuggling of weapons and ammunition. Coordination The deal mandates the immediate creation of a Joint Coordination Center, which will be based in Istanbul and will include representatives from Ukraine, Russia, and Turkey. The center will supervise the safe passage of ships along the agreed corridors. Russia and the UN will create a mechanism for the exchange of information on the export of products and fertilizers through the country's permanent mission to the organization."
2022-07-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/559483-philip-morris-leaving-russia/,Tobacco giant to quit Russia,"Philip Morris International CEO Jacek Olczak said on Thursday that the tobacco firm will wrap up its business in Russia by the end of the year. The corporation, whose cancer-causing products are sold in 180 countries worldwide, announced the pullout in March, in the wake of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. “We are working hard to conclude our presence in Russia but I don’t think it’s going to happen in the time frame of the next quarter,” Olczak told Bloomberg Television. The CEO added that withdrawing from Russia is “a pretty complicated process,” which should be finished “around year end.” Marlboro posted record second-quarter financial results earlier on Thursday, with Bloomberg noting that the increased profits were driven by strong sales of its IQOS “smoke-free” heated tobacco devices and rising cigarette prices worldwide. However, kicking Russia may be harmful to the cigarette firm’s financial health. According to figures from the company, Russia accounted for 8.4% of Philip Morris’ cigarette sales and 17.1% of sales of the aforementioned IQOS products in 2021. Only in Indonesia did the company sell more cigarettes, while Japan was the only country that consumed more IQOS products. Nevertheless, Philip Morris announced in March that it would reduce production volumes and suspend planned investments in Russia. While the company continued to pay its more than 3,200 employees in Russia, Olczak said it was scaling down its Russian operations “in solidarity with the innocent men, women and children” of Ukraine. Rival companies British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands also announced plans to withdraw from Russia and transfer their assets in the country to Russian owners. Imperial Brands has since gone through with its pullout, while British American Tobacco – which controls around a quarter of the Russian market – has not finalized its own withdrawal. Russian President Vladimir Putin likely won’t be troubled by Western cigarettes leaving Russian shelves. Putin’s government has clamped down on smoking in public and restricted cigarette advertising, while placing health warnings on cigarette packaging and raising the excise duty on tobacco products."
2022-07-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/559479-arctic-council-boycott-dangers/,Russia warns about dangers to the Arctic,"A “security spillover” from worsening relations between the collective West and Russia has put on ice many initiatives vital to the environment and wellbeing of native populations in the Arctic, the Russian Foreign Ministry warned on Friday. However, Russia still hopes that the Arctic Council will resume normal operations in the near future. Russia currently chairs the council, an inter-governmental forum established in 1996 to address the issues of the northern polar region. In early March, however, all of its other members – the US, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden – suspended their participation, citing the conflict in Ukraine. “A so-called security-spillover has occurred in the Arctic, when some issue, conflict or event that lies outside the geographic boundaries of the region has a negative effect at the local level,” said Nikolay Korchunov, a special envoy at the Russian Foreign Ministry and Moscow’s senior representative to the Arctic Council. “This is the first time this has happened in the Arctic Council’s 25 year-existence, even though many member countries over this period took part in numerous military interventions in various parts of the world,” Korchunov added. Earlier this week, Korchunov hosted a roundtable on the future of the Arctic Council, with the participation of experts from Russia, China, India and Finland. The talk focused on security issues, strengthening mutual trust in a difficult geopolitical situation, and forms of mutually beneficial cooperation in the Arctic. The council has effectively stopped functioning due to the Western boycott, Korchunov pointed out, but Moscow hopes it will resume its work at some point in the near future. About half of Russia’s projects within the council are aimed at improving the living standards of the region’s inhabitants, through initiatives such as the preservation of the native populations’ cultural heritage and history. Russia is also seeking input from scientists and experts from non-Arctic states when it comes to climate and environmental protection issues, as they affect not just the region but the entire planet, Korchunov noted. Among the issues Moscow has raised at the Arctic Council are the melting of permafrost and the ensuing emissions of hydrocarbons into the atmosphere, as well as the effect of microplastic pollution on Arctic ecosystems and the need to preserve their biodiversity. Commenting in April on the Western boycott of the council’s work, Korchunov insisted that it is “impossible to effectively ensure the sustainable development of the Arctic without Russia, a country that accounts for about 60% of the Arctic coast and is home to more than half of the region’s population.”"
2022-07-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/559476-ukraine-official-entry-ban/,Top Ukrainian official denied entry to country,"The Ukrainian border guard has stopped Gennady Korban from entering the country and seized his passport, the politician said in a Facebook post on Friday. Korban, who currently leads the territorial defense force of Dnepr Region, was attempting to enter Ukraine from Poland. “It still feels like some kind of misunderstanding or prank. They confiscated my Ukrainian passport,” Korban said. The official urged Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to personally address the “misunderstanding.” Korban is now reportedly stuck at the Smilnitsa border, as he lacks the documents to go back to Poland. So far, no official information on the incident has been made public by the border guard or any other authority. The border standoff comes in wake of media reports that suggested Zelensky had issued a secret decree, stripping several high-profile Ukrainian nationals of their citizenship. The list includes Ukrainian oligarch and former governor of Dnepropetrovsk Region Igor Kolomoysky – believed to be the top sponsor of Zelensky’s 2019 presidential campaign – Kolomoysky’s former deputy Korban, the co-chair of the outlawed Opposition Platform — For Life party Vadim Rabinovich, and other figures. The authenticity of the decree, however, has been questioned, given that Ukraine’s constitution explicitly prohibits stripping anyone of citizenship. Ukraine’s top officials have been quite ambiguous on the matter, with Alexey Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, neither confirming nor denying the existence of the decree. “Decrees, if they contain personal data, are internal use-only. You may not see them because citizenship decrees contain personal data. I cannot tell you whether they will be published because I have entirely different duties,” Danilov told local TV. The Korban affair was harshly criticized by his long-time associate, Mayor of Dnepr Boris Filatov, who slammed the decision to bar him from entering the country as “petty” and “indecent” in a Facebook post. The official also drew a comparison between the actions of the Ukrainian authorities and those of Nazi Germans, who “stripped [Jews] of citizenship based on their birth.”"
2022-07-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/559480-moldova-calls-withdrawal-peacekeepers/,Moldova calls for withdrawal of Russian troops,"The Moldovan Foreign Ministry on Friday called for the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping troops from the breakaway region of Transnistria in response to the remarks of a senior official of the unrecognized republic. In an interview with RIA Novosti on Thursday, Transnistrian Foreign Minister Vitaly Ignatiev said that the region was worried about “destructive demarches” from Chisinau, and accused the Moldovan authorities of interfering with the rotation of Russian peacekeepers. The Moldovan Foreign Ministry denied the accusations, stressing that the rotation of Russian peacekeepers is carried out in accordance with “a mechanism established with the aim of avoiding risks and ensuring a coordinated movement of contingent personnel.” Transnistria broke away from Moldova in the early 1990s, shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The region maintains a close relationship with Moscow, with Russian peacekeepers stationed there and most of the local population holding Russian citizenship. Responding to Russia’s claims about the recent detention of Russian peacekeepers at Chisinau airport – something that Moscow described as an “unfriendly” action – the Moldovan ministry stressed that only some Russian servicemen had been prevented from entering the country’s territory due to their non-compliance “with the criteria established in the mechanism.” “In this context, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration reiterates the position of the Moldovan authorities regarding the necessity of the unconditional resumption of the process of withdrawal of Russian troops and ammunition depots from our country,” the statement reads. Vladimir Dzhabarov, the deputy head of the international affairs committee of the Russian parliament’s upper chamber, has previously said that Russia will not allow the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces from Transnistria. “Any attempts by irresponsible politicians in Chisinau to question this role of peacekeepers, to push through a change in the format of the peacekeeping operation with the withdrawal of Russian troops from the region will lead to destabilization and the inevitable resumption of bloodshed,” he said. Meanwhile, Transnistria’s foreign minister has made some other controversial statements over the last two days. He told RIA Novosti that the region would seek independence with subsequent accession to Russia in accordance with 2006 referendum results. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that he couldn’t comment on Ignatiev’s statement as he was not aware “which processes it was related to.” At a press conference on Friday, Ignatiev clarified that the possibility of Transnistria’s accession to Russia was “not being discussed” at present as this was a matter that required political preparation. However, he stressed that the decision made in 2006, when the region’s residents supported “the independent development of Transnistria and the subsequent free entry into the Russian Federation,” remains relevant. Transnistria, officially known as the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR), is an unrecognized state located along a narrow strip of land between the Dniester River and the Ukrainian border in the eastern part of Moldova."
2022-07-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/559474-ukraine-uk-navy-drill/,Ukrainian sailors trained in Scotland to fight Russia,"The Royal Navy is training Ukrainian sailors in Scotland in an attempt to support Kiev in its fight with Russia, the British military said on Friday. The exercises were attended by Vladimir Gavrilov, Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, and UK Armed Forces Minister James Heappey. The exact location of the drill is undisclosed for security reasons. The ministers observed the sailors practicing key skills at sea, learning weapon drills, damage control and how to operate machinery on vessels.According to the Navy, 80 Ukrainian servicemen are receiving “comprehensive, expert instruction.” At the same time, the UK intends to sell Kiev two soon-to-be-retired Sandown-class minehunters. “We really need them to support Ukrainian efforts in the Black sea for the mining. It’s also a part of humanitarian mission which is very important to the world,” Gavrilov said. “The intensity with which the Ukrainian soldiers and sailors are training is something to behold. They work with the focus of troops who know they’ll be fighting in a war in just a few short weeks’ time,” Heappey added. The Royal Navy’s participation in the exercise is part of a UK-led military program that involves more than 1,000 British service personnel in various regions of the country. The drill is supposed to give volunteer recruits, that have limited military experience, the skills to perform in frontline combat. The joint exercises come as the UK decided to send another batch of anti-tank weapons, drones, artillery guns as well as tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition to Ukraine. Earlier, London also provided Kiev with financial support to the tune of £2.3 billion ($2.76 billion) to help the nation fight off Russia’s offensive. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.”In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-07-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/559443-ukraine-grain-deal-sealed/,Deal struck on Ukraine grain exports,"A deal to unblock much-awaited grain exports from Ukraine was signed at the UN-brokered talks in Istanbul, Turkey on Friday. Under the terms of the deal, which was agreed provisionally last week, representatives of Ukraine, Russia, the UN, and Turkey agreed to open a joint coordination center in Istanbul to oversee shipments from Ukraine, and to maintain safe transit routes for these shipments across the Black Sea. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and his Turkish counterpart, Hulusi Akar signed an agreement with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, while Ukrainian Infrastructure Minister Aleksandr Kubrakov signed a separate document with Akar, completing the deal. Guterres described the signing as “a beacon of relief in a world that needs it more than ever,” and thanked Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his “persistence” in getting the agreement signed. Guterres also praised Russian and Ukrainian officials for “putting aside [their] differences” for the sake of the world’s food supply, particularly in developing countries. Wheat deliveries from Ukraine, a major producer, were disrupted after Russia launched its military operation in the neighboring state in late February. The sides previously blamed each other for causing the crisis. Ukraine and some Western officials have accused Russia of deliberately preventing the shipments by blockading the country’s Black Sea ports. Moscow insists that Ukraine made the shipments impossible by laying naval mines outside of the ports, including Odessa. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned in March that delays in shipments of wheat from Ukraine and Russia could lead to “a hurricane of hunger and a meltdown of the global food system.” He said that 45 African and other less developed countries receive at least a third of their wheat from either Ukraine or Russia, and that for 18 of them, these exports make up at least 50%."
2022-07-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/559454-donbass-bans-google-propaganda/,Donbass republics ban Google,"The Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has decided to block Google in an attempt to shield the local population from “threats” coming from both the West and Kiev, DPR leader Denis Pushilin announced on Friday. The Russian and DPR leadership are taking steps to protect Donbass, as “the West and Ukraine are placing unprecedented pressure on the Republic and creating threats to both physical and psychological security,” Pushilin wrote on Telegram. “The purpose of this pressure is to intimidate the citizens of the Donetsk People’s Republic, to break their spirit.” Although he expressed confidence that the West will not succeed, Pushilin said action had to be taken, adding that “the ruthless propaganda” from Ukraine and the West has gone over the edge, with Russians being persecuted, and “disinformation and lies” being spread. In this regard, Google search engine, which is at the forefront of information technologies, openly promotes terrorism and violence against all Russians, and especially the Donbass population, acting at the behest of its supervisors from the US government. “To my mind, this situation can be tolerated no more. We have decided to block Google on the territory of the DPR. This is what any society would do to criminals – it isolates them from other people,” Pushilin said. He noted that the decision would be reversed if Google backtracks on its “criminal policies,” embraces common sense, and complies with the law. A similar statement to this effect was made by the authorities of the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR), with its head, Leonid Pasechnik, saying Google has become “the main weapon” used by the West and Ukraine in their media offensive against Donbass. “We will do fine without Google. If they redeem themselves and start respecting people – we will think about its return,” he said. The move to ban Google in the DPR comes after Russia fined the company 21 billion rubles ($356 million) on Monday, citing its failure to delete prohibited information on the Ukraine conflict. Russia has long been critical of the way foreign platforms deal with online content. In March, it introduced a law that allows substantial fines or more severe punishment to be imposed on persons and entities deemed to be discrediting the Russian Armed Forces and spreading false information about the conflict."
2022-07-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/559444-russia-unfriendly-states-diplomats/,Russia adds five more states to 'unfriendly' list,"Russia extended its list of states considered adversarial on Friday to include Greece, Denmark, Slovenia, Croatia and Slovakia. “The government has updated the list of foreign states engaged in unfriendly actions against Russian diplomatic and consular missions abroad,” the statement reads. The decree imposes restrictions (up to a complete ban) on the countries hiring local personnel for their embassies, consulates, and representative offices of government agencies in Russia. Greece has a limit of 34 people, Denmark – 20, Slovakia – 16. “Slovenia and Croatia cannot hire employees for their diplomatic missions and consular institutions,” the government said. Similar restrictions were imposed on the US and Czech missions in May 2021. Russian authorities also signaled that the list was open-ended and could be expanded to more nations, given “the ongoing hostile actions by foreign states against Russian representative offices abroad.” “Of course, ending up on the list of hostile countries leads to a lower level of contacts… Simply put, the move is based on the unfriendly policies pursued by these states,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday. In May, Russian President Vladimir Putin introduced a package of economic measures meant to retaliate against international sanctions placed on Moscow. The move aimed to protect Russia’s national interests in response to the unfriendly actions of Western countries to illegally deprive Russian entities of their property, the Kremlin said at the time. In March, following Russia’s attack on Ukraine and fierce pushback from Western countries, Moscow introduced a lengthy list of foreign states that pursue hostile policies towards Russia. All the countries mentioned in it, including the US, the UK, Canada, and EU countries, have slapped sanctions on Russia."

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has added that Kiev has agreed to remove “only a few” of the mines which have been blocking naval traffic since Russia launched its military offensive in February. Under the proposals, Ukraine's Navy and Coast Guard would steer grain ships to international waters, the report explained. Wheat shipments from Ukraine, a major exporter, were disrupted after Russia launched its military operation in the neighboring country in late February. Both sides blame each other for hampering the exports. According to the report, foreign crews would take the ship to Istanbul, Turkey, where they would continue on to other destinations. A control center would be set up in Istanbul to oversee operations, while Turkish officials would check the ships to assure Moscow that they aren’t used to deliver weapons to Ukraine. Two senior European officials were quoted as saying they were optimistic that a deal would be struck at the UN-sponsored talks in Istanbul on Friday. Western politicians accused Russia of deliberately blocking grain exports from Ukraine by blockading Black Sea ports. Moscow says the deliveries are not possible due to Ukrainian naval mines. The Russian Navy has offered to safely escort all grain ships."
2022-07-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/559437-ukraine-confiscate-russian-gas/,Ukraine should ‘confiscate’ Russian gas – politician,"Ukraine should “confiscate” Russian gas from transit pipelines, Dmitry Razumkov, the former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, the country’s parliament, has argued. Russia transports some of its gas to Western Europe using a route through Ukraine created during the Soviet-era. Razumkov, who was Rada speaker between 2019 and 2021, said the state of the Ukrainian economy is “close to a catastrophe.” “As a transit country, we must fulfill obligations to our international partners. But surplus Russian gas should be confiscated in accordance with the law and pumped into our storages,” Razumkov wrote in a column for the Ukrainska Pravda newspaper on Wednesday. “Because we have a paradoxical situation: every single day we are pumping millions of cubic meters of Russian gas and don’t fill our own storages to a required capacity.” Razumkov added that the government and state oil and gas company Naftogaz must adopt a strategic plan to “ensure the energy security of Ukraine.” “A difficult winter awaits us,” Razumkov warned, adding that Ukrainians may have to “get used to having a 16C temperature at home.”“We have only 11 billion cubic meters of gas today. It’s unclear how much Ukraine will manage to pump [to storages] by fall.”"
2022-07-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/559417-lavrov-africa-food-deliveries/,Russia taking ‘all measures’ to deliver food to Africa - FM,"Russia will deliver contractually promised food, fertilizer, energy and other commodities to Africa, despite the difficulties created by Western sanctions, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov promised in an op-ed on Friday. Western and Ukrainian propaganda accusing Moscow of trying to starve Africa is unfounded and seeks to deflect their own blame, he said. “We are well aware of the importance of Russian supplies of socially important commodities, including food, to many countries around the world. We are mindful that these supplies play an important role in preserving social stability,” Lavrov said. Kiev has accused Moscow of “blockading” Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea and not allowing an estimated 20 million tons of grain to be shipped to customers around the world. Russia has repeatedly pointed out that the ports had been mined by Ukrainian government forces, and that the Russian Navy has offered to safely escort all grain ships. The US and its allies insist that their embargo against Russia in the name of supporting Ukraine does not apply to grain and fertilizers. However, as Lavrov pointed out in an interview with RT and Sputnik earlier this week, the sanctions have denied insurance to Russian ships while blocking foreign vessels from Russian ports, effectively cutting off supplies to Africa by sea. Western sanctions have “further exacerbated negative trends” in global commodity markets that began during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the collective West flooded them with freshly printed money, according to Lavrov. “It is essential that all our African friends understand that Russia will continue to fulfill in good faith its obligations under international contracts with regard to exports of food, fertilizers, energy and other goods vital for Africa,” the Russian foreign minister wrote, adding that Moscow is “taking all measures to this end.” Lavrov reminded Africans that Russia is not “stained with the bloody crimes of colonialism” on the continent, but has instead “sincerely supported Africans in their struggle for liberation from colonial oppression,” over the years, including economic, military and educational assistance. Russia “does not impose anything on anyone or tell others how to live,” Lavrov argued. “We treat with great respect the sovereignty of the States of Africa, and their inalienable right to determine the path of their development for themselves.” Moscow's principle of “African solutions to African problems” is in stark contrast to the “master – slave” logic of the former colonial powers, the Russian diplomat noted. Relations between Russia and African nations are “of an intrinsic value and do not depend on fluctuations in the international environment,” Lavrov pointed out in closing. “It is good to see that our African friends have a similar understanding.”"
2022-07-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/559420-polar-bear-rescue-siberia/,Russian scientists save tongue-tied polar bear,"Russian authorities flew a team of veterinarians all the way from Moscow to save a polar bear in the remote Arctic settlement of Dikson on Thursday. The female got her tongue stuck in a can of condensed milk and was slowly starving to death. A video of the bear begging for help on the porch of a house in Dikson went viral in Russia this week. “Half her tongue was stuck in the can,” Alexander Makarkin, the airport employee who recorded the video, told Russian media outlets. The bear had walked up to the porch of his house and Makarkin tried to remove the can from her mouth, capturing the moment on his cellphone camera. Suffering polar bear seeks human help pic.twitter.com/nPlpdGT15Y A team of specialists from the Moscow Zoo made the 2,730-kilometer (1,696-mile) trip to the Russian Arctic. Upon their arrival on Thursday, they quickly tranquilized the bear and gently removed the metal can from her tongue, which was severely injured. The female, whom they named “Monetka” (coin) was then given an infusion to recover her strength, and airlifted away from Dikson by helicopter. “We spotted the bear about three kilometers from the Dikson airport,” said Svetlana Radionova, head of Russia’s natural resource management agency Rosprirodnadzor, on her Telegram channel. “Our specialists managed to tranq her with their first shot. She was asleep within ten minutes and we successfully removed the can. Now a veterinarian is treating her tongue, which has many cuts.” The bear turned out to be a female, about two years old, and weighed less than 90 kilograms (198 pounds). She could not eat or drink for days, said Mikhail Alshinetsky, one of the veterinarians who flew into Dikson. “The tongue is damaged, but will most likely recover because the underlying muscles are not affected,” said Alshinetsky. Radionova explained that the plan was to keep the bear sedated until her tongue could be patched up, then airlift her away from town and leave her in the wilderness about 60-100 kilometers (37-62 miles) away, with “three sacks of fish” she can eat until she’s well enough to hunt. “We will keep an eye on her, to make sure she’s all right,” she added. Rosprirodnadzor organized the rescue expedition, headed by the chief veterinarian of the Moscow Zoo, Dmitry Egorov, within a day of Makarkin’s video making the rounds. Unfortunately, bad weather kept them waiting for several hours in Norilsk, the nearest major city. Dikson is a community of fewer than 600 residents in Krasnoyarsk Region, near where the Yenisei River flows into the Kara Sea. It is the northernmost human settlement on the Asian continent, and was named after Baron Oscar Dickson, a 19th-century Swedish pioneer of Arctic exploration."
2022-07-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/559421-israel-russia-jewish-agency/,Russia tells Jewish Agency to leave,"Israel will send a delegation to Moscow “to ensure the continuation” of the Jewish Agency’s activity in Russia, the prime minister’s office announced on Thursday. Moscow’s Basmanny District Court said earlier that it had received a request from the Justice Ministry to liquidate the Russian branch of the agency. The potential closure of the organization, which promotes the repatriation of Jews to Israel, prompted Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid to conduct “a situation assessment” with diplomats and members of the National Security Council. “It was decided to send a joint delegation from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration to ensure the continuation of the Jewish Agency’s activity in Russia,” the office said in a statement. An additional inter-agency meeting will take place on Sunday. “The Jewish community in Russia is deeply connected with Israel. Its importance arises in every diplomatic discussion with the Russian leadership. We will continue to act through diplomatic channels so that the Jewish Agency’s important activity will not cease,” Lapid said. The Moscow court said that the pretrial hearing was set for July 28. It didn’t reveal the details of the Justice Ministry’s arguments, saying merely that the request to terminate the Jewish Agency’s operations was related to its alleged violation of Russian law. According to the newspaper Haaretz, a letter from the Justice Ministry to the agency’s office in Moscow sent on July 1 stated that the organization was in breach of laws related to data storage and protection. However, the outlet stressed that the ministry did not at that time explicitly demand immediate cessation of the agency’s operations. In early July, meanwhile, the Jerusalem Post, citing its own sources, said that the Russian authorities had ordered the Jewish Agency to stop all of its activities. The organization later refuted this information, while the Russian Foreign Ministry called the article “a provocation,” a view that it shared with the Israeli authorities. The Jewish Agency, founded in 1929, first assisted in repatriating Jews to Palestinian lands, and after Israel gained independence, to the state of Israel. Its offices and partners, according to its website, operate in the cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg, Samara, Rostov, Pyatigorsk, Yekaterinburg, Irkutsk, Novosibirsk and Khabarovsk. As Haaretz reports, citing internal figures of the Aliyah and Integration Ministry, the last few months coinciding with the Russian military offensive in Ukraine have seen a sharp increase in immigration from Russia to Israel. In the first six months of the year, the number of Russians who relocated to Israel totaled 16,598, which is more than double the number who emigrated to the country throughout all of last year. It is also nearly 40% above the number of Ukrainians who have moved to Israel over the first half of this year."
2022-07-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/559422-putin-saudi-crown-prince-opec/,Putin speaks to Saudi crown prince,"Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the situation in global oil markets with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a phone call on Thursday. The conversation came just a few days after US President Joe Biden traveled to Riyadh for an official visit which appears to have yielded mixed results. The Wall Street Journal has reported that relations between Washington and Riyadh have hit historic lows. According to the report, citing sources in both capitals, the personal enmity between US President Joe Biden and bin Salman has been an important factor in the fraying of relations. Meanwhile, Putin and Bin Salman praised the high level of “friendly” bilateral relations between the two nations and their cooperation within the OPEC+ group, the Kremlin said in a statement. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia, which together comprise OPEC+, are “consistently fulfilling their obligations” to keep the balance and stability in the global energy market, the two leaders said, according to the Kremlin. Last month, the group agreed to increase output by 648,000 barrels per day (bpd), or 0.7% of global demand, over July and August. The decision came as Western nations had been pressuring OPEC to address global energy shortages exacerbated by sanctions on Russia. The move, however, failed to drive oil prices lower at that time. On Thursday, Putin and bin Salman also discussed bilateral relations and focused on “expanding mutually beneficial trade and economic ties,” the Kremlin said. Back in May, Riyadh said that Russia’s military action in Ukraine would not affect Saudi Arabia’s relations with either Russia or Ukraine, as the kingdom sought to maintain its extensive trade relations with both countries. The two leaders also exchanged views on the situation in Syria, according to the Kremlin readout. On Tuesday, after the summit in Tehran where Putin met with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Russian president said the US should stop “looting” Syria. Hundreds of American troops are still present in Syria, where they are controlling the oil wells and wheat fields in the country’s northeast."
2022-07-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/559416-belarus-donetsk-lugansk-recognition/,Another country de facto recognizes Donbass republics,"Belarus will officially recognize the independence of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk if it becomes necessary, but the absence of a formal recognition isn’t stopping Minsk from helping them, President Alexander Lukashenko said on Thursday in an exclusive interview with Agence France-Presse. The French agency asked Lukashenko why Belarus, which supports Russia’s military operations in Ukraine, has not recognized the Donetsk People’s Republic and Lugansk People’s Republic as independent states – or Crimea as part of Russia, for that matter. Crimea voted to rejoin Russia in 2014, after the US-backed coup in Kiev. Donetsk and Lugansk declared independence later that year, after the Ukrainian government tried to seize control of them by force. Russia recognized the two republics in February. “There was no need for it,” Lukashenko responded. “But if Crimea, Lugansk, Donetsk need foodstuffs, bricks, cement, assistance with rebuilding, etc., we will help them. We will recognize them, if needed, if it makes any sense. But what difference will it make today if I recognize them publicly?” “The fact that we cooperate with Crimea, Lugansk, and Donetsk means that we recognize them de facto,” Lukashenko added. “And all these speculations about my recognition or non-recognition are just idle talk. I will recognize them by a presidential decree, if needed.” The leader of Belarus pointed out that France has pledged to rebuild the Kiev region of Ukraine, thereby essentially “partitioning” that country. “In other words, you have already divided Ukraine and will rebuild it. And I will help Lugansk and Donetsk. I will help Crimea. We cooperate with them, we do not hide it,” Lukashenko told AFP. Ukraine can decide to end the conflict tomorrow, but its backers in the West won’t allow it, Lukashenko also told the French agency. When asked about the status of Donetsk, Lugansk, and areas under the control of Russian troops, such as Kherson, the leader of Belarus said their fate was a foregone conclusion. “Listen, this is no longer under discussion. You could have talked about it in February-March,” said Lukashenko, accusing both the current Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and his predecessor, Pyotr Poroshenko, of pushing Moscow into a confrontation by banning the Russian language and otherwise mistreating the ethnic Russians and Russophone Ukrainians."
2022-07-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/559408-mirotvorets-website-ukraine-russia/,Russia sounds alarm over Ukraine labelling kids as ‘enemies’,"Russian human rights activists have discovered that the notorious Ukrainian website Mirotvorets (Peacemaker) features the personal details of 327 children. The revelation prompted the Russian authorities to share their concerns over this “huge injustice” with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. Since 2018, the website has published personal details – names, addresses, photos, social media pages – of children, the youngest of whom is not even 10 years old yet, the head of the Foundation for the Fight against Repressions, Mira Terada, said at a press conference in Moscow on Thursday. The latest post was dated February 4, 2022, she added. The Mirotvorets website was created in 2014 as a public database of “pro-Russian terrorists, separatists, mercenaries, war criminals, and murderers.” It was reportedly launched under the initiative of Anton Gerashchenko, an official adviser and a former deputy minister at the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs. He endorsed the project and often made statements on its behalf. Mirotvorets is widely believed to be run by Ukraine’s Security Service. According to Terada, the website’s servers are located in the US, which, she said, could mean it “was created with the support of American citizens or companies, probably not without the participation of special services.” “The human rights activists of the Foundation for the Fight against Repressions came to the conclusion that, as of today, the Ukrainian resource database contains personal data of at least 327 underage residents of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Armenia, of which 162 are girls and 165 are boys,” Terada said. The reasons for including children in the database are “as absurd as possible,” she added. “Each child is cynically accused by the administration and the creators of the resource of committing deliberate acts against the national security of Ukraine, peace and international law and order,” Terada said. According to her, many children have received threats of physical violence and of other types. Nevertheless, she claimed, “the Ukrainian government categorically refuses to restrict access to Mirotvorets.” “Only through joint efforts of the UN, UNICEF, Russian and international human rights organizations, it is possible to achieve a complete blocking of the Mirotvorets resource and the complete removal of the personal data of children and their parents,” the human rights activist concluded. Terada’s call was supported by the deputy head of Russia’s mission to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky. Speaking via videolink from New York, he said Russian diplomats had previously raised the issue of the violation of children’s rights – which he described as a “huge injustice” – with the UN secretary general and with UNICEF, but “no active actions followed.” Further discoveries made by the Foundation for the Fight Against Repressions prompted Polyansky to raise the issue again in a letter to Guterres, which he sent on Wednesday. “Our task is to show international organizations, our partners, who claim to belong to the civilized world, what is really happening in Ukraine,” the diplomat said. The Mirotvorets project gained notoriety in 2015, when writer and historian Oles Buzina and politician Oleg Kalashnikov were assassinated in Ukraine after their profiles appeared on the website. In 2016, EU officials and journalist groups condemned Mirotvorets for leaking data on more than 4,000 members of the media."
2022-07-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/559399-russia-sniper-rifle-ukraine/,World’s longest-range sniper rifle used in Ukraine – media,"The “super-long-range” Sumrak (Twilight) sniper rifle has been used for the first time by Russian soldiers in Ukraine, TASS reported on Thursday, citing a security source. Snipers have operated the gun near Kiev, as well as in the area of Kharkov in eastern Ukraine, but “rarely,” because it has not always been possible to find suitable terrain, the source told the outlet. There has been no official confirmation of the information, the agency added. The single-shot bolt action weapon, designed in 2012 by Russian firm Lobaev Arms, the SVLK-14S Sumrak can effectively hit targets at a range of up to 2,700 meters (1.6 miles), according to the manufacturer. In 2020, Britain’s Daily Mirror newspaper described the Sumrak as “the world’s most deadly sniper rifle,” noting that it has nearly double the effective range of the L115A3, the British Army’s sniper rifle. In 2017, a bullet from the Sumrak traveled 4,210 meters (2.6 miles) before hitting a target at a shooting range in Russia, which reportedly set a world record."
2022-07-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/559395-cia-putin-health/,Putin 'too healthy' – CIA chief,"President Vladimir Putin is “entirely too healthy,” CIA Director William Burns said on Wednesday, dispelling speculation about the Russian leader's wellbeing. “There are a lot of rumors about President Putin’s health, and as far as we can tell, he is entirely too healthy. It’s not a formal intelligence judgment,” he said, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum. The CIA chief’s comments were later echoed by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who claimed on Thursday that the Russian leader is in good health. “Ukrainian, US, and British would-be media professionals have been spreading bogus stories about the president’s health condition in recent months. This is all hoax,” he said. Peskov also addressed the fact that the president apologized for a cough at the Strong Ideas for a New Time forum. The Kremlin spokesman attributed it to overexposure to air conditioning during the Tehran visit. “As for the air conditioners, that’s true, it’s hot outside, 40C, but it’s chilly under the AC. My voice became husky too. Such things happen, no big deal,” Peskov explained. Earlier this week, Putin made a trip to Tehran for talks with his Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi and Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The remarks by both Burns and Peskov come after a flurry of speculation in Western media and from officials about Putin being in poor health and purporting that he had undergone a cancer treatment and even survived an assassination attempt. Ukrainian officials have also participated in the conjecturing. In late June, Defense Intelligence chief Kirill Budanov claimed that “Putin doesn't have a long life ahead of him,” citing a supposed Ukrainian spy ring in the Kremlin. Moscow has repeatedly denied the claims of ill health."
2022-07-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/559392-bill-gates-farmland-purchase/,From Powerpoint to Potatoes: Why is Bill Gates buying so much land?,"In late June, the North Dakota Attorney General approved the purchase of 2,100 acres of farmland by a company tied to Bill Gates. Red River Trust bought it from potato growers Campbell Farms for about $13.5 million. According to legal documents obtained by FOX Business, the sale was made last November. Media reports suggest that the reaction of locals to the deal was far from positive. “I’ve gotten a big earful on this from clear across the state, it’s not even from that neighborhood. Those people are upset, but there are others that are just livid about this,” North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring told local television station KFYR. Other concerns cited in the media insist that “ultra-rich who buy land in North Dakota… do not necessarily share the state’s values.” Before it was revealed that the deal had been approved, the office of the Attorney General sent Red River Trust a letter asking how the company planned to use the land. “In North Dakota… all corporations or limited liability companies (LLC) are prohibited from owning or leasing farmland or ranchland, and from engaging in farming or ranching. In addition, the law places certain limitations on the ability of trusts to own farmland or ranchland. The Corporate or Limited Liability Company Farming Law has certain exemptions, such as permitting registered family farms or allowing the use of the land for business purposes…” “Our office needs to confirm how your company uses this land and whether this use meets any of the statutory exceptions, such as the business purpose exception…” The letter required an answer within 30 days, but there’s no information about whether Red River Trust had anything to reply. The news of the purchase made headlines, as many people found it surprising that the Microsoft co-founder is spending so much money on agriculture. Still, the North Dakota case is just the latest example of a billionaire’s investment in farmland making big news. Summarizing the data as of 2020, a magazine called The Land Report put Bill Gates’ photo on its cover with the caption ‘Meet Farmer Bill’. The outlet called Gates and his then-wife Melinda “America’s largest private farmland owners.” In tracking the history of Gates’ investments, The Land Report cited a 2014 article from the Wall Street Journal about a man named Michael Larson, who, according to the outlet, has managed the billionaire’s investment empire since 1994, “mostly through a firm called Cascade Investment LLC.” “The Wyoming ranch is part of a bet by Cascade on the steep rebound in real-estate prices since the financial crisis,” the WSJ reported, citing its sources. “The firm owns at least 100,000 acres of farmland in California, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana and other states – or an area seven times bigger than Manhattan.” In 2021, The Land Report said that Gates owned almost 269,000 acres across the country. The same year, Reddit users had a chance to ask the Microsoft co-founder about the reasons behind such a large investment. The question was “hey Bill! Why are you buying so much farmland?” “My investment group chose to do this. It is not connected to climate,” Gates replied. “The agriculture sector is important. With more productive seeds we can avoid deforestation and help Africa deal with the climate difficulty they already face. It is unclear how cheap biofuels can be but if they are cheap it can solve the aviation and truck emissions.” The uproar over Gates’ latest land purchase created a wave of discussion online. During the height of the Covid pandemic, the Microsoft co-founder was often in the limelight due to his pronouncements about the virus, and even became the subject of conspiracy theories. So, there’s no surprise that his unusual investment unleashed online gossip as well, sparking rumors that the billionaire owns the majority of US farmland. Actually, there are some 895 million acres of farmland in the country. So even while being the largest private farmland owner, Gates actually has less than 1% of the country’s total. And, no matter how eccentric the Microsoft co-founder can be, the reasons behind his farmland investment are most likely mundane, experts say. “If you look at farmland purchases in the United States, the overwhelming majority is acquired by farmers. The next largest group are people somehow close to farming, like retired farmers, or people from the rural area that are interested in purchasing land. People who put together large portfolios are pretty rare,” Todd H. Kuethe, an associate professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics at Purdue University in the US, told RT. “Usually, they’re buying it for the financial position and so that land usually stays in production. There’s no disappearance of that land.” Still, Bill Gates’ years-long investment in land elicited a question from analysts: Is farmland such an attractive asset? The answer is yes, for several reasons: farmland is a limited resource, offers strong returns, and is a stable and low-risk asset. Interest in farmland is rising, and prices are climbing accordingly. Last year’s data show the value of US farm real estate having averaged $3,380 per acre, up 7% compared with 2020. “The US farmland has been increasing in price in recent years because of high returns and low interest rates,”Carl Zulauf, a professor emeritus in the Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics at The Ohio State University, explained to RT. “The high returns have been from the market and from government programs.” Non-farm investors often see farmland as part of a diversified investment portfolio that will reduce their overall investment risk. There is some evidence that farmland can stabilize returns of a well-diversified portfolio. The importance of this factor varies over time but is likely related in part to the volatility of the stock market. Kuethe agrees: “It's a really nice thing to be added to a broad investment portfolio, to give you some of those diversification advantages. Farmland is an attractive investment, and a lot of folks see the value of adding it to an investment portfolio. It’s a relatively lower risk than investing in equities or buying individual stocks, but it offers a little bit higher return than just bond purchases. So, it sits in the middle – a financial investment where you can get a little bit higher return, but not that much additional risk.” After all, stability seems to mean a lot nowadays. Years of the Covid-19 pandemic, marked by lockdowns, and the current conflict in Ukraine, which disrupted trade, particularly of grain supplies, made more countries look carefully at their food security. Still, Kuethe thinks that all of these factors are not enough to make individual businessmen buy land for personal consumption. “I don’t think that investors are looking for farming for their own consumption, they’re still looking at producing commodities for the global market,” he says. “I don’t have the concern that people are going to start buying up land and wanting to farm themselves because they’re worried about food insecurity.”"
2022-07-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/559378-medvedev-west-sins-list/,Former Russian president lists ‘Western sins’,"Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has compiled what he called a list of “their sins,” a reference to what he sees as the shortcomings of the US and Europe. The list was published on Medvedev’s Telegram channel on Thursday and comes a day after the former president outlined Russia’s ‘sins’, a mocking exhortation to the West to blame Moscow for all manner of ills, from US President Joe Biden’s gaffes to even the extinction of the dinosaurs. “THEIR SINS (what Russia is not guilty of): European fools being cynically conned by the Americans, who forced them to endure the most painful consequences of the sanctions that have hit the populations of EU countries; ordinary Europeans freezing cold in their homes this winter; the highest food inflation in decades in Europe and the United States; EU and US companies losing their multibillion-dollar investments in the Russian economy,” he wrote. Medvedev added that Moscow has nothing to do with “Americans electing a strange old man with dementia who, having forgotten about his duties, loves another country much more than his own.” He also noted that Russia is not to blame for “town crazies who proclaimed themselves the EU leadership irrevocably losing touch with reality and making poor Ukrainians sacrifice their lives to join the EU.” The ex-president also mentioned NATO’s encroachment on Russia’s borders, a process that is “contrary to reason and common sense,” he said. According to Medvedev, Russia should not have to take the blame for the “numerous political crooks that are leveraging the issue of restoring Ukraine’s statehood to its former borders as they plan to receive new military contracts and embezzle the cash flows earmarked for the Kiev regime.” Nor is Russia responsible for “Ukraine losing its independence and coming under the direct control of the collective West after the 2014 coup” and the fact that “Ukrainian criminals will certainly be tried for their atrocities committed against the people of Ukraine and Russia.” The former Russian president came up with the list after Biden repeatedly attempted to pin the blame for the record gas prices and 40-year-high inflation on Russia and the Ukraine conflict. However, according to a Rasmussen poll conducted in June, only 11% of Americans believed that “Putin’s price hike,” a term coined by the US president, was responsible for their economic woes. Meanwhile, more than half (52%) of respondents cited Biden’s poor energy policies as the culprit. The EU has also tried to point the finger at Russia. In late June, for instance, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock accused Moscow of triggering a food crisis and using global hunger as “a weapon” by blocking Ukrainian grain shipments. These barbs were later addressed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who noted that Western nations are deliberately stirring up tensions over Ukrainian exports, while Moscow is ready to provide free passage to grain ships."
2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559352-china-ambassador-ukraine-ceasefire/,China calls for ‘immediate ceasefire’ in Ukraine,"China wants an “immediate ceasefire” in Ukraine and the resumption of talks between all of the parties involved in the conflict, including the US and NATO, its ambassador to the US Qin Gang said on Wednesday. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado, Qin said that the ongoing conflict in Ukraine was “spilling over” and causing “multiple crises,” including an economic downturn, an influx of migrants, and energy and food shortages. “So what China is calling for is immediate ceasefire, resumption of peace talks. All parties involved should be engaged, including between Russia and US and its NATO allies,” the ambassador said. He called on the sides to “sit down, calm down to find a way out of [the] dilemma” which would be based “on the principle of accommodating each other’s legitimate concerns.” “Only by doing so can we achieve peace and can we restore the security in Europe which should be stable, should be comprehensive, should be balanced, effective and sustainable,” the diplomat said, adding that this position was shared by other developing countries. According to the ambassador, Beijing believes that “national sovereignty and the territorial integrity of all countries must be respected” and that “the legitimate security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously.” Meanwhile, two days ago, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba declared that peace negotiations with Moscow would make sense only after Russia’s defeat on the battlefield. By saying so, he echoed the remarks of EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who claimed that, “This war [in Ukraine] will be won on the battlefield.” Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova responded to Kuleba’s statement by saying that the Ukrainian government did not seek peace for the country and, instead of talking with Russia, was choosing to sing along to Washington’s “tune.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has previously accused the US and its allies of “actively betting on the continued war” and of not allowing Kiev “to think nor talk about or discuss peace.” Moscow and Kiev started peace talks four days after the start of the Russian military offensive in Ukraine in late February. The sides have held several rounds in person in Belarus and then continued the talks via video link. In late March, the delegations from Russia and Ukraine met once again, in Istanbul. Since then, however, the talks have stalled."
2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559311-neo-nazi-attack-donbass-repel/,WATCH: Russian forces repel neo-Nazi attack in Donbass,"As Ukrainian forces recently attempted to assault the town of Belogorovka in the Lugansk People’s Republic, RT had a crew nearby. TV Correspondent Murad Gazdiev reported, from the scene, that the attack, led by the infamous ‘Kraken’ neo-Nazi battalion, was met with a “hail of artillery fire."" The offensive was successfully defeated following close-quarter combat on the outskirts of the settlement. Russian troops captured four Kraken fighters. One of them, identified only as Dmitry, told RT that morale in the nationalist unit was extremely low and the commanders treated soldiers like “earthworms” by simply “crushing them underfoot” and forcing them to launch assaults. The battalion has been stationed in the north-eastern Ukrainian city for months, Dmitry said. Dmitry himself was left behind by his fellow fighters during the hasty and chaotic retreat of the ‘Kraken’ battalion from Belogorovka. The man claimed he was part of a Ukrainian Kharkov “territorial defense” unit until it was “merged” with Kraken. According to him, the Kraken had to frequently change their base locations in the city since the locals have been exposing it and making it public on social media. Kharkov has been traditionally seen as a city with a rather strong pro-Russian sentiment. Delete According to Dmitry, the nationalists had to frequently change their base locations in the city since locals were exposing it and publishing it on social media. Eventually, the battalion was sent to frontlines not far from Belogorovka, some 200 kilometers away from Kharkov. That happened, the captive alleged, soon after bodies were found in a battalion member's backyard. The seven bodies discovered in the yard allegedly belonged to civilians killed by a ‘Kraken’ member, Dmitry said. The captive did not elaborate on whether any punitive measures had been taken against the suspected killer. The man called the neo-Nazis “savages” and said he would not “go back” even if Ukrainian forces offered to exchange him for Russian captives. In late June, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that its forces had killed over one hundred Kraken battalion fighters in a series of precision artillery strikes against targets near Kharkov. Moscow considers the battalion an offshoot of the notorious neo-Nazi Azov regiment, which saw a large amount of its fighters surrender in the city of Mariupol in the spring. A video that circulated online showed the neo-Nazis shooting POWs in the knees and killing them. Kraken calls itself a special reconnaissance and sabotage unit under the Ministry of Defense, operating separately from the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Moscow has accused the battalion of committing several war crimes since the beginning of the conflict, including the mistreatment of Russian prisoners of war. A video that circulated on the internet showed the neo-Nazis shooting the POWs in the knees and killing them. The head of Russia’s National Defense Control Center, Mikhail Mizintsev, has also previously accused Kraken members of harassing Kharkov region residents and of conducting “punitive raids” against people suspected of harboring pro-Russian sentiments."
2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559340-ukraine-western-weapons-problems/,Diversity of Western weapons creates trouble for Ukraine – media,"The wide variety of weapons systems supplied to Ukraine by the West is proving a “serious challenge” for Kiev, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing US and UK think tanks. While insisting that the weapons are “effective” in the fight against Russia, analysts say the piecemeal delivery of multiple different systems has created a “logistical nightmare” for Kiev. Early on in the conflict, the US and its allies sent Ukraine portable Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and Javelin anti-tank rockets, but quickly depleted their own stocks. In April, the White House announced the first delivery of heavy artillery – M777 towed howitzers – followed by HIMARS multiple rocket launch systems in June. Kiev has so far received M777 guns from the US, Australia and Canada, but also a number of self-propelled systems such as the US M109, the German Panzerhaubitze (PzH) 2000, France’s Caesar and the Polish Krab, among others. While in theory they all share the same 155-caliber projectiles, things are not so simple in practice. “None of these systems have that much commonality,” Jack Watling of the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank told the Journal. “Ammunition should be interchangeable, etc. But that’s not the case.” Watling co-authored the RUSI report published earlier this month, which argued that the “current approach by which each country donates a battery of guns in a piecemeal way is rapidly turning into a logistical nightmare for Ukrainian forces with each battery requiring a separate training, maintenance and logistics pipeline.” Some of it was based on input from Ukrainian military and intelligence officials. The diverse artillery systems have different ranges, propellant charges, loading mechanisms, spare parts and maintenance requirements, among other things. One example cited was the PzH 2000, which has “specific requirements for loading charges” and takes 40 days of training Ukrainians in how to operate and maintain the dozen or so they’ve received so far. Scott Boston, a senior defense analyst at the US-based RAND Corporation, pointed out other challenges in dealing with Western-made systems. “A lot of the Ukrainian stuff is legacy – 40-year-old vehicles that you fix with a hammer and a wrench, brute force, lubricants and prayer. If you think about how a mechanic fixes a modern consumer automobile – with a hand-held computer that you hook up to read the sensors inside the vehicle – it is going to be different,” he told the Journal, adding that not having spare parts other than what comes in from the West is further complicating matters. Ukraine is effectively suffering from too much diversity of weapons, and RUSI’s Watling has suggested the West should try to limit the number of different systems it’s sending to Kiev. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559338-putin-predicts-revolutionary-changes/,Putin predicts ‘revolutionary’ changes,"A new epoch of world history is approaching and only “truly sovereign” states will be able to succeed in the changed environment, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday. Speaking at a business forum, Putin claimed that “truly revolutionary,” “enormous” changes would lead to the creation of a new, “harmonious, fairer and more community-focused and safe” world order. In this new epoch, “only truly sovereign states can ensure high growth dynamics,” he said. By the term ‘sovereignty’ the Russian president means “freedom of national development, and thus of each person individually,” as well as “technological, cultural, intellectual, educational viability of the state” and a “responsible, active and nationally minded, nationally oriented civil society.” Such a state, the president said, will serve as an example for others when it comes to “the standards and quality of people’s life, the protection of traditional values and high humanistic ideals.” This kind of world is in sharp contrast to the Western-dominated unipolar world order, which, in Putin’s opinion, is “becoming a brake on the development of our civilization.” He accused the West of being “racist and neo-colonial,” saying that its ideology “is becoming increasingly more like totalitarianism.” The president argued that despite attempts by Western elites to preserve the existing world order, the changes are “irreversible.” Putin has been discussing the end of the “unipolar” world for a long time. In his famous 2007 Munich Security Conference speech, the Russian president said that “the unipolar world that had been proposed after the Cold War did not take place.” He explained that a world of “one master, one sovereign” is destructive not only for everyone within the system but also for the sovereign itself. He accused the US of neglecting the “basic principles of international law” and stressed that “unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions” had never solved any problems. In May, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed hope that his country’s military offensive in Ukraine, when completed, would force the Western nations “to stop promoting the so-called unipolar world under the dominance of the United States and its allies.” The idea of a new “multipolar” world has been discussed in the West, too, most recently by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. However, following Moscow's offensive in Ukraine, the West declared its intention to “isolate” Russia and imposed tough sanctions on it. Russia views these actions as another manifestation of Western attempts to “contain” it and maintain the existing world order."
2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559337-ukraine-shelling-villages-casualties/,Ukrainian shelling leaves one person dead – governor,"The villages of Zhuravlyovka and Nekhoteevka in Russia’s Belgorod Region bordering Ukraine have once again been shelled by Ukrainian troops, leaving one person dead and several buildings damaged, the region’s governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, claimed on Wednesday on his Telegram account. According to the governor, preliminary reports indicate the villages were hit by five shells in total, with no visible damages found in Zhuravlyovka. “In Nekhoteevka, four dwellings and a community club were hit, with further reports of damaged roofs, windows, and hedges. A local man born in 1958 was killed,” Gladkov said. Authorities are now trying to determine why the man was in the village at the time of the shelling, since it had previously been evacuated, the official added. “We relocated all the residents over a month ago,” he said. Gladkov had previously advised Belgorod Region residents to avoid visiting the border-straddling villages of Zhuravlyovka, Nekhoteevka, and Sereda until further notice. The region’s government announced a state of emergency in the villages on March 23, and most of their residents have since been evacuated to the city of Belgorod. Russian regions bordering Ukraine have been reporting attacks by Ukrainian forces since March, including mortar strikes, drone bombardments, and even suspected sabotage attempts. In May, a truck driver was killed in a mortar strike on the village of Tyotkino in Kursk Region, with several other civilians injured. Belgorod was hit by several ballistic missiles in July, killing a total of five civilians, and injuring at least five more."
2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559334-putin-coca-cola-chemicals/,Coca-Cola is ‘all chemicals’ – Putin,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has derided Coca-Cola and suggested that ‘Ivan Tea’ – a medicinal brew made from Siberian fireweed – is a more “useful” refreshment. Coca-Cola pulled out of the Russian market in June over Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine. Participating in the ‘Strong Ideas for New Times’ forum in Moscow on Wednesday, Putin was approached by Alexander Khlynov from the Union of Ivan Tea Producers, who proposed the government help boost production of the traditional Russian drink. Putin agreed to bring Khlynov’s proposal to Minister of Agriculture Dmitry Patrushev, and gave the tea his personal approval. “Indeed, it is certainly more useful than Coca-Cola,” he remarked, “which is all chemicals.” ‘Ivan Tea’ is made from the fermented leaves of the fireweed plant. Enjoyed for both its refreshing taste and its medicinal properties, it is a natural anti-inflammatory beverage, contains 16 amino acids, and is packed with vitamins B and C. Outside Russia, fireweed is consumed in the Canadian Yukon, where its flowers are made into jelly, and in the US Pacific Northwest, where honey produced from its pollen is highly regarded. Putin’s comments on Coca-Cola came after the American beverage giant announced last month that it would withdraw from the Russian market in response to Russia’s ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. The pullout followed similar moves by other iconic Western brands, including Starbucks and McDonald’s. The Russian president is not the only world leader to denigrate the sugary soft drink. Despite reportedly consuming up to a dozen cans of Diet Coke a day, former US President Donald Trump quipped on Twitter in 2012 that he had “never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke,” before suggesting that “the more Diet Coke, Diet Pepsi, etc you drink, the more weight you gain?” Donald Trump e a Coca-Cola pic.twitter.com/IchAZstisi While Diet Coke contains less than a single calorie per can, Trump concluded in yet another tweet that “this stuff just doesn’t work. It makes you hungry.” Finally, after apparently receiving some backlash from the company, Trump later tweeted “The Coca Cola company is not happy with me – that’s okay, I’ll still keep drinking that garbage.”"
2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559326-medvedev-president-sins-west/,Former president lists ‘sins of Russia’,"Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has compiled what he said is a list of Moscow’s ‘sins’, mocking the accusations hurled at the nation by the West. The list was published on Medvedev’s Telegram channel on Wednesday. “OUR SINS (what Russia is guilty of): Skyrocketing gas prices at all pumps in the US and their close allies; soaring prices for all food products in all stores across all continents; sweltering heat in the European resorts that torments all living beings; triggering the ‘sanctions from hell’ against Russia that hit defenseless European companies,” he wrote. Medvedev added that Russia is to blame for “[US President] Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. occasionally confusing words, failing to find the exit to the room, and reading technical notes on a teleprompter.” The list also included mail-in voting in the US, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz being called an “offended liverwurst,” (an insult made by former Ukrainian Ambassador Andrey Melnik), and all the resignations of European leaders since “Peter the Great arrogantly established the Russian Empire against all odds.” Medvedev continues, saying Russia is responsible for “public opinion manipulation with the help of Russian classical literature and symphonic music,” as well as “the wanton murder of the progressive European politician Gaius Julius Caesar committed by a gang of terrorists, including Publius Servilius Casca, Marcus Brutus, and other Russian hacks in order to split the Western world and promote anti-liberal values.” The ex-president concludes the open-ended list of Russia’s sins with the “unprovoked preemptive meteorite strike on our planet and the subsequent dinosaur extinction.” Medvedev’s comments come days after he claimed that Washington and London have drawn the “useful European idiots” into an economic war against Russia. “Washington in tandem with London conned the Europeans like a couple of shell-game tricksters,” he said at the time, referring to the record weakening of the euro."
2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/news/559315-lavrov-ukraine-grain-us/,UN chief ‘under huge pressure’ over Ukraine – Russian FM,"UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is under huge pressure from the US and its allies over the issue of Ukrainian grain stuck in Black Sea ports, Russian FM Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday in an interview with RT and Sputnik. “We are blamed for using hunger as a weapon” by the West, Lavrov said, rejecting those accusations as “lying.” Russian food products and fertilizers might not be directly subject to sweeping restrictions slapped on the country over its military operation in Ukraine, but they still can’t be exported because of “insurance, shipping, our vessels that are supposed to enter foreign ports and foreign vessels that are supposed to enter Russian ports to carry those commodities – that was sanctioned almost right away,” he explained. And the US and their allies now “want to drag the Secretary General of the UN into their games,” Lavrov said. In late April, Guterres “got really worried about the food crisis,” believed to be largely caused by the absence of Russian and Ukrainian grain on the market due to the conflict between the neighbors, and came to Moscow for talks with President Vladimir Putin, the top diplomat reminded. According to the minister, during those negotiations the UN chief offered Putin “a package deal.” Guterres promised to “make the US lift all the impediments on the path of your [Russian] grain” in exchange for Moscow – together with Turkey and other nations – removing the mines placed by Kiev in the Black Sea to allow Ukrainian grain to leave the ports and reach its customers, he said. Moscow accepted those terms, and Guterres promoted the deal for the last two months. Last week, Russian diplomats traveled to Istanbul in Turkey to discuss ways of implementing the UN chief’s plan. “They agreed on some basic principles, in accordance to which the Ukrainian grain would be exported. And when our delegation reminded about the second part of this package deal [regarding Russian grain]… the Ukrainians refused categorically. And the UN delegations – they were modestly keeping silent,” Lavrov revealed. When Moscow contacted Guterres on this development, the UN chief responded by suggesting to “first deal with the Ukrainian part and then we will deal with the Russian part,” according to the FM. “But that’s so just wrong, so dishonest for people, who are involved in high-level politics,” Lavrov insisted. However, he expressed belief that it likely wasn’t Guterres’s choice to behave in such a manner. “The Secretary General is under huge pressure from the US, and the UK, who are sitting in the secretariat around him, holding positions of the deputies. And they have privatized, basically, this structure [the UN] and they use it in their interests, which is sad,” the minister pointed out. During the interview, Lavrov also responded to Monday’s comments by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who claimed that Moscow “weaponized” economic integration. She also threatened nations seeking closer trade ties with Russia, including China, with harsh consequences. “It beats every other things that they [the US] used to say. But that’s them agonizing because they have no other explanation for their failures,” the foreign minister insisted."
2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/news/559324-putin-heads-youth-movement/,Putin to head all-Russian children and youth movement,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he would head the supervisory board of a new national children and youth movement. The president made the announcement while speaking with the participants of the all-Russian competition “Big Break.” One of the participants of the competition, Anastasia from St. Petersburg, said Putin should become the head of the council of observers for the new children and youth movement, which the Russian president signed into law earlier this month. “Okay, I agree, Nastya. It’s impossible to refuse after such a presentation,” the Russian leader said, adding that although children perhaps know less than adults, they feel things much more acutely and are more sincere. He noted that communication between children and adults was beneficial for both sides. “I gladly accept your offer. I hope that this communication between us and the movement will benefit both me and my colleagues, who in one way or another will be involved in the activities of this movement and with all of its participants as well,” the president said. The all-Russian youth and children’s movement is intended to be a massive non-profit self-governing organization. The goal of the movement is to prepare children for a full life in society by shaping their worldview on traditional Russian values and developing their creativity as well as love and respect for their country. Olga Kazakova, an MP and one of the founders of the initiative, said the movement would help children form real bonds and become part of a collective. “In a team, there are many different forms of communication that a child will encounter in adulthood. It is here that the child can get the first communication skills and understand how to get out of a conflict, how to care, how to empathize.” She also said the movement could guard children from the negative effects of social media, which have detached them from the real world. “Parents no longer understand their children, and most importantly, where the risk zones are hidden for them. Children have begun to leave parental and pedagogical attention. It is clear that the situation needs to change. Otherwise, children will lose protection,” she said. The movement will consist of young students, who will be the participants of the movement, while adults – including parents – will be their mentors. It is also specified that foreign agents or people cooperating with them will not be allowed to be mentors in the movement."

Speaking with RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan, the minister explained why, despite a promising start, peace talks with Ukraine effectively broke down in spring. He shared his views about the risks of a nuclear war with the West and how Western-supplied heavy weapons affect the fighting on the ground in Ukraine, as well as decision-making in Moscow regarding the conflict. Lavrov also discussed the effects of the sanctions on the European economy and the delivery of Russian gas to EU member states. You can watch the full interview here:"
2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559321-lavrov-russia-ukraine-frontline/,Lavrov tells RT what would push Moscow to redraw front line,"The use of Western-supplied heavy weapons by Kiev will only force Russia to move deeper into Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told RT and Sputnik on Wednesday. Lavrov told RT Editor-in-Chief, Margarita Simonyan that when negotiators met in Istanbul, Turkey on March 29-30, they were discussing “one geography,” referring to the areas controlled by Russia and the forces of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR). “Our willingness to accept Ukrainian suggestions was based on the geography as of the end of March, 2022,” the minister noted. “Now the geography is different. We’re not talking about the DPR, the LPR. We’re talking about Kherson Region, Zaporozhye Region and a number of other territories, and this process is ongoing.” Lavrov accused the West of exacerbating the conflict by “pumping” Ukraine with heavy weapons, including M142 HIMARS multiple rocket launchers and long-range munitions. “It means that we will have to put the line even further,” he said, adding that Moscow will not allow Ukrainian troops to threaten either Russia, or the Donbass republics. During its offensive, Russian and allied troops captured parts of southern Ukraine and pushed Ukrainian troops out of many towns in Donbass. The peace talks, meanwhile, have remained stalled since March, as Western politicians say that Kiev should not be pressured into giving up territory to Moscow. The Russian Embassy in Washington released a statement on Wednesday, saying that people living in Russian-controlled areas will “decide on their future independently, by themselves.”"
2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559319-zaporozhye-nuclear-power-plant-attacked/,Europe's largest Nuclear Power Plant attacked by Ukraine,"Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant has been attacked by three ‘kamikadze drones’ belonging to the Ukrainian armed forces, Russian media has reported, citing local officials. According to statements, Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, located in southeastern Ukraine but under the control of Moscow’s forces, has not been damaged and its reactor was not impacted by the attack. The radiation background is normal and it is constantly being monitored, Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Zaporozhye Region military-civil administration, told Tass news agency. This is not the first time the NPP has been targeted by the Ukrainian military. On July 12, Ukrainian UAVs dropped several 120mm shells on a building located next to the power plant, causing damage to its roof and window, the press-service of the Energodar city administration told RIA Novosti. According to the spokesperson of the administration, 11 employees were injured during that attack, with four of them remaining in serious condition. Russia currently controls the southern and central part of the Zaporozhye region, including the city of Energodar, where the biggest nuclear plant in Europe is situated. The administrative center of the region, Zaporozhye, remains under Ukrainian control. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559314-wikipedia-russia-law-fake/,Wikipedia designated as lawbreaker,"Russia's state media regulator, Roskomnadzor, has obliged search engines to label Wikipedia as being in violation of the law, saying that the online encyclopedia promotes misleading information about the conflict in Ukraine. The watchdog said on Wednesday that it would take steps to punish Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., which hosts Wikipedia, due to its failure to delete content deemed in violation of Russian law. With this in mind, the regulator “has decided to apply a coercive measure which would see search engines inform internet users about a violation of Russian legislation by a foreign entity.” According to Roskomnadzor, the measure will apply until the company is in full compliance with national law. In April, Russia slapped two fines totaling 5 million rubles (some $86,500 at the current exchange rate) on Wikimedia Commons for failing to delete a number of articles. Most of them were classified by the court as pieces spreading misinformation about the Russian military and its actions during the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, while two contained information on making explosives. In early March, Russia adopted a law that allows the authorities to impose substantial fines on persons and entities for discrediting the Russian armed forces or calling for sanctions against Moscow. If an offense leads to “grave consequences,” the perpetrator may face a prison sentence of up to 15 years."
2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559310-lavrov-european-bright-leaders/,Russia’s FM reveals who wins from lack of ‘bright leaders’ in Europe,"The bureaucrats in Brussels are the real winners from today’s lack of competent leaders in Europe, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with RT and Sputnik on Wednesday. “The [current] Western elites are very adequate in their own eyes, but they are restricted [in terms] of political experience and vision,” Lavrov told RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan. “The lack of bright leaders is something really convenient.” “To whom?” Simonyan asked. “To the bureaucrats that make up the European Commission,” he said. “They have become ‘a thing-in-itself’. It’s no wonder that Poland and Hungary are asking, ‘Why do we have to listen to these people?’” To illustrate the point about the conflicts within the EU, Lavrov mentioned the ongoing spat between Budapest and Brussels over Hungary’s law that bans content which “promotes” or portrays “sex change or homosexuality” to minors. The European Commission said the law was discriminatory and announced last week that it was suing Hungary in the European Court of Justice, the EU’s top judicial body. Lavrov’s remarks come after former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told Bloomberg that the current “European leadership does not have the sense of direction and mission,” unlike leaders of the past such as Charles de Gaulle of France and Konrad Adenauer of West Germany."
2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559304-lavrov-nuclear-war-ukraine/,There can be no winner in nuclear war – Russian FM,"There can be no winner in a nuclear conflict, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday in an interview with RT and Sputnik. When asked about the possibility of the conflict in Ukraine provoking a nuclear war between Russia and the West due to the ongoing attempts by the US and its allies to escalate the situation, Lavrov reminded that “we [Moscow] initiated a lot of statements of the five UN Security Council permanent members that there could be no victor in the nuclear war, it could never be started.” “This is our stance. And we are going to stand firmly on this stance,” he insisted. The Russian FM also reiterated that Russia has its own “doctrine that clearly stipulates what could be the case when we would be forced to use nuclear weapons.” This doctrine only allows the use of nuclear arms if such weapons, or other types of weapons of mass destruction, are used to target Russia, or if the country is faced with an existential threat from conventional arms. Lavrov also slammed the US administration for trying to spin the Ukraine conflict, insisting that “they're acting, well, irresponsibly, I would say. And the plans they make, they are building they really have some risks.”"
2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559291-ukraine-russia-strikes-civilians/,Russian troops given new orders in Ukraine,"Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has inspected troops taking part in Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine. He ordered them to take measures to stop the Ukrainian military’s strikes on civilians, the ministry revealed on Wednesday. Shoigu visited a command post of the ‘West’ grouping where he got a progress report on the military campaign from Lieutenant General Andrey Sychevoy. “After hearing the report..., Sergei Shoigu gave instructions for a further increase of operational responsiveness related to destroying enemy unmanned aerial vehicles over areas at the Russian border, as well as to step up the prevention of attacks launched by nationalists on residential areas of the liberated settlements due to the delivery of new counter-battery warfare means,” the statement read. Earlier this month, the ministry revealed that Shoigu had also met the commanding officers of the ‘South’ and ‘Center’ groupings and had given instructions to ramp up actions aimed at staving off rocket and artillery strikes on civilian infrastructure by the Ukrainian military. The defense minister’s visit comes amid numerous Ukrainian strikes that have targeted residential areas. In an attack earlier this month, Kiev forces shelled the Russian-controlled city of Novaya Kakhovka in Kherson Region using US-made HIMARS launchers. Local officials said that the attack hit a cluster of warehouses containing chemicals. In addition to those killed and injured, the explosion damaged a hospital and church and left over 270 people homeless, they claimed. The Ukrainian military said it had destroyed an ammunition depot in the city. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559297-us-uk-real-war-russia-europe-lavrov/,US and UK want ‘real war’ between Russia and EU – Lavrov,"The US and UK want to escalate the Russia-Ukraine conflict into a larger confrontation between Moscow and members of the European Union, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday in an interview with RT and Sputnik. “Our American counterparts, British counterparts… with active support from Germans, the Polish and the Baltic states, they really want to turn this war into a real war and start a confrontation between Russia and European states,” Lavrov told RT’s editor-in-chief, Margarita Simonyan. The Western governments are “keeping Ukraine from any constructive steps” towards a peace settlement, Lavrov argued. “[Ukraine is] not just [being] pumped with weapons. They are forced to use these weapons in an increasingly riskier way.” Russia launched its military operation in the neighboring country in late February. Many countries, including NATO members, imposed sweeping sanctions on Moscow and have been supplying Kiev with heavy weapons. The latest deliveries include US-made M142 HIMARS multiple rocket launchers and M777 howitzers. Lavrov claimed that the US and Britain were acting to their own advantage in the conflict between Russia and the EU because the economies of the bloc’s members are bearing the brunt of the sanctions. He added that the US has been acting “irresponsibly” by stoking tensions with Russia. They are playing a very dangerous game. I don’t think they understand it themselves. But then, in Europe, a lot of people are starting to understand that. US President Joe Biden said last week that Russia must suffer “a strategic failure” in Ukraine and vowed more support for Kiev. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559287-latvia-citizenship-russians-ukraine/,Passport warning issued to Russians in EU state,"People who support Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine and live in Latvia could be stripped of their citizenship, the nation’s president said on Tuesday. Speaking in an interview with RTVI broadcaster, Latvian President Egils Levits said he supports legislation allowing Russian Latvians with dual citizenship to be stripped of their passport if they openly back Moscow’s military operation. “I believe that Russians living in Latvia should take a certain position. And most of them did so because in such a situation there can be no effect of neutrality. If a person is neutral, then he did not understand the essence of the matter,” Levits said. According to him, many Russian Latvians clearly support Ukraine, and some of them are still on the fence, but are gradually moving “in the right direction.” At the same time, there is a minority that approves of Russia’s actions, and they are “outside the scope of democracy,” he claimed. “The scope of democracy is based on notions of justice, and supporting an obviously unjust idea means that you are not a democrat,” the president said. In April, the Latvian parliament approved legislation allowing citizenship to be revoked for people who support countries responsible for what the authorities deem to be crimes against peace and humanity. This amendment, however, only applies to people with two or more passports. Also that month, the nation banned the public display of the letters ‘Z’ and ‘V’ (which are used as symbols by Russian troops in Ukraine), saying they glorify aggression and war crimes. Latvia also prohibits the display of symbols that glorify Nazi or communist regimes, but does nothing to stop marches honoring Latvian members of the Waffen-SS. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/559283-putin-zelensky-meeting-prospects/,Russia and Ukraine were close to peace deal in March – Putin,"Russian President Vladimir Putin explained on Tuesday that Russia and Ukraine could have ended their conflict in March, if Kiev had not withdrawn from negotiations. He didn't answer directly if he would be willing to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart, Vladimir Zelensky, but implied that a meeting would be pointless, at this stage. “There were well-known negotiations in Istanbul, when we actually reached an agreement, the only thing left to do was to sign it,” Putin told reporters on Tuesday, after meeting with the presidents of Turkey and Iran in Tehran. “In order to create these conditions, our troops withdrew from central Ukraine, from Kiev, but the Kiev authorities refused to implement these agreements” and have no desire to do so even now, the Russian president added. Thanking Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his efforts to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine, as well as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for offering mediation efforts, Putin said the outcome in the end depends “not on the mediators, but on the willingness of the parties involved” to make good on their obligations. Putin was in Tehran for the summit of the ‘Astana Troika’, the three countries leading the peace process for war-torn Syria since early 2017. In early May, Ukrainian media reported that Kiev reneged on the March 29 agreement reached by the two delegations in Istanbul, after a visit by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on April 9. Johnson told Zelensky that Putin is “a war criminal, who should be prosecuted and not negotiated with,” and that even if Ukraine were willing to make peace with Russia, the West was not, Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing multiple government officials. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba insisted in an interview with Forbes on Monday that Kiev would only be eager to resume talks after Moscow suffers “defeat on the battlefield.” According to Kuleba, Zelensky is not ruling out “the possibility of negotiations,” but believes “there is no reason” for it at the moment. If and when talks on a peaceful settlement of the Ukraine conflict resume, Moscow will make much harsher demands, Leonid Slutsky, a member of Moscow’s negotiating team, warned on Tuesday. Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov also addressed the possibility of resuming talks with Ukraine, saying on Monday that Russia’s demands would be different if the two sides sat down at the negotiating table now."
2022-07-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/559280-putin-erdogan-tehran-grain-export/,"Erdogan, Putin note progress in grain exports talks","Moscow and Ankara have expressed confidence in the outcome of the four-way talks on Ukrainian grain exports. Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the issue with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan during a meeting in Tehran on Tuesday. Putin told journalists in Tehran that he and Erdogan discussed cooperation between Russia and Turkey in facilitating “easier” exports of both Russian and Ukrainian grain to world markets, and were satisfied with the provisional outcome of the Istanbul talks on grain exports, held on June 13. They also talked about international food security, the Russian president said. Erdogan praised the approach of the Russian delegation at the Istanbul talks as “very positive.” The outcome of the talks will have a positive impact on the “whole world,” he told Putin in Tehran, according to the Turkish Anadolu Agency. Putin thanked Erdogan for his mediation efforts and called the progress on the issue a “good sign.” Moscow expects the talks to continue in the near future. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, noted that the situation regarding Ukrainian grain that remains stuck in some of the nation’s ports due the ongoing conflict with Russia is not the reason for the global food crisis. Russia is still ready to contribute to the easing of the global food shortage, he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Turkish companies expressed their readiness to process both Russian and Ukrainian grain to make other products like oil and then sell them to the other parts of the world. Exporting Russian and Ukrainian grain through Turkey could potentially speed up the whole process, said Celal Kadooglu, head of the Grains, Legume and Oilseed Product Exporters Association in the Turkish region of Southeast Anatolia. During last month's meeting, negotiators from Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and the UN agreed to set up a joint coordination center in Istanbul to oversee the grain shipments. The sides also coordinated their approaches on technical issues, such as joint controls and the safety of navigation, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar told reporters at the time. Last week, the UN also welcomed the provisional agreements reached during the Istanbul talks, calling it a “ray of hope.” The World Trade Organization, World Bank, and IMF issued a joint statement, calling on nations around the world to remove trade restrictions to improve “the functioning and resilience of global markets for food and agriculture.” Ukraine has accused Russia of blockading up to 25 million tons of grain in its ports, which Moscow has denied. Russia's own grain exports, which are four times larger than Ukraine's, have been blocked from reaching world markets due to Ukraine-related Western sanctions. A similar embargo on mineral fertilizers has further exacerbated the problem."
2022-07-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/559276-ukraine-win-winter-yermak/,Ukraine must win by winter – Zelensky aide,"The Ukrainian military must defeat Russia before winter, Andrey Yermak, chief of staff to President Vladimir Zelensky, said in an interview on Tuesday. Amid a shakeup in Ukraine’s government and Russian gains on the battlefield, Yermak insisted that more Western weapons could turn the tide. “Today, our main goal is victory,” Yermak said, “to do this, we need our military to have everything they need. They have everything except sufficient equipment and sufficient weapons.” The US alone has already allocated more than $55 billion worth of military and economic aid to Ukraine since February, and even though the Biden administration’s Lend-Lease program of arms shipments is set to come online in August, Yermak stated that time was not on his country’s side. “The main task of Lend-Lease is that we get everything on time,” he explained. “It is very important for us not to enter the winter. After winter, when the Russians will have more time to dig in, it will certainly be more difficult.” Asked whether Ukraine’s military could retake the Black Sea coastline before winter, as Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov told the UK’s Sunday Times earlier this month that it would, Yermak did not answer directly, saying instead that “our goal is definitely the de-occupation of all our territories,” without providing a timeframe. “It’s hard work,” Yermak admitted, “when there is an enemy against you who has much more weapons and men.” In Reznikov’s estimation, Ukraine needs around 50 M142 HIMARS rocket artillery systems from the US to hold back the advancing Russian military, and 100 of these truck-mounted launchers to conduct a counteroffensive. Reznikov announced these figures during a meeting of the Atlantic Council, a NATO-backed think tank, on Tuesday. To date, Washington has given Ukraine eight HIMARS systems, and the White House revealed on Tuesday that a fresh package of military aid to be announced this week will include more of these weapons systems. Ukraine has suffered a string of losses on the battlefield, with the entirety of the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR) coming under the control of Russian-allied forces at the beginning of this month, and Russian and Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) forces seizing operational control of Seversk – within striking distance of the major cities of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk – in recent days. Meanwhile in Kiev, Zelensky’s government appears consumed by a witch hunt, with Zelensky firing Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova and the head of the country’s top security agency, Ivan Bakanov, over the weekend. According to the Ukrainian leader, “high treason and collaboration” was rampant in both services. Ukraine’s parliament on Tuesday approved the firings, and Zelensky went on to remove five more regional bosses of Bakanov’s agency, as well as its deputy head, Vladimir Gorbenko."
2022-07-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/559277-reznikov-weapons-polygon-foreign/,Ukraine offers itself as test site for Western weapons,"Ukraine has invited foreign arms manufacturers to use it as a location to try out new weapons in battlefield conditions, Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov said on Tuesday. In an interview with the Atlantic Council, a US-based pro-NATO lobby group partly funded by the industry, Reznikov said that Ukraine can already be considered “essentially a testing ground.” “Many weapons are now getting tested in the field, in the real conditions of the battle against the Russian army, which has plenty of the modern systems of its own,” he explained. Stressing that Ukraine is a trusted partner and needs all sorts of weapons, Reznikov revealed that the government is interested in building up the country’s “testing ground” potential. “We are sharing all the information and experience with our partners. We are interested in testing modern systems in the fight against the enemy and we are inviting the arms manufacturers to test their new products here,” the defense minister said. He added that his offer could provide “a good chance” for Poland, the US, France, Germany, and other countries “to test [their] equipment.” “Give us the tools, we will finish the job and you will have new information,” Reznikov said. Extending his gratitude to the US and its allies for the ongoing weapons supplies, the minister stressed that in order to successfully fight the Russian forces and especially to conduct a counterattack, Ukraine needs more arms, “fast and in sufficient quantities.” He specified that before all else, Kiev needs air and rocket defense systems, long-range weapons, anti-ship missiles, aviation, tanks, and armored vehicles. Reznikov also hailed the US-provided High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and added that “for an effective counteroffensive,” Ukraine would need at least 100. As of July 8, the US has provided 12 HIMARS systems to Ukraine. The White House revealed on Tuesday that a new package of military aid to be announced this week will include more of these weapons systems. Moscow has consistently warned Western countries against providing Ukraine with weapons, saying that it would not prevent Russian forces from achieving all the goals of the military operation, but would lead to prolongations of the conflict and to unnecessary casualties. Russia also made it clear that any foreign arms on Ukrainian territory would be considered legitimate targets. Earlier this month, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that the country’s forces had destroyed two HIMARS launchers in Donbass. The Russian military also claims that some of the weapons sent by the West to Ukraine “are spreading throughout the Middle East region, and also end up on the black market.” Kiev describes such allegations as “propaganda.”"
2022-07-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/559275-germany-admits-ukraine-weapons/,Germany admits it ‘can’t give much more’ to Ukraine,"Berlin stands ready to support Ukraine in the future but in terms of weapons supplies it can’t “give away much more,” German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said on Tuesday. During a visit to Mullheim, she told reporters that Ukraine could be assured of Germany’s intentions “to continue to support them in the future.” Stressing that Germany had already provided Kiev with some state-of-the-art heavy weapons, such as Panzerhaubitze 2000, Lambrecht also said that she had a very trusting and constructive relationship with her Ukrainian counterpart, Alexey Reznikov. “We can’t give away much more from the Bundeswehr, I'll say that very clearly, and my colleague is aware of that,” the German minister said. Earlier this month, Lambrecht made it clear that Berlin would keep supporting Ukraine “with everything possible” but not at the expense of its own defense capabilities. Germany has been providing Ukraine with assorted weaponry since the beginning of the Russian military offensive against the neighboring country in late February. Still, Berlin lags far behind the top arms suppliers, the US and the UK, and has been facing accusations from both the media and Ukrainian and Polish officials of “overpromising and under delivering” when it comes to the military supply to Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has previously addressed these accusations, noting that his country is unable to provide Kiev with weapons at a similar pace to the United States because its resources are more limited. At the same time, the chancellor stressed, Germany had already sent all the weapons it had in stock to Kiev, as well as some brand-new weapons. Scholz also confirmed that Germany would continue supplying Ukraine under the “circular exchange” principle, a scheme in which Eastern European countries donate their Soviet-era military inventory to Ukraine and in turn receive more modern systems from Germany. Meanwhile, Russia has repeatedly warned the West against sending weapons to Kiev, saying that it would only prolong the conflict, increase the number of casualties and lead to long-term consequences. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov recently said that continuing to “pump up” Ukraine with weapons would only prompt Russia “to perform more missions on the ground.”"
2022-07-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/559269-transnistria-russia-west-sign-peace/,Breakaway region bordering Ukraine seeks security guarantees,"Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova, has proposed that all parties in the ongoing ‘5+2’ peace talks sign a document providing security guarantees for the unrecognized republic that borders Ukraine. Transnistrian President Vadim Krasnoselsky floated the idea during his meeting with Russia’s representative at the talks, ambassador-at-large Vitaly Tryapitsin, on Tuesday. “There is an idea to appeal to all participants in the ‘5+2’ format [to] draw up a single document on the guarantees of peace and security of Transnistria,” Krasnoselsky said, as quoted by his press service. “If they keep talking about peace, let’s see them all sign it.” The talks between Moldova and Transnistria are being mediated by Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE, while the US and EU attend as observers. They began in 2005 in an attempt to find a solution to the conflict between Chisinau and the breakaway republic. They have effectively been on hold since 2019. According to Krasnoselsky, even if the ‘5+2’ format shows no signs of progress, there still should be at least some bilateral engagement between Moldova and the Russian-speaking breakaway Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR). “There are political representatives, there is the president, there are other Moldovan officials who should now be talking and finding compromises on the issues that are currently not being solved. The agenda of the talks is known by everyone quite well, and it still holds true,” he said. The disputes between the PMR and Moldova should now be viewed “in a different light” because of Chisinau’s decision to apply for EU membership, the president added. “Moldova and the PMR are moving in opposite directions,” he said. A nation of 2.6 million people sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania, Moldova declared itself a neutral state soon after gaining independence as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, it has long aimed to become a member of the EU – and was finally granted candidate status in late June, along with Ukraine. Since the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Transnistria has seen a number of explosions and other provocations. The region, stretching along the Ukrainian border, maintains strong ties with Moscow and hosts Russian peacekeepers."
2022-07-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/559260-ukraine-longer-range-himars-missiles/,Ukraine may already have longer-range HIMARS – DPR,"Ukrainian troops may soon deploy missiles capable of striking targets at a distance of up to 300km, a spokesman for the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has told Russian media. Such missiles, which are used by the US-made HIMARS multiple-launch rocket systems, may already have been delivered to Ukraine, he added. When Kiev claimed it was in possession of HIMARS missiles with a range of up to 70km, Donbass fighters were already finding pieces of missiles with 110km-120km range, Eduard Basurin, the DPR army spokesman, told Russia’s Rossiya 1 TV Channel. “Now, if they claim it is a 150km-180 km [range], it might well mean they already have [some missiles with] a 300km range,” Basurin said. He did not provide any specific evidence to back up this statement, however. Earlier, the Ukrainian media reported that Kiev was in talks with the US about acquiring tactical ballistic missiles with a range of up to 300km for the HIMARS systems it already got from Washington. “Our government is holding talks with the US representatives at all levels,” Ukrainian MP Fedor Venislavsky told journalists last week, adding that Ukraine has “all the chances” to use some “long-range missiles.” Washington previously said it would not supply Ukraine with missiles having a range of 300km out of fear they could be used to strike Russian territories, thus greatly escalating the ongoing conflict between Kiev and Moscow. Last week, the authorities in the Russian-controlled Kherson Region accused Ukrainian forces of using HIMARS systems in a strike that killed seven people and injured nearly 200. Over 270 people were also left homeless in the wake of the attack, according to local authorities. A day before, officials in the DPR accused Ukrainian forces of using the US-made systems in an attack that killed three civilians involved in a humanitarian mission. According to the Pentagon, the US has provided Kiev with eight HIMARS systems since the beginning of the conflict in February. Last week, Russian authorities claimed they destroyed two of these rocket systems in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). Also last week, Kiev received its first M270 MLRS (Multiple Launch Rocket System), which is, effectively, an older cousin of М142 launchers capable of launching twice as many 227 mm missiles in one go. Ukraine has also recently threatened to use the US-supplied systems in a potential strike against Crimea – a move that would be met with a “crushing” response, according to Moscow."
2022-07-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/559242-ukraine-peace-talks-conditions/,Russia warns of ‘tougher’ terms for talks with Ukraine,"Moscow will make much harsher demands if and when talks on a peaceful settlement of the Ukraine conflict resume, Leonid Slutsky, a member of Moscow's negotiating team, has warned. “Today, the conditions on our part will be tougher regarding demilitarization and ‘denazification’; tougher both in terms of essence and the timeframe of their implementation,” Slutsky, who leads the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) in the Russian State Duma, said during a press conference on Tuesday. However, the parliamentarian pointed out that currently “Kiev doesn’t show any eagerness to resume the negotiations.” On Monday, Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov also addressed the possibility of the resumption of talks with Ukraine, saying that Russia’s demands would be “different” if the two sides sit down at the negotiating table now. However, much like Slutsky, he had to acknowledge that “for now, there’s no interest in this from both Kiev and the Western countries” that are backing Ukraine in the conflict. The peace process had been put on hold by the Ukrainian side after the latest round of negotiations, which took place in Istanbul in late March, according to the aide. “After that, the Ukrainian delegation didn’t maintain any contact with us,” Ushakov said. Moscow had initially been optimistic about the outcome of the talks in Turkey’s largest city, but later accused Kiev of backtracking on all the progress that had been achieved there and declared that it had lost all trust in the Ukrainian negotiators. In his interview with Forbes on Monday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba insisted that Kiev would only be eager to resume talks after Moscow suffers “defeat on the battlefield.” “Otherwise, it will be the language of ultimatums again” on the part of Russia, he explained. According to Kuleba, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky doesn’t rule out “the possibility of negotiations,” but believes “there is no reason” for it at the moment. Despite Russian forces steadily gaining ground in Donbass, Ukraine’s top negotiator David Arakhamia suggested last month that Kiev could achieve a “favorable position” on the front by late August after it conducts “counteroffensive operations in certain areas.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/559254-putin-visits-tehran-strategic-alliance/,"Petr Akopov: As Putin visits Tehran, Russia and Iran are ready to create a strategic partnership","On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin is visiting Iran for a fifth time. Is that a lot or a little? Well, if you count back to 2000, when he first became the leader of Russia, it doesn’t seem like much. However, if you look at the dates of the visits, a very different picture emerges. It turns out that this trip is the fourth in the last seven years. Yes, Putin first came to Tehran in 2007, but his regular trips did not start until 2015. At the same time, all of Putin's visits have been of a working nature. He has never been to the Islamic Republic on an official tour. Each time his arrival was linked to a multilateral event held in the Iranian capital, such as The Caspian Forum, a summit of gas-exporting countries. Or, as in this case, a meeting in the Astana format, i.e., a trilateral summit of Russia, Turkey, and Iran. This “big three” emerged five years ago in connection with the search for a solution to the conflict in Syria, but it has long outgrown that single issue. Because all three countries are truly sovereign states, they have a lot to discuss. Moreover, while Turkey's importance in both regional and global affairs is well understood (by both supporters and opponents of strengthening bilateral relations), the role of Iran has been underestimated for many years. More precisely, it has been completely misjudged. The reason is simple. Our Western-oriented expert community looked at Iran mainly through the American-led prism: a rogue country, mullahs with missiles and a desire for a nuclear bomb, theocracy, a repressive regime, a security threat to the Middle East and the world, Islamic fanatics, etc. In general, it has been perceived as some kind of eastern hole, incomparable to the advanced, enlightened and wealthy West. The political leadership looked at Iran with different eyes, but what did our people know about the Islamic Republic? At worst a retelling of Western propaganda, at best some echoes of Traveler’s Club (a TV show once popular in Russia and the USSR). Even our pivot to the East after 2014 has not changed that perception: the real Iran is still very poorly known in Russia. However, we are now moving towards a comprehensive strategic cooperation treaty – one that can last for 20 or 25 years. It could be signed as early as this year: in January, the new president, Ebrahim Raisi, presented the Iranian draft to Vladimir Putin in Moscow, and last month Sergey Lavrov brought the Russian version to Tehran. Russia and Iran will not become military allies (although military-technical cooperation is increasingly complemented by joint exercises), but our relationship will develop very seriously. Iran is increasingly involved in the multilateral format of cooperation with Russia – it has already joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO); the accession procedure will be completed in autumn – and Tehran wants to join BRICS. In other words, we are talking about a full-fledged course towards strategic cooperation between the two countries, both bilaterally and on the global stage. Russia and Iran have enormous potential for cooperation, from trade to the North-South transport corridor linking the Baltic Sea to Iranian ports in the Arabian Sea. That is, the European Union to India via the Caspian Sea. There is no need to think that Russia’s conflict with the West has made it irrelevant – the potential for North-South trade is still enormous. Even if the war of sanctions between Russia and the EU lasts for a long time, the corridor will be needed for Russia’s trade with the Middle East and Asia. And most importantly, rapprochement with Iran is in Russia's strategic interests. Because we are not simply dealing with the heir to great civilizations, with an 86-million-strong country, but with one of the strongest nations in the world in spirit. Iran is truly a sovereign country, going its own way, looking for its own forms of state and societal organization, standing up for its national interests and not bowing to any external pressure. This is exactly what Russia is doing, but we have yet to fully complete the process. And it is not even about the Iranian experience of living and developing under decades of Western sanctions – that too will come in handy, although the old world, in which the West could significantly hamper countries undesirable to it (and threaten to destroy them), is a thing of the past. More importantly, Iran has managed to find its own formula of state structure and social relations, a formula expressing exactly its national identity and aspirations. The Islamic Republic is not a carbon copy of foreign models, Western or Eastern – it is a unique Iranian invention. It is complex, based on both tradition (religious and national) and the notion of the correct form of popular representation and the application of Islamic law. With its problems, mistakes, and lessons, but surviving in the most difficult external conditions. None of the great powers – and Iran is undoubtedly among them – has demonstrated anything like this kind of creativity in building a new kind of state in recent decades. The last one to have a similar experience was the Soviet Union. Now we are again facing a huge challenge – we need to invent a new form of existence for our people and our state. Not only to withstand a confrontation with the West, but because we have long needed it ourselves. The Iranian experience is not directly applicable to Russia, but their aspiration for an ideal social structure is close to Russians as well as the dream that the state must stand for justice, embody, and protect people's ideals, that the leaders must be honest, strong in spirit and feel their responsibility before the people and God. And that is why Putin's fifth meeting with Rahbar Khamenei, the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, is not just a conversation between two very influential and very experienced statesmen – it is also a meeting between two people who have something to talk about, besides global issues and challenges. Because if two countries such as Russia and Iran go their own spiritual and national way, then they will go together. And each will become stronger – no longer just responding to challenges from the West, but together building a new world where traditionalist peoples can live by their own ways and their own laws.

2022-07-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/559247-ukraine-vinnitsa-officers-killed/,Senior Ukrainian officers killed in Vinnitsa strike – reports,"Three Ukrainian officers, including two colonels, were reportedly taken out in last week’s Russian attack on the city of Vinnitsa in western Ukraine on July 14, according to local reports. Moscow says it targeted a building used for military purposes, a claim rejected by Kiev. The Minsk Suvorov Military Academy in Belarus said on its website that a former cadet, Ukraine’s Colonel Oleg Makarchuk, was killed in the Russian strike. According to the academy, Makarchuk previously served as the head of repairs and logistics in the Ukrainian Air Force. In April, Makarchuk was presented with an award by President Vladimir Zelensky for “defending the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.” The death of another military officer, Konstantin Puzyrenko, was reported by local authorities in the city of Berdichev in Ukraine’s western Zhitomir Region, and by news website Zhitomir Online. A post on Facebook about the funeral of Ukrainian Air Force Colonel Dmitry Burdiko said he was also killed in Vinnitsa on July 14. According to reports, Burdiko’s death was first announced by his son Konstantin in a now-deleted post on Instagram. The Ukrainian government has not reported any military casualties resulting from the strike, but Vinnitsa Governor Sergey Borzov said on Tuesday that the death toll had risen to 25. Ukrainian media reported earlier that the victims included doctors from a nearby clinic and small children. On July 14, Russian warships launched cruise missiles at a high-rise building called ‘The House of Military Officers’. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that senior commanders of the Ukrainian Air Forces were inside, conducting a meeting with foreign arms suppliers. The Ukrainian Air Force insisted that the building was “de jure” owned by the military, but “de facto” served as a civilian concert venue and housed cafes and other businesses. Zelensky argued that the Russian strike was tantamount to “terrorism.” Both Ukraine and Russia have repeatedly accused each other of attacking civilian targets, while claiming only to have hit military sites. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotyr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

Rogov said that the authorities in Kiev “had not granted approval for the swap for a long time.” Ukraine’s military intelligence agency the GUR said on Tuesday that the bodies of 45 Ukrainian fighters have been returned. The sides conducted similar swaps in the past. In June, Kiev said that Russia handed over the remains of 56 soldiers. Prisoner swaps took place as well, including a large exchange late last month, when 144 of their respective inmates were transferred from each side. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/559249-night-wolves-biker-club-ban/,Targets of new EU anti-Russia sanctions revealed - media,"The leader of the Night Wolves biker club Aleksandr Zaldostanov, Moscow mayor Sergey Sobyanin, as well as popular Russian actors Sergey Bezrukov and Vladimir Mashkov are among the 48 individuals targeted by the EU’s latest Russia sanctions, according to multiple outlets citing a draft of the sanctions list. Zaldostanov, 69, was singled out by the EU for “actively supporting Russian state propaganda through publicly denying Ukraine’s right to statehood and calling for the ‘denazification’ as well as the ‘de-Ukrainization’ of the country,” the document says, as cited by EUObserver. Founded by Zaldostanov and a number of associates soon after the collapse of the USSR, the Night Wolves Motorcycle Club has grown into something of a patriotic movement. The club has held numerous rides in support of ‘traditional values’ and is one of the founding factions of Anti-Maidan, a counterprotest organization intended to thwart Western-inspired regime change in Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has personally participated in some of the club’s rides. Zaldostanov is also on the US and Canada’s sanctions lists for his participation in the events that led to the secession of Crimea from Ukraine. Actors Bezrukov and Mashkov were, in turn, targeted, for allegedly spreading “pro-war propaganda,” the newspaper reports. Both award-winning actors with multiple starring roles under their belts, Vladimir Mashkov and Sergey Bezrukov have been outspoken supporters of Russia’s operation in Ukraine since its start on February 24. During a visit to Lugansk in June, Mashkov told his fans Russia was fighting in Ukraine to protect “our brothers and sisters,” calling those who oppose the campaign “monsters.” In a post on his VK page in March, Bezrukov recited ‘To the Slanderers of Russia,’ a patriotic poem by Alexander Pushkin, saying: “It’s one thing when we are solving our problems by ourselves, but when other countries who do not know our history or culture start intervening, that’s a different story.” Most of the individuals targeted by new sanctions are Russian military commanders and politicians, including Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin. The draft document also lists a number of Ukrainian nationals appointed by Russia to various government positions in the territories it controls.There are also relatives of Russian oligarchs who have already been slapped with restrictions. One of them is Pavel Ezubov, a cousin of tycoon Oleg Deripaska, who is reportedly involved in ownership of Deripaska’s properties in France, Washington DC and Austria. The new sanctions package, discussed by EU ambassadors on Monday, also targets eight entities, including Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender. Once the list is approved on Wednesday, Sberbank will see its activities in Europe significantly restricted. A ban on Russian gold imports is likewise listed among the new measures."
2022-07-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/559240-ukraine-crimea-fleet-peskov/,Ukraine threatens to destroy Russian fleet,"Ukraine will crush Russia’s Black Sea fleet and regain control of Crimea with Western weapons, the country’s Deputy Defense Minister, Vladimir Gavrilov has vowed during a visit to the UK. Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, which is based in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, is “a permanent threat” to Ukraine, and Kiev has to address this issue, Gavrilov said in an interview with the Times on Tuesday. Kiev was waiting to get longer-range weapons from foreign nations before launching an assault, he added. “We are receiving anti-ship capabilities and sooner or later we will target the fleet. It is inevitable because we have to guarantee the security of our people,” the deputy defense minister explained. Gavrilov claimed that Ukraine is also planning to take back Crimea - which overwhelmingly voted to reunite with Russia in a 2014 referendum after a coup in Kiev. According to the official, the Ukrainian government was holding discussions with their Western backers on whether it could use foreign-supplied arms to target Russian forces on the peninsula. American officials earlier assured that Kiev had promised that US-made arms, including М142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS multiple launch rocket systems, would not be used to attack Russian territory. However, Kiev says it doesn’t view Crimea as part of Russia, considering it to be a Ukrainian area occupied by Moscow. “Sooner or later we will have enough resources to target Russia in the Black Sea and Crimea. Crimea is Ukrainian territory, that’s why any target there is legitimate for us,” the deputy defense minister stated. Gavrilov also didn’t rule out the use of diplomatic means in order to reclaim Crimea, saying that “we have to think very carefully how to do it in the right way.” “Russia will have to leave Crimea if they wish to exist as a country,” Gavrilov insisted. His statements didn’t go unnoticed in Moscow, with Kremlin press secretary, Dmitry Peskov saying that they were “yet another proof that [Russia’s] special military operation was a correct and absolutely justified move because it was the only way to save Ukraine from such leaders” as Gavrilov. The deputy defense minister is the latest in a series of high-ranking Ukrainian officials to threaten the use of force against Crimea. Last week, spokesman for the intelligence service of Ukraine’s defense ministry, Vadim Skibitskiy, also said Kiev considered the region to be a legitimate target for its forces as its being used as a transport hub by Moscow. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of the country’s National Security Council, warned that if the Ukrainian leadership really decided to attack the peninsula “the Day of Judgment will come to them all simultaneously – a swift and hard one.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-07-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/559194-new-normal-russia-nato-relations/,Julia Melnikova: World War Three is off – why NATO can't afford to have Russia as its main enemy,"The world is currently changing so rapidly that the term ‘new normal,’ which first appeared in the business realm and later enriched diplomatic slang, has been added to the active vocabulary of not only all those who follow the news, but even those who don’t. The NATO summit held in Madrid, last month, was rich in information, claiming to be one of the key political events of the summer of 2022. The gathering marked another milestone in relations between Moscow and Brussels, with the continuing conflict between Russia and the West the main focus. First, a new Strategic Concept for the bloc was released, in which Russia was publicly declared its main security threat. Secondly, the procedure for Sweden and Finland's membership was officially launched, symbolically confirming the unity of the Euro-Atlantic camp. Thirdly, a number of measures and plans have been announced which are aimed at directly deterring Russia militarily. These are all alarming signals that create a depressing impression for outsiders. The reaction of officials does not add optimism either. For example, in commenting on NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept, Russia’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alexander Grushko, said “The very existence of a state like Russia is recognized as a serious threat to the alliance. This is a very serious turn and a real bid to confront us.” It would seem that everything points to a ‘new normal’ in Russia-NATO relations. Naturally, questions arise: How did this happen? What will Brussels do in practice, and how will Moscow react? Can a strategic confrontation in the information field and the buildup of means of deterrence on both sides escalate into an open conflict? However, if you look deeper, the fundamental answers are not as scary as they might seem. How did this happen? In fact, to properly interpret this ‘new normal’ in Russia-NATO relations, they must be analyzed from a chronological perspective. Looking at the period since the collapse of the USSR and the end of the Cold War, Russia’s offensive in Ukraine is, indeed, an unprecedented scenario for European security. Naturally, NATO’s new strategic document differs from previous entries in the series. The 1991 concept noted a reduction in the security threat due to the change in the balance of power in Europe, but also noted the need to take the legacy of the Soviet Union’s military potential into account. The 1999 edition characterized Russia, Ukraine, and the Republic of Moldova as partners for dialogue. The installment from 2010 finally attached strategic importance to relations with Russia and was aimed at deepening them on issues of mutual interest. Accordingly, if we compare the document from 2022 with its immediate predecessor, the ‘new normal’ really is new. However, 12 years have passed since the adoption of the previous concept, during which NATO has faced internal crises and failures in achieving its goals, and Russia has moved to a more active foreign policy. Today’s apex in the confrontation between Moscow and Brussels sums up the events of this period. Russia’s complaints against NATO had already begun accumulating since the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s, and noticeably escalated after the 2008 summit in Bucharest, when Ukraine and Georgia were promised membership of the bloc. This criticism persisted, albeit implicitly, during NATO’s operation in Libya, as well as in the Syrian conflict. The NATO summits that took place in Wales and Warsaw in 2014 and 2016 following the first Ukrainian crisis, in turn, formalized the beginning of the ‘securitization’ of Russia. In this context, the parties actually abandoned dialogue and suspended the work of the Russia-NATO Council at Brussels’ initiative. Despite attempts to revive the format and even use it in early 2022 to discuss Russian proposals for security guarantees, it became clear that the functionality and effectiveness of the Council had been reduced to zero. In the fall of 2021, Russia’s Permanent Mission to NATO, the Information Bureau, and the bloc's Military Liaison Mission in Moscow also suspended their work. In the absence of these channels of communication and, in fact, any real purpose for them, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov succinctly characterized Moscow’s relations with Brussels as “non-existent.” Therefore, if we compare the reality after the Madrid summit with the development of events before it, the ‘normal’ is the same… only more clearly formulated. What will Brussels do and what will Moscow do? Once the ‘i’s are dotted and the important words delivered, things become clearer. Today’s reality makes it easier for both parties to understand the logic of their opponent, as well as thei behavior in the future, to a certain extent. In the current situation, the decisions announced by NATO confirm the bloc’s return to a Cold War regime. Its leadership signaled this move by announcing the deployment of additional troops in the East and its readiness to continue providing military assistance to Ukraine, as well as by increasing the frequency and intensity of military exercises and ramping up the modernization of its military-industrial complex. It is obvious that, in the medium term, the bloc will focus on fortifying its eastern and southern borders in order to contain Russia. If Finland and Sweden successfully complete the process of accessiom, the format NATO chooses to secure its borders with Russia, which remains unknown, will be key in terms of Moscow’s reaction. There are two groups of issues here – related to conventional and strategic weapons. With regard to conventional weapons, either US forces or multinational battalions like those operating in Poland and the Baltic States may be deployed to bolster Sweden’s and Finland’s national troops. The probability of the second option is higher since the leaders of the Nordic countries themselves have spoken out against the first. In this case, significant effort will be required from the Russian side to deploy additional forces and equipment along its border with Finland, as well as to modernize its military infrastructure in the adjacent Karelia and Murmansk regions. In the Baltic Sea, the coexistence of both Russian and NATO fleets would be problematic (since all states with access may soon be members of the alliance) and require updating, confidence-building and incident prevention measures. The expert community is also discussing the prospects of deploying medium- and short-range missiles, as well as nuclear weapons and anti-missile defense systems, on NATO’s new flank. This would already require a rearrangement of Russia’s strategic weapons and add a new dimension to the issue of the militarization of the Arctic, creating a significant challenge for Moscow's strategic security. Nevertheless, it would be a very risky step on the part of the bloc to deliberately encourage further escalation in its relations with Russia, so the governments of the Nordic countries have dismissed the likelihood of such a scenario so far. According to statements from Russia’s Foreign Ministry, any steps taken by NATO will be thoroughly analyzed by the Russian military, which means the ball is now in Russia’s court. But one way or another, from a practical standpoint, the events currently taking place demonstrate that the ‘new normal’ in Russia-NATO relations is actually very old… one that stood the test of time in a bygone era. Will there be a war? But there is potentially good news, too. Despite the seriousness of the steps taken by the bloc, given the historical analysis above, the ‘new normal’ that will form the basis of Russia-NATO relations in the foreseeable future won’t have come as a surprise to Russia’s military and political elites, so it will not require any fundamental shift in thinking on Moscow’s part. When the dialogue moves from political and diplomatic arenas to the military realm, it often becomes more concrete and pragmatic. An important point in the statement from the Madrid summit is the preservation of the 1997 Founding Act on Russia-NATO Relations, despite the fact that Russia had been accused of violating it the day before. This indicates that the parties are not ready to completely abandon security guarantees and engage in open conflict. The same idea was expressed by NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg. While the fighting in Ukraine is in an active phase, the parties will remain vague, determining what measures must be taken to adequately secure their borders without openly challenging the security of their opponents. As soon as the hostilities end and a post-conflict model emerges, when new troops appear on Russia’s borders and the details of Finland’s and Sweden’s accession become clear, further dialogue will inevitably be devoted to finding ways to de-escalate, since a peak in tensions is always followed by a decline. There is another reason it is not beneficial for NATO to engage in open conflict with Moscow or concentrate all of its resources on its border with Russia. As was confirmed by the decisions taken during the course of the Madrid summit, the big confrontation of the future won’t be concentrated in Europe at all, but in the Asia-Pacific region. And if the United States and its allies need resources to counter China very soon, the bloc simply cannot afford to use them all in an open conflict with Russia."
2022-07-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/559228-sbu-ukraine-bakanov-zelensky/,National security chief fired in Ukraine,"Ukraine’s parliament has approved the firing of Ivan Bakanov, the top official at the state security service (the SBU), on Tuesday. Bakanov was a childhood friend of President Vladimir Zelensky and was installed in 2019. Meanwhile, Zelensky also removed the heads of SBU departments in five of the country’s regions on Tuesday. The SBU leaders in Sumy, Dnepropetrovsk, Zhytomir, Transcarpathia and Poltava regions have all been replaced. The agency’s deputy head, Vladimir Gorbenko, has also been relieved of his duties by presidential decree. Bakanov, who also worked with Zelensky during the latter's comedy career, had been suspended since Sunday. After vote on his removal, lawmakers later made the same decision regarding Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova, also relieving her of her duties. Zelensky had asked the Verkhovna Rada to fire the two top officials over a loss of trust. The president earlier said that there was “rampant” treason in the SBU and General Prosecutor’s Office relating to the conflict with Russia. More than 650 criminal cases have been launched against the employees of the two agencies, he announced. Such a vast “array of crimes,” as well as contacts between “employees of law enforcement agencies of Ukraine and Russia,” raise “serious questions” for Bakanov and Venediktova, Zelensky insisted, warning that they would not remain unanswered"
2022-07-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/559220-zelensky-ukraine-prosecutor-sbu/,Zelensky wants top prosecutor and spy chief sacked amid treason allegations,"President Vladimir Zelensky has submitted proposals to the country’s parliament to fire Ukraine’s prosecutor general and the head of the Security Service (SBU). A draft decree on relieving SBU chief Ivan Bakanov of his duties was published on Monday on the website of Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, with a similar document regarding the fate of Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova being registered on Tuesday. According to Zelensky, Venediktova and Bakanov should be removed from their posts due to a loss of trust. According to Ukrainian law, the country’s president requires approval from lawmakers to reshuffle officials at such high positions. The Verkhovna Rada’s committee on national security, defense and intelligence has already supported Zelensky’s initiative regarding Bakanov. The MPs said that they would consider the request to sack the SBU chief at the next parliamentary session. Venediktova and Bakanov were suspended on Sunday over what Zelensky described as “rampant” treason in their agencies, with 651 criminal cases against prosecutor general’s office staff and SBU officers being launched. Such a vast “array of crimes,” as well as contacts between “employees of law enforcement agencies of Ukraine and Russia,” raise “serious questions” for the two officials, the president insisted, warning that they won’t remain unanswered. On Tuesday, the deputy head of Zelensky’s office, Andrey Smirnov, gave assurances that Venediktova and Bakanov could only be fired after all probes against them are concluded. He also suggested that the investigation could well end with the duo retaining their jobs. Venediktova’s deputy, Aleksey Simonenko, has been assigned as caretaker prosecutor general, while the role of the acting SBU chief went to Vasily Malyuk, who also used to be the deputy head of the agency."
2022-07-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/559209-ukraine-eu-join-deadline/,Ukraine’s FM comments on EU accession ‘deadline’,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has set an “internal deadline” for Kiev to join the EU, the country’s foreign minister has said. “Integration with the EU is like the work of a farmer: you have to go and work on the field every day, instead of hypothetical planning of how many years it would take,” Dmitry Kuleba told Forbes Ukraina magazine on Monday. The minister said the country must focus on adjusting its legislation to comply with EU standards. Asked if the government had a self-imposed “internal deadline” for accession, Kuleba replied: “Not the government, but President Zelensky has set an internal deadline for the accession of Ukraine to the EU.” “But I will not tell you that,” he added, according to Forbes Ukraina. The decision also depends on the European Union, and not only on us. If we voice a deadline, we could scare someone within the EU, making them deliberately stall everything tied to the European integration of Ukraine. Even if we implement 120% of all standards and directives, they will still stall. So everything must be done calmly, wisely and be aimed at achieving results. Ukraine applied to join the 27-nation bloc shortly after Russia launched its military offensive in late February. Last month, Brussels granted Kiev EU candidate status, the first step in a lengthy accession process. At the same time, Brussels said Kiev must continue structural reforms, fight corruption and reduce “the persistent influence of oligarchs.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the newspaper Izvestia on Monday that making Ukraine a candidate was “a part of the geopolitical gambit against Russia” and a way to “demand full solidarity with the EU with its anti-Russian actions.”"
2022-07-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/559202-ukraine-conflict-korean-war-stavridis/,Kiev reacts to ex-NATO commander’s forecast on conflict with Moscow,"The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine should not be compared to the 1950-1953 Korean War, Ukrainian presidential aide Mikhail Podolyak said on Monday, in response to an assessment made by the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, James Stavridis. The retired American admiral believes both sides will have no other option but to leave the conflict “frozen” in between four and six months. “Ukraine is not [South] Korea and Russia is not the DRPK,” Podolyak said in a Twitter post in response to Stavridis’ assessment, made during an interview for New York-based WABC radio over the weekend. The context and the “scale” of the conflict is different this time, President Volodymyr Zelensky’s aide maintained, adding that the only way to end the ongoing “war” is to “defeat” Russia and allow Ukraine to “liberate the territories.” 🇺🇦 is not a Korea, 🇷🇺 is not the DPRK. Different context, different scales. Any ""frozen conflict"" means the war returning in a few years – well prepared and bloodier. The only way to put an end to the war and return security to Europe — to defeat RF and liberate the territories. pic.twitter.com/RZLDlh1gbI Any “frozen conflict” would mean hostilities would reignite “in a few years” and a new conflict would be “bloodier,” Podolyak warned. His words came after Stavridis told radio host John Catsimatidis that he sees “this one headed toward a Korean War ending,” adding that it would mean “an armistice, a militarized zone between the two sides, ongoing animosity, kind of a frozen conflict.” The retired admiral also said he would expect the hostilities to subside within “a four-to-six-month period” since “neither side” would be able to sustain the current warfare intensity any longer. The Korean War was fought between 1950 and 1953, with the USSR supporting Pyongyang and the US supporting Seoul. The war ended with an armistice between the two Koreas and a demilitarized zone was created along the 38th parallel. Russia has repeatedly said that its operation in Ukraine is proceeding “as planned.” President Vladimir Putin said in late June it would be “wrong” to set specific deadlines for it. He also expressed his confidence in the actions of the Russian military commanders. Around the same time, Zelensky told the G7 summit that he wanted to see the conflict ended by the end of the year before winter sets in, according to Reuters. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/559195-borrell-purpose-sanctions-economy/,EU admits goal of anti-Russian sanctions,"The embargoes imposed by the European Union against Moscow are intended not to stop the fighting in Ukraine, but wreck the Russian economy, the bloc’s foreign policy commissioner Josep Borrell said in Brussels on Monday. Borrell also announced an EU ban on Russian gold exports later this week. “The EU sanctions will not stop the military activities in Ukraine, but ought to create a lot of problems for the Russian economy,” Borrell said, adding that the EU “cannot afford sanctions fatigue.” Russian President Vladimir Putin “counts on the fatigue of democracies with sanctions,” the EU high representative for foreign policy said. “It is not easy but we must continue to put pressure on the Russian economy. Our European societies must not abandon this policy,” he added. Borrell’s comments echoed the argument he made in a blog post over the weekend, responding in part to Hungarian PM Viktor Orban’s statement that the embargo policy has been “miscalculated” and harmed the EU members more so than Moscow. The Spanish diplomat also argued the embargoes were not to blame for the pain at the pump, saying the price of oil was the same now as it had been in February. Borrell revealed that the EU is planning to impose a ban on Russian gold later this week, in a mini-package of measures intended to improve the implementation of existing sanctions. The ban would affect the “the direct or indirect import, purchase or transfer of gold, which constitutes Russia’s most significant export after energy,” according to the wording leaked to the Guardian. While Brussels is officially committed to supporting the Ukrainian government with a €9 billion ($9 billion) emergency loan, the Wall Street Journal reported no money had been paid out yet. Meanwhile, the fund to supply Kiev with weapons has been capped at €5.7 billion until 2027."
2022-07-18,https://www.rt.com/news/559191-russia-lgbt-propaganda-ban/,LGBT ‘propaganda’ faces complete ban in Russia,"The promotion of LGBT relations could be permanently banned in Russia under a bill introduced to the State Duma on Monday, which likens such messaging to war propaganda and incitement of hatred. Currently, LGBT ‘propaganda’ in Russia is only banned when directed at children, but some politicians have been calling for harsher restrictions and punishments for the “denial of family values” and “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations.” In an explanatory note attached to the bill, the authors argue that LGBT ‘propaganda’ has become widespread in Russia and is being promoted through the media, public events, streaming services and through the depiction of such relationships in films. “In Russia, at the legislative level, it is not allowed to promote suicide, drugs, extremism, criminal behavior, as they are considered negative and socially dangerous phenomena. At the same time, formally, until now, there is no ban on propaganda of the denial of family values and non-traditional sexual relations, including with the use of film distribution,” the note reads. The authors of the bill – who do not include members of the ruling United Russia party – claim the denial of family as a social value, promotion of so-called “childfree” lifestyles, and the approval and recognition of non-traditional sexual relations, is dangerous not only for children and young people, but for society as a whole, since it “puts the issues of demography and future economic growth at risk.” The bill seeks to supplement current legislation by introducing administrative and criminal responsibility for spreading LGBT messaging across any demographic in the Russian Federation and to deny distribution rights to films that promote such relations. “Family, motherhood and childhood in their traditional understanding, taken from the ancestors, are the values that ensure the continuous change of generations,” urge the authors of the bill, adding that they are a “condition for the preservation and development of the multinational people of the Russian Federation, and therefore need special protection from the state.” The lawmakers note that the prohibition of LGBT propaganda does not deprive Russian citizens of the opportunity and right to determine their sexual preference and orientation, nor does it allow for their discrimination in any way. However, they insist that these privileges “do not give them the right to seek public approval of such relations” or “disseminate ‘new’ values that carry hidden threats to society.” Last month, a similar bill was also introduced to the State Duma, seeking to introduce fines of over $160,000 for promoting non-traditional sexual relations. However, it failed to pass its first reading."
2022-07-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/559189-falklands-war-veteran-captured-donbass/,British Falklands War vet captured in Donbass asks for help – media,"A British man, who fought alongside the infamous Neo-Nazi ‘Azov’ regiment in Mariupol, has asked London for help in a video published by a Russian journalist over the weekend. Identified as John Harding, the man says he would otherwise “face the death penalty.” “I would say to [UK Prime Minister] Boris Johnson, if you can help, if you can influence [Ukrainian] President Zelensky, if you can influence the president of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), or if you can influence [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin, then please do,” Harding can be heard saying The clip was posted by a correspondent with Moscow's Channel One broadcaster, Marina Kim, on her Telegram channel. “People’s lives are depending on this. So, if you can, please, help,” he adds, saying that “otherwise I face the death penalty. My friends face the death penalty.” Harding’s friends and family confirmed to the BBC that it was him in the video. The UK Foreign Office told the British media it was “concerned” by his detention. Some major British media outlets like the BBC and the Guardian identify Harding only as a man “in his 50s and originally from Sunderland,” northern England. Some other media reports – both in the Russian and English-speaking news outlets – suggest he is a Falklands War veteran, 59, who also fought Islamic State (IS, former ISIS) in Syria together with Kurds. The man is said to have joined the infamous Ukrainian ‘Azov’ regiment in 2018. He was reportedly captured in May as the ‘Azov’ fighters had to surrender alongside other Ukrainian forces in the city of Mariupol following a months-long standoff with the Russian forces and the Donbass militias. Kim referred to him as a “British mercenary” in her Telegram posts as she confirmed he was “a footstep away” from his sentence and potential death penalty. The Donetsk People’s Republic authorities have so far not officially commented on his case. Two other British fighters – Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner – had previously been sentenced to death by a court in the DPR alongside a Moroccan national. All of them surrendered to the DPR forces in the city of Mariupol in the spring. London insists that its citizens should be treated as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention. Officials in Donetsk have said they consider the captives to be mercenaries, which means they are not under the protection of international law, unlike regular combatants. All the foreigners sentenced to death in the DPR have appealed their verdicts. Russia previously asked the UK to deal with the DPR directly, which the UK has refused to do. London has repeatedly refused to name the Donetsk People’s Republic, calling the region’s authorities “Russian proxies.”"
2022-07-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/559188-kiev-names-condition-peace/,Kiev names condition for peace talks with Moscow,"Peace negotiations with Moscow will make sense only after Russia’s defeat on the battlefield, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba has declared. In an interview with Forbes Ukraine published on Monday, Kuleba named Russia’s “aggressive behavior” as a reason for the absence of peace talks, arguing that any negotiations “are directly linked to the situation at the front.” “I tell all partners a simple thing: ‘Russia should sit down at the negotiating table after defeat on the battlefield. Otherwise, it will be the language of ultimatums again,’” Kuleba explained. He stressed that President Zelensky does not rule out “the possibility of negotiations” but believes that “there is no reason” for talks now. “He communicated this very clearly to the leaders of the countries who had hinted at negotiations. These leaders have also stopped talking about it,” Kuleba said. In June, Ukraine’s top negotiator David Arakhamia suggested that Kiev believes it could achieve a“favorable position” by late August after it conducts “counteroffensive operations in certain areas.” On Sunday, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev who is now a deputy chairman of the country’s Security Council, said that there shouldn’t be any doubts that all the goals of his country’s military operation in Ukraine would be achieved. At the same time, he noted that “such actions are not of an immediate nature,” referring to some of Vladimir Putin’s previous statements. “The President has repeatedly spoken about this, there are certain scenarios of how such operations are unfolding,” Medvedev explained. Moscow and Kiev started peace talks four days after the start of the Russian military offensive in Ukraine in late February. The sides have held several rounds in person in Belarus and then continued the talks via video link. In late March, the delegations from Russia and Ukraine met once again, in Istanbul. Since then, however, the talks have completely stalled. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia had provided Ukraine with a draft agreement but Kiev has ignored it. Peskov has previously accused the US and its allies of “actively betting on the continued war” and of not allowing Kiev “neither to think nor talk about or discuss peace.” Moscow has also warned the West against supplying Ukraine with weapons, saying that this would only lead to prolongation of the conflict and unnecessary casualties but would not change the outcome."
2022-07-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/559187-eu-ukraine-military-support/,EU ramps up military support to Ukraine,"The European Union agreed Monday to allocate an additional 500 million euros in military aid to Ukraine. With the approval of the fifth assistance package, the bloc’s aid to Kiev has reached €2.5 billion ($2.5bn), the head of the European Council Charles Michel announced following a meeting of EU foreign ministers. In his post on Twitter, Michel noted that the funds are being released in the framework of the European Peace Facility (EPF) – a financial mechanism created in 2021 to enhance the bloc’s ability to act as a global security provider. The EPF reimburses governments for military equipment supplied to Kiev, “including items designed to deliver lethal force for defensive purposes.” “EU support in military equipment to Ukraine Armed Forces now at €2.5 billion. Europe stands with Ukraine,” Michel wrote. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry welcomed the announcement describing it as “an important step in strengthening European security.” Ahead of Monday’s ministerial meeting, Bloomberg noted that the EPF has a ceiling of about €6 billion and is supposed to support not only Ukraine but also other countries. Over the summer the EU has to review how to continue supporting Kiev using this mechanism, Bloomberg reported citing sources familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, Russia has consistently warned the EU, the US, the UK and their allies against providing Ukraine with weapons. It argues that they only prolong the conflict and create long-term issues. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova earlier accused the EU of turning into “NATO’s economic relations department.” This followed a tweet by the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who claimed that “This war (in Ukraine) must be won on the battlefield.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-07-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/559175-russia-fine-google-youtube-ukraine/,Russia fines Google $366 million,"A Russian court has fined American search giant Google more than 21 billion rubles (f$366 million) on Monday, for its failure to delete prohibited information on the conflict in Ukraine, RIA Novosti has reported. Moscow’s Tagansky District Court has slapped a turnover-based fine on the IT-company for its repeated refusal to delete information prohibited by Russian law. Roskomnadzor, the national internet and media watchdog, had previously required the company to remove all “misleading information” regarding Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine, from YouTube. Prior to the court’s ruling, Roskomnadzor had sent Google 17 notifications requiring it to abide by Russian law, but the tech giant failed to comply. The total fine is equal to one tenth of the company and its affiliated structures’ annual turnover in Russia. Russia has long been critical of the way foreign platforms distribute online content that violates national laws. Last December, the Silicon Valley firm was hit with a fine of 7.2 billion rubles (around $98.1 million) for failing to take down banned content, which was the first time that an IT company had been fined in Russia with a penalty linked to its earnings. In late June, Roskomnadzor completed a report regarding what it said was Google’s repeated failure to remove prohibited items, saying the company had not deleted at least 7,000 “illegal materials” from Youtube. At the time, the watchdog accused the IT giant of promoting false information on the Ukraine conflict, and hosting material that supports extremism and encourages children to participate in unauthorized mass protests."
2022-07-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/559179-ukraine-prosecutor-sbu-zelensky/,Ukraine walks back firing of top security officials,"Contrary to reports on Sunday night, Ukraine’s prosecutor general and Security Service (SBU) chief have been suspended, but no decision has been made on whether to fire them, the office of President Volodymyr Zelensky clarified on Monday. Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova and SBU chief Ivan Bakanov were removed from duty in a surprise announcement on Sunday, with Zelensky claiming it was done because of “rampant” treason in both agencies, with 651 criminal cases against its employees launched. Such a vast “array of crimes,” as well as contacts between “employees of law enforcement agencies of Ukraine and Russia,” raise “serious questions” for Venediktova and Bakanov, the president insisted, warning that “every such question will get an appropriate answer.” The deputy head of Zelensky’s office, Andrey Smirnov, has now said “there’s currently no talk about firing those two officials. We’re talking about suspending the Prosecutor General from office, and the head of the SBU being temporarily barred from his duties.” The move was intended to prevent Venediktova and Bakanov from influencing criminal investigations against staff of their agencies, Smirnov explained, according to Interfax-Ukraine. The probes could end with both the prosecutor general and SBU chief being reinstated, he pointed out. In a later TV appearance, Smirnov reiterated that Zelensky would decide the future of the two officials only after investigations are concluded. The deputy head of Zelensky’s office rejected speculation that Aleksey Simonenko, who has been appointed acting prosecutor general, is set to keep the role permanently. “Some politicians should engage in less politics during wartime,” he advised. Smirnov also noted that the president would need approval from the Ukrainian parliament to reshuffle officials in such high-profile positions as prosecutor general or security chief."
2022-07-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/559167-ukraine-mercenary-russia-missile-strike/,Ukraine’s ‘foreign legion’ struck by missiles – Russia,"A facility used by Ukraine’s “foreign legion” in Donbass has been targeted in a Russian missile strike that killed up to 250 mercenaries and destroyed a number of military vehicles, Moscow’s Ministry of Defense announced on Monday. “A temporary mercenary deployment point of the so-called Ukrainian ‘foreign legion’ was hit with high-precision air-launched missiles in the settlement of Konstantinovka in the Donetsk People’s Republic,” the ministry claimed. “Up to 250 foreign militants, seven armored vehicles, as well as 12 special purpose vehicles were taken out,” it added. Kiev’s foreign military unit was created in late February at the request of President Volodymyr Zelensky, and is officially known as the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine. The Russian military said it had conducted another high-precision strike on the temporary deployment point of a battalion of the 118th Brigade of the Ukrainian Territorial Defense forces in central Ukraine’s Cherkasy Region. The strike killed up to 60 nationalists and destroyed two multiple rocket launcher systems, along with four artillery pieces. Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said last month that the best thing foreign mercenaries could expect was a “long term in prison.” He also claimed that attempts by Ukrainian officials to provide foreign fighters with legal protection by adding them to the list of the armed forces or giving them Ukrainian passports would not save them from prosecution. He also revealed that hundreds of foreign mercenaries in Ukraine had been killed by Russian long-range precision weapons “shortly after their arrival at the places where they were undergoing additional training and where the tactical units were coordinated.” However, most of them, according to the spokesman, were killed “due to a low level of training and a lack of real combat experience.” Data from the Russian Defense Ministry shows that 6,956 foreign citizens from 64 countries arrived in Ukraine to become pro-Kiev combatants between February 24 and June 17. Some 1,956 of those have been killed, while 1,779 have left the country, the ministry said. The latest strikes come after Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced on Monday that the Russian ‘East’ grouping in Donbass would make Ukraine’s long-range weapons their primary target. The Defense Ministry claimed that Kiev was using them to strike residential areas in Donbass and set wheat fields and grain warehouses on fire."
2022-07-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/559155-lavrov-ukraine-russia-deal/,Germany and France ‘killed’ Minsk agreements – Russia,"Germany is demanding that Russia guarantee Ukraine’s territorial integrity, but such a deal was previously signed, only to be “killed” by Berlin and Paris, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday. “When [German Chancellor] Olaf Scholz demands that Russia should be compelled to sign an agreement granting Ukraine guarantees of territorial integrity and sovereignty, all his attempts are in vain. There was already such a deal – the Minsk agreements – which was killed by Berlin and Paris. They were shielding Kiev, which openly refused to comply,” he wrote in an op-ed for the Russian newspaper Izvestia. Russia, Germany and France brokered the 2015 Minsk agreements between Ukraine and Donbass, which were designed to put an end to hostilities. But according to Lavrov, Berlin and Paris failed to ensure Kiev’s compliance. The Russian foreign minister noted that former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko admitted the Minsk agreements meant nothing for Kiev, and Ukraine used them only to buy time. “Our task was to stave off the threat... to buy time to restore economic growth and create powerful armed forces. This task was achieved. The Minsk Agreements have fulfilled their mission,” Poroshenko said in June. Lavrov also mentioned that in December 2019, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had a chance to fulfil the Minsk agreements at the so-called Normandy format summit held in Paris. After negotiations with leaders of Russia, Germany and France, Zelensky pledged to resolve issues surrounding the special status of Donbass. “Of course, he did nothing, and Berlin and Paris were shielding him once again,” he noted. The Minsk agreements included a series of measures designed to rein in hostilities in Donbass and reconcile the warring parties. The first steps were a ceasefire and an OSCE-monitored pullout of heavy weapons from the frontline, which were fulfilled to some degree. Kiev was then supposed to grant a general amnesty to the rebels and extensive autonomy for the Donetsk and Lugansk regions. Ukrainian troops were supposed to take control of the rebel-held areas after Kiev granted them representation, and otherwise reintegrate them as part of Ukraine. Poroshenko’s government refused to implement these portions of the deal, claiming it could not proceed unless it fully secured the border between the breakaway republics and Russia. He instead endorsed an economic blockade of the rebel regions, initiated by Ukrainian nationalist forces. Zelensky’s presidency gave an initial boost to the peace process, but stalled after a series of protests by right-wing radicals, who threatened to depose the new Ukrainian president if he tried to deliver on his campaign promises. Kiev’s failure to implement the roadmap, and the continued hostilities with rebels, were among the primary reasons cited by Russia when it attacked Ukraine in late February. Days before launching the offensive, Moscow recognized the breakaway Ukrainian republics as sovereign states, offering them security guarantees and demanding that Kiev pull back its troops. Zelensky refused to comply."
2022-07-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/559139-russia-middle-east-strategy/,Dmitri Trenin: How a smart Middle East strategy can help Russia play a significant role in shaping the new world order,"This week, Russian President Vladimir Putin travels to Tehran for a summit of the guarantors of the so-called Astana process, which aims to find a political settlement in Syria. Apart from a joint session with the other two participants, Iran’s Ibrahim Raisi and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Putin will hold talks with each separately. The visit comes soon after the Russian leader's trip to Tajikistan and Turkmenistan – the latter for the Caspian summit that brought together Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia and the host state. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, for his part, has recently traveled to Algeria, Bahrain, Oman, and Saudi Arabia, where he also met with counterparts from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. With relations between Russia and the West beyond repair for the foreseeable future, Russian diplomacy is focusing on non-Western countries, and the Middle East and North Africa feature prominently in Moscow’s new foreign-policy geography. Since Russia’s spectacular return to that part of the world in 2015 by means of a military intervention in Syria, the MENA region has been the principal area where Moscow’s post-Soviet approach to foreign affairs has taken shape, and where it has been most successful. Key elements of that approach have included: focusing strictly on Russia’s own national interests, while acknowledging the concerns of regional states; being flexible and able to manage differences with the main partners; staying in touch with all relevant players, while neither patronizing nor antagonizing anyone; managing relations with states which see each other as antagonists; and refraining from imposing any selfish design or demands on the region. This has worked, so far. Not that Russia’s record in the Middle East is impeccable – it has had its share of mistakes and failures – but it has been remarkably better than in many other parts of the world, including some much closer to home. This is even more remarkable when you consider the diversity of the Middle East and the intensity of conflicts there. As a result, this pattern of foreign policy making, based on profound knowledge of, expertise in, and empathy toward the region, which has miraculously survived –and expanded– in various agencies in the immediate post-Soviet years, makes it a useful template for adapting to other regional dimensions of Moscow’s global foreign policy. Since the start of the Russian military campaign in Ukraine, the importance of the MENA region to Moscow has grown substantially. With the airspace over the European Union off limits to Russia, Istanbul has turned into the main air transport hub for Russian travelers heading west. Wealthy Russians, no longer welcome in London, have flocked to Dubai. Meanwhile, the collapse of commerce along the traditional trading routes across the Russia-EU borders, the Baltic and the Black Seas gives a powerful boost to the North-South corridor from St. Petersburg to Mumbai via Iran and the Caspian. Turkey has emerged as the preferred venue for Moscow’s official contacts with Kiev and – along with Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the United Arab Emirates – it's now one of the few places where Russians and Westerners can have a dialogue on de facto neutral ground. Of fundamental importance, of course, is the refusal of Middle Eastern countries to join the US-led sanctions war targeting Russia. In the Kremlin’s optics, not being against Russia means being friendly toward it. This enhanced importance of the MENA region calls for revising upward Moscow’s regional strategy. Its general goal would remain maintaining functioning, friendly relationships with the countries of the region, to promote economic cooperation – in defiance of the sanctions regime – and to protect security along Russia’s southern borders. Some of the principal building blocks of that updated and enhanced strategy could include: While the updated strategy does not completely shun interaction with Western countries – e.g., on the Syrian conflict or on the Iranian nuclear program, it needs to view the West, primarily the United States and the European Union, as opponents seeking to completely isolate Russia. As such, the West’s policies will aim at defeating Russia’s regional strategy. Cooperation with the West in these circumstances has to be limited to the few issues that serve Russian interests and are in line with the values supported by the Russian people. Given that – with the exception of Iran and Syria – all other MENA countries maintain active and close relations with Washington and depend on the US for political support, financial or military assistance, technology or access to the American market, Russia’s strategy needs to be resourceful in dealing with the obstacles and limitations imposed by those dependencies, while offering tangible benefits to Moscow’s regional partners. At the same time, Russia will need to engage its major strategic partners, China and India, with a view to coordinating their policies on the Middle East, to the extent that it's both feasible and advisable."
2022-07-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/559153-shoigu-donbass-ukraine-rtillery/,Russian military given new priority in Ukraine,"Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has told military commanders of the ‘East’ grouping in Donbass to make Ukraine’s long-range weapons their primary target. The order came as he inspected troops stationed around Donetsk, the main city of the Donetsk People’s Republic. Shoigu gave orders to prioritize striking Ukrainian missile and artillery capabilities, due to their use by Kiev in targeting residential areas in Donbass and setting wheat fields and grain warehouses on fire, the Defense Ministry said in a statement on Monday. Ukraine’s long-range arms, which beside Soviet-designed systems include US-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, French CAESAR self-propelled howitzers and other foreign hardware, should be hit with high-precision weapons, according to the minister. On Monday, the People’s Republics of Donetsk said its territory had been shelled 53 times from the Ukrainian side over the past 24 hours, with more than 660 projectiles being fired. During their meeting, the commander of the ‘East’ grouping, Lieutenant General Rustam Muradov, informed Shoigu “about the current situation and the progress achieved in fulfilling the assigned combat tasks of destroying the opposing forces,” the ministry said. Shoigu’s unannounced tour of the Russian forces in Donbass was first revealed by the Defense Ministry on Sunday, when it said that the minister had inspected the ‘South’ and ‘Center’ groupings, meeting with their commanders, Army General Sergey Surovikin and Colonel General Alexander Lapin. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-07-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/559149-reasons-why-sbu-head-prosecutor-fired/,Zelensky explains why he fired Ukraine’s top security officials,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has fired Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova and the head of the country’s top security agency, Ivan Bakanov, citing allegedly rampant “treason” in both services. In Sunday’s dramatic announcement, he claimed that a large numbers of staffers at Kiev’s successor to the KGB, the SBU —which Bakanov headed since 2019 — were working with Russia. “As of today, some 651 criminal cases have been registered on high treason and collaboration activities of employees of the prosecutor’s office, pre-trial investigation bodies, and other law enforcement agencies,” Zelensky stated, announcing the decision. Amid the ongoing conflict with Russia, “more than 60 employees of the law enforcement agencies and the SBU” remained in the “occupied territory” and are now working against Ukraine, Zelensky claimed. That vast “array of crimes,” as well as contacts between “employees of law enforcement agencies of Ukraine and Russia,” are posing “serious questions” to the heads of the respective bodies, he went on, warning that “every such question will get an appropriate answer.” Bakanov, who assumed the spy-chief post shortly after Zelensky’s presidential victory in 2019, was removed under Article 47 of the Disciplinary Statute of the Ukrainian military. The article refers specifically to a serious failure in official duties “which caused loss of life or other grave consequences or create a threat of such consequences.” While Bakanov’s successor has not been named yet, Venediktova, who had served as prosecutor general since March 2020, has been replaced by Oleksiy Symonenko."
2022-07-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/559147-pope-urges-ukraine-russia-negotiations/,Pope calls for peace talks between Russia and Ukraine,"Pope Francis has urged his followers to pray for negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to resume. During Sunday’s Angelus service, he claimed to be “near the suffering Ukrainian people” and asked “how is it possible not to understand that war only creates destruction and death, driving people apart, killing truth and dialogue.” The comments, which were also posted on Twitter, were just the latest of many statements the pontiff has made regarding the conflict. He has repeatedly urged both sides to return to the negotiating table and for Western countries to cease beefing up their defense spending in response to the war. Earlier this month he announced he would “renew [his] closeness to the Ukrainian people, who are daily tormented by the brutal attacks that ordinary people are paying for,” calling on followers to pray for an “end to this senseless war.” Pope Francis has frequently called for “de-escalation” and an end to hostilities in Ukraine, recently declaring that while “the world needs peace,” that peace cannot be based “on the balance of arms or mutual fear.” The Catholic leader last month acknowledged that the war may have been “provoked,” citing a conversation with an unnamed head of state who commented that NATO was “barking at the gates of Russia” in a way that was all but certain to provoke a conflict. He also claimed World War III was underway and had been for several years. Last week, the Pope revealed that he plans to visit Kiev and possibly Moscow in the coming months, believing such a visit “would have positive results,” according to Vatican Secretary for Relations with States Monsignor Paul Richard Gallagher. No Pope has yet visited Moscow, and Francis’ previous request to do so was reportedly turned down, with Russia stating it was not the right time for such a visit. In addition to urging his followers to pray for peace in Ukraine, the Catholic leader also called on them to pray for the people of Sri Lanka, whose government recently collapsed due to widespread fuel and food shortages."

2022-07-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/559146-live-tv-protester-detained/,High-profile Russian TV protester detained,"TV editor Marina Ovsyannikova, who interrupted a live broadcast in March with a banner condemning Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, was detained in the Moscow region on Saturday, according to a statement posted on her social media. The whereabouts of the former Channel One employee is currently unknown, according to the post. Imagery shows her being led away by two police officers. Officials haven’t made any comments on her apparently being taken into custody or any reasons behind it. Later in the day, she was released. The detention came two days after Ovsyannikova staged a protest outside the Kremlin, condemning the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and, specifically, the deaths of children during the hostilities. Ovsyannikova displayed toys covered in ‘blood’ during her stunt and held a placard branding Russia’s president a “murderer” and Russian troops “fascists,” imagery from the scene shows. No action was taken against her during the protest. Ovsyannikova, a longtime video editor with Russia’s TV Channel One, made headlines in mid-March when she crashed a live news broadcast to protest the conflict. At the time, the then-video editor displayed a poster reading in English and Russian: “No war. Stop the war. Don’t trust propaganda. They’re lying to you here. Russians against war.” She also released a pre-recorded message online, condemning the hostilities. While the stunt got Ovsyannikova a minor fine in Russia, it scored her praise abroad. Having quit her job with Channel One shortly after her protest, she was hired in early April as a freelance correspondent for German newspaper Die Welt. In late May, she was awarded the Vaclav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent during the annual Oslo Freedom Forum in Norway. After her three-month contract with Die Welt expired, Ovsyannikova ultimately returned to Russia."
2022-07-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/559142-medvedev-crimea-strike-ukraine-judgement-day/,Former Russian president warns of ‘Judgement Day’,"The leadership of Ukraine would meet their maker should they attack Crimea, as Russia would retaliate with a massive strike, the country’s former president has warned. Speaking with Second World War veterans on Sunday in the city of Volgograd, Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s president from 2008 to 2012 and currently deputy chairman of the country’s Security Council, issued a dire warning to the authorities in Kiev, who had earlier said that a strike against Crimea was on the cards. “Some exalted bloody clowns that are periodically popping up over there with some statements, and are even trying to threaten us – I mean an attack on Crimea and so on,” should be aware that the consequences of such an action would be severe for them, the Russian official said. According to Medvedev, “in case something like that happens, the Day of Judgement will come to them all simultaneously – a swift and hard one.” The former president added that “it will be very difficult to hide” should Russia launch such a massive strike. He noted that despite these risks, the Ukrainian leadership is “continuing to provoke the overall situation with such statements.” At some point the Ukrainian authorities will start to realize that Russia will accomplish all of its operational goals in Ukraine no matter what, he said, including demilitarization and denazification. Medvedev, however, qualified his remark, by saying that the hope for such a scenario was “fairly faint because they are not acting sensibly.” He went on to claim that the government in Kiev is eager to fight Russian forces “to the last Ukrainian,” but this is likely to backfire and lead to the “collapse of the existing political regime” in the future. The former president acknowledged that Russia itself was going through a “very difficult” period in its history, and expressed confidence, however, that the country would emerge stronger out of the current conflict. “And we will achieve the set goals in the name of our country’s development and so as not to let our dear veterans down, who defended our motherland during the Great Patriotic War,” Medvedev concluded. Earlier on Sunday, Russian Senator Andrey Klishas echoed the former president’s statement, saying that “threats from the Ukrainian junta to attack Crimea or the Crimean Bridge only confirm that ‘denazification’ and demilitarization must be carried out throughout the whole of Ukraine.” Meanwhile, MP Mikhail Sheremet, who represents the peninsula in the Russian parliament, threatened Ukraine with a retaliation so harsh that the country would never be able to recover from it. A string of warnings and threats began pouring out of Moscow after a spokesman for Ukraine’s Directorate of Intelligence at the Ministry of Defense, Vadim Skibitskiy, said on Saturday that Kiev considers the Crimean Peninsula to be a legitimate target for long-range weapons provided by the West. “Today, the Crimean Peninsula has become a hub for the movement of all equipment and weapons that come from the Russian Federation to the south of our state,” the Ukrainian official explained. Crimea became a Russian region back in 2014 following a referendum in which the vast majority of its residents voted in favor of rejoining Russia. This vote was preceded by the Maidan coup in Kiev, with the predominantly Russian-speaking population of the peninsula refusing to recognize the new authorities as legitimate. Ukraine, along with the EU, the US and most other countries, consider Crimea an inalienable part of Ukrainian territory, which is temporarily occupied by Russia."
2022-07-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/559061-children-donbass-world-not-care/,"A view from Donbass: Ukraine has treated the people of this region as sub-humans, this made peace impossible","The military conflict in Ukraine, which began on February 24, was preceded by a long war in Donbass. Over the course of eight years, it claimed the lives of at least 14,200 people (according to the OHCHR), over 37,000 were wounded, hundreds of thousands became refugees or had their homes destroyed. A de-escalation was achieved in February 2015, as both sides realized that a bad peace was better than a good war, and attempted to find a political resolution on the basis of the Minsk agreements. That, however, failed to bring peace to Donbass, which instead faced eight long years of economic and legal blockade, compounded by chaotic shelling of areas near the frontlines. They were eight hard years, which involved rebuilding bombed schools, hospitals, and houses, a rather humiliating dependence of formerly well-to-do people on humanitarian aid, an economic slump due to the economic blockade imposed by the Ukrainian government, restricted access to pensions, and the risk of being wounded or killed for those who lived in urbanized frontline areas. People who voted for the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics in the referendum in May 2014 could never have imagined living in this endless terror. They were forced to wait for that terror to stop until February 2022, when Russia recognized the independence of Donbass and then deployed its military to, among other things, protect it and liberate territory occupied by Ukrainian forces since 2014. It hasn’t exactly been a walk in the park, but the people of Donbass now know that war will soon be over for them. The people’s militias of both republics are doing everything in their power to achieve victory as soon as possible. It may seem to an outside observer that some citizens of Ukraine backed by the Russian military are fighting other citizens of Ukraine backed by NATO. This description, however, would satisfy neither side of the conflict. Donbass residents no longer consider themselves citizens of Ukraine, while the Ukrainian government and society at large deny their sovereignty and dismiss them as collaborators and mercenaries for Russia. Both are wrong. In reality, it was precisely this denial of sovereignty that led Donbass to renounce everything having to do with Ukraine, and it started way before 2014. Let me add here that what was said above applies to the whole southeastern region of Ukraine, also known as Novorossiya; however, the case of Donbass was the most dramatic and revealing manifestation. It all began with dehumanization. After gaining independence in 1991, Ukraine was too big to be uniform. The enthusiasm of Galicia in the west to build a nation-state was mixed with depression in the southeast over the loss of a shared economic space with Russia. Machine building in Dnepropetrovsk, Kharkov, and Zaporozhye declined, Odessa’s Black Sea shipping operations were shut down. The country survived thanks to metallurgy and coal mining. Both industries were centered around Donbass. While almost a million people poured into the streets throughout Galicia for the funeral of Ukrainian politician and Soviet-era dissident Vyacheslav Chornovol, Donbass workers were toiling in the mines. While Ukrainians traveled to Europe as labor immigrants, miners in Donbass were dying on the job because of poor safety standards (profits ranked higher than lives during those lean years). ‘Let those miners die. They don’t see the Ukrainian sky anyway’ – that was the reasoning of some Ukrainians back then. The citizens of Donbass weren’t doing much reasoning – they were too busy mining coal and melting steel. The most aggressively ambitious of them were not happy with that setup though, so they chose the path of crime and raider attacks. The 1990s were times of rampant crime in Ukraine, and the so-called ‘Donetsk gangs’ were among the most adept at it. Donbass was now perceived as a breeding ground for criminals, which further tarnished its image. At the same time, Ukrainians turned a blind eye to similar financial groups with criminal ties in the nearby city of Dnepropetrovsk. Partially preserved industry (objectively speaking, metallurgy is easier to maintain than, say, rocket construction) and the concentration of capital in the hands of a narrow group of oligarchs made Donbass the vehicle for the Party of Regions, which was known as ‘pro-Russian’. In fact, there was little ‘pro-Russian’ about it – other than the fact that its leaders used the desire of people in the southeast to continue using Russian and keep their economic ties with Russia as a way to energize their base. This was the last step towards the dehumanization of Donbass, which was now perceived as non-Ukrainian. Instead of encouraging interethnic dialogue, it only led to Ukrainian nationalists’ promises to make Donbass more Ukrainized. It was just like what they had said about Crimea before – that it would either be Ukrainian or depopulated. A caricature of the typical denizen of Donbass emerged – a foulmouthed alcoholic, a lowbrow menial worker who dreams of turning Ukraine over to the Kremlin. People in Donbass took offence, talked about their complex industry which required sophisticated skills, and called Ukrainians freeloaders. The divide within the country kept growing. This was followed by the first wave of Maidan protests, which dismissed the southeast under the political leadership of Donbass as an entity which does not deserve a political voice. The presidential elections split the country into two halves, with one side accusing the other of falsifying the results. People in central and western Ukraine considered the residents of the southeast to be lowlifes with a slavish mentality who are incapable of fighting for freedom. They staged protests at the Maidan, demanding another runoff vote. Politicians leaning towards the southeast made some clumsy attempts at stirring up similar protests and convened a congress in Severodonetsk, which was later labeled by Ukrainians as ‘separatist’. Later on, however, they backed down for fear of upsetting the country’s newfound fragile stability. Donbass and the rest of the southeast retreated, waiting for a chance to take revenge. That revenge came in 2010, when their candidate won the election. A derogatory chant was coined: “Thanks, Donbass, for the president who is an ass.” Tensions in the country grew, not assuaged even by the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship, hosted jointly by Ukraine and Poland. Southeasterners got to enjoy their favorite sport, while Westerners tried their hand at organizing a European-level event. Everyone seemed happy, and yet western Ukrainian intellectuals, anticipating a forthcoming association with the EU, were smirking about how they had duped ‘the miners’ by enticing them with their beloved sport. Nobody asked ordinary Ukrainians whether they thought an alliance with Europe or with Russia would be better for their future. Those who wanted closer ties with Russia thought the choice was obvious, since their presidential candidate had won. Their opponents reasoned that Ukraine, since it became independent in 1991, only had the option of going down the European path. Any proposals to hold a referendum were dismissed. But when the signing of the EU Association Agreement was put on hold, people in central and western Ukraine revolted. Once again, they resorted to street politics, which Donbass despised. People in Donbass were used to working hard, earning enough to be more than comfortable, and delegating politics to politicians, expecting to receive competent leadership and the protection of Russian speakers’ rights in return. They wanted stability for a country recovering from the 2008 financial crisis and were pleading with their opponents not to incite a civil war. Maidan activists took that as a sign of weakness and decided they could defeat these people that they considered ‘rednecks’, now referring to them as ‘titushky’, ‘Donbass criminals’ that they accused of beating up Maidan protesters. Southeastern politicians had enough power to disperse the protesters, but chose to wait instead and kept pulling back the relatively small units of Berkut special forces. This is how they were defeated and left the southeast on their own to face the new government, and even worse, the mobs and their lust for revenge over ‘the blood of the Maidan martyrs’. The first decision of the new regime was to repeal the regional status of Russian. It was a move people in Donbass, Crimea, Kharkov, Odessa, and Zaporozhye could not forgive. People who used to prefer hard work to political activism were up in arms. Crimea, which enjoyed the status of autonomous republic and was the base of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, was lucky to have Russia’s support. Odessa wasn’t so lucky. On May 2, Ukrainian Nazis and ‘ultras’ from across the country descended upon the city, dispersed pro-Russian fighters, and proceeded to Kulikovo Pole, where they burned down a tent city and the Trade Union House, killing pensioners, women, and other ordinary people who had barricaded themselves inside the building. The people of Donbass decided to wait it out, hoping that “after all, they couldn’t possibly…” – they couldn’t possibly use the army against their own citizens, they couldn’t possibly use armored weaponry against their own citizens, they couldn’t possibly use the air force against their own citizens, they couldn’t possibly use tactical missile systems against their own citizens… No Ukrainian politicians were saints, and neither were the people of Donbass – not that anyone had asked them to be, though. The fact of the matter is that every escalation of violence was aimed at them. It was the Ukrainians who kept upping the ante, and nobody cared. The miners have always died, you know. Why should anyone feel sorry for them? They’re ‘dumb slaves’, they wear no balaclavas. Back then, in 2014, balaclavas were seen as a symbol of superior people, while the ‘stupid miners’ from Donbass (led by Valery Bolotov) and their volunteer supporters from Russia (led by Igor Strelkov) deliberately spurned them. The lives of the residents of impoverished mining towns cost less than the lives of those living in prosperous towns near the Carpathian Mountains. The air in Donbass stinks of soot and is full of coal dust and industrial emissions, so people die of cancer there, whereas the mountain air in Galicia is fresh and fragrant, and the wind of freedom blows in from Poland. Children were killed in Donbass. Nobody gave a damn, except Russia and the repressed Russians in the rest of Ukraine. It was rather amusing for the other side – people scraping their dead children off the asphalt and saying: ‘We’re being bombed, we’re scared, our children are dying!’ Ukrainians thought it was funny, a just punishment for those dehumanized earth-diggers. They called their children ‘Colorado beetle larvae’, because the stripes of the Colorado potato beetle resemble the St. George’s ribbon, which became the symbol of the uprising in Novorossiya. All of this convinced Donbass it had the moral high ground, which allowed it to stand tall and weather eight years of incredible hardship. The Ukrainians were granted the chance to reach a political settlement with the Minsk agreements, if they agreed to treat Donbass as a sovereign region within Ukraine. Had they done this, Donbass would have lost interest in politics, returned to its industrial roots, and left policymaking in the hands of western Ukraine again in a few years’ time. But they wouldn’t do this, even for the sake of stopping the war. Recognizing the sovereignty of Donbass was a red line for Ukraine, and so was dialogue with Donbass. The Ukrainian leadership stuck to those red lines even after Russia said it was going to put an end to the ongoing slaughter at its doorstep. So, what we now have is a new season of war, which has been going on for Donbass since 2014. The two people’s republics’ armies are storming Ukrainian fortifications as the Ukrainian military continues to bomb residential areas in Donetsk. People in Donbass stopped wondering “what they are capable of.” Now they know that the Ukrainian army and government are capable of anything – bombing cities, torturing people, and trying to pass off Donetsk people that they killed for Kiev residents, supposedly killed by Russian missile strikes. The only thing they can’t do is admit that the citizens of Donbass are people just like them, people who have their own interests and are prepared to fight for them until they win or die in battle."
2022-07-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/559134-ukraine-crimea-us-himars/,Ukraine threatened with ‘crushing blow’,"Russia’s response to a threatened Ukrainian attack on Crimean targets will be so harsh that the Kiev authorities will never be able to recover from it, Mikhail Sheremet, who represents the region in the Russian parliament, has warned. Commenting on continued suggestions by Ukrainian officials that Kiev forces may hit targets on the Crimean Peninsula or the Crimean Bridge, Sheremet stressed that such a move would be followed by “a crushing blow to decision-making centers in Kiev, military infrastructure and arms-supply logistics channels.” “The Kiev regime will receive such a rebuff that it will no longer be able to recover,” the MP told RIA-Novosti on Sunday. The warning follows Saturday’s statement by Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman Vadim Skibitskiy, who claimed that Crimea could be targeted by US-supplied М142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS multiple launch rocket systems. The peninsula is a legitimate target for Ukrainian forces due to becoming a Russian military transport hub amid the conflict between Moscow and Kiev, the spokesman said. Russia’s “Kalibr systems, frigates, small missile ships, submarines” in Crimea also “must be hit” as they endanger Ukraine’s security, according to Skibitskiy. Sheremet insisted also that “the US, which supplies lethal weapons to Ukraine, will also bear responsibility for the provocation towards Crimea.” “Russia won’t play nice with its enemies if the US decides to join their ranks. We have the opportunity to put in place the American authorities, who have crossed all red lines,” he added. Since Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine more than four months ago, several high-ranking officials and military commanders in Kiev have claimed that Crimea, which overwhelmingly voted to reunite with Russia in a 2014 referendum after a coup in Ukraine’s capital, could be attacked by the Kiev’s forces. Earlier this month, Alexey Arestovich, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said the Ukrainian military would target the Crimean Bridge as soon as it obtains the capability to carry out such a strike. American officials had earlier claimed that their Ukrainian counterparts had promised them that US-made arms wouldn’t be used to hit Russian territory as it could escalate the conflict even further. However, Kiev says it doesn’t view Crimea as part of Russia, considering the peninsula to be Ukrainian territory occupied by Moscow. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

On Saturday, the spokesman for Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s Directorate of Intelligence, Vadim Skibitskiy, told the broadcaster 1+1 that Kiev considered Crimea, which overwhelmingly voted to become part of Russia in a referendum in 2014, to be a legitimate target for its forces.

Russian “Kalibr systems, frigates, small missile ships, submarines” in the area also “must be hit” as they endanger Ukraine’s security, he added. Several Ukrainian officials and military commanders have issued warnings over the past four months that Crimea, as well as the 19-km-long Crimean Bridge connecting the peninsula to Russia’s Krasnodar Region, could be attacked. Earlier this month, Alexey Arestovich, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said Kiev would target the Crimean Bridge as soon as it obtains the capability to do so. Officials in Washington have said that they were given assurances by the Ukrainian leadership that American weapons wouldn’t be used hit Russian territory as it could escalate the conflict even further.

2022-07-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/558555-nato-uk-response-force/,London falling: Britain's military decline exposes NATO's collapse in credibility and capability,"The secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Jens Stoltenberg, recently announced the US-led military bloc’s goal of expanding its so-called ‘Response Force’ from its current strength of 40,000 to a force of more than 300,000 troops. “We will enhance our battlegroups in the eastern part of the Alliance up to brigade-levels,” Stoltenberg declared. “We will transform the NATO Response Force and increase the number of our high readiness forces to well over 300,000.” The announcement, made at the end of NATO’s annual summit, held in Madrid, Spain, apparently took several defense officials from the NATO membership by surprise, with one such official calling Stoltenberg’s figures “number magic.” Stoltenberg appeared to be working from a concept that had been developed within NATO headquarters based upon assumptions made by his staffers, as opposed to anything resembling coordinated policy among the defense organizations of the 30 nations that make up the bloc. Confusion is the name of the game at NATO these days, with the alliance still reeling from last year’s Afghan debacle and unable to adequately disguise the impotence shown in the face of Russia’s ongoing military operation in Ukraine. The bloc is but a shadow of its former self, a pathetic collection of under-funded military organizations more suited for the parade ground than the battlefield. No military organization more represents this colossal collapse in credibility and capability than the British Army. Even before the current Ukraine crisis kicked off, the British military served more as an object of derision than a template of professionalism. Take, by way of example, the visit of UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace to Zagreb, Croatia in early February 2022. Croatian President Zoran Milanovic accused the British of trying to incite Ukraine into a war with Russia, as opposed to trying to address Russia’s concerns over the existing European security framework. Wallace flew to Zagreb for consultations, only to be rebuked by Milanovic, who refused to meet with him, noting that he only met with the defense ministers of superpowers, adding that “the UK has left the EU, and this gives it less importance.” But London keeps putting a brave face on a sorry reality. Take, for example, the offer of written security assurances to Sweden and Finland made by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. These pledges were designed to bolster the resolve of the two Nordic nations as they considered their applications to join NATO. But there was no substance to the British offer, if for no other reason than the British had nothing in the way of viable military capability to offer either the Swedes or the Finns. Even as Johnson proffered the proverbial hand of assistance to his newfound Nordic allies, the UK Ministry of Defense was wrestling with planned force reductions that would see the British Army cut from its current “established strength” of 82,000 to 72,500 by 2025 (the actual strength of the British Army is around 76,500, reflecting ongoing difficulties in recruitment and retention.) Even these numbers are misleading – the British Army is only capable of generating one fully combat-ready maneuver brigade (3,500 to 4,000 men with all the necessary equipment and support). Given the reality that the UK is already on the hook for a reinforced battalion-sized “battlegroup” that is to be deployed to Estonia as part of NATO’s so-called enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) posture (joining three other similarly-sized “battlegroups” fielded by the US in Poland, Germany in Lithuania, and Canada in Latvia), it is questionable whether the British could even accomplish this limited task. Last month’s deployment to Estonia of a battlegroup comprised of the 2 Rifles infantry regiment underscores the pathos that defines real British military capability. The 2 Rifles Battlegroup includes the three infantry companies and one fire support company integral to the unit, along with supporting artillery, engineering, logistic, and medical elements. France and Denmark provide a company-sized unit to the British-led battlegroup on an alternating basis. Altogether, the British battlegroup comprises some 1,600 soldiers, and is fully integrated within the Estonian 2nd Infantry Brigade. Given what we now know about the reality of modern warfare, courtesy of the ongoing Russian operation in Ukraine, the British battlegroup would have a life expectancy on an actual European battlefield of less than a week. So, too, would its allies in the Estonian 2nd Infantry Brigade. First and foremost, the units lack any sustainability, both in terms of personnel and equipment losses that could be anticipated if subjected to combat, or the basic logistical support necessary to shoot, move, or communicate on the modern battlefield. Artillery is the king of battle, and the British and Estonians are lacking when it comes to generating anywhere near enough tubes to counter the overwhelming fire support expected to be generated by any hostile Russian force. Stoltenberg’s hypothetical 300,000-strong Response Force envisions the existing battlegroups to be expanded to brigade-sized formations, ironically tasking the British to generate more combat power at a time when it is actively seeking to reduce its overall manpower levels. While the British may be able to scrape enough substance from the bottom of the barrel, so to speak, to accomplish this projected reinforcement, there would literally be nothing left to back up Boris Johnson’s bold offer of substantive military assistance to Sweden and Finland, leaving the British prime minister looking more like the captain of the Titanic after it hit the iceberg, issuing directives and acting as if his words had any impact, all while his ship is sinking."

It is, first of all, a cluster of military hardware, ammunition and materials that are concentrated in the Crimea, and then sent in to supply the Russian occupying forces,” Skibitskiy stated. Kiev is also seeking to attack the warships of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, stationed in Crimea, Skibitskiy went on. The warships are being used to launch cruise missiles and therefore are “among the targets that must be hit in order to ensure the safety of citizens, our installations and Ukraine in general,” he explained. The threat comes a day after Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov announced that Kiev has received its first M270 MLRS systems. The official did not elaborate on whether the systems have already been deployed on the battlefield, nor from where exactly they’d arrived. Earlier, London had pledged to supply at least three systems of the type. М142 and M270 are effectively two variants of the same system. Tracked M270 lacks mobility of the truck-based HIMARS, yet carries twice the 277mm launch tubes – 12 as against six. Still, the systems lack the range necessary to outright strike Russia’s Crimean Peninsula. The systems, however, can be fitted with Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) modules to launch heavier missiles, boasting ranges of up to 300 kilometers (186 miles). While Kiev has been looking to obtain such long-range munitions, Washington appears to be reluctant to deliver them over fears they would be used to hit deep into Russian territory and greatly escalate the ongoing conflict. Crimea, however, appears to be a special case, given that neither Washington nor Kiev recognizes it as an integral part of Russia. Crimea voted to leave Ukraine and join Russia in March 2014, following the US-backed Maidan coup in Kiev. Kiev appears to be fixated on targeting Crimea as a whole and, specifically, the Kerch bridge, constructed to simplify the connection to the Russian mainland. Destroying the bridge has been repeatedly floated as an idea by top Ukrainian officials over the past few months despite the fact that Moscow has seized the southeast of Ukraine, establishing an overland connection to Crimea. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/558778-us-campaign-stalin-regime/,"Zelensky, 2022, Stalin 1942: The US propaganda machine can easily make heroes, but it can quickly change the script","America’s sudden love affair with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and Kiev’s military forces is reminiscent of an old campaign to exalt a previous ally of geopolitical circumstance: Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. Just as in the Georgian strongman's heyday, the US political establishment and media-entertainment complex have responded to a crisis in Eastern Europe by portraying their preferred combatants as heroic friends who must be supported. In fact, Zelensky and his country’s defenders have been painted as freedom fighters battling to save democracy from evil aggressors – even as Kiev bans opposition parties, shuts down media outlets, and otherwise silences critics of the regime. For instance, outlets such as Newsweek and the Associated Press have touted Zelensky as a “defiant hero” and a “modern Churchill.” The comparison to former UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill wasn’t sufficiently glowing for CNN, which said Zelensky is a “more unlikely hero.” After all, the liberal network argued, Churchill was “an imperialist rather than a pure believer in democracy.” Zelensky, despite taking such actions as arresting the main opposition party's leader and banning critical TV and online outlets, apparently qualifies as a greater democrat than a man who lost office, by the ballot box, shortly after his greatest victory. Eight decades ago, Churchill and US President Franklin Roosevelt faced a similar challenge in trying to beautify the Western public image of Stalin, a hated enemy before Nazi leader Adolf Hitler broke a non-aggression pact by attacking the Soviet Union. As American historian Albert Marrin wrote in ‘A Time of Fear’, his 2021 book on the red scares before and after World War II, there was considerable public concern “over fighting one mass murderer with the help of another.” The joke back then was that the main difference between Stalin and Hitler was the size of their mustaches. “Otherwise, they were the same cold-blooded monsters,” Marrin said. But the Allied powers deemed support for the Soviets advantageous to keep Axis forces deployed on the Eastern Front, where 90% of German casualties would be suffered, taking much of the heat off their own armies. The White House used its new Office of War Information (OWI) propaganda unit to burnish the Soviet regime’s image while providing $11.3 billion in wartime aid to the USSR, equivalent to nearly $190 billion in today’s dollars. As in the current conflict, media outlets did much of the heavy lifting. Stalin was depicted as “Uncle Joe,” a trusted ally and brave leader. He appeared on the covers of major magazines, including three times on Time, which named the Georgian generalissimo its “Man of the Year” in January 1943. Later that same year, Collier’s magazine did a cover story making the dubious claim that the USSR was evolving “toward something resembling our own and Great Britain’s democracy.” This was a half decade after the Great Purge, when Stalin wiped out somewhere in the region of a million people during an attempt to eliminate perceived political threats. The New York Times agreed, asserting in 1944 that “Marxian thinking in Soviet Russia is out. The capitalist system, better described as the competitive system, is back.” Life magazine promoted the Soviet leadership present and past, including calling Vladimir Lenin “a normal, well-balanced man who was dedicated to rescuing 140 million people from a brutal and incompetent tyranny.” That was strangely high praise, given that the US government didn’t recognize the USSR until nearly a decade after Lenin’s death. Life also praised Soviet citizens, calling them “one hell of a people” who “look like Americans, dress like Americans and think like Americans.” Stalin’s brutal secret police, the NKVD, were described as “national police similar to the FBI,” whose job was “tracking traitors.” Life added, “If Soviet leaders tell us anything, we can afford to take their word for it.” The OWI also made efforts to promote the Soviet Red Army. A 1942 propaganda poster showing a smiling, apparently Russian, soldier was captioned, “This man is your friend. He fights for freedom.” Fast-forward to today, and praise for Ukraine’s military is similarly effusive. The Pentagon, for example, has been so impressed by Kiev’s forces that its leaders have suggested their exploits will be studied by future generations of soldiers. Ukraine’s fighters “will go down in military history” for their resilience in battling the Russian military, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in April. Even in defeat, such as Russia’s capture of Severodonetsk last month, the Pentagon has hailed the fighting prowess of Ukraine’s personnel. An unidentified US official has been quoted as saying that when Ukrainian forces retreated, “they chose to do [it] of their own accord.” However, the current portrait of Ukrainian forces has required major airbrushing of neo-Nazi elements, which establishment media outlets covered more openly before Russia launched its military offensive in February. As Reuters pointed out in 2018, dozens of volunteer militias in Ukraine use Nazi symbolism and recruit Hitler acolytes into their ranks. Those groups have attacked anti-fascist demonstrations, government meetings, media outlets, foreign students and minorities, among other targets, Reuters noted. Some 40 US senators signed a letter in 2019 demanding that some of those militias, including the Azov Battalion, be designated as terrorist organizations. But with Ukraine now a media darling, to the extent that major outlets acknowledge the country’s fascist elements, it’s typically to whitewash them. For instance, NBC News argued in March that because Zelensky has Jewish heritage and there have been no “recent mass killings or ethnic purges” in Kiev, it’s “absurd” for Russian President Vladimir Putin to claim that Moscow’s military offensive is partly designed to “denazify” the former Soviet republic. Likewise, President Joe Biden and other US leaders have mocked the notion that Ukraine has a Nazi problem, typically citing Zelensky’s Jewishness as their proof. “Putin has the gall to say he is denazifying Ukraine,” Biden said in March. “This lie isn’t just cynical, it’s obscene.” However, the fact is Ukraine incorporated neo-nazi militias, including the Azov Battalion, into its National Guard after the country’s democratically elected leadership was overthrown in a US-backed coup in 2014. Those fighters have been hailed for their alleged heroism in battling Russian forces, and Western outlets have amplified Azov propaganda, such as a falsely claimed chemical weapon attack in Mariupol. In fact, immediately after the Russian offensive began, Facebook altered its rules to allow users to praise the Neo-Nazis. The new wave of apologism for openly fascist elements – Ukraine has statues, street names and public marches venerating WWII-era Nazi collaborators – follows years of US political rhetoric hyping fears of neo-Nazism. Democrats in Congress, including Representatives James Clyburn (South Carolina) and Jerry Nadler (New York), likened then-President Donald Trump to Hitler. Prior to the current crisis, Americans knew little about Ukraine, which consistently ranked as one of the poorest and most corrupt nations in Europe. When Ukraine became a big news story during the 2014 coup, the Washington Post found that only one in six Americans were able to find the country on a map. The median guess was 1,800 miles off. Nevertheless, once Russian tanks rolled across the border, Americans were quick to accept the new narrative about Zelensky and Ukraine. A Pew Research Center poll found that 72% of Americans had confidence in Zelensky to “do the right thing in world affairs.” In fact, the Ukrainian president ranked ahead of all other world leaders in the survey, including Biden at 48%. Selling the public on Zelensky and Ukraine has been vital, given that the deeply indebted US government is pumping tens of billions of dollars’ worth of aid into Kiev and leading the charge for anti-Russia sanctions, which have contributed to the nation’s highest inflation rates in more than 40 years. And if warnings from Russian leaders are to be believed, the campaign to supply weapons to Ukraine and punish Moscow has put Americans and the rest of humanity at risk of potential nuclear annihilation. With the stakes so high, critics of Biden’s Ukraine policy have been branded as Russian stooges or traitors. The New York Times and USA Today, among other outlets, have dismissed opposition as “far-right” rhetoric. Such voices have repeated the Kremlin’s “misleading claims” about the war, The Times said, including “unfounded” allegations about US-funded biolabs in Ukraine. Rolling Stone called Fox News host and Biden critic Tucker Carlson a “Putin sycophant,” while MSNBC suggested that he was echoing Moscow's talking points because he wanted the US to become more like Russia, “with paleoconservative and white nationalist principles.” Hollywood was quick to jump on the “Stand With Ukraine” bandwagon. Actors Ben Stiller and Sean Penn went so far as to pay visits to Zelensky in Kiev, with the former telling the Ukrainian president, “You’re my hero.” Penn threatened in March to boycott the Academy Awards show and smelt his two Oscars if organizers didn’t invite Zelensky to participate in the event. As it turned out, Zelensky didn’t get to make a remote appearance, but the Los Angeles awards program featured a moment of silence for Ukraine and an appeal for public donations. The Ukrainian president did give a recorded speech at the Grammy Awards in April. Zelensky had no reason to doubt the entertainment industry’s support. He told Ukrainians in a March speech, “The whole world admires you, from Hollywood stars to politicians.” Several major studios announced in March that to show their support for Ukraine, they were halting the release of their films in Russia. In the UK, the opening of a blockbuster Guy Ritchie movie called ‘Operation Fortune’ has reportedly been delayed because it needed to be revised to reflect newfound reverence for Kiev. It turns out that gangsters in the story were identified as Ukrainian, which is no longer acceptable. Hollywood was also a key pillar in the campaign to sell Americans on Stalin and the Soviets. Studios rushed to produce pro-Soviet films – such as ‘The Boy from Stalingrad’, ‘Song of Russia’, and ‘Moscow Strikes Back’ – in many cases getting OWI approval for their scripts. In ‘Days of Glory’, starring Gregory Peck as “Vladimir,” Soviet guerilla fighters were portrayed as defenders of democracy. ‘The Battle of Russia’ featured ordinary citizens depicted as patriots devoted to their leaders, a theme that was too far-fetched even for Stalin, who once admitted that the Soviet people “fought for their homeland, not for us.” Roosevelt requested the making of a movie called ‘Mission to Moscow’, which was based on a book by a former US ambassador to the Soviet Union, Joseph Davies. The film portrayed Stalin as a kindly and wise leader with a fondness for children. It sanitized the Moscow show trials of 1936-1938 – which Stalin used to purge his political enemies – depicting them as a necessary step to expose traitors. Speaking to an audience that watched the movie in Chicago, Davies reportedly said, “The word of honor of the Soviet government is as safe as the Bible.” Ukrainian-born Soviet engineer Victor Kravchenko, who was assigned to Washington under the lend-lease program and later defected, cringed when he heard such gullibility as he traveled around America during the war. In his 1946 book, ‘I Chose Freedom’, Kravchenko recalled: “A thousand times, I had to listen in frustrated silence while the Soviet dictatorship was given full credit for the achievements of the Russian people. Stalin’s grip on the American mind, I realized with a shock, was almost as firm as his grip on the Russian mind.” Once the war ended, it was no longer necessary to promote Uncle Joe and the Red Army. The temporary allies were quickly estranged once Hitler was vanquished. With a congressional committee hunting down alleged communists as traitors and Hollywood facing pressure to prove its patriotic loyalty, Soviet-related films had a decidedly darker tone, as evidenced by such titles as ‘The Red Menace’ and ‘Behind the Iron Curtain’. A US poll conducted in March 1946, just 10 months after the war in Europe ended, showed that 60% of Americans believed their government was too soft on policy toward the USSR, while only 3% said it was too tough. By a 65%-25% margin, respondents believed the Soviets would go to war to get what they wanted. Later that same year, a poll showed that 62% of Americans said their feelings had become less friendly toward the Soviet Union, compared with only 2% who said they felt more friendly. The US-Ukraine relationship remains chummy, though it’s perhaps no longer in a honeymoon phase. Some observers questioned whether the ties were beginning to fray last month, when Biden said Zelensky “didn’t want to hear” Washington’s warnings early this year that the Russians were poised to launch an attack. Ukrainian officials called the claim “absurd.” Biden critics, such as Fox Business host Charles Payne and podcast host Jack Posobiec, said Zelensky was being thrown “under the bus.” With the economic effects of the conflict multiplying on the home front, US public support for Ukraine aid has begun to wane. Polling by research firm Morning Consult earlier this month showed that 81% of Americans remained at least “somewhat” concerned about the Russian offensive in Ukraine, down from 90% in March. Less than half of respondents (46%) said their government should impose sanctions on Russian oil, even if that causes fuel prices to rise, down from 55% in April. Only 43% of US voters, including 32% of Republicans, see the protection of Ukraine as America’s responsibility, down from 50% in April. Nevertheless, Biden’s administration is making plans to keep shipping weapons to Ukraine for “months and years,” a Pentagon official told reporters last week. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated late last month that the administration was committed to backing Kiev for the long haul. “We are giving Ukraine the support it needs to defend itself for as long as it takes, and we will continue to do so,” he said. Back in May, Blinken linked America’s heroic allies past and present: “Those who study the past know President Zelensky and the brave people of Ukraine embody the spirit of those who prevailed during the second World War.”"
2022-07-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/559087-ukraine-accuses-top-banks-war-crimes/,Ukraine accuses top Western banks of 'war crimes',"Major global banks, including JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, Citigroup and Credit Agricole, are “committing war crimes” by financing companies that ship Russian oil, a top Ukrainian official has said. In an interview with the Financial Times, parts of which were published late on Friday, Oleg Ustenko, economic adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, claimed that the financial institutions were guilty of “helping the Putin regime in this specific way,” referring to trade in Russian hydrocarbons. The revenue, in turn, is allegedly being used to fund Moscow’s offensive against its neighbor, Kiev claims. The official also told journalists that Ukraine’s Ministry for Justice is going to sue the banks at the International Criminal Court once the conflict is over. Ustenko pointed out that Kiev’s security services are keeping tabs on those lenders, which are supporting Russian fossil fuel trade. According to the FT, earlier this week the presidential adviser sent letters to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, Citigroup and Credit Agricole, in which Ustenko urged the financial institutions to stop providing credit to companies that trade Russian oil and sell shares in state-backed oil and gas groups Gazprom and Rosneft. The Ukrainian official reportedly accused the banks of “prolonging” the conflict and warned they would not be allowed to take part in the postwar reconstruction of Ukraine. The letters reportedly stressed, among other things, that HSBC’s and Credit Agricole’s asset management arms still hold shares in Gazprom and Rosneft, Russia’s state oil and gas firms. Citigroup allegedly provides credit facilities to another Russian oil and gas giant, Lukoil, as well as to Vitol, a Dutch energy company that trades in Russian oil, according to the letters seen by the FT. JPMorgan Chase is another global bank that extends credit lines to the Dutch trader, Ustenko reportedly claimed. On top of that, Kiev believes that the lender still holds stakes in Russia’s largest majority state-owned bank, Sberbank, as well as Gazprom and Rosneft, which were all described in the letter as some of the Kremlin’s most valued economic assets. In early July, JPMorgan Chase warned that attempts to impose a price cap on Russian oil could see global prices rise to a “stratospheric $380/bbl.” In his letter to the bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, Ustenko insisted that JPMorgan Chase’s assessment was nothing more than “scaremongering, based on poor quality analysis,” the FT reported. The Ukrainian official also allegedly berated Dimon for referring to the situation in Ukraine as a mere “crisis.” In a subsequent statement, JPMorgan Chase argued that it has “diligently” and actively implemented all Western sanctions against Russia. Citigroup and Credit Agricole, while not responding directly to the Ukrainian official’s letters, reiterated statements they had issued before about suspending and paring back activities in Russia. HSBC declined to comment. Privately, bankers revealed to journalists, however, that it has proven impossible to divest some of their Russian holdings because of the sanctions and other restrictions already in place. Vitol, a Dutch energy trader whose name cropped up more than once in Ustenko’s letters, pointed out that it had cut its Russian oil business by 80% since late February, with the remaining volumes in full compliance with Western sanctions."
2022-07-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/559085-ukrainian-shelling-hits-russian-territory/,Ukrainian mortar shells hit Russian region – governor,"Russian territory came under Ukrainian fire early on Saturday, according to the Governor of the Kursk Region, Roman Starovoyt. The official said the shelling did not lead to casualties, but damaged several buildings in the village of Tetkino. This is not the first time the border area has come under Ukrainian attack. “More than 20 shells landed today during the morning mortar shelling,” the governor wrote on Telegram. “Fortunately, there are no casualties among the residents,” but the attack did result in “minor” damage to several households, the governor added, while pledging “all necessary assistance” to affected locals. Accompanying Starovoyt’s Telegram post were two photos presumably shot in the border locality. One depicted a window pierced by shrapnel, the other featured what looked like a fence made of sheet metal with a single opening, apparently also left by shrapnel. Tetkino has previously been targeted by Ukraine. Back in May, a truck driver was killed in the village, and several more civilians were injured as a result of shelling. The conflict has also affected other Russian regions bordering Ukraine. In early July, the Ukrainian military hit Belgorod with several ballistic missiles, killing a total of five civilians, and leaving at least four more injured. The attack also resulted in considerable damage to apartment buildings and houses. Russia’s military claims to have intercepted all three incoming Tochka-U missiles, saying the damage was caused by falling debris. The city of Belgorod is located some 40 kilometers from the Ukrainian border."
2022-07-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/559076-russias-defense-minister-surprise-visit-ukraine/,Russia’s defense minister pays surprise visit to Ukraine,"Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has inspected Russian troops involved in the ongoing military operation in neighboring Ukraine, the ministry revealed on Saturday. Shoigu met the commanding officers of the ‘South’ and ‘Center’ troops, Army General Sergey Surovikin and Colonel General Alexander Lapin, as well as other senior commanding officers. “The head of the Russian defense ministry gave the necessary instructions to ramp up the actions of groups in all operational areas in order to exclude the possibility of the Kiev regime to launch massive rocket and artillery strikes on civilian infrastructure and residents of settlements across Donbass and other regions,” the military said in a statement. The minister also awarded Gold Star medals to Lapin and Major General Esedulla Abachev for “courage and heroism” throughout the ongoing conflict. The decree to present the officers with the top state awards had been signed earlier by Russian President Vladimir Putin, the military noted. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-07-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/559073-nasa-roscosmos-agree-spaceflight-seat-sharing/,NASA and Roscosmos agree on spaceflight seat-sharing,"The US and Russia have reached a deal to fly each other’s spacefarers to the International Space Station (ISS). The breakthrough comes after months of tensions and uncertainty over joint space activities in the wake of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Both Russia’s space agency Roscosmos and its American counterpart, NASA, confirmed on Friday that they have agreed on the so-called “integrated flights.” The ultimate goal of the agreement is ensuring that at least one US astronaut and one Russian cosmonaut are present at the ISS to maintain respective segments of the station, Roscosmos explained. “The agreement meets the interests of Russia and the United States and will promote the development of cooperation within the International Space Station program framework,” the agency said in a statement. A NASA spokesman, Josh Finch, emphasized that “flying integrated crews ensures there are appropriately trained crew members on board the station for essential maintenance and spacewalks.” The deal is a “no-exchange-of-funds arrangement,” Finch stated, and includes all the necessary training as well as “transportation to and from the International Space Station and comprehensive mission support.” “It also protects against contingencies such as a problem with any crew spacecraft, serious crew medical issues, or an emergency aboard the station that requires a crew and the vehicle they are assigned to return to Earth sooner than planned,” he added. The first mission under the arrangement, involving NASA astronaut Frank Rubio and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitry Petelin, is set to take place in late September. The crew will use the Russian Soyuz spacecraft to reach the ISS. Another mission, scheduled for the autumn as well, will fly a US Crew Dragon spacecraft. The mission will likely involve the only woman in Russia’s active cosmonaut roster, Anna Kikina, Roscosmos revealed. The apparent breakthrough in NASA-Roscosmos ties comes after months of tensions sparked by the ever-worsening relationship between the two countries, further aggravated by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The announcement of the deal also coincided with the dismissal of Russia’s long-time space chief, Dmitry Rogozin, who got replaced with Yury Borisov in a government reshuffle on Friday."
2022-07-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/559069-ukraine-mlrs-systems-delivered/,Ukraine gets its first US-made M270 missile system,"Kiev has received its first M270 MLRS (Multiple Launch Rocket System), Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov announced on Friday. The system will be “good company” for US-supplied М142 HIMARS launchers, the minister said in a Twitter post. While Reznikov did not elaborate on who exactly supplied the US-made system, as he extended his gratitude generally to Ukraine’s “partners,” Britain had previously pledged to deliver at least three systems like this to Kiev’s forces. The US-made M270 MLRS system is, effectively, an older cousin of М142 launchers, which had previously been supplied to the Ukrainian military by Washington. While the tracked system is less mobile than truck-based HIMARS, M270 packs twice the punch, featuring 12 tubes to launch 227 mm missiles against six. It was not immediately clear whether the new M270 launchers had already gotten to the frontline or not. The M270 HIMARS system was deployed by Kiev to the battlefield in late June. While Ukrainian officials insist the systems have been used to target “warehouses with weapons and stocks of fuel and lubricants” used by the Russian military, Moscow and Donbass authorities accused Kiev of using the weapons to shell civilian areas. Speaking at a media briefing on Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Kiev forces had been using “US-supplied multiple-launch rocket systems HIMARS on all fronts” as of late. The military “has apparently been ordered by Kiev to use the said launchers against civilians without any hesitation,” she claimed, while accusing Washington of sharing intelligence on targets with Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly warned the West against “pumping” Ukraine with weapons, insisting that such aid would only prolong the conflict and inflict further damage on the Ukrainian people rather than change its ultimate outcome. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-07-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/559068-liz-truss-british-mercenary/,UK blames Russia for ‘mercenary’s’ death,"British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on Friday summoned the Russian ambassador over the death of British citizen Paul Urey in the captivity of the Donetsk People’s Republic. Truss declared that Russia “must bear the full responsibility” for Urey’s death, which Donetsk officials attributed to his chronic health conditions. The Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) announced on Friday that Urey had passed away on Monday, nearly three months after he was detained at a checkpoint along with another British national, Dylan Healy. DPR ombudsman Darya Morozova stated that Urey suffered from “a number of chronic diseases,” including insulin-dependent diabetes, and died despite receiving medical treatment by his captors. “Russia must bear the full responsibility for this,” Truss declared on Friday, in a statement announcing that she had summoned Russian Ambassador Andrey Kelin. “Paul Urey was captured while undertaking humanitarian work,” Truss claimed. “He was in Ukraine to try and help the Ukrainian people in the face of the unprovoked Russian invasion. Those responsible will be held to account.” While Truss insisted that Urey had traveled to Ukraine as an aid worker, Morozova described the Briton as a “career soldier” who had fought in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. She said that he had been leading combat operations with the Ukrainian military, as well as “training mercenaries.” Russia has previously asked the UK to deal with the DPR directly, which the UK has refused to do. Speaking to the BBC after British fighters Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, found guilty of being mercenaries, were sentenced to death by the DPR last month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the British government should “talk to the DPR” about the two men. Truss has consistently refused to name the Donetsk People’s Republic, calling the region’s authorities “Russian proxies.” DPR authorities have told Aslin that nobody from the British government reached out directly to them about his case, his grandmother told the BBC last month. DPR officials notified the UK of Urey’s capture, but “no reaction from Great Britain had been forthcoming,” Morozova said on Friday. She added that the UK failed to send medicine to Urey via the International Committee of the Red Cross, and “ignored even the mere possibility of conducting talks on his return as part of a prisoner swap.”"
2022-07-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/559058-bellingcat-security-undesirable-designation/,Russia labels Bellingcat ‘undesirable’,"Russia’s prosecutor general’s office on Friday labeled the Western state funded Bellingcat investigative group, as well as two other non-profits, “undesirable organizations.” The designation, which is expected to be formalized by the country’s Justice Ministry shortly, effectively means a ban on operating in Russia. The prosecutors targeted both UK-based Bellingcat Ltd. and its Dutch branch Stichting Bellingcat. Latvia-registered media outlet The Insider and the Czechia-domiciled Central and Eastern European Law Initiative (CEELI) non-profit were also deemed “undesirable.” All of the organizations pose a threat to Russia’s “constitutional order and security,” the prosecutors claimed in a statement. The designation entails the mandatory closure of all local chapters and freezing of any assets held in Russia. Attempts to circumvent the ban carry administrative and criminal penalties. Over the past few months, Moscow has repeatedly targeted Bellingcat, placing the group under various restrictions. Back in October 2021, Russia previously labeled the organization, helmed by British-citizen Eliot Higgins, a “foreign agent” – a status that placed certain restrictions on its operations. Further action was taken by the national internet and media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, in March, when it blocked access to its website. Founded in 2014, Bellingcat portrays itself as an investigative group specializing in fact-checking and open-source intelligence, with both professional and citizen journalists contributing. It has received state funding from the US, Britain and the Netherlands. Russian Foreign Intelligence Service chief Sergei Naryshkin has accused Bellingcat of working closely with Western intelligence services. The sole purpose of the group was to “put pressure on either the country [Russia], or individuals and entities,” the spy boss alleged. “They use dishonest methods. And the information that is used in such cases is false, unverified, it has its own goals... They are ready to perform any task, because they do it for money, not objectively,” Naryshkin asserted. The GrayZone, last year, revealed that the group has ""accepted enormous sums from Western intelligence contractors"" while MintPress News outlined how it was funded by a CIA cutout organization and filled with former spies and state intelligence operatives. Bellingcat has repeatedly targeted Russia in its work, trying to pin the blame on Moscow for the 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Donbass, as well as for various incidents related to the war in Syria and the alleged poisoning of prominent Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny. The group’s findings have been repeatedly amplified by leading Western media outlets, which routinely take them at face value, without mentioning their funding. Moscow, however, has on numerous occasions called Bellingcat’s credibility into question, challenging the group’s findings with its own data."
2022-07-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/559053-russian-space-agency-reshuffle/,New Russian space boss unveiled,"The top Russian official responsible for the defense industry has been reassigned to head up the space agency Roscosmos. This move was part of a reshuffle ordered by President Vladimir Putin on Friday. Yury Borisov, who previously held the office of deputy chair of the Russian government and supervised defense contracts and research, was given the space job previously held by Dmitry Rogozin. Although it was not immediately clear what the former Roscosmos head would do next, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he would get a new assignment in the future. Rogozin, formerly an MP, Russia’s envoy to NATO and a deputy prime minister, was tasked to take the helm at Roscosmos in May 2018. While leading the space agency, he preserved his combative style of communication. In 2014, he suggested that NASA would have to use trampolines for manned space missions, due to freshly imposed American sanctions against Russia. The remark came during a period when the US relied on Russia to deliver and recover crew members of the International Space Station. Lately, he has been involved in a series of public spats with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Roscosmos marked Rogozin’s departure with a two-minute video highlighting the achievements of his four-year tenure. Those included a record-long string of over 80 successful space launches and the testing of the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, Russia’s new nuclear weapons delivery system. Borisov is a career military officer who specializes in air defense systems and electronics. Between 2012 and 2018, he served as deputy defense minister responsible for modernization of the military, in particular the acquisition of modern weapon systems. He was promoted to deputy chair of the government to replace the outgoing Rogozin. Another order issued by Putin on Friday was to raise the rank of the office of Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov, who will now be deputy prime minister while keeping his ministerial portfolio. Manturov, a key person in the Russian government’s effort to mitigate the damage caused by Western trade restrictions, has been charged with finding or creating alternative sources for crucial materials and parts required by the Russian economy."
2022-07-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/559038-russia-comments-airstrike-vinnitsa/,Russia explains deadly strike on Ukrainian city,"The Russian military has confirmed launching a missile attack at a target in the city of Vinnitsa in Ukraine. The Defense Ministry denied claims that it was a deliberate strike on civilians, stating that it hit Ukrainian military commanders as they were negotiating with foreign arms suppliers. Russia targeted the House of Military Officers in Vinnitsa with sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles, the Defense Ministry said on Friday during its daily briefing. The discussion was about the “transfer of more warplanes and weapons systems as well as the repair of the Ukrainian military air fleet,” the ministry outlined. The Russian strike killed all participants at the gathering, it claimed. According to Ukrainian officials, the incident left 23 civilians dead and injured scores of others, 80 of whom had to be hospitalized for treatment. President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Moscow attacked the city center deliberately and accused it of terrorism. The discussion was about the “transfer of more warplanes and weapons systems as well as the repair of the Ukrainian military air fleet,” the ministry outlined. The Russian strike killed all participants at the gathering, it claimed. The head of the Vinnitsa Region, Sergey Borzov, reported that Ukrainian air defenses engaged Russian missiles over the city and claimed they intercepted four of them. Kiev has accused Russia of waging a genocidal war, claiming that Russian forces have a policy of killing Ukrainians. Moscow has rejected such allegations, saying its forces only attack legitimate military targets. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/559032-starbucks-russia-rapper-owner/,Top Russian rapper eyes Starbucks buyout,"Rapper Timati was named by news outlet Mash among a group of people about to take over Russian coffee houses previously operated by US giant Starbucks. Like many other Western companies, Starbucks has shut down its outlets and is planning to pull out of the Russian market. Timati, whose real name is Timur Yunusov, has banded with restaurant tycoon Anton Pinsky and Senator Arsen Kanokov – the owner of a large commercial real estate holding – to acquire Starbucks’ assets in Russia, Mash said on Friday. Later in the day, the purchase was confirmed by the RBC business news site, which spoke to Kanokov’s holding Sindika and a spokesman for Pinsky, who said the details of the deal published by Mash were accurate. The Mash report described the sale as almost finalized and said that “the possibility of backtracking like Elon Musk did with Twitter is out of the question,” referring to the US billionaire’s aborted bid to buy the popular social media platform. The outlet said the buyers will receive the rental agreements for all 130 Starbucks outlets in Russia, as well as the employment contracts of its 2,000 workers, but will have to operate them under a new brand name. It did not offer details about the terms of the purchase. A popular performer and subject of constant celebrity gossip, 38-year-old Timati is also an accomplished businessman. His former record label, Black Star, grew into a major investment holding over 15 years. When he split with his business partners and left the label in 2020, Timati took as his share of the assets a chain of barber shops, beauty salons, tattoo parlors, and a carwash business. He also remained involved with a premium burger restaurant brand. According to Forbes estimates, in 2021 alone, he earned over $10.4 million. Starbucks, which opened its first coffee house in Russia in 2007, suspended all operations in March, after Russia attacked Ukraine. The US and its allies responded with an unprecedented wave of economic sanctions, and Western companies faced public pressure to cut all business ties with Russia. A similar deal was struck by McDonald’s, which sold its Russian assets to businessman Aleksandr Govor. The restaurants began reopening last month under a new name that translates as ‘Just Tasty’. Mash joked that Starbucks may soon be known as ‘Just Coffee’ in Russia."
2022-07-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/559031-russian-oil-price-benchmark/,Russia has price cap-busting oil plan - media,"Russia has ramped up efforts to create its own national oil pricing benchmark as part of its response to Western efforts to limit its oil revenues, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing government and industry sources. According to the agency, the Western sanctions campaign, which was launched after Russia began its military operation in Ukraine, and the attempts to squeeze its oil export revenue with a proposed price cap, have reinvigorated the idea. US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen is attempting to set an upper limit on how much Moscow can charge for its crude exports. Some experts have warned that the scheme may backfire. The Russian government wants to have a pricing benchmark in action sometime between March and July of 2023, the business news outlet reported. Discussions about the plan are in the early stages, but were confirmed by an executive in the energy industry, the report said. The country has tried for years to launch a national benchmark based on crude trade at the St. Petersburg International Mercantile Exchange, but the volume of foreign deals made on the exchange has not been high enough for this purpose. The US and its allies are seeking to damage Russian crude trade with nations like China and India, which refused to join the sanctions drive, by leveraging their dominance in the areas of insurance and finance. According to the plan, tankers carrying Russian oil would be denied these types of services if the price of the product is higher than what Western nations allow. The cap would apparently be at a level that would allow trade to be somewhat profitable for Russia, but far below what it currently earns. Western nations hope that buyers of Russian crude will agree to the plan out of self-interest. Global oil prices have surged due to supply chain disruptions and uncertainty resulting from the sanctions imposed on Russia, allowing Moscow to receive large profits despite reportedly offering big discounts to customers. The proposed cap “will give Russia a way to continue exporting oil at a price I expect would be quite profitable for them relative to shutting it in,” Yellen said on Thursday. Moscow has indicated that it will not trade at discriminatory terms, and has said the US-led plan would likely backfire by further driving up prices."
2022-07-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/558853-ukraine-needs-120-fighter-aircraft/,"Mikhail Khodarenok: The West says it wants Ukraine to win, but is it ready to supply Kiev with the armaments it needs for victory?","Participants in the NATO summit in Madrid called upon Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to settle for nothing less than a military resolution to the conflict in Ukraine. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo voiced the position of the US-led as follows: “It is very important to continue talking with President Volodymyr Zelensky, emphasizing that the war can only be won on the battlefield, and we must continue to support President Zelensky and the population of Ukraine so that they win on the battlefield,” Alexander De Croo said. The collective West’s military, political, and strategic goals in the armed conflict in Ukraine have at least two facets. The first is to prevent Russia’s military from achieving success during its military operation in Ukraine. The second is to thereby restrain China’s possible aspirations to solve the Taiwan problem by military means. However, in order for Ukraine to gain the upper hand, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) must, at a minimum, achieve air supremacy (at least during a presumed offensive or counterattack of strategic scale, at least for a while), as well as numerical and qualitative superiority in artillery and armored troops. Among other things, the AFU needs to stockpile sufficient material resources (jet fuel, diesel fuel, gasoline, ammunition, food supplies) for at least 30 days of combat operations. Even with the help of the collective West, this would be a very difficult task. It looks especially difficult in terms of implementation. Let’s take as an example Ukraine’s Air Force and some other branches of its armed forces. In order to gain air supremacy, or at least fight on equal footing with the Russian Aerospace Forces, the Ukrainian Air Force would require at least 124 multifunctional fighters (i.e. three fighter regiments of 42 aircraft each), 36 combat planes (three squadrons of 12 aircraft) and six training fighters (dual control aircraft). It is quite possible that these units will be organized like those of the United States and other NATO countries – squadrons of 24 fighters, with three squadrons combined into a wing. Among the possible contenders to become Ukraine’s main combat aircraft, the most likely candidate is America’s F-16C /D, which is currently being withdrawn from service in the US Air Force and replaced by the F-35. However, it is not that a concrete decision has yet to be made on this issue – these problems have not even been discussed. Now, let’s try to imagine how the process of re-equipping the Ukrainian Air Force with fundamentally new aircraft will go. To begin with, it will be necessary to send at least 200 flight personnel to the United States for retraining (so that there are at least two crews for each fighter). Maintenance personnel will also have to be sent for retraining (aircraft mechanics from different battalions). The number of these specialists will be about an order of magnitude greater than the number of actual pilots. However, an airplane is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to aviation. Ukraine will have to be supplied not only with combat planes, but also the entire array of airfield equipment, from fuel tankers and the necessary fuel to airfield power units and the loading trolleys that deliver aviation weapons to the planes and mount them on the aircraft. Absolutely none of Ukraine’s equipment is compatible with American fighters, as it is all Soviet-made. Not even its free-fall bombs, whose size and suspension lugs differ from similar products from the United States. In addition, the US (as well as other NATO countries) will have to supply the Ukrainian Air Force with the entire range of aviation weapons (from guided and unguided missiles of various classes to free-fall bombs) in sufficient quantity to last for a very long period of hostilities. With the transfer of Western-made combat planes to Ukraine, the problem of controlling fighters in the air during combat will inevitably arise. The American F-16s are not integrated in the automated command and control systems of Ukraine’s current fighter aircraft in any way, shape, or form. And, in order to solve this problem, the United States might well have to supply the Ukrainian Air Force with planes like the Hawkeye E-2C/D – a tactical early warning aircraft equipped with long-range radar. Without such means, it will be simply impossible to effectively control planes during air battles and strikes against ground targets. Now what remains is to calculate when these three fighter aviation regiments will reach ‘initial operational readiness’, as they say in the US. According to the most optimistic forecasts, this won’t happen before the winter. We see approximately the same picture (but certainly less complicated) with the formation of armored divisions. To give the AFU offensive potential, they will need at least four to five tank brigades (each numbering 120-140 main battle tanks) equipped with M1 Abrams (in this case, there are possible options – the Leopard-2 or Leclerc). Again, Ukrainian tank crews will have to go through all the necessary stages in this case – retraining, obtaining new weapons and equipment, and live-fire exercises. So, it will not be possible to resolve these issues very quickly. With ground artillery and multiple rocket launchers, things will be easier. The AFU will be able to master them quickly enough. But even here, the processes of obtaining and mastering this hardware will not be simultaneous in any way. It will take many months to form 7-8 artillery brigades with 72 guns each (the APU requires no less) and bring them to the level of combat readiness. But, during this time, the political environment and strategic situation on the front may change significantly, and there is no reason at all to assume that this will be in Ukraine’s favor. There is only one conclusion to be drawn here – the Russian Armed Forces need to achieve significant results without waiting for Ukraine to be rearmed with advanced modern weaponry of Western standards. In other words, to use the time needed to equip the AFU to their own advantage."
2022-07-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/559003-moscow-responds-londons-threats-truss/,Moscow responds to London’s threats,"Russia’s Foreign Ministry has blasted “Russophobic” remarks by British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who promised to “continue to lead the free world” against Moscow and ensure Ukraine’s victory. Truss made the remarks during a campaign event for Tory leadership on Thursday. The aspiring PM candidate, who scored third in Thursday’s ballot, bragged about her ability to “deliver” and make “tough” decisions, listing her staunch support for Kiev as an example of her decision-making abilities. “I stood up to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin by targeting Russia with the toughest sanctions his regime has ever seen. And I would continue to lead the free world in opposing Putin and making sure that Ukraine prevails,” Truss stated. The remark was not taken lightly in Moscow, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova blasting her words as “Russophobic” and “invariably steeped in painful aggression and nationalism.” Amid the ongoing Tory leadership campaign, Truss “has begun spewing threats towards our country and its leadership and wants to achieve a ‘Ukrainian victory’ over Russia,” in an effort to “fulfill her compulsive ambitions,” according to Zakharova. “[Truss’] ambition alone to ‘lead the free world’, in an effort to resist Russia, speaks volumes. She looks like a second-rate politician afflicted by megalomania. And she is doing all of this instead of addressing the issues at home, which are plenty,” she said in a statement. The proclaimed efforts to somehow “defeat” Russia are likely an attempt to “distract voters” from the real problems the UK has been experiencing, Zakharova said. “Our response to belligerent outbursts by the British Foreign Secretary, who prefers riding tanks over engaging in serious diplomacy, and her determination to ‘defeat’ Russia, is straightforward – go ahead and try. Many have tried in the centuries-old history of our country. As everyone knows, intelligent people learn from other people’s mistakes. Liz Truss could learn from her own mistakes,” Zakharova concluded."
2022-07-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/558998-antonov-airport-battle-video/,VIDEO shows fierce battle for Antonov Airport in Ukraine,"Live-action footage from the battle for the airfield outside Ukraine’s capital city of Kiev was posted online by RT Russian reporter Valentin Gorshenin on Thursday. The video, incorporating footage from the body cams of soldiers and imagery captured by drones, unveils previously unseen episodes of the battle for Antonov International Airport, located near the town of Hostomel, which occurred in the early days of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In the footage, soldiers are seen preparing for a helicopter assault at a staging area at an airfield in Belarus. The troops are then shown disembarking from helicopters and securing the Antonov airfield and multiple buildings at a military installation nearby. Attack and transport helicopters are shown providing support to the troops and hitting ground targets. The airborne troops are ultimately reached by the land forces seen pouring into the airfield en masse. Fighting at the airport resulted in the destruction of the world’s largest cargo aircraft, the Antonov An-225 Mriya, which was stationed there. Developed in the late 1980s, the Soviet-built behemoth was inherited by Ukraine and used for cargo deliveries. The carcass of the plane was captured on film by a drone and can be seen at the end of the video. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/558992-ukraine-nazi-torture-chamber/,RT visits neo-Nazi torture dungeon in Ukraine (VIDEO),"RT’s Murad Gazdiev has visited the former base of the notorious but now disbanded Ukrainian neo-Nazi Tornado battalion. It is located in the village of Privolye near the Lugansk People's Republic city of Lisichansk, which was recently liberated by Russian and allied forces. The Tornado battalion was formed in 2014 from the remnants of another volunteer unit called Shakhtersk. Despite the unit’s designation as a volunteer police battalion, it was led by a career criminal named Ruslan Onishchenko and the core of the group also consisted of ex-cons. Tornado was disbanded in 2015 after it faced an array of allegations of kidnapping, rape, torture and unlawful killings. The ‘policemen’ committed many of their grisly deeds at their headquarters, which had been set up in a local school. While the battalion is long gone, the memory of its actions lives on among the locals. Tornado fighters routinely grabbed people in the streets while searching for ‘separatists’ and inquiring why villagers were not in the army, a local man recalls. He showed the RT crew a dark room with no windows in the school’s basement, which was said to be the torture dungeon of Tornado. “People came out with bruises, beaten, and some were not found at all. My friend’s son disappeared, he still has not been found,” the man said, adding that some 5-6 people from his village alone vanished without a trace after their ‘stay’ at the battalion’s headquarters. I don’t know why they were like that. Maybe because they are Bandera followers and Nazis. The exact number of Tornado’s victims remains unknown – locals are still searching for their graves. “They were doing something in the basements, they were walking around dressed like Nazis, they were shooting at the cemetery, they had a shooting range there. People disappeared, we’ve dug up everything around there – no one knows where they have gone,” a local woman said. Onishchenko was sentenced to 11 years in prison for kidnapping and torture back in 2015. Several of his associates also received jail terms for kidnapping, torture, rape, and looting. However, shortly after Moscow launched its large-scale operation against Ukraine in late February, Kiev began releasing inmates who wanted to serve on the frontline – regardless of the seriousness of their crimes. Onishchenko was turned loose earlier this week, despite not having served his term in full, and as he awaited a new trial for his alleged involvement in a 2018 prison riot. Moreover, nearly all of the jailed fighters with the notorious battalion are now said to have been set free. According to the Ukrainian media, Onishchenko’s original sentence had been commuted in accordance with a 2015 law that says one day spent in pre-trial detention counts as two days in jail. However, the former commander had remained behind bars while awaiting trial for the prison riot. “Nearly all of the battalion’s members are now back on the frontline, fighting in various units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” Viktor Pandzhakidze, the ex-spokesman for Tornado, told Ukrainian media. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/559000-media-law-retaliation-foreign/,Putin signs media discrimination tit-for-tat law,"President Vladimir Putin signed a bill into law on Thursday making countries that restrict or ban Russian media subject to retaliation. According to the law, “if a ban (restriction) is imposed on the activity of a Russian media outlet within the territory of a foreign state,” the prosecutor general and deputies may apply similar measures to that country’s media outlets operating in Russia, resulting in “the termination of the correspondents’ accreditation,” revoking of registration or licenses, and the closure of offices. The ban could be lifted “only after the elimination of the circumstances which served as the basis for its adoption,” the document states. The new law also allows the prosecutor general and deputies to withdraw the registration or terminate the broadcasting license of any media outlet in certain circumstances. These include the distribution of false information, discrediting the activities of Russia’s armed forces, as well as demonstrating clear disrespect “for society, the state, and the official symbols of the Russian Federation.” Dissemination of “information containing calls for the organization and (or) participation in unauthorized public events,” as well as calls to impose sanctions on Russia and its citizens, could also lead to suspension and potentially a ban. Previously, only courts had the power to withdraw media registration or revoke licenses. In case of a first violation, the prosecutor general or deputy would submit a request to the media regulator, Roskomnadzor, to suspend the activities of the media outlet for up to three months. In the event of a repeat violation, a similar order could be issued for six months. With repeated distribution of false information, the outlet’s registration would be revoked. According to the bill, Roskomnadzor can lift the restriction if the media outlet rectifies the matter within a specified timeframe. The legislation comes in response to what Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova described as “mediacide based on ethnicity and political beliefs.” Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, which was launched in late February, has further strained relations between Moscow and the West. In response to the operation, Western countries introduced bans and restrictions on certain media outlets. As a result, RT and Sputnik – and even their accounts on some social media platforms – were made inaccessible in the EU. Australia, Canada, and the UK followed suit. Russia retaliated by blocking the websites of several Western state-run outlets, including the BBC and Deutsche Welle."

The leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said in a Telegram post that the Ukrainian military had hit a bus terminal. Among the victims are a young woman “who was going home from work” and a bus driver, the official revealed. Pushilin went on to claim that a US-supplied М777 howitzer had been used in the attack against an area where there are no military installations. He described the attack as “yet another deliberate shelling of civilians in the republic.” Also on Thursday, the authorities in Kiev claimed Moscow hit the city of Vinnitsa with missiles, allegedly killing 20 people, including three children, with 52 more injured. The Russian military would not immediately comment on the attack. However, RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan cited a Russian defense official as confirming the strike and claiming that it targeted a building which had been used as a temporary shelter for “Nazi” fighters. Both Kiev and Moscow have repeatedly accused each other of hitting civilian targets. Russia insists that only military objects are targeted."

Some 40 Russians have sought to be removed from the sanctions list, with around 30 taking the matter to court and 10 others addressing the EU authorities directly, according to the news outlet. An unspecified number of these individuals may actually succeed in their effort, as EU lawyers have already admitted that some of the restrictions may have been imposed based on weak legal grounds. The European Council’s legal service reportedly told EU ambassadors on Wednesday that some of the requests filed by the sanctioned Russians may have merit. The evidence supporting the restrictions against those individuals turned out to be either weak, too old, or outright false. However, the number of Russians who may have the measures against them lifted represents only a fraction of the people targeted by the EU over the past few months. Since the beginning of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the bloc has targeted hundreds of high-profile Russians, including top officials, business leaders and their family members over their alleged role in the ongoing conflict.

The latest casualty report by the emergency services claimed that 20 people were killed, including three children, while 52 others were injured. The incident happened on Thursday morning as city police said a total of three projectiles hit the downtown. Ukrainian air defenses shot down four other missiles over the city, according to Sergey Borzov, the head of the Vinnitsa Region administration. Multiple images purporting to show the aftermath of the incident show charred, heavily damaged vehicles, buildings with shattered windows, and other evidence of a powerful blast. There were also small fires in the area, photos and videos show. Ukrainian media claimed that the weapons hit an office building. Reports said they also damaged nearby residential buildings and the building of the House of Military Officers, an institution operated by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, which normally serves as a concert hall. The Russian military would not immediately comment on the incident. RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan cited a Russian defense official as confirming the attack and saying that the House was the intended target. Ukraine used it as a temporary shelter for its “Nazi” fighters, the source claimed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky decried the incident as the latest atrocity allegedly committed by Russia, claiming on social media that that Russian troops targeted civilians on purpose. The Ukrainian leader has also accused Russia of waging a genocidal war against his nation, while Moscow insists it only uses force against legitimate military targets.

2022-07-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/558976-kaliningrad-russia-transit-eu/,Russian exclave head hails blockade victory,"New EU guidance has removed the majority of restrictions on the transit of Russian goods to the country’s exclave of Kaliningrad, Governor Anton Alikhanov said on Thursday. Adding that Russia will continue to seek the removal of the road transit ban. On Wednesday, the EU Commission issued “additional guidance” after Lithuania, citing EU sanctions against Moscow, banned shipments via its territory. Russia called the measures unprecedented and illegal, as they affect access to its own territory. The EU Commission’s latest guidance allows Russia to resume rail transit under certain conditions. In an interview with Rossiya 1 TV Channel, Alikhanov described the EU’s move as a victory for Russian diplomacy, explaining that it lifted “more than 80% of the restrictions imposed on Kaliningrad transit.” The first deliveries of goods, he added, will begin “today or tomorrow.” He emphasized that resumption of rail transit is especially important for the transportation of building materials and metals. However, the governor said, “a significant part of the goods” remain under restrictions as the road transit of sanctioned goods is still not allowed. Alikhanov estimates that the ban affects 500-700 thousand tons of cargo per year out of 2.7-3 million tons of all sanctioned goods, which are subject to transit. Russia will continue “to press further and solve this problem completely,” Alikhanov stressed. He also noted that Russia reserves the right to provide a tough response if the restrictions on road transit are not lifted. ""The proposals that we made, of course, remain on the table, they are of varying degrees of destructiveness, economic effect,” he said. Meanwhile, Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte, speaking to the press on Thursday, confirmed that her country intends to follow EU guidance. She cited three reasons: respect for the EU Commission as an institution, the fact that the rules apply not only to Lithuania but to the “entire EU” and, most importantly, “respect for transatlantic unity.” The prime minister also made it clear that until Lithuanian authorities establish new rules based on the EU clarifications, the current procedure for transit to Kaliningrad will stay in force. Simonyte also emphasized that the guidelines “very clearly state” that there is no return to the situation that existed in mid-June, “when all goods could be transported in transit through the territory of the EU to and from Kaliningrad.” On Tuesday, Lithuania’s Customs Department reported it had stopped 34 trucks trying to cross its border from Kaliningrad and Belarus because they were transporting “sanctioned goods.” The trucks were forced to return to the territories of Russia and Belarus, it added. The vehicles were transporting car parts, furniture, glass, and alcohol, it revealed."
2022-07-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/558973-criminal-code-amendments-treason/,Russia ramps up punishments for taking enemy side,"Russia has introduced more severe punishments for actions that it considers detrimental to its national interests, such as joining the enemy during wartime or fighting against the country in foreign armed conflicts. The legislation was signed into law by President Vladimir Putin on Thursday. The bill is meant to ensure more effective “detection, prevention and disruption of criminal activity aimed at undermining the foundation of constitutional order, defense and security” of Russia, according to its sponsors. The law amends various parts of the Russian Criminal Code. Among other things, it equates to state treason joining enemy forces during wartime, a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Russian citizens and residents who would take up arms and actively fight in third countries “with goals contradicting the interests” of Russia will face up to 20 years in prison. The previous version of the article provided for a jail term of up to 15 years for simply joining the ranks of an unlawful militia. A part of the law that didn’t change is that first-time offenders may lay down arms voluntarily and be amnestied. Other changes relate to activities from cooperating with foreign intelligence services and failing to protect classified information entrusted to the offender to disrupting internet traffic in Russia and making public calls that harm national security. One of the amended articles, which covers hate crimes, criminalizes the repeated public demonstration of Nazi symbols or the symbols of extremist groups. This offense will be punishable by a four-year prison term, though the law provides judges leeway to choose other measures, such as heavy fines and community service. MP Ernest Valeyev, one of the sponsors of the bill, argued that Russia needed to update the Criminal Code to meet “the challenges of our time.” It was not adequate to certain situations that can arise, for example, from the deployment of Russian troops in Syria, he said in an interview. The legislation was first introduced in the Russian State Duma in late May. The parliament approved it in its final third reading in early July, with the upper chamber, the Federation Council, giving the green light last Friday."

It is a global conflict,” he said in an interview with Pink TV. The president said that the ongoing global war is what concerns him the most, and, in his view, it will only get worse. He also added that the conflict in Ukraine is taking its toll on the Balkans, reiterating that Serbia would do its best to keep the peace in the region. Moreover, Vucic believes that after Russia gains some more ground in eastern Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin will approach the West with a certain “proposal.” “I know what awaits us. As soon as Vladimir Putin has done his work in Seversk, Bakhmut and Soledar, after reaching the second line Slaviansk-Kramatorsk-Avdeevka, he will come up with a proposal. And if they [the West] don’t accept it, – and they won’t – all hell will break loose,” he predicted, without providing any details on the would-be initiative. The Serbian president also offered the reminder that his nation maintains close relations with Russia and China, adding that pursuing such policies does not come easy for Belgrade right now. Vucic’s comments come after Serbian Interior Minister Aleksandar Vulin said in early July that the West should apologize to Belgrade for the 1999 bombing campaign instead of forcing it to become a “NATO foot soldier” in the conflict with Russia."
2022-07-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/558928-iran-supply-uav-drones/,Might of the Islamic Revolution: Can Iranian drones help Russia in Ukraine?,"Last Monday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan claimed that Iran is preparing to send ""several hundred"" UAVs to Russia, to be used in Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine. Iran outright rejected the claim and Russia has made no comments on the statement. Meanwhile, Tehran and Moscow announced that President Vladimir Putin will be visiting the Iranian capital next week to hold talks with President Ebrahim Raisi. Here, RT looks into Iranian drones to see whether they could be of use to Russia in the course of the special operation in Ukraine. We will also explain why the US is alarmed by the prospect and how this development could affect the likelihood of the sanctions on Iran being lifted. ‘According to our intel…’ ""Our information indicates that the Iranian government is preparing to provide Russia with up to several hundred UAVs, including weapons-capable UAVs on an expedited timeline,"" Sullivan asserted. He was talking to reporters about Ukraine – therefore, while it wasn’t explicitly stated, one can assume that the US now expects Iranian drones to see action in Eastern Europe. “It’s unclear whether Iran has delivered any of these UAVs to Russia already,” Sullivan said, adding that the country will start training Russian forces to use the drones as early as this month. “This is just one example of how Russia is looking to countries like Iran for capabilities that... have been used before we got the ceasefire in place in Yemen to attack Saudi Arabia,” Sullivan explained. It was early Tuesday morning in Moscow when the briefing was broadcast in the US, but Russian officials are yet to make any comments about the subject. There was, however, other news from the Kremlin, as presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced that Vladimir Putin would visit Tehran the following week, on July 19. The agenda and details of the bilateral meeting between Putin and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi have not been disclosed. “There will be a meeting of the heads of the guarantor states of the Astana process, which, as you know, is the process to facilitate a resolution to the Syrian crisis. There will, indeed, be a meeting between Putin, Raisi and Erdogan. In addition to the trilateral meeting, bilateral talks will also take place,” Peskov said. As for Tehran, it flatly denied it has any plans to cooperate with Russia by supplying it with UAVs. When asked about the claim by a media representative, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said: “Cooperation between Iran and Russia in certain advanced technologies dates back to before the Ukraine war, and there have been no major developments in the area in the recent past.” What we know about Iranian UAVs Washington had been wary of Iran’s drone program even before Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine. Last November, the US introduced sanctions against Iranian private companies that were supposedly involved in the production of combat and reconnaissance UAVs. According to the Americans, these companies claimed to be engaged in “private research” while covertly providing critical support to the UAV development of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and conducting international transactions in the interests of the Iranian government. The latter, in turn, supplied drones to its allies – including groups that the US recognizes as terrorist organizations. Notably, even back then, the US Treasury Department insisted that Iranian UAVs “threaten international peace and stability.” Denis Fedutinov, editor-in-chief of the magazine Drone Aviation, told RT that Iranian drones are actually very much worth looking into – the country has been designing them since the 1980s. “Currently, Iran has several dozen drone systems, from miniature drones to medium-altitude long-endurance models,” he said. Some Iranian UAVs were inspired by the US designs. For example, the Qods Yasir is based on the Boeing Insitu ScanEagle intercepted by the Iranians in 2012, while the Shahed 171 Simorgh and Saegheh-2 have a lot in common with the RQ-170 Sentinel that violated Iranian airspace in 2011. Visually similar to the US MQ-1 Predator, the Shahed 129 attack drones are of particular interest, as they have played an active role in the civil war in Syria since 2014. “Iran isn’t too keen on sharing information on its drones, revealing only what’s beneficial to it. But doubtless, one of its advantages is its vast experience in UAV development,” Denis Fedutinov noted. Nevertheless, Iranian technology cannot hold a candle to its Turkish competition. “Turkish designers partner with the leading suppliers of various drone subsystems in the market, which makes it easier for them to develop more sophisticated equipment.” Why does Russia need Iranian drones? Viktor Litovkin, a retired colonel and military commentator for TASS, told RT that “all drones are essentially the same.” “The only difference is their role, their loadout and their flight time. Iran doesn’t have any outstanding drones, but nor does anybody else. All drones are essentially the same,” he explained. Moscow has also been developing its own UAVs for quite some time. Russian Vice Prime Minister Yuri Borisov, who is in charge of supervision of the defense industry, said last month that Russia “has access to almost all types of unmanned military aerial systems, including reconnaissance, attack, tactical, operational and operational-tactical models.” At the same time, he doesn’t deny that Russia “should’ve recognized the benefits of drones much earlier.” Answering RT’s question about the “shortage of drones,” Borisov promised to “ramp up production,” adding, “it takes time.” This may be interpreted as a sign that Russia considers Iranian drones to be a temporary solution until Russian drones are put into service. Fedutinov argues that if a deal were to be signed, Moscow would be interested mainly in heavy recon and attack UAV systems. “Had they been available to the Russian Army, I don’t see any obstacles to fielding such systems [in Ukraine]. And as far as civilian casualties or friendly fire are concerned, drones carry high-precision weapon systems that minimize those risks,” Fedutinov said. Litovkin expressed doubt that Iranian drones would see any use in Ukraine. “No type of weapon could change the course of the war. Well, nuclear weapons could, but escalating the conflict in Ukraine to a nuclear war is out of the question. Drones are not weapons per se, they are combat platforms,” he said. Will Iran be able to cover Russia’s UAV demand? “It sounds like Iranian companies have been able to launch mass production of drones. And we can even say that they have begun to sell their UAV systems to certain customers,” Fedutinov said when asked if Iran was capable of exporting drones. Litovkin agrees. According to him, “Iran has manufactured a significant number of drones that are just being stored at warehouses right now.” “Iran is not engaged in any wars, so it doesn’t need all those drones, while Russia could use them in its Ukraine campaign. It is no wonder then that we could buy different types of UAVs from Iran,” the military expert believes. Vladimir Sazhin, from the Institute of Oriental Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences and an expert on Iran, disagrees: “Iran has many adversaries in the region, including Israel, the Gulf countries, Jordan and Egypt. There have even been proposals to establish a ‘Middle Eastern NATO.’ All these developments keep pressure on Iran, so I don’t think it will jeopardize its defense capabilities by giving its drones to some other country.” Sazhin also has doubts about Teheran’s ability to mass produce and export UAVs, “Iran supplies drones to its ‘allies’ – mostly, Yemen’s Houthis, and we can hardly count them in the hundreds, dozens would be a more realistic estimate, and we don’t even know the type. Besides military drones, Iran also manufactures simple models, almost like toys. I don’t think Iran is capable of increasing the scale of production in such limited time. The systems that are manufactured in Iran right now can hardly be exported.” What else stands in the way? “I don’t think there was any kind of plan to sell drones to Russia before February 24. Maybe there were some discussions after that, but I doubt anything will actually happen,” Sazhin says. He believes that political considerations are also involved, “Iran is neutral on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Its unwavering position is that a ceasefire should be reached as soon as possible. I don’t think Iran plans to take either side, by supporting Russia and opposing the West.” He also said that Tehran is heavily invested in the Vienna talks on resuming the Iranian nuclear deal, which was basically abolished by the Donald Trump administration. “Iran wants to see this deal come through, because it wants the Western sanctions to be lifted. The EU, Japan and other countries support Teheran in its agenda. They can’t wait for the sanctions to be eased, because that will give them instant access to the Iranian economy, which has been in dire straits. Tehran really needs external investments in all industries. And technology. Obviously, Russia can’t help it with either, while the EU and Japan can,” Sazhin explained. The expert also notes that by supplying Russia with drones Iran would face more pressure from the West, which would jeopardize its future partnerships with countries that could provide investment and technology. “That is not the kind of risk Iran is ready to take, this configuration doesn’t benefit it,” Sazhin added. The expert says that a behind-the-scenes deal between Moscow and Teheran is also impossible. “Today, a deal like that would remain a secret for only a few hours. Even if Iran secretly supplies Russia with its drones, they will be discovered in the combat zone. This would put Iran in an even more difficult situation,” according to Sazhin."
2022-07-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/558957-blinken-forced-deportations-russia/,Russia responds to US abuse claims,"Moscow has dismissed American claims that it forced up to 1.6 million Ukrainians to move to Russia, was confiscating Ukrainian identification documents, and issuing Russian passports instead. The accusations, which were made by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday, are “poor quality Western disinformation,” the Russian embassy in Washington said. The top US diplomat accused Russia of abusing Ukrainian citizens in various ways. He cited estimates by sources that “indicate that Russian authorities have interrogated, detained, and forcibly deported [to Russia] between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainian citizens, including 260,000 children.” He was apparently referring to the evacuation of civilians from Eastern Ukraine and Donbass republics. Hundreds of thousands of people fled to Russia before and during the ongoing military conflict. Kiev claimed that those refugees were Russian “hostages.” Blinken further claimed that Russian forces were “separating families, in an apparent effort to change the demographic makeup of parts of Ukraine.” Moscow has offered Ukrainian citizens a simplified path to Russian citizenship, should they want it. Initially only residents of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, which Russia recognized as sovereign states in February, were eligible for the scheme, but it was later extended to all Ukrainians. The US also claimed that Russia was “deliberately separating Ukrainian children from their parents and abducting others from orphanages before putting them up for adoption inside Russia.” Blinken cited “eyewitnesses, survivors, and Ukraine’s General Prosecutor” as his source for these and other serious accusations. Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, commented on Blinken’s remarks, suggesting that “a case like this must have been described” somewhere in a medical encyclopedia. When she discussed the allegations on Thursday on Russian TV, she said they were meant for consumption by a US audience. Blinken’s claims were as “absurd” as Washington’s “mantra” that Russian President Vladimir Putin had imposed “a tax” and driven American gas prices up, she added. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/558949-ukraine-hospital-odessa-newborn/,Ukrainian militants forced mothers and newborns out of maternity wards – Russian MOD,"The Ukrainian military has been accused, by the Russian Defence Ministry, of throwing mothers and their newborn babies out of maternity hospitals in the southern Odessa Region. Wednesday's statement added that medical staff who tried to stop them were allegedly assaulted. “In the settlements of Dobroslav and Krasnoselka of the Limansky district in Odessa Region, Ukrainian militants use hospitals and ambulance stations as command posts and barracks. At the same time, all the patients, regardless of their health condition, as well as maternity ward patients and their newborn children, were ruthlessly kicked out of medical institutions, while medical staff who tried to prevent the neo-Nazis’ cruelty suffered from physical violence,” Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Control Center, outlined. He added that the Ukrainian forces set up barracks, firing positions, and ammunition depots in a clinic in Ugledar (a city in the Donetsk People’s Republic), with heavy weaponry, artillery, and mortars stationed nearby. Mizintsev urged international organizations, including the World Health Organization, to influence Kiev to put an end to the use of medical facilities for military purposes. “Such actions of the criminal Ukrainian authorities show their complete indifference to the fate of their own citizens and absolute disregard for all moral norms and principles of international humanitarian law,” he said. Mizintsev’s comments come in the wake of Ukrainian shelling in the Russian-controlled city of Novaya Kakhovka in Kherson Region, which reportedly killed two people and injured at least 90, with seven still missing after a fertilizer storage depot was hit. The explosion also damaged several civilian sites, including a market and a hospital. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/558947-ukraine-cuts-ties-pyongyang/,North Korea cut off by Kiev,"Ukraine has severed all diplomatic and economic ties with North Korea after Pyongyang recognized the independence of the two Donbass republics. “We consider this decision as an attempt by Pyongyang to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. “The North Korean regime’s recognition of the ‘subjectivity’ of the Russian occupational regimes in Donetsk and Luhansk regions is null and void, will have no legal consequences and will not change the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine,” the ministry said. The statement comes after Pyongyang confirmed on Wednesday that it had officially recognized the independence of the republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, which broke away from Ukraine shortly after the 2014 coup in Kiev. Russia recognized their independence in late February, and Syria followed suit last month. Russian President Vladimir Putin cited the need to protect the people of Donbass as one of the reasons for sending troops into Ukraine on February 24."
2022-07-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/558942-ukraine-end-point-negotiating-position/,Ukraine reveals negotiation 'end point',"Ukraine will not agree to any territorial concessions as part of a peace agreement with Russia, its Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba told journalists on Wednesday. Talks between Moscow and Kiev have been in a deadlock since March. “The objective of Ukraine in this war... is to liberate our territories, restore our territorial integrity, and full sovereignty in the east and south of Ukraine,” Kuleba said, as reported by Reuters. “This is the end point of our negotiating position.” Moscow recognized the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics in the Donbass region shortly before the military operation in Ukraine was launched in late February. Crimea, which was also once part of Ukraine, voted to join Russia in a referendum in 2014 after the Maidan coup in Kiev led to the overthrow of the democratically elected government. In the southern part of Ukraine, Russian forces and Donbass militias seized Kherson Region and the majority of Zaporozhye Region. In the East, allied forces wrested control of the territory of the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR) from Ukraine in early July. Russian troops and militias also control parts of the Ukrainian Kharkov Region bordering the LPR. The two sides are now fighting for control over the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic. Peace talks between Moscow and Kiev remain stalled at the moment, Kuleba said, adding that Kiev sees no reason to engage in negotiations. “Currently there are no [peace] talks between Russia and Ukraine because of Russia’s position and its continued aggression against our country,” he told journalists. The US and Germany have also said they see no point in negotiating with Russia. Moscow accused the West of preventing Kiev from even thinking about peace talks, previously saying Ukraine could end the conflict if it agrees to Moscow’s demands. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-07-13,https://www.rt.com/business/558938-eu-guidance-transit-sanction-kaliningrad/,EU clarifies stance on Russian exclave blockade,"No “sanctioned goods” are allowed to be transported by Russian operators through EU territory by roads, the EU Commission has said in its fresh “additional guidance” on the transit of Russian goods. The document published on Wednesday comes amid tensions around the Russian Kaliningrad exclave. Lithuania had previously blocked the shipment of goods to the region via its territory to comply with EU sanctions against Russia. Transit via rail is still allowed, according to the document, but only as long as the EU member states “perform effective controls.” The bloc’s nations should “check whether transit volumes remain within the historical averages of the last three years” as well as whether they reflect “the real demand for essential goods at the destination,” the guidelines say. The transit of sanctioned military and dual use goods and technology is fully prohibited, the document says, adding that any “unusual flows or trade patterns” could potentially be suspected of giving “rise to circumvention” of anti-Russian sanctions. The document specifically notes that the EU members “are obliged to prevent all possible forms of circumvention of EU restrictive measures.” The EU Commission also pointed to the “importance of monitoring the two-way trade flows between Russia and Kaliningrad” aimed at ensuring that “sanctioned goods cannot enter the EU customs territory.” The document comes just hours after the Russian newspaper Izvestia reported that the EU is in talks with Lithuania on lifting sanctions on the transit of goods to Russia’s exclave. The media outlet also claimed that the EU had sent a draft document to Moscow in early July outlining that the transit of goods by both rail and road from mainland Russia to Kaliningrad would be removed from sanctions. The EU, however, has denied this information. “There were no talks between the EU and Russia on the issue you’re talking about, contrary to the reports you are citing,” Eric Mamer, the EU Commission chief spokesman, told the RIA news agency when asked to comment on the reports. The Russian Foreign Ministry previously threatened Lithuania with “tough measures” if it continued to block Russian transit to the exclave. The response measures have already been prepared, the ministry’s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said on Sunday. “The European Commission, the EU must understand that the clock is ticking,” she warned. Lithuania blocked the transit of goods by rail to Kaliningrad through its territory on June 18, with the restrictions affecting about 30% of deliveries to the Russian exclave. Moscow called the measures unprecedented and illegal, as they affect Russia’s access to part of its own territory. Following the release of the document, Russia’s Foreign Ministry replied that it would closely monitor how the EU’s new guidelines were put into practice. On Tuesday, Lithuania’s Customs Department reported it had stopped 34 trucks trying to cross its border from Kaliningrad and Belarus because they were transporting “sanctioned goods.” The trucks were forced to return to the Russian and Belarusian territories, it added. The vehicles were transporting car parts, furniture, glass, and alcohol, it revealed."

Earlier on Wednesday, Pushilin said the republic’s laws do not specify fixed dates to carry out these sentences, and the executive service would act “in accordance with its internal decisions.” He added that executions normally are “not public” and information on them “is not disclosed.” The official also said that the three convicts would be executed by firing squad if their appeals are not successful. The three men who fought for Ukraine and were captured in Donbass were found guilty by the republic’s Supreme Court on June 9 of being mercenaries and taking part in “Ukraine’s armed aggression,” attempting to overthrow the government of the DPR. All three – two Britons and one Moroccan – have filed appeals. DPR Justice Minister Yury Sirovatenko said on July 12 that the court could decide on their appeals by the end of the month. The last appeal was filed on July 4 by Briton Aiden Aslin’s defense. The DPR lifted its moratorium on the death penalty on July 12. The fighters surrendered to Russian and DPR forces in or near Mariupol, a port city that the DPR claims as part of its sovereign territory. London demands that its citizens be treated as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions."
2022-07-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/558926-north-korea-recognize-donbass-republics/,North Korea recognizes Donbass republics,"North Korea has become the third UN member to recognize the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics. A member of North Korea’s diplomatic mission in Moscow confirmed the move to the news agency RIA on Wednesday. The two Donbass republics had already been recognized by Russia and Syria. “This morning, there was a meeting with an ambassador of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and she received a note suggesting that we recognize the DPR’s independence,” a North Korean diplomatic official told RIA. The DPR embassy in Moscow confirmed the meeting and released a photo of the envoy, Olga Makeeva, receiving the note from North Korea’s ambassador to Moscow, Sin Hong-chol. “The sides agreed to take further steps to establish diplomatic relations,” the embassy’s statement read. The DPR’s leader, Denis Pushilin, also thanked Pyongyang for its “impressive support of the Donbass people.” Pushilin had earlier confirmed the development on his Telegram channel, calling it “another victory of our diplomacy.” The recognition is a sign that the DPR’s “international status and its nationhood are consolidating,” he added. He also expressed his hope that the two nations would be able to develop trade and an economic partnership. According to the North Korean embassy, a meeting with a Lugansk People’s Republic’s (LPR) ambassador is expected to take place shortly. Pyongyang has already informed the Russian ambassador to North Korea, Aleksandr Matsegora, about its decision to recognize both Donbass republics. Russia recognized the independence of the two Donbass republics in February. Days after doing so, it began its military operation in Ukraine, which had the aim of, among other things, protecting the two republics. Syria was the second nation to acknowledge the republics’ independence, having done so in late June. Kiev severed its diplomatic ties with Damascus in response and also said it would impose a trade embargo on Syria over the move."
2022-07-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/558905-yashin-charges-russian-army/,Opposition figure faces jail for ‘fakes’ about Russian military,"Elected Moscow city official and opposition figure Ilya Yashin has been officially charged with public dissemination of false information about the activities of the Russian military, the politician’s lawyer, Maria Eismont, told RIA Novosti on Wednesday. Yashin denies any wrongdoing, she added. The authorities have requested that Yashin be detained for two months, the joint press service of the Moscow court system said. Later on Wednesday, Moscow’s Basmanny District Court agreed to the prosecutors' request and ruled that Yashin would be kept in custody until September 12. Yashin is suspected of violating Article 207.3 of Russia’s Criminal Code, which bans “publicly and knowingly disseminating false information” about Russia’s military “under the guise of reliable reports.” If found guilty, he could face up to 10 years in jail. Earlier, it was reported that the politician’s home in Moscow had been searched by police. He was elected to the local government in Moscow’s Krasnoselsky District in 2017. Yashin had just finished serving a 15-day administrative arrest, which stemmed from an unrelated incident in Moscow last month and was due to be released on Wednesday. According to police, Yashin had refused to comply with a document check in a public park in June and scuffled with officers. He denied that the scuffle took place and claimed that the charges against him were politically motivated. “I’m not crazy to start a fight with three police officers,” he wrote on his Telegram channel at the time. Article 207.3, which deals with the spreading of falsehoods about the Russian Armed Forces, was added to the Criminal Code shortly after Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February. According to his lawyer Vadim Prokhorov, Yashin was charged over the comments he made on his channel in YouTube in April about the events in Bucha, a city near Kiev. Ukraine, Western governments and human rights groups accused Russian troops of committing atrocities while in the city in March. Moscow has repeatedly denied these claims. Last week, another elected official in the Krasnoselsky District, Alexey Gorinov, was sentenced to seven years in jail after being convicted of spreading falsehoods about the Russian military. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/558907-lugansk-attack-ammo-depot/,Donbass republic says Ukraine hit ammo depot,"Powerful explosions heard overnight in the city of Lugansk in Donbass were caused by a successful Ukrainian attack on a military site near the city, the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR) confirmed on Wednesday. Footage of the incident shows a large fire raging near the city, with explosions heard thundering in the distance. According to Vitaly Kiselev, the deputy defense minister of the LPR, Ukrainian forces fired multiple rockets at a military facility near the city. “Our air defense engaged them and shut down all but one, which hit an ammo depot,” he told Russia’s TASS news agency. “The munitions caught fire, blew up and were scattered 1.5- 2km or even 3km away.” The LPR official earlier reported that Ukraine fired nine missiles from a US-made HIMARS multiple rocket systems at around midnight. The barrage was initially misidentified as a single Tochka-U tactical ballistic missile, Kiselev said at the time. He also noted that Ukrainian forces targeted an air defense base protecting the city from regular attacks. The republic, which Russia recognized as a sovereign state days before launching its offensive against Ukraine, didn’t offer any details about damage or possible casualties caused by the Ukrainian strike. Earlier this week, Ukraine struck the Russian-controlled city of Novaya Kakhovka in Kherson Region, which locals said was a fertilizer storage facility and Kiev said was an ammunition depot. The strike on Monday evening killed at least seven people and injured dozens of others. It sparked a massive explosion, sending fireballs into the night sky. City officials compared it to the ammonium nitrate explosion in Beirut in 2020.

2022-07-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/558906-dating-ads-lonely-ukrainian/,Dating ads for ‘lonely Ukrainian women’ banned,"The UK’s advertising regulator has banned online dating ads offering the chance to meet “lonely Ukrainian women” for being offensive. In a statement published on Wednesday, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) addressed three ads for online dating service SofiaDate, seen in May 2022. The first one, which appeared on the Dorset Echo’s website, featured the image of a woman on a balcony with the text: “Ukranian [sic] Women. Meet Thousands of Lonely Ukrainian Women. Forget About Loneliness. Let Yourself be Happy.” The second ad, seen on the website of Scottish newspaper The National, had the same image with a different text: “Ukranian [sic] Women. Connecting Singles Across the World to Their Ideal Partner.” The third, also on The National’s site, showed a woman in front of a sunset with the text: “Ukranian [sic] Women … Sofiadate.com.” The complainants, “who felt the ads were inappropriate” amid the ongoing Ukraine conflict, challenged whether they were offensive, ASA said, adding that Astrasoft Projects Ltd., which trades as SofiaDate, has since removed the ads. The watchdog ruled that the focus on Ukrainian women dressed “in the aforementioned manner,” as well as the references to their loneliness, highlighted their vulnerability and connected it “to their sexual appeal.” “For that reason, we concluded the ads were likely to cause serious offence,” ASA said, ruling that the ads “must not appear again in the form complained of,” and issued a warning to SofiaDate. The regulator said that it considered several factors. First of all, ASA claimed, “there was heightened sensitivity about references to the country, and the vulnerability of Ukrainian women had become an area of public concern.” The watchdog also took into account the controversy surrounding the UK government’s ‘Homes for Ukraine’ scheme. The program, which encourages members of the public to share their homes with Ukrainian refugees, had raised concerns about the safety of single Ukrainian women. In April, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) called on the British authorities to develop “a more appropriate matching process” to ensure that women and women with children are not matched with single men. ASA also revealed that The National and Newsquest Media Group, trading as Dorset Echo, actually defended the ads, saying they were “ostensibly conventional,” did not refer to the conflict in Ukraine, were not partisan, and were “not unsympathetic towards Ukrainian women or the Ukrainian people in general.” However, the media holding responded to the complaints and removed the ads, admitting upon reflection that they could be inconsistent with its policy of refusing ads for prostitution and trafficking."

On June 9, the republic’s Supreme Court sentenced three foreign fighters – two Britons and one Moroccan – to death, finding them guilty of being mercenaries and taking part in “Ukraine’s armed aggression,” attempting to overthrow the government of the DPR. Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner, and Brahim Saaudun appealed the verdict. “All foreigners filed an appeal; we are waiting for the court hearing. If the court finds a measure of punishment appropriate, then the cases will be transferred to the executive service for the implementation of the sentence. It is carried out by firing squad,” Pushilin said. Pushilin’s remarks were made on Soloviev.Live, a prominent journalist’s RuTube channel, the day after the moratorium on executions was officially lifted in the DPR. Lawmakers explained their move to lift the moratorium, saying capital punishment serves “as a deterrent to the commission of especially heinous crimes, in particular crimes against the peace and security of mankind.” The fighters surrendered to Russian and DPR forces in or near Mariupol, a port city that the DPR claims as part of its sovereign territory. UK authorities insist its citizens are treated as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions. However, Britain is not formally at war with the DPR and does not recognize the republic as an independent state. The lawyers of all three men have filed complaints, asking the court to reduce the punishment. The last appeal, by Aslin’s defense, was filed on July 4. The court confirmed the receipt of the complaints and said they would be considered within two months of the dates the documents were sent. Officials in Donetsk consider the men to be mercenaries, who are not granted the same privileges as regular combatants under international law."
2022-07-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/558887-germany-energy-russia-dependence/,Germany reveals when it will wean itself off Russian energy,"Germany will completely end its dependence on some types of Russian energy this year – it will stop buying coal on August 1, and oil on December 31, Deputy Finance Minister Joerg Kukies announced on Wednesday. Speaking at the Sydney Energy Forum amid ongoing gas shortage concerns, Kukies accused Moscow of having “a blatant disregard” for contractual obligations “by using gas as a weapon.” His remarks came after Gazprom reduced the flow of gas to Germany via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline by 60% last month, citing sanctions-related issues. Kukies, however, said his country placed itself under “this concentrated risk of sourcing energy in such an undiversified way from one source.” The deputy finance minister explained that in order to diversify sources of energy, his country is accelerating the drive for renewables. However, instead of switching directly from fossil fuels to renewables, it must switch “from fossil fuels including Russia to fossil fuels excluding Russia into renewables,” adding that doing so “simultaneously adds complexity,” but the first goal will be achieved very soon. “We will be off of Russian coal in a few weeks. 1st of August – complete sanction, zero volume of coal from Russia, it used to be 40% of our coal mix,” he said. Russian oil also constituted 40% of Germany’s imports, but it “will be zero” after December 31, according to Kukies. “As you can imagine, anyone who knows the history of the Druzhba pipeline which was already a tool of the Soviet Empire over Eastern Europe – ridding yourself of that dependence is not a trivial matter but it is one that we will achieve in a few months,” he added. Kukies said that Germany “accelerated the path towards independence from Russian gas” by building LNG infrastructure in a speedy manner. “The first LNG ship will hopefully sail into the port of Hamburg either at the end of this year or early 2023,” he said. Some German media outlets, however, have reported that the government’s LNG plan will not work, because the country does not have enough tankers and could face severe gas shortages this winter. In the middle of June, the flow of gas through the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline was slashed due to operational challenges caused by the failure to return a turbine – which was sent to Canada for maintenance – due to the sanctions on Russia. Russia has consistently denied Western accusations that it uses oil and gas as a political weapon. A few days ago, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “Russia is consistently fulfilling all its obligations, and Russia is still capable of guaranteeing Europe’s full energy security.” Russian President Vladimir Putin previously accused EU leaders of committing economic “suicide” by attempting to give up Russian energy."
2022-07-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/558879-russian-gas-ukraine-transit/,Moscow describes future of Ukrainian gas transit,"The future of Russian gas transit through Ukraine will depend on European nations, according to a Foreign Ministry official. The EU’s intention to drop Russia as a supplier means that Ukraine will no longer receive transit fees, according to the senior diplomat. But “if European consumers maintain the demand and the Ukrainian pipeline system remains operational, Russia would consider the option of preserving Ukrainian transit,” Dmitry Birichevsky, the head of the economic cooperation section of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told RIA Novosti in an interview published on Wednesday. The current transit contract with Ukraine was signed in December 2019 for five years, with an option to extend it for 10 more years. Ukraine considered the deal a major victory. After Russia’s military operation in Ukraine began in late February, the EU placed sweeping economic sanctions on Moscow, declaring its intention to wean itself off Russian energy. In May Ukraine announced the suspension of gas transit through one of the two routes used by Russia, claiming it was necessary due to the loss of control over part of the pipeline. The infrastructure in question was captured in the early days of Moscow’s military operation. Russian gas giant Gazprom dismissed Ukraine’s claims that the continued operation of the pipeline was not safe. The flow of gas through an alternate route to Europe, the Nord Stream pipeline, was disrupted last month. Russia said it had to reduce the capacity by 60% due to Germany’s failure to return a Siemens Energy gas turbine following maintenance. The crucial piece of equipment was stuck in Canada due to sanctions. Berlin and Ottawa have since negotiated the return of the turbine. Canada, however, has not said when it will be shipped back to Germany. Kiev lashed out at the decision, calling it an erosion of the sanctions, while claiming that Russia could pump more gas through Ukraine instead. “It’s not Russia’s fault that Europeans are facing winter cold without heating and summer heat without air conditioning. The sanctions boomerang back at the Western economies,” he said. European restrictions may be painful for the Russian economy, but “our retaliatory measures can be quite painful” too, he said, adding that Moscow has not done everything within its power to harm Western nations."
2022-07-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/558875-ukraine-russia-grain-talks/,Ukrainian FM comments on grain talks with Russia,"Kiev and Moscow are close to breaking the impasse over held-up Ukrainian grain exports, but the ball is in Russia’s court, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba has stated. “We are two steps away from reaching an agreement with Russia,” Kuleba told Spanish newspaper El Pais on Wednesday. “We are in the final phase, and now it all depends on Russia. If they want to, the grain exports will start soon.” Kuleba claimed that Russia “wants to show the countries of Africa and Asia that they want to save them from food shortages.” Ukraine is one of the world’s leading grain exporters but has been unable to export by sea due to the ongoing conflict with Russia. On Wednesday, negotiators from Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN will meet in Istanbul to discuss the situation. There are “high hopes” for “a certain consensus” at the meeting, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted a diplomatic source as saying. Kiev and its Western partners have accused Russia of preventing grain shipments from leaving Ukrainian Black Sea ports, which they insist has contributed to the surge in global food prices. Moscow denies the allegation, saying it has been offering safe passage to freighters and that Ukraine is preventing civilian ships from leaving ports. Russia also says Kiev’s deployment of sea mines has created a threat to shipping in the area. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/558867-eu-nato-ukraine-weapon-control/,West wants to track weapons sent to Ukraine – FT,"Concerns are growing among NATO and EU members about the way Ukraine handles weapons supplied by the West, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. Western nations are now seeking to establish a special tracking mechanism to try and prevent the arms from ending up on Europe’s black markets, the paper added. Since the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, the US and its allies in Europe and elsewhere have pledged over $10 billion in military assistance to Kiev. The shipments have included scores of small arms, as well as portable anti-tank and anti-air missiles. “All these weapons land in southern Poland, get shipped to the border and then are just divided up into vehicles to cross: trucks, vans, sometimes private cars,” an unidentified Western official told the Financial Times, explaining why the EU and NATO want Kiev to keep a detailed inventory list for all weapons it receives. “From that moment we go blank on their location and we have no idea where they go, where they are used or even if they stay in the country,” the official added. According to Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency, some of the arms might have already left Ukraine and found their way back to Europe. In April, Europol warned that its investigations indicated the weapons were being trafficked out of Ukraine and into the EU to supply organized criminal groups. The conflict in Ukraine “has resulted in the proliferation of a significant number of firearms and explosives in the country,” the agency said at the time. Europol appeared to be particularly concerned that the Ukrainian authorities abandoned the practice of keeping “registers of firearms handed out to civilians” at the beginning of the conflict. “Firearms have been distributed without records since then,” the agency said, calling for a similar register to be created for all weapons and military materials transferred from the EU to Ukraine. Kiev denies it has become “a major hub for arms smuggling.” According to Yury Sak, an adviser to Ukraine’s defense minister, “any movement of weaponry either into Ukraine or out of Ukraine … is very closely monitored and supervised both by Ukraine and our international partners.” Washington has said it trusts Kiev, while admitting that the prospects of American weapons falling into the wrong hands was “among a host of considerations” due to the “challenging situation” on the ground. “We are confident in the Ukrainian government’s commitment to appropriately safeguard and account for US [weapons],” the US undersecretary for arms control and international security, Bonnie Jenkins, told reporters in Brussels last Friday. America’s European allies appear to be less certain. “It’s hard to avoid trafficking or smuggling,” Czech Defense Minister Jana Cernochova told journalists in Prague on Friday, adding that Western nations failed to “achieve it in former Yugoslavia and probably won’t avoid it in Ukraine.” According to the minister, it would not be possible to track every single item even if the donor nations did all they could to follow the weapons. In June, the Swedish police sounded the alarm over weapons sent to Kiev potentially ending up with criminal gangs. Interpol Secretary General Juergen Stock also expressed similar concerns that same month."
2022-07-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/558865-ukraine-proposes-chechnya-independence/,Ukrainian lawmakers support secession of Chechnya,"Ukrainian MPs Alexey Goncharenko and Musa Magomedov introduced legislation on Monday calling on the country’s parliament to recognize the sovereignty of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria – the breakaway state that fought two wars with Russia in the 1990s and 2000s. Text of the draft resolution has not yet been made available on the website of Ukraine’s parliament, but Goncharenko claimed in a Facebook post that Russia committed “violent murders [and] genocide” in Chechnya over the course of the First and Second Chechen Wars. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a stalwart ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, “continues the policy of terror,” Goncharenko continued. The resolution is likely a knee-jerk response to Russia’s recognition in February of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, two Russian-speaking regions that declared independence from Ukraine in 2014, and were subjected to an eight-year bombing campaign by Kiev’s forces in response. Upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev unilaterally declared independence from Russia, emptied the region’s prisons, and declared that he no longer recognized Moscow’s authority. Organized crime flourished, and Dudayev declared the region the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria in 1994, proclaiming it to be an Islamic state. After a two-year war, Russia made peace with Dudayev’s government but the lawlessness continued. When Islamist terrorists from the Republic entered the Russian region of Dagestan in 1999 to wage holy war, Russia again intervened, this time winning a decisive victory against the Chechen separatists. The conflict had almost come to a complete end when Ramzan Kadyrov took power in 2007. Kadyrov followed in the footsteps of his father, Akhmad Kadyrov, who fought against Russia during the first war, but switched allegiance and served as the first president of the Chechen Republic between 2003 and his assassination by Islamists in 2004. Chechnya’s ‘Akhmat’ Special Forces are currently fighting in Ukraine alongside Russian troops and soldiers of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics. The Chechen Republic of Ichkeria still technically exists in exile, though its sovereignty has not been recognized by any foreign power since the Taliban government in Afghanistan fell in 2001."
2022-07-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/558864-billy-herrington-ukraine-zelensky/,Zelensky to consider honoring gay porn star,"A petition calling on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to commemorate American pornographic actor Billy Herrington with a monument in Odessa has passed 25,000 votes and must now be considered. Activists want Herrington’s likeness to replace that of Russian Empress Catherine the Great. Launched in May, the petition passed the threshold of 25,000 votes this week. Describing Catherine II as a “controversial historical figure whose actions caused great damage to Ukrainian statehood and culture,” it calls on Zelensky to ensure that her statue is torn down and replaced with one of Herrington sitting “at the bar with a bottle of beer.” The petition’s author wrote that this would make the statement that “Odessa is not a part of Russian culture but has its own culture and sense of humor,” and would send “a clear signal that Ukraine supports the LGBT community.” Furthermore, he wrote that a monument to Herrington would be “fun and funny” and would be worth it for “memes.” Herrington filmed adult movies, most of them with other men, between 1990 and his death in a car accident in 2018. Famous in Japanese ‘Gachimuchi’ memes, Herrington’s name has already been put before Ukrainian politicians, when a similar petition in March called on local authorities in the city of Zaporozhye to rename Mayakovsky Square ‘Billy Herrington Square’. The activist behind the petition – likely the same culprit responsible for the Odessa campaign – claimed that “generations of not only Americans, but also Ukrainians and Europeans grew up on his films,” and that the square would become “a powerful tourist magnet.” Aside from generating laughs on Russian television, the petition went nowhere. The monument of Catherine II in Odessa caused controversy long before petitions called for its replacement with the likeness of an adult film star. Depicting the empress and four of her companions, the ‘Monument to the founders of Odessa’ was erected in 1900 by Yuri Meletevich Dmitrenko, but removed in 1920 by order of the Bolsheviks. Ukrainian authorities restored the statue in 2007, a move that was opposed by Ukrainian nationalists, among them then-president Viktor Yuschenko. A fishing village during centuries of Ottoman rule, Odessa was founded as a city by decree of Catherine II in 1794, and during the 19th century was the fourth-largest city in the Russian Empire. Odessans today predominantly speak Russian."
2022-07-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/558862-ukraine-shelling-novaya-kakhovka-medical-aid/,Nearly 200 in need of medical help after Ukrainian attack,"Nearly 200 people have requested medical assistance after sustaining injuries in a strike targeting the Ukrainian city of Novaya Kakhovka, the local administration’s head, Vladimir Leontyev, has claimed. He added that local authorities did not count “minor scratches,” referring to light wounds that were treated on the spot. At least seven people died in the attack, carried out by Kiev, the media reported. “Today, 187 people injured [in the strike] sought [medical assistance],” Leontyev told TASS, adding that the authorities managed to provide the necessary aid to only 90 of them. Plumes of smoke are still rising over the area hit by the Ukrainian missile strike in the early hours of Tuesday, a local administration head in the Kherson region told TASS on Tuesday, adding that the area is still being rocked by explosions. The attack hit a cluster of warehouses in the town of Novaya Kakhovka, the local authorities said. The storage facilities housed, among other things, saltpeter – a similar substance caused a massive blast in Beirut in 2020, which leveled a large part of the city and killed hundreds. In Novaya Kakhovka, in addition to those killed, the explosion damaged a local hospital and church and left over 270 people homeless, according to Leontyev. The Ukrainian authorities reported that a Russian ammunition depot had exploded in the city after being targeted by Kiev’s forces. Local emergency teams and military personnel are still clearing the rubble and demining the area, Leontyev said, adding that the number of casualties could rise. Many people remain trapped under rubble, he told TASS. According to Russian media, the Ukrainian strike also destroyed a warehouse where 35 tons of humanitarian aid, including food for inhabitants of the city, were stored. According to the local authorities, hundreds of houses, several kindergartens, two schools, and two markets were damaged in the attack. At least two apartment blocks are now beyond repair and will have to be taken down, the city administration said, adding that many private houses were “totally destroyed.” A local factory producing equipment for hydroelectric plants was “destroyed” as well, Leontyev said. The local administration head blasted the attack as a “terrorist act against the civilian population,” adding that it is a “crime that will make its way into the history books.” The US-made HIMARS multiple-launch rocket systems were used in the Ukrainian strike, the local authorities claimed. According to the Pentagon, the US has provided Kiev with eight HIMARS systems since the beginning of the conflict in February. Last week, however, Russian authorities claimed they destroyed two of these rocket systems in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). Just a day before the strike on Novaya Kakhovka, authorities in the DPR accused Ukrainian forces of using the US-made systems in a attack that killed three civilians involved in a humanitarian mission. Novaya Kakhovka, a regional center, came under Russian control on February 24, the first day of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. Previously, there had not been any information in open sources that there were warehouses containing saltpeter in the city."
2022-07-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/558845-ukraine-tornado-fighter-release/,Ukraine frees warlord sentenced for torture – media,"Ruslan Onishchenko, former commander of the notorious Ukrainian Tornado battalion, whose fighters were convicted of torturing people in Donbass, has reportedly been released from jail and may join the fight against Russia. Ukraine began selectively releasing inmates who want to serve on the frontline shortly after Moscow attacked the neighboring state in late February. The now-disbanded Tornado unit was formed in 2014 to fight for Kiev during the conflict in Donbass. Despite the unit’s designation as a volunteer police battalion, former felons were allowed to become members. Onishchenko had three prior convictions before joining the unit. In 2017, a Kiev court sentenced Onishchenko to 11 years in prison for kidnapping and torture. Several of his fellow fighters also received jail sentences for kidnapping, torture, rape, and looting. On Monday, Roksolana Khmara, the wife of former MP Stepan Khmara, wrote on Facebook that Onishchenko was released under the guarantees of her and her husband. Khmara posted a photo of Onishchenko in a Kiev courtroom, while claiming his sentence had been politically motivated. Newspaper ‘KP v Ukraine’ said that Onishchenko had asked to be allowed to join the fight against Russia. According to the paper, Onishchenko’s original sentence had been commuted in accordance with a 2015 law that says one day spent in pre-trial detention counts as two days in jail. However, the former commander remained behind bars while awaiting trial for a 2018 prison riot. “Nearly all of the battalion’s members are now back on the frontline, fighting in various units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” Viktor Pandzhakidze, the ex-spokesman for Tornado, told the paper. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-07-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/558846-us-uk-eu-sanctions/,US and UK have 'conned' EU – Medvedev,"Washington in tandem with London conned EU members “like a couple of shell-game tricksters” by drawing them into the economic war against Moscow, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev claimed, commenting on the weakening of the euro. On Tuesday, for the first time in 20 years, the US dollar and euro exchange rates reached parity on the Moscow Exchange. This turn of events, according to Medvedev, who now serves as deputy chair of the Russian Security Council, means that “predictions about the onset of a systemic crisis in the eurozone are beginning to come true.” In his opinion, the fall of the euro demonstrates “who pays in hard currency for the bloody crisis” in Ukraine. “Washington in tandem with London conned the Europeans like a couple of shell-game tricksters,” the former president wrote on Telegram. Prior to imposing “crazy restrictions” against Russia, European countries should have calculated “their own monetary and economic problems,” Medvedev claimed, adding that the White House normally weighs its risks much better. “But the ‘useful European idiots’ suffered much more at the mercy of the Americans,” the deputy chair of the Security Council stressed. However, Medvedev does not feel sorry for them since, in his opinion, “the Russophobes from the EU” unleashed “a hybrid war” against Russia and opened “a wide economic front” against it. The former head of the state said that the transition to new trade payment methods, including the use of national currencies – the Russian ruble, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and others – would be the best protection against “a rotting euro.” He didn’t rule out the possibility that, in the future, the BRICS countries might come up with a new reserve currency. “The modern world clearly needs more than the dollar, euro, and pound sterling. For now, $1 = €1. Keep savings in rubles!” Medvedev wrote. Commenting in mid-June on the economic sanctions against Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin called them “insane and thoughtless.” Previously, he alleged that European leaders were committing economic “suicide” under pressure from the US. The EU, however, insists that its members were aware of the grave consequences of anti-Russia sanctions for their own economies. “But this is the price to pay to protect democracies and international law, and we are taking the necessary steps to address these issues in full solidarity,” the bloc’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said earlier this month."
2022-07-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/558837-putin-iran-meetings-leaders/,Putin to meet leaders of Iran and Turkey – Kremlin,"Russian President Vladimir Putin will visit Tehran on July 19 for talks with his Iranian and Turkish counterparts, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said during a press briefing on Tuesday. Putin will attend a trilateral meeting with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan under the so-called ‘Astana peace process.’ The format was launched in early 2017 with the aim of putting an end to the 11-year-long conflict in Syria. “In addition to the trilateral meeting, there will also be bilateral meetings,” Peskov said. Putin and Erdogan held a phone call on Monday during which they discussed economic and trade cooperation, the use of national currencies in transactions and Russian energy supplies. The two leaders also exchanged opinions on the situation around Ukraine, “including in the context of coordinating efforts to ensure the safety of navigation in the Black Sea and grain exports to world markets,” the readout of the conversation published on the Kremlin website says. According to the Turkish president’s Directorate of Communications, meanwhile, Erdogan told his Russian colleague that “it was time for the United Nations to take action for the plan regarding the formation of secure corridors via the Black Sea for the grain export.” Kiev and Western nations have accused Russia of blocking food exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, which they maintain has contributed to the surge in global food prices. Moscow denies the allegation, saying it has been offering safe passage to freighters, whereas Ukraine is preventing civilian ships from leaving the ports. Russia also says Kiev’s deployment of sea mines has created a threat to shipping in the area. The key topic of the talks between Putin and Raisi will be “planning for the development of economic cooperation between Iran and Russia,” according to Mohammad Reza Pour-Ebrahimi, chairman of the Iranian parliament’s Economic Commission. He hailed the results of Raisi's January visit to Russia, saying that it marked “a new chapter of economic relations” between the two countries. The commission chairman also claimed that Russia needs economic cooperation with Iran “more and more” amid the sanctions imposed on it by Western countries."
2022-07-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/558831-russia-names-foreign-fighters/,Russia names UK and US ‘mercenaries’ en-route to Ukraine,"The Russian military has published the names of five people who it identified as British and American citizens on their way to join the Ukrainian forces. It warned that they could be captured and tried as mercenaries or even end up dead if they follow through on their plans. The five individuals were named as Colin Scot and Adrian Davis from the UK, and Michael Vujkovic, Andrew Fox, and Oliver Short from the US. The Russian military claimed that all five arrived last Wednesday at a certain location in the city of Zamosc in eastern Poland, around 100km northwest of Lviv, Ukraine. The Defense Ministry called the place a “staging ground for foreign mercenaries” on their way to Ukraine, and published the address of where it allegedly operates. “We recommend those citizens to reevaluate their plans and go home with their lives,” the spokesman for the ministry, Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, said during a daily update. He added that if the foreigners are captured alive fighting for Ukraine, “the best outcome they can expect is a trial and a maximum-length jail term.” The ministry claimed that over the past three weeks, 391 foreign fighters have been killed in Ukraine, and 240 others left the country. Meanwhile, 151 new recruits have entered over the same period of time, it said. The report added that combatants from Poland, Georgia, Britain, Romania, and Canada made up the greatest numbers among those killed.

In early July, the Roscosmos chief inspected the Krasmash plant in the city of Krasnoyarsk in eastern Siberia to check on the efforts to continue testing and ensure that serial production is successfully launched. In May, he spoke about the Sarmat’s offensive capabilities, saying that “it can demolish half of the coast of some large continent” should a nation decide to take an aggressive stance towards Russia. The Sarmat ICBM was first successfully test-launched on April 20 from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Arkhangelsk Region. The new missile is expected to enter active combat duty by the end of 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in late June. The ICBM is set to replace the older Voyevoda systems, also known by the NATO reporting name ‘SS-18 Satan’. According to earlier statement from Rogozin, the Sarmat, dubbed the ‘Satan 2’, is the most powerful missile of its class in terms of range and warheads, and is designed to be “invincible” to all existing air defenses."
2022-07-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/558830-russia-harpoon-missiles-destroyed/,Russia claims it destroyed US-made Harpoon launchers in Ukraine,"The Russian military says it has destroyed more US-made weapons in Ukraine. Several Harpoon anti-ship missile units were targeted by a ground-launched Iskander missile strike in Odessa Region, the defense ministry claimed on Tuesday during a daily briefing. The report identified the location as being near the village of Berezan, some 20km northwest of the port city of Odessa. It offered no further details about the strike. Last week, Russia claimed it destroyed two Harpoon missile systems near the village of Liman in the same region with a sea-launched missile strike. The Harpoon is an anti-ship missile system made by Boeing. Several Western nations have supplied them to Ukraine. Officials in Kiev claimed that the weapon was a game-changer for the balance of military power in the Black Sea. Some credited the threat posed by Western weapons, including the Harpoon, for Russia’s decision to withdraw from Snake Island two weeks ago. Moscow said it was a goodwill gesture meant to counter Ukrainian allegations that Russia was blocking grain exports from the country. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/558825-loan-eu-ukraine-approved/,EU approves €1 billion loan for Ukraine,"The European Council on Tuesday approved an additional €1 billion loan to Ukraine “as a matter of urgency” and pledged to provide Kiev with more help “in the coming months.” According to the council’s statement, the total macro-financial support from the EU to Kiev since the end of February, when Moscow launched its military operation in the neighboring country, has now reached €2.2 billion. The loan is supposed to “give Ukraine the necessary funds to cover urgent needs and ensure the operation of critical infrastructure,” Czech Finance Minister Zbynek Stanjura said. The Czech Republic currently presides in the EU Council. European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis hailed the decision, saying that as “Ukraine is an economy at war,” it “badly needs” short-term assistance. “The EU is there to help,” Dombrovskis wrote. The European parliament approved the allocation of funds on July 7. The aid will be released once a memorandum of understanding is agreed on with the Ukrainian authorities. The loan is a part of the “highly concessional” long-term loan package that the European Commission proposed on May 18. The €9 billion would “top up the significant short-term relief provided until now, with a new exceptional macro-financial assistance” for Ukraine, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen explained at the time. However, according to Corriere della Sera, for more than a month, Germany has been blocking the aid package. German Finance Minister Christian Lindner does not like the fact that Brussels is offering to fund aid to Ukraine from the common European debt, the Italian outlet claims, adding that for now, Berlin has only agreed to approve a €1 billion tranche. Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko, in an interview with Corriere della Sera on Monday, confirmed that EU members are at odds over how they should support Ukraine, and that some of them believe €9 billion is too much. Marchenko also said that while Ukraine needs €5 billion ($5.05 billion) every month, Kiev has been receiving much less so far. These comments come after he announced in mid-May that Ukraine may have to resort to “painful” measures to save the economy amid the conflict with Russia. At the time, he warned that the government might have to raise taxes, cut spending, and nationalize certain businesses."
2022-07-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/558819-us-consolidate-west-behind-china/,"Ivan Zuenko: The US is using the Ukraine crisis to unite the West behind its real goal, a face-off with China","If there had not been an active rapprochement between Moscow and Beijing over the past decades, and if Russia did not have an Asian alternative to European markets for oil and gas, it would not have been able to attack Ukraine. Does this mean China is the main beneficiary of the European crisis and that the situation is developing according to Beijing’s plans? There are various ways to assess the nature and consequences of the events that began in February. But what is clear is that they cannot be considered in isolation from the historical context, which should include at least the last eight years, starting with the Western-backed overthrow of Viktor Yanukovych’s government in Ukraine. Or better yet, the whole period of the post-bipolar world order since the USSR came to an end in 1991. Nor should it be reduced to the relationship between Moscow and Kiev. The situation in Ukraine is a consequence of the fact that since the end of the Cold War, the countries of the Euro-Atlantic bloc have not been willing to create a comprehensive security system in Europe that includes Russia. The current conflict and its economic aspects involve most of the world. Moreover, in a situation where the tactics of ‘total cancelation’ and the severance of economic and humanitarian ties constitute the main leverage against Russia, the Chinese factor has proved to be key. If China had not adopted a benevolent neutrality towards the Russian military operation, had not continued to buy Russian goods and thereby provided a reliable strategic rear, the continuation of the offensive would have been objectively impossible. But is China the main beneficiary of the European crisis, as asked at the outset? For me, the answer clearly is no. The current course of events has not been to Beijing’s liking or in its interests. China itself is convinced that the US is practically the only party that stands to gain right now – it regards Washington as the ‘warmonger’. The coalescing of ‘the collective West’ – based on the imaginary dichotomy of ‘democracy vs. authoritarianism’, a ‘battle between Good and Evil’ – harms China’s interests by cutting off the possibility of normalizing relations with the US, which, for purely economic reasons, would be beneficial for Beijing. It also reduces China’s room to maneuver in Western Europe, which is a key market for its goods, notwithstanding the sharp increase in energy and food prices, which are essential to the stable development of the Chinese economy. Overall, the situation for China is complicated. The country has been preparing for the fact that sooner or later, its natural ambitions for the role of a world leader (the concept of ‘the Chinese Dream’) will have to be backed up with muscle. Economic pressure, the imposition of sanctions on China, and the aggressive rhetoric of Western leaders over the past five years have left Beijing with no choice but to prepare for a future war – regardless of whether it is ‘hybrid’ or ‘trench’. However, events have unfolded too quickly, and at present, the leadership does not yet feel it is ready to proceed with the kind of decisive action that Moscow has taken. Moreover, China thinks that time is on its side, and Beijing’s task now is to maintain a neutral stance for as long as possible, building up its forces while hoping to weaken its competitors. The Euro-Atlantic capitals also realize this and they are forcing geopolitical pressure on China. The ‘indivisibility of security in the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific’ thesis has already emerged in rhetoric, effectively suggesting the creation of a ‘global NATO’. Thus, we are moving from a European security crisis to one that is truly global. In practice, a global NATO is already in the making, and the US-led military bloc’s Madrid summit in late June is the best proof of this. For the first time in NATO’s history, the Pacific states – Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea – were invited; actions were intensified to form ‘quasi-alliances’ such as the QUAD (the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue between the US, Australia, Japan and India), AUKUS (the trilateral pact between the US, Britain, and Australia), and the Partners in the Blue Pacific (PBP: AUKUS plus Japan and New Zealand). In contrast to the ‘classical NATO’, which has long been perceived in China as a vestige of the Cold War and intra-Western conflicts, these alliances have an unambiguous anti-Chinese orientation. Eventually, the Ukraine crisis may be remembered as a sideshow before the main event. This article was originally published in Russian on ru.valdaiclub.com"

The city is controlled by Russian forces. Vladimir Leontyev, the city’s top Russian-appointed official, shared a video showing several destroyed buildings, including a supermarket. “This is the city center. This is how everything looks [now],” Leontyev said. Local officials said five people were killed and at least 80 injured in the city on Monday evening, while seven are missing. They claimed that Ukrainian troops used US-delivered HIMARS multiple rocket launchers to attack Novaya Kakhovka. According to their reports, a fertilizer storage depot detonated due to the shelling. The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday that it had destroyed an ammunition depot in the city."
2022-07-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/558813-monkeypox-case-russia-detected/,Russia reports first monkeypox case,"The first case of monkeypox has been detected in Russia, consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor announced on Tuesday, adding that further spread of the disease was prevented due to a “timely epidemiological investigation.” According to the Russian Health Ministry, the case was detected in St. Petersburg. “The disease was detected in a young man who returned from a trip to Europe and applied to a medical facility with a characteristic rash,” Rospotrebnadzor said in a statement, adding that there is no threat to the patient’s life, as “the disease proceeds in a mild form.” Later on Tuesday, the watchdog revealed that the patient had returned from Portugal. The authorities took measures to prevent further spread, Rospotrebnadzor stressed. The patient’s contacts have been traced and are now “under medical supervision.” The young man lives alone and had limited contact with others in Russia upon returning from Europe, according to the statement. The watchdog said that Russia has all the necessary means to detect the infection, and that the authorities are closely monitoring the situation. “Particular attention is paid to those who arrived from countries where cases of infection have already been registered, as well as to patients with symptoms of exanthemic diseases.” Rospotrebnadzor also claimed that the country’s population “has a significant immune layer necessary to stop the spread of monkeypox” due to the mass vaccination against smallpox carried out in the past. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) regional director for Europe, Dr. Hans Kluge, called for “urgent and coordinated action” amid the rapid spread of monkeypox cases around the world, especially Europe. As of July 11, a total of 9,647 cases has been detected in 63 countries, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The largest number of cases – 2034 – has been registered in Spain. The WHO says that “most reported cases so far have been identified through sexual health or other health services in primary or secondary health-care facilities and have involved mainly, but not exclusively, men who have sex with men.” The virus can be spread through close contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets, as well as via contaminated materials. The initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and exhaustion. A rash often begins on the face and then spreads to other parts of the body, although the WHO noted that patients affected by the current outbreak have developed lesions on the genitals and anus, and not some of the traditional flu-like symptoms of the infection."

The city is in Ukraine’s southern Kherson Region and is controlled by Moscow. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the region, also told RIA Novosti that seven people are missing. Vladimir Leontyev, administration chief of Novaya Kakhovka, said that a fertilizer storage depot detonated from shelling on Monday, and multiple houses were damaged, as well as other civilian sites, including a market and a hospital. Natalya Zarya, who coordinates the delivery of humanitarian aid to the city, said that a storage facility with 35 tons of aid, including food, has also been destroyed. Local officials claimed that Ukrainian troops used US-provided HIMARS multiple rocket launchers to attack the city. “Such strikes on civilian sites can only draw resolute condemnation. It is a direct consequence of the delivery of weapons by the [United] States to Kiev,” Dmitry Polyansky, the deputy head of Russia’s mission to the UN, told RIA Novosti on Tuesday. The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday that it destroyed an ammunition depot in Novaya Kakhovka. Ukraine and Russia have repeatedly accused each other of shelling residential areas and killing civilians. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

Local sources claimed that substantial damage has been caused to civilian buildings, as a top local official branded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a war criminal. TASS and RIA Novosti sources say that warehouses with saltpeter (a source of nitrogen) were attacked, stating separately that the city's hydroelectric power plant was not damaged, but the nearby market, hospital, and residential buildings were hit. Vladimir Leontyev, the head of the city’s military-civilian administration, blamed the attack on Ukrainian forces, adding that the strike had been carried out with recently delivered American weapons. It is a “crime against the civilian population,” he told RIA Novosti. According to Leontyev, dozens of people were injured and hundreds were left homeless. “Tonight reminds me of the terrible analogies of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which the United States carried out in August 1945. Almost the same thing happened to us today. There are already casualties among the civilian population, there are wounded, hundreds of people were left homeless, dozens of houses were destroyed. Hospitals continue to receive people. Many dozens of people are injured. We are shocked by this bombardment,” he said The deputy head of the regional administration, Kirill Stremousov, echoed Leontyev's assertion that Ukrainian troops used high-precision American HIMARS rocket launchers. “The information has already been unequivocally confirmed that a large humanitarian hub was located... a few meters from the missile hit, and a boy with a disability remained on duty there for the night,"" he outlined. ""This is not some kind of heartbreaking story, it’s actually true. This boy died for sure. But the psychological effect that they want to achieve (in Kiev) as a result of these bombings will not be achieved. This is a crime against the civilian population, first of all,” Leontyev said “When you give an order to bomb the center of a peaceful city, this is a crime, an obvious crime that has no statute of limitations. This is a real tragedy,” he added, referring to Zelensky. The Ukrainian authorities reported that a Russian ammunition depot exploded in the city, and claimed that locals would be delighted with the attack, without providing any evidence to support the idea. “People’s windows are flying out, but they are still happy... Because this means that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are close,” a Ukrainian military servicemember and adviser to the head of Kherson Region, Sergey Khlan, said.

2022-07-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/558798-ukraine-respond-russia-citizenship-initiative/,Ukraine responds to Russia’s citizenship initiative,"Granting all Ukrainians a right to apply for Russian citizenship under a simplified procedure is nothing short of an “encroachment on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine” on Moscow’s part, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said on Monday. The ministry said it “strongly condemns” the move on the same day Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the relevant decree. Ukrainian diplomats also declared Moscow’s decision “incompatible with the norms and principles of international law.” According to the ministry’s statement, the offer to Ukrainians of a fast-track to Russian citizenship suggests the Kremlin supposedly is still seeking to “seize Ukrainian lands, destroy the Ukrainian state” and “forcibly assimilate” the Ukrainian nation. Kiev also warned that it would consider the granting of Russian citizenships to Ukrainians under this procedure “null and void,” adding that it would have “no legal consequences” for Ukraine. It also accused Moscow of attempts at using the procedure to “force” Ukrainians living in the territories controlled by Russian troops to “participate in the criminal activities of the occupation administrations.” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba also used the occasion to request more weapons from the West. “It is now critically important to provide more assistance to our nation,” he said in a statement, as he called on Ukraine’s “partners” to “urgently provide Ukraine with more heavy weapons and introduce new economic sanctions against Russia.” The minister also branded the Russian president’s decree “worthless,” adding that it only shows “Putin’s aggressive appetites.” The Russian president’s decree, signed and published on Monday, modifies the procedures earlier reserved for the citizens of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics as well as the residents of the two southern Ukrainian regions that have been under the control of the Russian forces almost since the start of the conflict between Moscow and Kiev. Now, all Ukrainians may file a citizenship request with the Russian authorities without the previous requirements of the need to have lived in Russia for five years, to have a source of income or to pass a Russian-language test. People who lived on the territories controlled by the two Donbass republics got such a right in 2019. As of February, 950,000 people there had reportedly filed applications and 770,000 of them have become Russian citizens. Back in 2019, when this simplified procedure was first introduced, Putin said it was not aimed at “creating problems” for Ukraine but to help protect the basic rights of the people of Donbass, who were “completely deprived” of them for a long time. In May, another decree added the residents of Zaporozhye and Kherson regions in the south of Ukraine to those eligible for the citizenship scheme."

Between the six-month deadline provided by law and the ongoing conflict, it was “impossible for SCM to sell its media business on market terms,” he added. Therefore, Media Group Ukraine will surrender to the state the licenses for all 10 of its terrestrial and satellite TV channels, as well as print media, and cease operations at all of its online outlets. System Capital Management (SCM) has owned the two top-rated TV channels in the country – Ukraina TV and Ukraina 24 – as well as the most popular sports channel. Akhmetov said he had invested more than $1.5 billion into the media business, with over 4,000 employees. “Being the largest private investor in the Ukrainian economy, I have repeatedly stated that I have never been and am not going to be an oligarch,” said Akhmetov. The Donetsk-born Akhmetov is considered Ukraine’s richest man, with a coal and steel empire valued at $7.6 billion in 2021 and ownership of the Shakhtar Donetsk Football Club. Between 2006 and 2012, he was also a member of parliament for the Party of Regions – ousted in the US-backed coup in 2014, which set off the conflict over Donbass. Since Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, Zelensky has banned a total of 15 political parties as “pro-Russian” and arrested a number of opposition figures. On June 30, he also issued a decree establishing a “register of oligarchs,” targeting the top business figures in the country under a law passed in 2021. The law defines oligarchs as individuals who fit certain criteria, prohibits them from financing political parties, advertisements and demonstrations, and requires public officials to declare any contact with persons so designated. To qualify as an oligarch, an individual must fit three out of four of the following criteria: be directly involved in political activities, have “considerable influence” over media, benefit from monopolies as designated by antitrust authorities, and own assets whose value exceeds $81 million. A January 2022 poll showed that 55% of Ukrainians considered Zelensky himself to be an oligarch, in the same company as his predecessor Petro Poroshenko, his benefactor Igor Kolomoisky, and Akhmetov."

Anna Sergeeva, who was born in 1996, was promoted to the position on June 10 despite having almost no public service experience. She previously ran a management consultancy firm. The new deputy minister appears to have had very little involvement with public administration prior to her appointment by Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal. According to her profile published by the ministry, Sergeeva graduated from Taras Shevchenko University in Kiev, majoring in journalism. She also received a master’s degree in the same field at the same university the following year. In 2021, she attained a bachelor’s degree, this time in law, and is now undertaking further postgraduate studies in journalism. Between 2019 and 2022, she also ran a management consultancy firm called Service Revisor. The company, which, according to the Ukrainian media, provided services to barber shops and beauty salons, still lists Sergeeva as its owner and “final beneficiary.” According to her Facebook page, she also worked for the Ukrainian ‘1+1’ TV channel’s news service, as well as for BBC before her appointment to the ministerial position. She is also reportedly a successful blogger with over 92,000 followers on Instagram. Her account on the platform was recently set to private, however. Ukraine’s Social Policy Ministry also added that Sergeeva was “actively engaged in public activities” over the past four years as she contributed to the “socialization of children with physical and mental disabilities,” as well as supporting lonely elderly people and orphans. She also worked as an “adviser” to Ukraine’s social policy minister “in a voluntary capacity,” the ministry’s statement added."

Details a little later,” Viktor Andrusiv wrote on his Telegram channel. He had served as an adviser in both government departments. He did not elaborate on the reasons for his decision. Earlier, Andrusiv had criticized plans by the Ukrainian authorities to reduce the number of civil servants in the country. He had previously attracted a lot of media attention after saying that the Crimean Bridge, which connects Russia to the peninsula across the Kerch Strait, “will definitely be destroyed, it’s only a matter of time.” Andrusiv said Kiev had the necessary weapons but its armed forces would have to advance to the coast of Azov Sea before carrying out such a plan. The Kremlin responded by describing the statement as an announcement of a terrorist act. Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said the remarks required a legal assessment and may warrant punishment. Andrusiv had also rejected the possibility of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. According to him, such an outcome would mean the advantage of one country over another. “Until this situation has come, it makes no sense to invent scenarios,” he explained. Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed decrees dismissing five diplomats, including Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, who had become a controversial figure following a series of recent statements. Germany’s Bild newspaper, citing its own sources, said the former head of the diplomatic mission had been offered the position of deputy foreign minister.

They added that those killed were taking part in a humanitarian mission. “It should be noted that all the victims are volunteers of the public organization ‘Young Republic’ and came under fire as they carried out a humanitarian mission to assist the local population,” the authorities said, offering condolences to the families of the deceased and wishing speedy recovery to the injured. According to the DPR’s representatives from the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination on ceasefire (JCCC), the Ukrainian missile strike in question hit Amvrosievsky district on July 10. In addition to the killed and wounded, four persons are reported missing. Amid the Ukraine conflict, the US and its allies have been supplying Kiev with financial, humanitarian and military aid to help it fight off Russia’s offensive. The recent deliveries included medium-range M142 HIMARS and ammunition that, according to the US, would be a boon for the Ukrainian military, given its lack of firepower. According to the Pentagon, the US provided Kiev with eight HIMARS systems since the beginning of the conflict. Last week, however, Russian authorities claimed they destroyed two of these rocket systems in the DPR.

2022-07-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/558765-eu-divided-support-ukraine/,EU divided over Ukraine support – Kiev,"EU members are at odds over how they should support Ukraine, with some countries unprepared to provide Kiev with a €9 billion ($9.1 billion) aid package, Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko said in an interview with Italian daily Corriere della Sera on Monday. He claimed the world is also getting tired of Ukraine’s conflict with Moscow. “Of course we receive weapons and military aid, but this is not enough… It is a clear sign that the European Union and the rest of the world around Ukraine are getting a little tired of this war. That is understandable; they are suffering from oil and gas prices,” the minister told the outlet. On Sunday, Corriere della Sera reported that Germany had been blocking the €9 billion EU package for Ukraine. Berlin has also allegedly opposed proposals to finance Ukraine using common European debt, in a move that greatly alarmed Kiev. The newspaper also speculated that this was the true reason why Ukraine had abruptly sacked its ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnik. Commenting on the EU aid package delay, Marchenko said that “some governments are not ready to support Ukraine with such an amount of money.” “During the first months of the war, Europe was united. Now we see different opinions emerge on how to support Ukraine,” the minister added. Marchenko also lamented that while Ukraine needs €5 billion ($5.05 billion) every month, Kiev has been receiving much less than this so far. “We need €5 billion a month, but in April we received €1.6 billion. In May, we got €1.5 billion. In June, €4.4 billion. In July, we expect more than €4 billion, but we are dependent on the European bureaucracy,” he said, adding that the EU wants to know exactly how Kiev is spending its money. Marchenko explained that the funds are intended exclusively for social and humanitarian programs. The minister’s comments come after he announced in mid-May that Ukraine may have to resort to “painful” measures to save the crashing economy amid the nation’s conflict with Russia. At the time, he warned that the government might have to raise taxes, cut spending and nationalize certain businesses."
2022-07-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/558637-severodonetsk-referendum-independence-first-attempt/,The seeds of the split: How the Russian-speaking Donbass first attempted to win independence from Ukraine in 2004,"In late June, after fierce fighting, the last remaining units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces pulled out of Severodonetsk, a large industrial center in the western part of the Lugansk People's Republic. Back in 2004, the city hosted the famous congress of the ‘federalists’, Ukrainian politicians – elected at different levels – who backed the presidential candidate Viktor Yanukovych during the Western-backed Orange Revolution. Back then, they declared that the Kiev protests were an attempted coup and warned that an illegitimate government coming to power could prompt the congress to establish southeastern autonomy to protect local residents. At the same time, regional deputies decided to hold a referendum on changing the country into a federal state and appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin for support. In this article, RT recounts the first attempt of Ukraine’s southeastern regions to gain independence from Kiev and explains why the events of 2004 defined the future armed conflict in Donbass. Political discussions about a possible disintegration and reconfiguration of Ukraine have been going on ever since the country became independent in 1991. Ironically, one of the first people to doubt the country’s unity was Vyacheslav Chornovol, the founder of the national democratic party Narodny Rukh (People’s Movement) and a hero for Ukrainian nationalists. Admittedly, he only mentioned the possibility of turning Ukraine into a federation. The idea of federalization was the focal point of discussions that – until the Maidan political crisis of 2014 – were commonly referred to as “separatist” discourse. As early as 1989, Chornovol said that Ukraine should be a “union of lands.” “I imagine future Ukraine as a federal state, a union of lands, which have come together throughout the course of history and whose natural, climatic, cultural, ethnographic, and linguistic differences, as well as idiosyncrasies in their economies, habits, and customs define the unique diversity of a single people. I envision the People’s Republic of Ukraine, which includes such lands as the Kiev Region, Podolye, Volhynia, Galichina, Bukovina, Transcarpathia, Getmanshchina, Sloboda Ukraine, Zaporozhye, the Donetsk region, and Tauria, whereas Crimea could be an independent neighbor or an autonomous republic in alliance with Ukraine,” he wrote. Chornovol added that Ukrainian should be the only state language in the new federation, although local authorities could make certain provinces bilingual. Two years later, in 1991, Chornovol initiated the convention of the so-called Galicia Assembly, which spoke in favor of administrative reform and the creation of a new autonomous regional entity, Galichina, based on the amalgamation of the Lviv, Ternopol, and Ivano-Frankovsk Regions. Even though the assembly was one of the catalysts of Ukraine’s independence, Chornovol’s supporters were accused of separatism after Leonid Kravchuk was elected president. This was in large part due to ideas to create a Donetsk Republic and Novorossiya in the Russian-speaking southeast of Ukraine, which began circulating in the 1990s. Over time, Chornovol’s proposals came to be viewed as too radical, and opponents of federalization have been linking his designs with the breakup of the country for more than 30 years now. When the Ukrainian constitution was adopted in 1996, it defined Ukraine as a unitary state, which removed the issue of federalization from the agenda. And yet, apart from the 24 regions and two federal-level cities (Kiev and Sevastopol), Ukraine also included the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, which, for a few years, even had its own constitution and president. Throughout those years, Ukrainian presidents Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma managed to strike the right balance in their foreign and domestic policies, especially as regards to handling relations between regions on both sides of the “Subtelny line,” which is traditionally used to divide Ukraine into two distinct parts. However, in 2004, when the outcome of the protests was still uncertain, politicians who supported Yanukovych (dubbed 'pro-Russian' in the West, despite his years of negotiations with the EU) revived the idea of federalization. Members of the Party of Regions claimed that Ukraine had failed as a unitary state and therefore had to be reorganized as a federation with a high degree of autonomy at the level of administrative and territorial entities. Ukraine was going through a real crisis, and, probably for the first time, that schism was pushing the country to the brink of an all-out civilian conflict. The mass protests in Kiev, which would later be known as the Orange Revolution, were met with little enthusiasm in the southeast of Ukraine, especially in Donbass. While protesters at the Maidan claimed their ‘pro-European’ candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, had his victory “stolen from him,” many supporters of Yanukovych felt the same watching their opponents clamor for official election results, which had declared the latter victorious, to be repealed. A response to the protests in the capital was imminent. On November 28, the All-Ukrainian Congress of Deputies of All Levels welcomed more than 3,500 pro-Yanukovych delegates from across the country. They declared that the protests were an attempted coup and warned that an illegitimate Yushchenko-led government taking over Kiev could prompt the congress to establishautonomy to protect the residents of southeastern Ukraine. The final statement of the congress, which had been unanimously adopted by its delegates, said: “If the sociopolitical situation in the country develops according to the worst crisis scenario, we will stand firm and united to defend the vote of the people of Ukraine going as far as holding a referendum on possible changes to the administrative and territorial structure of Ukraine.” The significance of the gathering was further elevated by the presence of Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who delivered a sharp rebuke to Ukraine’s radical opposition. “On the one hand, we’re seeing this orange-fueled mayhem [orange became the symbol of support for Yushchenko – RT], which claims to represent the majority in Ukraine. On the other hand, we have this quiet force gathered in this room today,” Luzhkov said to a round of applause. At the same time, the Regional Council of Lugansk came up with an alternative project, proposing the establishment of the South-East Ukrainian Autonomous Republic with Kharkov as its capital city. Along with the initiative, local MPs also asked President Putin to help them organize a referendum on Ukraine’s federalization. The referendum was scheduled for December 5, 2004. At the same time, the Regional Council of Donetsk decided to establish its own police force. Leaders of Ukraine’s southeastern regions began to voice their support for the idea of reorganizing the country. Kharkov’s authorities decided to set up committees that would have executive state powers. Governor Yevgeny Kushnarev was elected head of the regional executive committee – he was well known as a pro-Russian politician and supporter of federalization, as well as a presidential hopeful according to many journalists and activists. His responsibilities at the time included coordination between other councils in the southeastern territories. The Kharkov Region also stopped making payments to the national budget, waiting for the situation in Kiev to stabilize. It was Kushnarev who put into words the idea that later defined the development of the Donbass armed conflict. Speaking at the Severodonetsk conference, he said, “I’d like to remind you that we are 400 kilometers away from Kiev and 40 kilometers away from Russia. We understand that the east is very different from Galicia in the west. We are not imposing our way of life on Galicia, but we will never let Galicia lecture us either.” Together with Boris Kolesnikov, head of the Regional Council of Donetsk, he proposed organizing a referendum in every city to see if people trusted the government and asked what they thought of ‘relaunching’ Ukraine as a federal republic. All of this political activity in the country’s southeast caused some serious concerns in the West, where governments started to see that the dissolution of the state was quite possible. The diplomatic channels were activated. EU and Russian representatives began making frequent visits in order to work out some compromises. At the end of the day, they didn’t include a referendum, but a process was agreed on to transfer power to Yushchenko. The compromise worked like this: Yushchenko got the green light at the election, and his win in the runoff was accepted by the opponents. In return, he agreed to change the constitution and have presidential privileges reduced as of January 1, 2005, thus turning Ukraine into a parliamentary republic. The local governments in the southeast wrapped up their plans. As time went on, everyone felt comfortable forgetting about the convention of ‘federalists’ in Severodonetsk and the programs announced by the local governments in the southeast. They were only recalled when attempts were made to blackmail or jail the local big wigs. The significance of those events shouldn't be underestimated, however. It was the very first time the southeast made it clear what its response was to ""patriots"" in Kiev trying to seize power and disregard the opinion of half the country’s population while they were at it. Back then, there were no consequences because the parties to the conflict worked out a solution based on compromise, while Russia abstained from backing and pushing Yanukovych. A little later, however, the members of the Severodonetsk rally came under severe pressure. A criminal charge was launched against Evgeny Kushnarev – a famous member of the Party of Regions – on the grounds of separatism, to be dropped later. That was enough for Kushnarev to distance himself from the separatism agenda, focusing instead on regional issues. In 2005, he “engaged,” as he called it, Yanukovych by merging his New Democracy platform into the Party of Regions. The two politicians ran together in the parliamentary elections in 2006. It was Kushnarev who addressed the items on the election program the most, including the issue of the status of the Russian language. In January 2007, Kushnarev was severely wounded during a wolf hunt in the Izyum district of Kharkov Region. He was shot by one of his friends, who had joined him for the hunt. A day later, Kushnarev died in spite of two surgeries. He was regarded as the leading anti-Maidan spokesman and a pro-Russian candidate for presidency. The events of those years – Maidan, federalization attempts in southeastern Ukraine and the death of a popular champion of Russia and federalism, Evgeny Kushnarev – marked the end of the first era in the history of an independent Ukraine. The people in power, Kuchma included, were anything but impeccable. They had a lot to answer for. But they were forged in the Soviet era and they had a sense of responsibility for their country and understood how complex the situation really was in Ukraine and abroad. During that period, politicians avoided any radical steps and tried to resolve conflicts through compromise. But when Yushchenko came to power, he abandoned this approach and attempted to impose on Ukraine an agenda that was alien to millions of its citizens. Aggressive ‘Ukrainianization’ and a policy aimed at distancing the country from Russia eventually resulted in mounting tensions and a protracted political crisis. All of that has brought Ukraine to its present state – a country plagued by domestic political crises and economic instability, a nation suffering territorial loss and ravaged by an armed conflict in the southeast that began in 2014. Today, Ukrainians look back on the period, which ended in 2004, as the last peaceful era in Ukraine's modern history. Kiev’s failure to draw the right conclusions from the ‘Severodonetsk case’ contributed to the tragedy Ukraine experienced in 2014. Ukrainian society was never able to bridge its internal divide, and the revolution that came a decade later only split the country further, leading to the loss of Crimea and a bloody war in Donbass."
2022-07-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/558741-ukraine-plans-counteroffensive/,Ukraine urges citizens to leave South due to counteroffensive plans,"Ukrainian authorities are urging their citizens to leave the southern regions of the country, which are now under the control of the Russian army, Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk said on Sunday, as Kiev is preparing a counteroffensive in this direction. According to Vereshchuk, the armed forces of Ukraine will launch a counteroffensive in the near future. “I don’t know in what numbers this will happen, but I know for sure that there should [in the cities of the alleged theater of operations] definitely not be women and children. It is clear that there will be active hostilities, including shelling, so we urge our citizens to urgently evacuate,” Vereshchuk added. Earlier, the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Alexey Reznikov, told The Times that President Volodymyr Zelensky had given the order to prepare for an assault on the coastal regions of the south of the country. To do this, Kiev has gathered a million-strong army, he claimed, and a plan is being worked out to attack those areas that are ‘politically’ important to Ukraine. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/558740-ukraine-ready-to-recapture-south/,Ukraine has million-strong army to retake South - minister,"Ukraine has amassed a million soldiers, at the behest of President Volodymyr Zelensky, to recapture its southern areas, defense minister Alexey Reznikov has claimed in an interview with The Times. “We understand that, politically, it’s very necessary for our country. The president has given the order to the supreme military chief to draw up plans,” he said in an interview published on Sunday. “We’re people of the free world and with a real sense of justice and liberty. We have approximately 700,000 in the armed forces and when you add the national guard, police, border guard, we are around a million strong,” the minister added. Reznikov praised the British effort to help Ukraine, especially Ben Wallace, Britain’s defense secretary, who, according to him, was key to helping shift the approach from providing Soviet equipment to NATO-standard 155mm artillery, guided multiple launch rocket systems and high-tech drones. This, Reznikov explained, will make up for heavy losses in the Donbass region in the face of mass Russian artillery shelling. President Zelensky previously said Ukraine was losing some 200 men a day in the area. Reznikov also mentioned other allies, claiming an “anti-Kremlin coalition was born.” “Our partners in London and Washington DC and other capitals, they are invested in us, not only with money but the expectations of their people that we have to make the Kremlin lose. We have to win this war together,” he said. Russian president Vladimir Putin’s old alliances have also been shattered, Reznik argued, pointing to Kazakhstan: recently president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev publicly refused to recognize the Lugansk and Donetsk People’s Republics as sovereign nations. “I’m sure that in the next few years we will see a procession of calls for sovereignty on Russian territory. The Russian Federation will finish its life as different countries – Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, etc,” Reznikov said. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-07-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/558725-us-russia-sri-lankan/,US blames Sri Lankan crisis on Russia,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken claimed on Sunday that “Russian aggression” in Ukraine may have been partly to blame for the turmoil in Sri Lanka. The island nation has been in a state of unrest for several months, with food and fuel in short supply and prices skyrocketing. It escalated on Saturday as thousands of protesters stormed the president’s residence, forcing him to flee. “We’re seeing the impact of this Russian aggression playing out everywhere. It may have contributed to the situation in Sri Lanka; we’re concerned about the implications around the world,” Blinken told reporters in Bangkok. He claimed that “growing food insecurity” around the world “has been significantly exacerbated by the Russian aggression against Ukraine.” Blinken reiterated his call on Moscow to allow 20 million tons of grain to leave Ukrainian ports which, in his opinion, Russian forces are blocking as part of their military offensive. He also added that, in Thailand, fertilizer prices have “gone sky high” due to the alleged blockade. Russia, meanwhile, denies all accusations of blocking food exports. Moscow says it has been offering safe passage to freighters but that Ukraine is preventing civilian ships from leaving ports, including Odessa. It also says Kiev’s placement of sea mines has created a threat to shipping in the area. Earlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said some countries are trying to use the food security issue “in the worst possible way” by accusing Moscow “of something it is not involved in” and by “whitewashing” Ukraine. Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt in May for the first time in its history. Fuel rationing was introduced earlier this month, and armed police and troops have been deployed to petrol stations. The crisis has been attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic, which deprived the island nation of vital tourism revenue. An increase in government spending, tax cuts, and quantitative easing drove inflation upwards. Around 100,000 people are believed to have surrounded the Sri Lankan president’s residence in Colombo on Saturday. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe both subsequently announced their resignation amid mass unrest."
2022-07-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/558510-us-investigation-shireen-abu-akleh/,The untouchable ally: US government lets Israel off the hook in the case of Palestinian-American journalist’s death,"The US State Department’s press release on Washington’s investigation into the killing of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh has sparked outrage and triggered accusations of a whitewash. Almost two months after the murder of the veteran Al-Jazeera reporter, Washington announced that an investigation by the US Security Coordinator (USSC) had concluded that Israeli gunfire was “likely responsible.” However, the statement asserted that the evidence was inconclusive and it could not say that Israeli forces were to blame, contradicting various other reports which had concluded the opposite. The US government also claimed that there is “no reason to believe” that the killing was intentional and instead was likely “the result of tragic circumstances,” to which Israel’s top human rights group B’Tselem responded by calling the investigation a “whitewash.” “We are incredulous,” the family of Abu Akleh said in a statement of their own, in which they decried the State Department’s press release. What is perhaps most concerning about the State Department’s statement is its contradictory nature; it calls for accountability on the one hand, whilst simultaneously disagreeing with other reports that indicate Israeli guilt and making a poorly-substantiated assessment of intent. If the US government’s investigation cannot conclude Tel Aviv's guilt or prove an Israeli soldier fired the shot, then how can it conclude that the “likely” culprit did not intend to kill Abu Akleh? According to a CNN investigative report, Abu Akleh was killed in a “targeted attack by Israeli forces,” implying that the evidence suggested the killing was indeed intentional. The claim made by the Israeli government, that a firefight had occurred in the minutes leading up to the murder, was seemingly debunked by the Washington Post’s own investigation into the incident. This is important because the Israeli military’s argument as to why they say the shooting was unintentional is based upon their claim that Israeli soldiers were likely trying to fire at Palestinian militants. Furthermore, according to the Washington Post, “Abu Akleh and other journalists identified as press would likely have been visible from the IDF convoy’s position.” The New York Times also conducted its own investigation, in which it “showed that there were no armed Palestinians near her when she was shot” and debunked the Israeli government’s claims as to how many bullets were fired in the journalist’s direction. The New York Times also stated that “the bullet that killed Ms. Abu Akleh was fired from the approximate location of the Israeli military convoy, most likely by a soldier from an elite unit.” The United Nations’ probe likewise came to conclusions “consistent with many findings out there that the shots that killed her came from Israeli Security Forces.” The other troubling element surrounding the US investigation has been the White House’s flip-flopping on its approach to achieving justice. When news first broke of Abu Akleh’s death on May 11, State Department spokesperson Ned Price stated that “the Israelis have the wherewithal and the capabilities to conduct a thorough, comprehensive investigation,” and seemed to indicate that a US inquiry would not be necessary. Later, however, it was reported that Israel would not conduct an investigation into the killing, and then a statement from an IDF military lawyer suggested that if an Israeli soldier were to be found responsible for firing the fatal shot, they would not be guilty of any criminal misconduct “absent further evidence.” The above information also has to be paired with the fact that Israel’s Foreign Ministry and various political figures distributed a video of Palestinian gunmen, following the killing, claiming that Palestinians had been responsible for the crime. The video that was being shared around was quickly debunked by B’Tselem, which proved through an on-the-ground investigation that the Palestinian gunmen shown in the video could not have possibly fired the kill shot. Then-Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett claimed that it was likely Palestinians who were responsible, later altering his rhetoric when it became more difficult for him to defend the claim. To rub salt into the wound, after Israeli forces had harassed the family of Abu Akleh, police violently assaulted the pallbearers at the slain journalist’s funeral in Jerusalem. Making things even worse, it appeared that the Israeli police doctored footage from the scene of their attack, to make it appear as if Palestinians had thrown objects at the police, prior to the assaults on mourners. The USSC has not provided any clarity on how it was able to draw the conclusions it did. Investigations from the UN, various human rights groups, CNN, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and others, all point to Israeli guilt, but none were able to determine the exact intention of the Israeli soldier who fired the bullet. The US assertion that there is no evidence to suggest the attack was intentional contradicts multiple eyewitnesses who say it was. If the US investigation relied on claims that Israeli soldiers were engaged in firefights with Palestinian militants (likewise contradicted by the investigations mentioned above), then their conclusion is questionable. Above all, the USSC’s judgment of intent has now given Israel a convenient excuse to sweep the killing of an American citizen under the rug. Some may call it a whitewash, but what it really looks like is the US siding with Israel once again over the lives of its own people."
2022-07-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/558709-ukraine-germany-melnik-legacy/,From Nazi controversy to attacking the chancellor: A look back at the turbulent tenure of Ukraine’s man in Germany,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky relieved diplomat Andrey Melnik of his post on Saturday. While neither his potential successor nor the future fate of the now ex-envoy are currently known, media reports have suggested the controversial emissary might end up being promoted and assume the post of deputy foreign minister in Kiev. Melnik was elevated to the position of ambassador to Germany for post-Maidan Ukraine in December 2014, succeeding Russian-born Pavel Klimkin in that role. For the latter, the post became a stepping stone to the position of Ukraine’s foreign minister under then-President Petro Poroshenko. The envoy quickly became the subject of assorted controversies, with the past few months in office particularly scandalous for Melnik over his questionable ways of rallying support for Kiev amid the ongoing conflict with Russia. Shortly after assuming the post of ambassador, Melnik became embroiled in his first major scandal after he visited the grave of Stepan Bandera – a hardcore Ukrainian nationalist who collaborated with the Nazis during WWII and is deemed to be a national hero in present-day Ukraine. Почав свій візит до Мюнхена із покладання разом з громадою квітів і панахиди на могилі Героя України Степана Бандери pic.twitter.com/q5ShYDandu “Began my visit to Munich by laying flowers together with the community, and [partaking in] a memorial service at the grave of the Hero of Ukraine Stepan Bandera,” Melnik tweeted. Since fighting between Kiev and Moscow broke out in late February, Melnik has repeatedly criticized the scale and pace of Berlin’s military aid. For instance, the diplomat posted a picture on social media of a snail with a rifle bullet taped to its shell, sarcastically captioning it “German help is already on its way to us.” “Deutsche Waffen für die Ukraine bereits unterwegs” 🤦‍♂️Gerade von einem Regierungsmitglied aus Kyjiw per whatsapp zugeschickt bekommen. Tja. Russland darf den Krieg nicht gewinnen pic.twitter.com/giDldA20tv Arguably the most high-profile scandal was sparked by Melnik in May, when he described German Chancellor Olaf Scholz as an “offended liverwurst” over his refusal to pay a visit to Kiev. Scholz’s move stemmed from Kiev’s own refusal to host German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in mid-April, over his allegedly cozy ties with Russia. While Melnik had repeatedly defended his remark and insisted it was “not a matter of apologizing,” he admitted in late June that he ultimately “regretted” the offensive statement and promised to apologize to Scholz personally. In late June, Melnik launched a vicious assault on a group of leading German intellectuals, who penned an open letter advocating the end of arms deliveries to Ukraine and urging the West to make Kiev negotiate peace. “What a bunch of pseudo-intellectual loosers (sic),” Melnik tweeted, listing some of the intellectuals by name and suggesting they “should go to hell with [their] defeatist advice.” Nicht schon wieder, what a bunch of pseudo-intellectual loosers 🤦‍♂️Ihr alle Varwicks, Vads, Kluges, Prechts, Yogeshwars, Zehs & Co. sollt euch endlich mit euren defätistischen „Ratschlägen“ zum Teufel scheren. Tschüßhttps://t.co/maeCCkxrBUpic.twitter.com/R6W19c66om The most recent scandal in which Melnik became entangled, rather ironically, turned out to be again related to the controversial Ukrainian national ‘hero’. During an interview with German podcaster Tilo Jung, the diplomat repeatedly defended Bandera, presenting him as a universally revered Robin Hood-like figure. He also claimed that Bandera was not implicated in the mass murder of Jews and Poles, prompting criticism from both Poland and Israel. The fallout from his interview turned to be so bad that Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry had to step in to explain that the remarks did not represent Kiev’s official stance."
2022-07-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/558699-ukraine-us-aid-oversight/,Kiev blasts calls for oversight of US military aid to Ukraine,"Kiev has reacted angrily to a call voiced by US Congresswoman Victoria Spartz (R-Ind) to “establish proper oversight” over weapons and aid deliveries to Ukraine. The idea amounts to an attempt to “undermine” existing mechanisms of delivering aid to Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict with Russia, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Saturday. Spartz’s stance is particularly cynical given the Ukrainian origins of the congresswoman, Nikolenko noted in a Facebook post. “The Congresswoman should stop undermining the existing mechanisms of US military assistance to Ukraine. The Ukrainian side is interacting with American partners with maximum openness, providing them full information about the use of technology,” the spokesman said, claiming that “further bureaucratization” of the process would only help Moscow. Rep. Spartz sent a stern message to both the US President Joe Biden and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this week, telling them to take at least “three urgent action items” she believes would help “get the situation under control.” According to Spartz, Biden must “stop playing politics, have a clear strategy and align security assistance with our strategy.” Zelensky should “stop playing politics and theater,” and “start governing” instead “to better support his military and local governments.” The third point, related to establishing an oversight mechanism, has apparently irked Kiev the most. “Congress has to establish proper oversight of critical infrastructure and delivery of weapons and aid,” Spartz stated. Establishing an oversight mechanism into how money destined to help would be actually spent had been demanded by US politicians before. Back in May, for instance, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul delayed the passage of the behemoth $40 billion Ukraine bill, urging the creation of the oversight mechanism. The aid money would have been better spent at home, Paul argued back then. “My oath of office is to the US Constitution, not to any foreign nation, and no matter how sympathetic the cause, my oath of office is to the national security of the United States of America. We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the US economy,” the Senator said. After the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine broke out in late February, Washington became, by far, the top arms supplier of Kiev. According to fresh figures by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IFW), the US has pledged some €6.37 billion in military aid. It has actually delivered, however, less than a half of that amount – some €2.44 billion in military aid – so far, according to IFW statistics. The figures, however, include “disclosed deliveries” only and the actual scale of delivered hardware might be larger, considering that some supplies might be arriving in secret. The ‘best’ performance in terms of pouring weaponry into Ukraine has been shown by Poland, IFW figures suggest. The country has delivered in full all the €1.8 billion-worth of weaponry it had pledged. Moscow has repeatedly urged the West not to supply Kiev with more weapons, warning it will only prolong the conflict and lead to long-term negative consequences. Last week, Russia’s top diplomat Sergey Lavrov said that continuing to “pump up” Ukraine with weapons would only prompt Russia “to perform more missions on the ground.”"
2022-07-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/558704-zelensky-gay-marriage-petition/,Zelensky to consider gay marriage petition,"A petition calling on Volodymyr Zelensky to legalize gay marriage will be considered by the Ukrainian president after it attracted 25,000 signatures. While Ukrainian flags have been flown at pride parades throughout the Western world, gay marriage is extremely unpopular in Ukraine itself. Filed in early June, the petition recently passed 25,000 signatures, a threshold that means Zelensky must respond. Referencing the current conflict in Ukraine, the petition reads “at this time, every day can be the last. Let people of the same sex get the opportunity to start a family and have an official document to prove it. They need the same rights as traditional couples.” Zelensky’s stance on the issue is unclear. Despite positioning himself as a liberal during his 2019 election campaign and stating during his first press conference that he didn’t “want to say anything negative” about gay people, lawmakers from his party have tried to introduce bills criminalizing the “propaganda of homosexuality and transgenderism.” Although Ukraine under Zelensky has been pursuing greater integration with the West, gay rights activists at home seem unhappy with the comedian-turned-president. For instance, while Zelensky signed a joint statement with US President Joe Biden last September promising to “fight…discrimination against the LGBTQI+ community,” activists in Kiev have demanded that he fire one of his top advisors, Alexey Arestovich, for calling them “deviant.” Ukrainian colors have been hoisted at gay pride events throughout the West, with the Irish government even integrating the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag into the LGBT rainbow in an announcement welcoming gay Ukrainian refugees. Yet back in Ukraine, polling has found that between 9% and 24% of the public think two members of the same sex should be allowed marry. Furthermore, 14% of Ukrainians surveyed in 2019 said that homosexuality should be accepted by society, while 6% in 2020 considered homosexuality “justifiable.” These values are broadly comparable with surrounding countries in Eastern Europe."
2022-07-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/558689-glenn-diesen-germanys-developing-economic/,Glenn Diesen: Germany’s developing economic crisis is a fascinating study in self harm,"Germany just posted its first monthly trade deficit in three decades, and the head of the German Federation of Trade Unions has warned that key industries in the country may collapse permanently as a result of high energy prices and shortages. The golden era of the European Union’s economic locomotive has already come to an end. For three decades, the competitiveness of German industries was enhanced by the import of cheap Russian energy, while Europe’s largest country also became a key export market for German technologies and manufactured goods. Over the previous centuries, a key theme of European politics was that the productive power of Germany and the immense resources of Russia could create the main pillar of power on the European continent. The relationship between Germany and Russia has subsequently always presented a dilemma: A partnership between the two giants would create a challenge to rival powers such as Britain and the US, while German-Russian conflicts have previously turned Central and Eastern Europe into what the British geographer James Fairgrieve referred to as the “crush zone.” The current NATO-Russia proxy war in Ukraine demonstrates that this dilemma from the 19th and 20th centuries remains relevant. Although the 21st century presents a key difference in that the world is no longer Europe-centric. Moscow’s objective for a Russian-German partnership was to construct an inclusive Greater Europe, although this initiative has now been replaced with a Russian-Chinese partnership to construct a Greater Eurasia. The export of Russian energy and other natural resources is being redirected to the East, while Russia increasingly imports vital technologies and industrial products from that source as well. The economic crisis in Germany is a fascinating case study of self-harm. After Moscow supported German reunification in the early 1990s, there was a lack of reciprocation as Bonn, then Berlin, abandoned the agreements with Moscow for a pan-European security architecture based on “sovereign equality” and “indivisible security.” Instead, Germany supported NATO expansionism to create a pan-European system, without the continent’s largest state. As a result, the centuries-long historical rivalry for influence in Central and Eastern Europe was revived between Germany/NATO and Russia over where the new European dividing lines would be drawn. After Berlin supported the Orange Revolution in 2004 and the Kiev Maidan in 2014 to install pro-West/anti-Russian governments, Ukraine became a less reliable transit corridor for Russian energy. Yet, Germany undermined its own energy security by opposing several Russian initiatives to diversify transit routes. Berlin repeatedly threatened to cut reliance on Russian energy and thus incentivised Russia to search for export markets in the East. The Minsk-2 agreement in February 2015 represented a compromise to resolve the conflict that followed the Western-backed coup in Ukraine the year before. Berlin negotiated the peace agreement, although it then played along with American efforts to sabotage or “renegotiate” the agreement for the next seven years. As NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg publicly admitted recently, the military bloc was using this time to prepare for conflict with Russia. When Moscow responded by recognising the independence of Donbass and attacking Ukraine in February 2022, Germany cancelled the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, seized control of Gazprom’s subsidiaries on its territory, and announced sanctions on Russian energy. For years, there has been speculation that Russia would use the feared “energy weapon” by cutting energy supplies to Germany, although in the end there was no need to do so as Germany inflicted this economic pain on itself. Escalation control entails the ability to raise tensions to impose costs on adversaries and de-escalate them when the desired concessions have been obtained. In the unipolar era, when there was solely one centre of power, the collective West largely enjoyed escalation dominance as it could raise the pressure until its adversaries were compelled to capitulate. NATO expansionism, strategic missile defence and asymmetrical economic interdependence enhanced this power against Russia. However, in a multipolar world, it is not possible to base European security on the principle of expanding a hostile military bloc toward Russian borders and then expect that Moscow will simply adapt to these new realities. In the emerging world order, sanctioning Russia merely entails surrendering an immense market share to states such as China and India as opposed to forcing Moscow into submission. While Germany is scrambling to find expensive energy to replace cheap Russian fuels, Moscow is now selling its output at a discount to China and India as it transitions from Greater Europe to Greater Eurasia. Consequently, German industries will lose competitiveness vis-à-vis their Asian counterparts. While Russia can diversify its energy exports, the West’s ability to diversify its energy imports has been undermined by other policies during the unipolar era. Western sanctions against Venezuela and Iran have reduced their ability and willingness to support the West in its time of need. Similarly, the invasion of Libya and subsequent destabilisation of countries such as Nigeria has reduced the ability of African states to fill the gap. Meanwhile, the US has been confiscating Syrian oil, although Syrian energy exports would be much higher if the US would end its illegal occupation of the country’s territory. The collective West is facing an economic calamity, driven by unsustainable debt, runaway inflation, declining competitiveness, and now also an energy crisis on top. As escalation hurts Germany more than Russia, logic would suggest Germany might pursue de-escalation by revisiting and reconsidering the decision to abandon the pan-European security agreements that were made in the early stages of the unipolar era. Instead, reason has gone out the window as leaders in Berlin, consumed by ideological fervor, double down on failed policies."
2022-07-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/558684-agony-of-g20-why-paralyzed/,"The West has paralyzed the G20 by pursuing confrontation with Russia and China, but the organization remains indispensable","The meeting of G20 foreign ministers turned into something of a farce, as Russia's Sergey Lavrov left the meeting before the end, and his US counterpart delivered insults. No breakthroughs were achieved on issues that are vital to the world. This meeting was another rehearsal for the G20 summit scheduled for November, which seems doomed to fail due to the conflict between Russia and the West, as well as ever-growing tensions between the US and China. Russian experts agree that because of these problems, the organization that helped the world overcome the 2008 financial crisis will not be able to rein in the current energy and food disaster. Will the G20 survive in the context of a major conflict between its key participants? Who suffers from the organization’s inefficiency the most, and which blocs will be in charge of handling global issues in the new reality? RT explains. For the first time since the start of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, the foreign ministers of the G7 countries met personally with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The meeting was held on the island of Bali, Indonesia. And it didn't go well. Firstly, for the first time in the history of meetings between G20 diplomats, the participants refused to pose together for a photo. Secondly, the Russian minister and his Western counterparts exchanged mutual accusations: Western ministers accused Russia of blocking grain supplies, Lavrov accused the West of an dangerous approach. “If the West doesn’t want talks to take place but wishes for Ukraine to defeat Russia on the battlefield – because both views have been expressed – then perhaps there is nothing to talk about with the West,” Lavrov said. “Aggressors, invaders, occupants. We’ve heard quite a few such things today,” he said of the meeting. Ultimately, the Russian envoy departed the event before it ended. According to media reports, he left the hall at the moment when Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba was speaking via video link. Ukraine is not a member of the G20. The Russian minister also missed a speech by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. The previous G20 meeting, which took place in April, was not productive either. The British, American and Canadian delegations left the room when Anton Siluanov, Russia’s finance minister, gave his address remotely (he wasn’t even there in person). His message, as it happens, focused on the consequences of skyrocketing energy prices and possible solutions to a problem that concerns many countries, including the Western states. Given all this, as well as the latest developments, we wonder if the November G20 summit can yield any results. The biggest concern so far seems to be the list of attendees. US President Joe Biden said in March that “Russia should be removed from the G20”. In June, the Italian prime-minister reported that he had it on good authority that Indonesia would not let Russia take part in the summit (this was later denied by Jakarta and Moscow). The Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese said he would treat Russian president Vladimir Putin with “the contempt he deserves”, while Ukraine's Volodomyr Zelensky was convinced that “not too many countries will come to the summit if Russia is among the attendees”. In all fairness, alternative voices are heard as well. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, for example, thinks that the conflict with Russia should not be allowed to paralyze the G20, and it is not a good idea for the member states to boycott the summit because of Putin. It is still unclear, however, if Russia plans to participate. It sounds like the Kremlin knows that a conflict would be inevitable and hasn’t made the decision on the format of Putin’s presence, if he participates at all. Russian experts express their concern that in light of all the controversies, the G20 can no longer serve as an effective organization capable of solving global problems and challenges as it has in the past. Professor Sergey Lunev, who teaches history at Moscow's MGIMO University, told RT that the G20 would now “yield zero results”. He thinks that the situation will not change even if Russia and the West find their way out of the current conflict, because the reasons for the degradation of the G20 are more fundamental. “We are talking about a major transformation of the global system, the economic aspects – first and foremost, the system in which the West will lose its current position. The split in the G20 is defined by the doubts in the old system where the Western countries had all the privileges and were the foundation of global economy. In this context, it is hardly possible that the G20 will have any positive impact,” says Lunev. Dmitry Suslov, Deputy Director of the Higher School of Economics’ (HSE) Department of World Economy and International Affairs, is more optimistic about the G20’s prospects. He believes the organization may be able to address some of the issues on the global agenda at the upcoming summit, although not the most pressing problems. “The opportunities for pursuing constructive partnership are now very limited. I think the G20 will come up with some final documents at this summit, as they are currently being agreed at the Sherpa level. But the overall scale of decisions produced by the summit will be significantly more modest compared to previous years. And they are likely to be worded in a more general and ambiguous way, supporting the good and opposing the evil, so to speak. Don’t expect any concrete solutions – it’s an almost impossible thing to accomplish in a situation of confrontation,” the expert says. However, attempts to find a way out of the global crisis will be made, for sure, as the looming plight – which has not yet unfolded to its full extent, but is already felt in many countries of the world – cannot be confronted unless the world’s biggest economies combine their efforts. This year’s agenda includes, at least, two things – the global food and energy crises. And the COVID-19 pandemic is still there, too, with Europe currently facing a new wave of the infection. And that’s not to mention the recent monkeypox outbreak and the risk of other virulent diseases that may affect the world’s populations in the future. Let’s turn to the format's history and recall that the group first met in 1999 as a response measure the G8 devised to deal with the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. “It was back then that the US and the rest of the world finally realized that no global issues could be tackled effectively by the West alone,” Dmitry Suslov explains. But since the crisis was already beginning to wane at the time of G20’ inaugural meeting, the new group was soon forgotten, with only fairly regular meetings of the member states’ finance ministers keeping it from falling apart completely. But the 2008 crisis breathed new life into the Group of 20. In less than a year, its member states held three summits producing dozens of decisions designed to improve the global financial system. Experts are unanimous in recognizing the G20’s exceptional role in resolving the 2008 global financial crisis. However, the G20 only retained its status as the world’s main crisis-response tool for less than 10 years. The Ukrainian events of 2014 were the first warning og the decrease of the G20’s effectiveness. “The G20 grew substantially less efficient, once the [American] Trump Administration reversed its policy on China [from friendly] to overtly confrontational,” says Suslov. “Starting from 2018, it became increasingly difficult for the G20 member states to find common ground because of the American-Chinese confrontation, the US and China being the world’s two most powerful and influential countries having the biggest potential and a final say in resolving issues on the global scale. If the two key players are fighting, it’s extremely difficult to reach agreement needed to address global issues,” the expert said. The Covid-19 pandemic revealed that the G20 had lost much of its effectiveness. This improvised crisis committee proved essentially useless in dealing with the global health crisis. The US was busy blaming the pandemic on China, and Beijing, too, was rather hostile. “For four years already, the G20 has been unable to provide the much needed coordination between the world’s key economies. But now, the problems are going to become even worse, much worse,” Suslov predicts. One solution that seems pretty obvious is that if the G20 is disrupted by the West’s conflict with Russia and China, then it probably could be mended by simply dumping these two powers and going back to business as usual without them. The experts, however, believe that this is not going to happen. First of all, according to MGIMO Professor Sergey Lunev, neither Russia nor China have any critical disagreements with the other parties to the G20, i.e. Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, South Korea and South Africa. Moreover, he points out that these nations, on the contrary, “support Russia to varying degrees, sometimes covertly for fear of being slapped with sanctions by the West."" “We are talking about transformation of the world order and the global economy, which was the very reason the West has lost its dominant position in the first place. It’s only natural that other powers are very interested in this development, and because of that, they will continue to support Russia. It’s quite another matter that all these powers, including China, will be only happy to have Russia wrestle with the West all alone,” Lunev adds. According to Dmitry Suslov, there is another reason why the G20 can’t go on without Russia and China, and it’s pretty simple: for the lack of resources. “Discussing climate change, food supply, energy sources and global economy without China is as pointless as trying to discuss all that without the USA; and so is discussing global security or energy or food supply without Russia. Russia’s role is critical in these areas,” Suslov explains. No one wins from a weaker G20, since global threats transcend borderlines. Everyone on the planet is affected by things like climate change, a global pandemic or global recession. As bad as all that is, things can only get worse when the world’s leading powers don’t see eye to eye. One example: the US government is now forced to push up local oil production and even activate frozen oil wells in order to deal with the energy shortage the US has found itself in – which is quite the opposite of what Joe Biden vowed to achieve during his election campaign on the climate change front. While the experts have different views on how they think the world will tackle global challenges in the future, they all seem to agree on one thing, i.e. that there will be two major centers of power on the global scene in the immediate future, and they will be enacting their own, different policies. “Non-Western alliances are gaining momentum. One example is BRICS that recently received applications to join from Iran and Argentina. Should other non-Western powers that are members of the G20 also decide to join, the world will end up having two clubs essentially: one boiling down to the G7 and representing the interests of the West, and BRICS representing the interests of all the others,” Lunev believes. While Suslov agrees it’s true, he is also convinced that the very existence of the G20 is under no real threat in the absence of any other global organization that could claim to represent 85% of the global economy. “It’s true that the G20 will become less efficient. It will become in essence a bipolar organization, with its two poles defined by the G7 and BRICS powers respectively. They both will be pursuing their own agendas, as well as the global agenda. They will tackle the latter from their own perspectives. The G20 itself will be trying to keep these two tracks coordinated, but how well it can do it remains to be seen,” Lunev concludes."
2022-07-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/558681-embassy-comments-us-ukraine-himars/,Russia calls out American goal in arming Ukraine,"The US government is aiming to protract the armed conflict in Ukraine for as long as possible, and it is for this purpose that Washington is providing Kiev with four more HIMARS units, the Russian embassy in Washington claimed on Friday. The diplomatic mission's statement went on to suggest that the planned delivery of additional multiple launch systems is intended to make up for growing casualties among Ukrainian forces. The Russian embassy’s statement went on to suggest that the planned delivery of additional multiple launch systems is intended to make up for growing casualties among Ukrainian forces. It dismissed the Pentagon’s claim that such weapons are being used by Kiev for defensive purposes. The Ukrainian military and “nationalist groups are deploying US-supplied weapons to destroy cities of Donbass,” the statement insisted. The Russian diplomats claimed that the “Ukrainian Armed Forces are constantly deliberately targeting residential areas of Donetsk,” including parts of the city where there are no Russian troops. As a result of this, “civilians are dying,” according to the embassy. “The goal of the Russian Federation is to put an end to the terror of the Kiev regime,” the embassy proclaimed, adding that “Washington with its actions is not bringing peace closer, but on the contrary, is encouraging the Ukrainian authorities to commit new blood crimes.” Earlier on Friday, a senior Pentagon official revealed that the “White House will be announcing” a new round of military aid for Ukraine, which would include, among other things, four high-mobility artillery rocket systems, HIMARS, and additional ammunition for those units. The US Department of Defense official stressed that these weapons are “especially important and effective in assisting Ukraine and coping with the Russian artillery battle in the Donbass.” When asked by a journalist about the total number of HIMARS units that Ukraine would have after receiving the new four ones, the Pentagon representative said Kiev would have 12 such systems at its disposal. They went on to rebut Russia’s claims that its forces had managed to destroy some of the HIMARS units Washington had previously supplied. “That is not correct,” the unnamed DoD official insisted, adding that the “Ukrainians have those systems and are making use of them.” He also revealed that the $400 million package would include 1,000 rounds of 155 millimeter high-precision artillery ammunition."
2022-07-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/558677-belgorod-nuclear-submarine-poseidon/,Russian Navy receives nuclear torpedo submarine,"The world’s longest submarine, the K-329 Belgorod, was officially handed over to the Russian military on Friday at the Sevmash shipyard in Severodvinsk. Russian Navy commander Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov attended the ceremony and thanked the shipbuilders for delivering the “research"" vessel. The Belgorod, however, is also designed to be able to carry up to six ‘Poseidon’ nuclear-powered torpedoes, which are still under development. The vessel “opens up new opportunities for Russia in conducting various studies, allowing us to conduct a variety of scientific expeditions and rescue operations in the most remote areas of the oceans,” Yevmenov said at the ceremony, thanking both Sevmash, the Rubin design bureau and Russia’s entire military industry for successfully building the submarine. The multi-purpose nuclear submarine was previously designated as Project 09852. It is based on the Project 949A series, known in the West as the Oscar II-class, but with significant modifications. The lengthened hull allows the Belgorod to carry undersea drones, a deep-sea rescue vehicle (DSRV), as well as a smaller nuclear-powered submarine such as the AS-31 Losharik. While Admiral Yevmenov chose to highlight the scientific and rescue capabilities of the vessel, Western observers are mainly interested in Belgorod’s ability to carry ‘Poseidons’. The United States Naval Institute dubbed the vessel a “doomsday submarine… armed with a strategic nuclear torpedo the size of a school bus,” while the War Zone defense blog called it one of “Russia’s most versatile and feared weapons, built with espionage and launching nuclear powered, nuclear-armed torpedoes in mind.” Formerly known as the ‘Status-6 Oceanic Multipurpose System’ (after an “accidental” leak in 2015), the nuclear-powered autonomous torpedo was one of the six “superweapons” officially announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin back in March 2018. Still in development, the Poseidon is supposedly designed to be undetectable by conventional means, and capable of destroying entire carrier battle groups or causing tsunamis that could wreck coastal cities. An entire new class of submarines, the Khabarovsk, is allegedly being designed around carrying the ‘Poseidons’, but all information about them is classified."
2022-07-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/558664-estonia-kallas-resignation-coalition/,Another European PM resigns,"Kaja Kallas, Estonia’s first-ever female prime minister, submitted her resignation to President Alar Karis on Friday. The move is part of a month-long effort to put together a new coalition government, after Kallas lost the support of her erstwhile junior partner and with it the parliamentary majority. A new cabinet will include three parties and, once it’s finalized, the Riigikogu is expected to approve Kallas as the PM again. “I myself submitted this resignation proposal,” Kallas told the Estonian outlet Delfi, explaining that she wished to avoid “noise and discontent” if she simply appointed new ministers. The announcement came after her Reform party reached a power-sharing deal with two smaller parties, the Social Democrats and Isamaa (Fatherland). “Habemus papam,” Kallas tweeted on Friday, using the Latin expression for the election of a new pope to herald the deal. The Baltic state has been facing a cabinet crisis since June 3, when Kallas’s coalition with the Center Party (Eesti Keskerakond, EK) fractured over the push to make all elementary education in Estonian only – banning the use of Russian in the former Soviet republic. The Centrists’ departure left Kallas with only 34 seats in the 101-member legislature, which meant that the Social Democrats and Isamaa could drive a hard bargain for their nine and 12 seats, respectively. In addition to the education bill, the three parties stumbled over family and energy subsidies, as Estonia faced skyrocketing energy prices due to the EU embargoes against Russia. While they have reached an agreement on the policies, the three parties are still working on the composition of the new cabinet. The Social Democrats’ leader, Lauri Laanemets, said it could be in place by the end of next week. President Kariis welcomed the new coalition deal, saying it came “at the twelfth hour,” and that the new cabinet must be formed quickly amid the “acute security crisis” he blamed on Moscow. “Estonia will have new ministers who must quickly start work to lead our people through the challenges of inflation and energy prices that lie ahead in autumn and winter,” said Karis, according to the national broadcaster ERR. Kallas became prime minister in January 2021, after the resignation of the Centrist PM Juri Ratas, following a scandal. She has been a vocal advocate of anti-Russian sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, calling for the EU to arm the Kiev government. Even as she negotiated the new government on Friday, she was tweeting about a new €2 coin minted by the Estonian central bank, which will feature the slogan “Slava Ukraini” (Glory to Ukraine)."
2022-07-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/558659-nato-commander-crimea-bridge/,NATO ex-commander encourages attack on Crimea bridge,"The bridge linking Crimea to the rest of Russia is a “legitimate target” for Ukraine, the former supreme NATO commander for Europe, General Philip Breedlove, believes. Kiev now has the ability to try and attack the bridge across the Kerch Strait with Western-supplied Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Breedlove told The Times in an interview published on Thursday. “Kerch bridge is a legitimate target,” Breedlove stated. “It doesn’t surprise me at all that the Russians are concerned about Kerch bridge. It’s incredibly important to them.” Now that the West has given Ukraine Harpoon missiles, I think the Russians have every reason to be worried about Ukraine launching an attack on the bridge. The attack can materialize in retaliation to Moscow tightening its “naval blockade” on Ukraine, Breedlove claimed, suggesting that Russia might go as far as sinking civilian transport vessels carrying grain from Ukrainian ports. Russia, however, has repeatedly stated that it was ready to provide safe passage for such ships, pointing out that the heavy mining of the Ukrainian coast, carried out by Kiev, was the only real obstacle for resuming grain exports by sea. “There are many Western leaders and ex-leaders like me who are having conversations now about what would happen if Russia begins to sink Ukrainian grain ships or if the Russian naval blockade goes kinetic,” Breedlove said. Several people I have spoken to say ‘dropping’ Kerch bridge would be a huge blow to Russia. Kerch bridge is a legitimate target. While destroying the bridge completely would require a “dedicated bombing operation,” putting it out of order temporarily should be a fairly simple task, he said. All of the bridges have their “weak points” and hitting them “could render Kerch bridge unserviceable for a period of time,” the general added, citing his civil engineer training as proof of expertise. Crimea voted to leave Ukraine and rejoin Russia in March 2014, following the US-backed Maidan coup in Kiev. The Crimea bridge was built to simplify the connection to the Russian mainland. Destroying the bridge has been repeatedly floated as an idea by top Ukrainian officials over the past few months. While Russia seized the southeast of Ukraine during the ongoing conflict, establishing an overland connection to Crimea, Kiev seemingly remains fixated on striking the bridge. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/558660-canada-satanist-sanctions-patriarch/,Russia responds to ‘satanist’ Canadian sanctions,"Doubling down on its commitment to Ukraine, Canada on Friday blacklisted 29 Russians and 15 entities, accusing them of being “disinformation and propaganda agents” of the Kremlin. Among those sanctioned were RT and Sputnik, two government agencies, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, and Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill. “Only satanists could sanction the Patriarch,” Zakharova said on Telegram, reacting to the announcement. A spokesman for the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church called the Canadian sanctions “another pointless move, empty of meaning.” Patriarch Kirill is person 847 on the Canadian sanctions list, under his birth name Vladimir Mikhailovich Gundyaev. Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly made no mention of the Patriarch in her announcement of the new sanctions, sent from the G20 meeting in Bali, Indonesia. Joly claimed the sanctions were aimed at “state-sponsored disinformation and propaganda agents.” “The Russian propaganda machine must answer for its lies. Canada is committed to fighting disinformation wherever and whenever it is found,” Joly said. “Canada stands with Ukraine.” Ottawa’s “propaganda” designation applies to all major Russian media outlets, from Channel 1 and Russia-1, to NTV, TASS, public broadcaster VGTRK, Russia-24, RT, Sputnik and Regnum. Also sanctioned on Friday were the international aid agency Rossotrudnichestvo and the media regulator Roskomnadzor. Among the sanctioned individuals was movie director Tigran Keosayan, husband of RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan – who has also been blacklisted by Ottawa. Another part of Friday’s sanctions package was an embargo on the importation of Russian gold and most gold products. The government in Ottawa banned broadcasting by RT in March, accusing it of menacing the sovereignty of Ukraine. Moscow responded two months later, revoking the credentials of the Canadian state broadcaster CBC. Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned of additional countermeasures, noting that the West has thrown out international law in favor of arbitrary rules on the nature of “freedom of information” and “propaganda.” “We initially did not want to give a mirror response that would affect journalists’ rights, but the West has buried the freedom of speech with its own hands,” Lavrov said on Monday."
2022-07-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/558653-dpr-parliament-lifts-execution-moratorium/,DPR takes step towards executing British mercenaries,"Lawmakers in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) have lifted a moratorium on executions, citing threats to the Donbass republic’s vital interests. There are currently three foreign volunteers, who fought for Ukraine and were captured by DPR forces, awaiting their fate on death row. On Friday, Elena Shishkina, chair of the committee on criminal and administrative legislation in the DPR People’s Council, announced that “in light of the need to protect the sovereignty, territorial integrity and interests of the Donetsk People’s Republic in the existing military-political circumstances, it is being proposed to declare” the ban on executions null and void. The official also pointed out that the death penalty is only meted out to those found guilty of “particularly heinous crimes against life and certain crimes committed in times of war or in a combat environment.” The mere fact that condemned convicts can actually be executed will serve as a powerful deterrent to would-be offenders, especially those committing “crimes against peace and security of humanity,” the statement on the DPR’s parliamentary website reads. With a majority of MPs voting in favor of the proposal, people facing capital punishment could be put to death from the day the legislation is published. On June 9, the DPR’s Supreme Court sentenced two British and one Moroccan national to death, finding the three guilty of being mercenaries and taking part in “Ukraine’s armed aggression” against the republic. The fighters surrendered to DPR forces in mid-April in the city of Mariupol, which had seen weeks of heavy fighting between Ukrainian troops on one side and Russian and DPR forces on the other. London insists that its citizens should be treated as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention, even though Britain is not formally at war with the DPR and does not recognize the republic as an independent state to begin with. Officials in Donetsk have said they consider the captives to be mercenaries, which means they are not under the protection of international law, unlike regular combatants. On Monday, Aiden Aslin’s legal defense team said it had lodged an appeal of the death sentence. The Briton’s attorney, Pavel Kosovan, told Russia’s TASS media outlet that he was contesting two counts of the verdict – ‘commission of crimes by a group of persons’ and ‘forcible seizure of power or violent retention of power’ – and was seeking to have the case dismissed “due to the absence of corpus delicti in the actions of the defendant.” In late June, Aslin’s compatriot, Shaun Pinner, also appealed the court’s decision, with his lawyer calling for the sentence to be commuted from death to life imprisonment. Moroccan national Saadun Brahim’s defense also filed an appeal last Friday. The DPR court has confirmed the receipt of all three petitions."
2022-07-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/558645-military-fakes-jail-term/,Russia hands out first jail term for ‘fakes’ about military,"A Moscow court sentenced a local city councillor, Alexey Gorinov, to seven years behind bars on Friday. The legislator was found guilty of deliberately disseminating ‘false information’ about Russia’s military after he opposed plans to hold an art competition for children in his district while “children are dying” in Ukraine. The politician pleaded not guilty and staged a protest during the hearing, displaying a placard reading, “Do you still need this war?” from the defendant’s booth. The verdict caused a minor disturbance in the courtroom, with three supporters of Gorinov reportedly being briefly detained over failing to comply with the bailiffs’ orders. The legislator was found guilty of “deliberately disseminating false information about the Russian military or the state bodies while using a public position to his advantage.” The offense carries a maximum penalty of 10 years behind bars or a major fine of up to five million rubles (nearly $80,000). The court fully agreed with the arguments presented by the prosecution, slapping Gorinov with a seven-year jail term, as requested by the prosecution. Gorinov found himself in the media spotlight – and subsequent legal trouble – after the scandalous meeting with local legislators in Moscow’s central Krasnoselsky district in mid-March. During the meeting, Gorinov strongly opposed holding a drawing contest for children in the district, insisting that the event was inappropriate because “children are dying” in the ongoing war in Ukraine. His stance was supported by the local chief MP, Elena Kotenochkina, who branded Russia a “fascist” state altogether. While Gorinov ended up in custody after multiple complaints were filed by several public figures with Russian prosecutors, Kotenochkina managed to evade the law and fled abroad. She was later arrested in-absentia and is currently being sought for the same charges as Gorinov. Gorinov’s case seems to be the first time a person accused of disseminating ‘fakes’ about Russia’s military received a real jail term. Earlier this year, at least two people were found guilty of that offense, with one of them fined one million rubles ($15,900) and another reportedly receiving a three-year suspended sentence. Russia has tightened its legislation amid the ongoing military operation in neighboring Ukraine, launched in late February. Apart from outlawing the spread of ‘false information’ about the military and state bodies, it has also criminalized “public actions” aimed at tarnishing the image of Russian Armed Forces."
2022-07-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/558643-putin-ukraine-balance-power/,Kremlin clarifies Putin’s remark on Ukraine,"President Vladimir Putin’s observation that Russian troops in Ukraine “haven’t even really started anything yet” simply states that Moscow is far superior in its military strength, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov clarified on Friday. On Thursday, Putin dared Western leaders who seek Russia’s defeat on the battlefield in Ukraine to deliver on the threat. “Let them try. We haven’t even really started anything yet,” he claimed. The president “simply reminded [his audience] that the military potentials [of Ukraine and Russia] were incommensurable,” Peskov said. “Russian strength is so vast that only a small fraction of it is engaged in the special military operation,” the official said. Western expectations that Ukraine can defeat Russia militarily are “absurd and only add to the suffering of the Ukrainian people,” he added. The US and its allies have declared as their goal in Ukraine a strategic defeat of Russia and are providing weapons and training to Kiev forces. Top Western officials have stated that Ukraine will be able to beat Russia on the battlefield with their help. The Ukrainian government agreed and broke peace talks with Russia, which took place during the first month of the conflict. Moscow believes that Kiev was pressured into its uncompromising position by its Western backers. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-07-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/558640-eu-sanctions-global-famine/,EU will be held responsible for starving millions around the world – tycoon,"Sanctions imposed on Russian and Belarusian fertilizer producers are akin to weapons of mass destruction in the scale of the damage they will likely cause over the next few years, the founder of chemical giant EuroChem has claimed. “The EU sanctions mean suffering, famine and migration flows for many hundreds of millions of people,” Andrey Melnichenko said in an interview with the Swiss newspaper Die Weltwoche on Thursday. “Sanctions targeting food and energy are economic weapons of mass destruction. They hit innocent people the worst. I have no doubt that billions of people will feel its effects,” he warned. Suffering people will want to hold those responsible accountable, and the EU won’t be able to shift its culpability, the businessman added. It was not Russia or the US, but EU members like Lithuania and Estonia, and also European leaders Germany, France and Italy, which chose to disrupt the operation of his chemical empire with sanctions, he explained. EuroChem, a leading fertilizer producer, is headquartered in Switzerland, where Melnichenko also lives with his family. The EU and Switzerland targeted the company and its owner with sanctions aimed at hurting the Russian economy in retaliation for Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine. Melnichenko argued he personally was unjustly punished for being a rich Russian, dismissing claims that he had any influence on the Russian government. He warned of the catastrophic consequences that the “carpet-bombing” of the Russian economy will cause over a few years. He assessed that EuroChem products helped feed almost 274 million people. With its fertilizers not produced and sold due to sanctions, the effect would be far worse than what is happening now over the cut in grain exports from Ukraine, he said. “The G7 countries, with their one billion citizens, see themselves as the world's moral leaders. But they have overridden the interests of the other seven billion people,” he said. Russia and its ally Belarus, another target for Western sanctions, account for 17% of global fertilizer supply, the tycoon said. Should that supply disappear from the market, the world “will lose food for almost 750 million people after just a few harvests,” he warned. Exports from those two countries already dropped by 30-40% amid the stand-off with the West, and it’s the most vulnerable people who are paying the price, Melnichenko added. “We don't know whether people in the third world are already dying, or if they are ‘just’ starving and migrating away,” he said. With social tensions skyrocketing over hunger and fuel shortages, there will be a surge of violence, he predicted. “Perhaps jihad will raise its black flag again. These are not wild theories, but facts.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-07-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/558635-puting-condolences-abe-death/,Putin sends condolences to Shinzo Abe’s family,"President Vladimir Putin of Russia has sent condolences to the mother and to the wife of the late Shinzo Abe, a former prime minister of Japan, who was killed by a gunman on Friday. Putin’s message called Abe “an exceptional statesman, who … did a lot for good neighborly relations” between Russia and Japan during his tenure in office. Putin said that, during his contacts with the Japanese politician, he fully appreciated his personal and professional qualities. “A fond memory of this wonderful man will stay forever in the hearts of everyone who knew him,” he said. Earlier the Russian foreign ministry described the shooting as a “terrorist act” and called for the culprit to be held accountable. Meanwhile Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for the Kremlin, called Abe a true patriot of Japan. “He always fought for the interests of his country, and preferred to do so at the negotiation table. That is why he established a good, constructive working relationship” with the Russian president, Peskov said. Abe was killed during an election rally in the western Japanese city of Nara. He arrived in hospital with no vital signs and was proclaimed dead as a result of blood loss shortly afterwards, medics said. The perpetrator was apprehended at the scene after having fired his weapon twice. He was identified by the police as a 41-year-old resident of the city. Abe held the office of the prime minister of Japan from 2006 to 2007 and again from 2012 to 2020, which made him the longest-serving leader in the country’s modern history. He resigned due to developing health problems, but remained an influential figure in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. His public appearance was to deliver a speech on behalf of the Nara Prefecture’s representative, who is seeking a new term in the upcoming parliamentary election."
2022-07-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/558625-russia-condemns-abe-shooting/,Russia condemns Abe shooting as ‘terrorism’,"Russia has described the assassination of former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe as a “monstrous crime” and an “act of terrorism.” Everyone responsible for it should be held accountable, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. She was writing before Abe's death was confirmed. Meanwhile, President Vladimir Putin, in a Telegram, wrote that ""the hand of a criminal cut short the life of an outstanding statesman who led the Japanese government for a long time and did a lot to develop good neighborly relations between our countries."" Putin added that Abe, whom he called only ""Shinzo"", was an ""excellent person"" and lamented the loss of his ""personal and professional qualities."" Abe was shot in the Japanese city of Nara, on Friday, where he was delivering a speech ahead of a parliamentary election. His death was confirmed some hours later. Police identified the gunman, who was apprehended at the scene, as a 41-year-old local resident. The murder has sparked universal condemnation in Japan and in other nations."
2022-07-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/558621-lavrov-g20-meeting-indonesia/,Lavrov describes reaction to his G20 presence,"Western foreign ministers attending a G20 meeting in Indonesia this week used the opportunity to unleash verbal attacks against Russia, instead of sticking to discussion of global economic challenges, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told journalists on Friday. Lavrov remarked that he didn’t go to the summit for photo ops with foreign officials. If Western ministers wanted to skip some parts of the entertainment offered by the host nation to avoid being seen with him, it was up to “their understanding of the protocols and politeness,” he added. Some of the countries that want to punish Russia for attacking Ukraine pledged to use the meeting of G20 foreign ministers in Bali to demonstrate Russia’s supposed diplomatic isolation. “It was obvious that they didn’t use the G20 for the purposes, for which it was created,” Lavrov said. Participants from developing countries didn’t support the approach, he added. “Aggressors, invaders, occupants. We’ve heard quite a few such things today,” he explained while describing the speeches made by his Western counterparts. Lavrov said that signals coming from Western nations contradicted each other, since some were calling for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine while others urged Kiev to fight and win before talking to Moscow. “If the West doesn’t want talks and wants a victory over Russia on the battlefield… then perhaps we simply have nothing to talk about,” Lavrov remarked. The top diplomat said that in some cases Western Russia-bashing was apparently more about the theatrical effect than anything else, as, he assessed, was the case with outgoing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The British PM announced his resignation as the leader of the Conservative Party and the head of the government on Thursday amid the latest scandal plaguing his cabinet. “Well, he resigned, and so be it,” Lavrov said. “Everyone said Russia must be isolated. But so far his own party has isolated Boris Johnson.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-07-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/558618-urkaine-pressures-canada-turbine/,Ukraine seeks to block return of gas turbine to Russia,"The Ukrainian government is pressuring Canada not to return a gas turbine to Russia that could boost the supply of Russian fuel to Germany, Reuters and a Ukrainian news site have reported. Kiev argues the precedent would erode anti-Russia sanctions. Previously, Russian gas monopoly Gazprom reduced the flow through the Nord Stream pipeline to 40% of capacity, claiming that Germany failed to return a Siemens gas turbine from maintenance in Canada. The crucial piece of equipment had become stuck due to Ottawa’s sanctions against Russia. According to sources in the Ukrainian government cited on Thursday and on Friday by Reuters and the Ukrainian news website Evropeyskaya Pravda, Kiev was informed that Canada had decided to return the turbine. Officials in Ukraine argued that it was a bad move. “If, God forbid, this decision is approved, we will undoubtedly appeal to our European colleagues that their approach must be reassessed,” a source in Ukraine’s Energy Ministry was quoted as saying by Reuters. “Because, if countries do not follow decisions they have agreed about sanctions, how can we talk about solidarity?” Both outlets said Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko had lobbied Canada not to return the turbine, claiming that Russia could ramp up gas supplies to Germany. The Ukrainian newspaper said the minister had sent a two-page letter to his Canadian counterpart, Jonathan Wilkinson, on June 22, in which he explained that more Russian gas could be pumped through Ukraine. Kiev is concerned that by bowing down to what it considers Russian energy blackmail, Canada would set a bad precedent for the Western sanctions regime. Germany activated the second phase of its gas emergency plan after Russia reduced supplies through Nord Stream. Berlin reportedly asked Ottawa to return the turbine before 10 days of scheduled maintenance starts on the pipeline next week."
2022-07-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/558587-moscow-rain-storm-flood/,Freak storm hits Moscow (VIDEOS),"Moscow was hit by heavy rain and strong winds on Thursday, which caused flash flooding in some parts of the city. A number of trees were felled and structures damaged, while a lightning strike even sparked a minor fire at a church. In the span of just an hour, parts of Russia’s capital were subjected to some 30% of the monthly average rainfall total, according to the city’s public services department. Streets across the city turned into rivers, as storm drains were overwhelmed. The strong winds toppled numerous trees, footage circulating online shows. Debris and fallen trees damaged multiple cars across the metropolis. At least one residential building in central Moscow partially lost its roofing, with the wreckage reportedly landing on a parked vehicle. Lightning struck a late 18th century church in central Moscow, causing a minor fire. Footage from the scene shows smoke rising from the dome. The blaze, however, was promptly extinguished by emergency services. The inclement weather also briefly disrupted operations of the Moscow metro system, one of the largest in the world. It affected both above-ground lines, which in some cases were blocked by fallen trees, while the entrances to some underground stations saw light flooding. Some Muscovites, however, seemed to have found a way to enjoy the tempest. Footage circulating online shows a naked man having climbed out onto the roof of a building in order to, apparently, get a better feel of the storm that hit the city."
2022-07-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/558596-bundeswehr-soldiers-crimea-bridge/,German troops planned attack on Crimea bridge – media,"Two Bundeswehr soldiers – who wanted to use purloined explosives to destroy the bridge linking Crimea to the rest of Russia – are among a dozen suspects arrested in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein for a series of burglaries at military bases. That's according to the Stern magazine, citing police sources. “A series of burglaries, long investigations, a crazy plan: How German soldiers wanted to intervene in the Ukraine war,” the Hamburg-based weekly headlined. The story, pieced together from police reports, details the investigation into a theft ring that involved four Bundeswehr soldiers and eight other suspects rounded up by the police in Kiel. The arrests actually happened on May 22, to little or no media attention, as the probe was focused on break-ins at military facilities and the theft of weapons, explosives, and other ammunition for resale at the black market. The bridge plot was discovered by accident, as police monitored the suspects’ phone conversations, according to the magazine. During the calls, the two men discussed the type and quantity of materials they would need to destroy the 19-kilometer bridge between Crimea and the Taman peninsula, as a way to help Ukraine in the conflict with Russia. Just before they were arrested, the conspirators had tried – unsuccessfully – to steal diving equipment from the Eckernfoerde naval facility near Kiel. Police say they had planned to travel to Ukraine a few days later. Ammunition, weapons and explosives were found at the home of the two soldiers. Stern said the stolen goods were partly intended for resale and partly for personal use – including the Crimea plot. The ring allegedly began operations last summer, and broke into a barracks in Alt Duvenstedt and a naval facility in Eckernfoerde at the beginning of 2022, before the hostilities in Ukraine escalated. Crimea voted to leave Ukraine and rejoin Russia in March 2014, following the US-backed coup in Kiev. The bridge was built to connect the peninsula to the Russian mainland, with the road portion opening in 2018 and the rail segment in 2020. Though Russian troops established an overland connection with Crimea early on in the conflict by taking most of the Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, the government in Kiev has remained fixated on destroying the bridge. “If there is an opportunity to do this, we will definitely do it,” said Alexey Danilov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, in an April interview. Ukrainian general Dmitry Marchenko told US state-run media last month that Kiev still wanted to blow up the bridge, but was waiting for the West to deliver the right kind of weapons. Alexey Arestovich, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said last week that the plans to go after the bridge were absolutely still in play. On Thursday, former NATO commander in Europe and retired US Air Force general Philip Breedlove told the Times the Ukrainians should target the bridge with Harpoon anti-ship missiles recently delivered by the Pentagon."
2022-07-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/558593-putin-russia-hasnt-started-yet/,Russia hasn't really started anything yet – Putin,"Russia is ready to engage in peace negotiations with Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday, warning that those who reject such prospects should realize that prolonging the ongoing conflict would only make such talks more difficult. “We do not refuse to negotiate peace, but those who refuse should know that the longer they do, the more difficult it will be to negotiate,” Putin said, issuing a warning to those who might think Russia has already exhausted its capabilities amid the conflict. We hear today that they want us to be defeated on the battlefield. Well, what can I say? Let them try. We haven’t even really started anything yet. Putin also said that the West appears to actually be willing to “fight until the last Ukrainian,” which he said is a “tragedy” for the Ukrainian people. The president blamed the ongoing conflict on the US-led NATO, stressing that Russia’s consistent efforts to create a fair international security system have been jeopardized. “The initiatives to work together on missile defense have been rejected, warnings about the unacceptability of NATO expansion, especially at the expense of the former Soviet republics, have been ignored,” Putin said. If the West’s goal was to provoke a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it has evidently succeeded in that, Putin admitted. On the strategic level, however, the West already lost when Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine, Putin stated. They should have realized that they had already lost from the very beginning of our special military operation, because its beginning also means the beginning of a complete breakdown of the American world order. The president added that the ongoing breakdown “cannot be stopped.”"
2022-07-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/558573-belarus-intelligence-war-poland/,US eyes direct war with Russia – Belarus,"The US is making plans for a direct war against Russia and its ally Belarus, the head of Belarusian military intelligence warned on Thursday. The scenario is becoming more likely as the proxy war in Ukraine and other ways to hurt the two nations are failing, he claimed. “The territory of Poland as well as the Baltic states is being turned into a staging ground, from which the US plans to unleash a new bloody conflict in Europe, targeting the Russian Federation and its allies,” Major General Ruslan Kosygin said. He cited NATO training troops for rapid deployment in Eastern Europe and the development of anti-ballistic missile systems in the region as evidence of the looming crisis. Further proof, he claimed, is the “dangerous attempts by some Polish politicians to initiate a return of so-called historically Polish regions” in western Ukraine and Belarus. The general said his agency believed that Western nations were preparing for an attack against Belarus and Russia under the guise of deterring Russia from launching an invasion, which is how NATO justifies its military build up in Eastern Europe. Belarus “does not favor” the scenario of a war, but will act decisively, if it comes true, Kosygin said. He said an escalation was becoming increasingly possible because “the West is coming to the realization that traditional methods of hybrid aggression against Russia and Belarus are not producing the results it wants.” Direct confrontation with Poland and Baltic nations, if it starts, would be similar to the hostilities in Ukraine in terms of principal origin, Kosygin said. Ukraine “was deliberately pumped with weapons since 2014. It was trained to fight, and fight particularly against the Russians,” he said. “Unfortunately, similar anti-Russian, and lately anti-Belarussian sentiments have been injected in the same way into the minds of people of Poland and the Baltic states,” he added. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-07-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/558564-ukraine-conflict-first-phase-autumn/,"Sergey Poletaev: By fall, the result of the first phase of the Ukraine conflict will be clear – what comes next is up to the West","Last weekend, the territory of the Lugansk People’s Republic was completely liberated from Ukrainian control. This is not only a symbolic stage in the entire battle for Donbass, but also the completion of a significant military operation: the agglomeration of Rubezhnoye-Severodonetsk-Lisichansk is the second largest after Mariupol among those for which serious fighting has taken place. The results are contradictory. On the one hand, the successes are much more modest than we had hoped for in the spring: the enemy (the Ukrainian Armed Forces) has not been defeated, and the Donetsk group is not completely surrounded. Moreover, there was no attempt at such encirclement. Instead, the Russian army, combined with the forces of the Donbass republics as well as contract soldiers, has adopted the tactic of slowly pushing through defensive lines with a reliance on artillery. This could be called a modern reiteration of the First World War principle: “artillery devastates, infantry floods.” The reason is a shortage of personnel, which is a result of Russia’s refusal to implement mass mobilization. The armies of the Lugansk (LPR) and Donetsk (DPR) People’s Republics, the Wagner militia and the Russian Guard play the role of infantry manpower, but still the density of the advancing ranks is three to five times lower than the normal rule in such situations, which cannot but affect the tempo. The main consequence is the inability of the advancing side to break through the frontline with rapid strikes and encircle the enemy. This enables the Ukrainians to hold a defensive position in a particular settlement to the last man, and then retreat with the most capable units, leaving the poorly trained “meat” of the territorial defense to cover it. The tactic has its flaws: when retreating, heavy equipment has to be partially abandoned, plus there are further losses from artillery and aviation strikes during the retreat itself. On the other hand, Russia is honing and perfecting its assault actions, as can be seen by the pace of the offensive: the smaller of the three towns, Rubezhnoye, was fought over for two months; Severodonetsk was taken in a month, while Lisichansk was seized in a week and a half. Along the way, to the south of Lisichansk, a ring around Gorskoe-Zolotoye was also loosely closed. The Russian command seems to be aware of the problem, so in the first days of July, when the fate of Lisichansk had already been decided, it focused not on creating a tight encirclement ring, but on pushing as far west as possible on the heels of the retreating enemy. As a result, the front came close to the next Ukrainian defensive line: at Seversk-Soledar-Artemovsk (Bakhmut). These are three densely built-up towns, between which there are smaller settlements along a railway and river. The northern end of this line rests on the Seversky Donets River, which is difficult for Russia to cross, while to the south it borders the Ukrainian military’s fortified area, which was established along the line of contact in previous years. This is probably the end of the operation in this area and a pause for rest and reinforcements will follow. So, where will the next major offensive happen? There are several options. First, it is possible to have success in the northern part of the DPR by breaking through and dissecting the aforementioned Seversk-Artemovsk line. Second, it is feasible to move from Izyum and Bogorodichnoe to the rear of Slaviansk-Kramatorsk, the last major stronghold of Ukrainians in this area. The Russian Armed Forces created a good bridgehead here in April and May on the southern bank of the Seversky Donets. Kiev’s forces understand the vulnerability of their position and are constantly harassing the Russian forces with sabotage actions, facilitated by the dense Izyum forests. Thirdly, the constant shelling of Donetsk itself is forcing Moscow, and its partners, to act here in the first place. The goal is to move the front line at least 20-30 kilometers away from the city, beyond the range of the main mass of artillery. So far, Russia has had little success in this direction: back in the spring, the front line was squeezed, and a bridgehead was created to the north of Donetsk, near Verkhnetoretskoye, while to the south of the city, a similar foothold in Marinka had to be abandoned. Fourth, the Kherson-Nikolaev area looks tempting, where the Ukrainians have comparatively few forces and the main prize (the city of Nikolaev) is just a stone’s throw away. What about the enemy? Right now, the Ukrainian army is completely incapable of offensive action – despite constant talk of an imminent counterattack – but as weapons are accumulated and mobilized reservists are trained, it may try to seize the initiative. The north of Kherson Region and the city of Kherson itself appear to be the most preferable areas for Kiev to mount such an operation. So far, all previous attempts to attack have failed for the Ukrainians, but the weakness and stretching of Russian troops in Kherson Region (about 20 kilometers per battalion-tactical group) offer a chance to create a local advantage in this direction and a headache for Moscow’s forces. Another operational area is the northern Kharkov Region, where Kiev is trying to push the front line away from the city and Russia is trying to prevent Ukrainian troops from reaching the border. It is in this sector where the most frequent shelling of Russian territory takes place; the first casualties were recently reported in Belgorod. When attempting an offensive, Ukraine will face the same problems as Russia, only on a much larger scale. Kiev has a slight advantage in infantry, but the backbone of land warfare, artillery, is severely lacking, with Western supplies estimated not to cover even a fraction of the losses. This precludes rapid breakthroughs, while the slow pace allows Russia to promptly pull up its artillery and stop the crisis. The total superiority of Russia in aviation further exacerbates the issue. However, even the current supplies of Western high-precision artillery, combined with Western intelligence, are enough to bombard Russian rear areas. For example, the number of arms depots successfully hit by the Ukrainian army is growing – a weak, but tangible, response to Russia’s daily “re-setting” of Kiev’s supplies. In the absence of tangible victories, Kiev once again must limit itself to virtual overtures. It must be said that Moscow is playing along. For example, on June 30, Russia evacuated Snake Island, which had been taken on the first day of the special operation. The small territory was a vestige of an attempt in February to attack everywhere at once, and it is surprising that Moscow managed to hold it for so long. In fact, the Russian garrison on the island was under constant shelling, and couldn’t control the waters around it: there was no way to deploy the coastal batteries while under fire. The direction of the campaign can be traced until autumn: Russia will continue to retake Donbass, while Ukraine will try to respond with at least one real, rather than virtual, offensive. The results of both will draw a line under the first military campaign. Will this be the end of the fighting, and will a truce follow? Much of this depends on the position of the EU and the US, which do not seem to want to back down and are preparing to face winter in a state of economic war with Russia. But that is a topic for another conversation."
2022-07-07,https://www.rt.com/news/558566-military-advisor-ukraine-ceasefire/,Ukraine could be wiped off the map – former Trump military adviser,"Ukraine could disappear from the map unless the conflict with Russia is resolved peacefully, former Trump military adviser Colonel Douglas Macgregor said in an interview with Sky News Australia on Wednesday. When asked what more could be done to help Ukraine in the ongoing military conflict, Macgregor stated that “the longer this lasts, the more people are going to be needlessly slaughtered, the more damage will be done to Ukraine,” adding that it is now “effectively a failed state, it could be erased completely from the map.” Noting that Ukraine’s military has suffered enormous losses during the conflict and that Russian forces were “by no means overstretched or hurting at this point,” Macgregor argued that “we need a ceasefire” and that countries like Australia should be pushing for it since “no one in Washington is going to do it.” “We can’t afford to fight this until there are no longer any Ukrainians left,” he insisted, noting that he has heard from people in Berlin, Paris, and London that there is growing support for a ceasefire or coming to “some sort of an arrangement” between Moscow and Kiev. The former adviser also commented on the prospects of Russian President Vladimir Putin agreeing to such a ceasefire, noting that he has “never been interested in all of Ukraine,” and that the territory currently under Russia’s control is the “traditional Russian-speaking area.” Macgregor noted that Ukrainian forces which were concentrated in the Donbass region were of “great concern” to Vladimir Putin, who feared these forces “would attack Russia,” and the US would “inevitably deploy theater ballistic missiles there to hold his [Putin’s] nuclear capability at risk.” “He’s not going to withdraw, that’s out of the question,” the former top Pentagon adviser said, suggesting that if the two sides were unwilling to come to some sort of arrangement on a territorial basis, then an armistice should be achieved, lest the conflict grow into a “wider, regional war.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

They added among those killed were three children, with eight also wounded. Officials earlier said a kindergarten had been shelled in Donetsk on Thursday. The authorities reported power outages in the villages of Aleksandrovka and Kremenets after the area was hit by Ukrainian artillery. Pavel Kirilenko, a senior Ukrainian-appointed Donbass official, meanwhile, said that seven civilians were killed by Russian fire in several Ukrainian-held towns on Wednesday. Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of shelling residential areas and killing civilians.

Johnson released a statement last month, saying that “Ukraine is on a knife-edge and we need to tip the balance of the war in their favor.” Johnson was appointed prime minister in 2019 and survived a no-confidence vote in Parliament last month.

2022-07-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/558439-belgorod-target-regular-airstrikes/,"Life in a time of conflict: Locals in the Russia-Ukraine frontier city of Belgorod speak of drones, shelling and ethnic tensions","Belgorod is one of seven Russian regions that border Ukraine. In 2014, it gave refuge to people fleeing from Kharkov, Donetsk, and Lugansk, and in 2022, it did the same all over again. Recently both the city of Belgorod and nearby towns and villages, on the border, have been the target of regular airstrikes. People were evacuated from several settlements, and access to them has been restricted. In the early hours of July 3, four people in Belgorod were killed by an unguided Tochka-U tactical ballistic missile almost certainly fired by Kiev's forces. In a tragic irony, three of the victims were Ukrainians, who had sought refuge in the area to escape the fighting across the frontier. Belgorod’s history has been defined by its status of a border outpost since its foundation in the late 16th century. A surviving record says that in 1596, Tsar Fyodor I, the son of Ivan the Terrible and the last ruler of the Rurik dynasty, ordered “to have the city of Belgorod built on the Seversky Donets, and the city of Oskol built on the Oskol river.” Since February 2022, the Seversky Donets has made more headlines than any other river. The city of Stary Oskol remains one of the key cultural and religious centers in the area. In 1719, Peter the Great had Belgorod upgraded in status. It became the capital city of the eponymous province within the Kievan Governorate of the Russian Empire. Sixty years later, Belgorod and the surrounding territories were split between the Kursk and Voronezh Regions. The end of the 18th century saw Catherine the Great take control of Crimea, thus expanding the empire’s territory. Belgorod at the time lost its status of a border fortress. By the early 20th century, Belgorod had evolved into a major railway hub connecting Sumy and Volchansk (both Ukrainian cities today). In 1918 and 1919, it was occupied by German troops and became part of the Ukrainian State established and ruled by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky who collaborated with Germany and Austria. Later, during WWII, Belgorod was occupied by Nazi Germany twice. The city’s liberation on August 5, 1943, was celebrated with fireworks in Moscow. According to the Russian Statistics Agency, the population of Belgorod Region in 2022 totals about 1.5 million people. This and other facts are part of the program offered by the museum of local lore. On June 13, 2022, some refugees from Ukraine left these comments in the museum’s guest book: “We are now in this beautiful city because of the special military operation. The museum is so inspiring, like a breath of fresh air we haven’t had in a long while.” Air flights to and from Belgorod were cancelled on February 24. The same day, reports came in about the first victims of an air attack. A few days later, another assault followed: multiple calls were made reporting fake bomb threats at public buildings. On March 23, a border village was shelled, leaving three civilians injured. The villages of Zhuravlyovka and Nekhoteyevka were put on high alert. The authorities strongly advised residents to flee. However, about 46 people were still living there as of mid-May 2022 despite the risks, according to Belgorod Region Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov. The shelling of the two villages continued; the number of damaged houses and wounded residents (mostly elderly) grew. Locals reported at least one incident when they had to spend the night hiding in a basement. On May 11, 2022, Ukrainian shelling took the life of 18-year-old Ruslan Nefedov, from the village of Solokhi. A veteran reporter from Belgorod, who is native to the region, talked to RT about what he saw after the shelling. He said that the residents who refused to leave their homes cited a belief that warnings first seemed disproportionate to the threat they faced. One person cited a reluctance to part with the handcrafted agricultural tools they owned. The locals appeared to be equally relaxed about the fire at the oil depot in Belgorod that occurred on April 1. According to Russian officials, it was caused by an attack from a Ukrainian helicopter gunship. The thick black smoke was visible from all parts of the city. People living close to the area were evacuated to other neighborhoods. There were reports of serious traffic congestion close to the burning depot – due to the high number of people wishing to drive closer and capture the incident on video, the reporter told RT. A printing house in Belgorod was also hit in early April. The mother of one resident who talked to us is an employee there and had a lucky escape on the day of the shelling, since she was working from home at the time. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Ukraine fired three unguided Tochka-U missiles with cluster warheads at a residential neighborhood in Belgorod in the early hours of July 3. The city of Kursk also came under fire. Tu-143 Reis drones rigged with explosives were used in that attack. The city’s missile defense systems intercepted all the rockets, yet one damaged rocket crashed into a residential building in Belgorod. The governor reported four people killed and four injured, including a child. As mentioned above, three of the deceased were Ukrainian citizens – locals said they were a family from Kharkov waiting for the hostilities to end. Over 60 private houses and apartment buildings were damaged. The Defense Ministry emphasized that there were no military targets close to the damaged area and that “the missile attack was planned and carried out to harm the civilian population of the Russian cities.” In early March, Russia opened humanitarian corridors to Belgorod for Ukrainians willing to leave Sumy and Kharkov located about 80km away. Prior to the beginning of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, Belgorod had been accepting refugees from Lugansk and Donetsk for some time, due to increased tensions there, much in the same way as back in 2014. Residents of Belgorod told RT that many Russian-speaking people from Kharkov and places around it arrived. One couple said they were stopped by armed Ukrainian police who would only speak Ukrainian. They replied to them in Russian, which prompted a demand to speak Ukrainian. When they obeyed, however, the officers beat them up for faulty pronunciation while bystanders stood and watched. The couple decided to leave the country and now they say they aren’t sure they’d want to return to Kharkov in the future. Many Belgorod residents have extended family in and around Kharkov, and there are several Ukrainian-speaking settlements there. The Belgorod Region as an administrative entity was established in 1954 by Soviet authorities who at the time weren’t particularly mindful of linguistic or nationality aspects. Until the 2014 Western-backed Maidan, Belgorod residents were in the habit of visiting Kharkov on holiday and for better shopping opportunities. Yet somehow it happened that Kharkov has become an unsafe place for ethnic Russians in post-Soviet Ukraine. On the one hand, Kharkov was a lot less radical than Lviv or Ivano-Frankovsk, yet on the other hand, the overall mood there was very different from that in Lugansk or Donetsk, where people supported Russia. Kharkov, where contact between all things Russian and Ukrainian became so intense, evolved into a breeding ground for some radical groups. Andrey Biletsky, the former leader of the infamous Azov Battalion (banned in Russia) was born there. In mid-April 2022, when the governor of Belgorod Region visited a refugee center, it sheltered a total of 107 Ukrainians: 58 from Izyum and 49 from Kharkov. Founded by Tsar Alexis of Russia in the 17th century, Kharkov was the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic for a brief period of time, until 1934. The Kharkov Polytechnic Institute was established in 1885 with help of chemist Dmitry Mendeleev. The institute supplied a qualified work force for the Shebekino Chemical Plant, which was established after World War II and manufactured household chemicals and laundry detergents for the entire Soviet Union. Today, Shebekino is only seven kilometers from the border with Ukraine. The town’s population is estimated at 40,000 people. An elderly man, who has worked as a driver at the chemical plant his entire life, described to RT the dynamics between Shebekino and Volchansk. Just 15 kilometers separates one town from the other. Since February 24, Volchansk has been under Russian control. “The Volchansk Meat Processing Plant was established before the Revolution. Many Shebekino residents used to take the train to Volchansk, but local shopkeepers weren’t always happy about it. Some even refused to sell their merchandise to anybody from Shebekino. Others went as far as closing their doors. ‘Look, the Chinese are here again,’ they used to say in Volchansk about their neighbors from Shebekino [a reference to a stereotype about Chinese tourists buying everything they can on trips abroad – RT]. Now that the border is open, the tables have turned and people from ravaged Volchansk take trips to Shebekino to shop for groceries and soap.” When asked about the situation in Shebekino, the man shrugs: “It’s always boom, boom from the other side, time and again. I’ve had quite enough of this.” Yuri Trofimov, editor-in-chief of the Shebekino newspaper Krasnoye Znamya, told RT: “We even have several Ukrainian-speaking villages, and a lot of people with Ukrainian surnames. We have strong family ties with Kharkov, which is also full of Russian speakers. Of course, everyone wants this to end as soon as possible.” Reporting on the assistance provided to Kharkov refugees, the region’s governor said in early July that “25 tons of transformer oil have been delivered to restore power supply in the Kupyansk, Izyum, and Balakleya districts of Kharkov Region... Balakleya was especially struggling, since the substation that powered the entire town had been destroyed almost a month ago. Thanks to our joint efforts, more than 20,000 people got power in their homes, and, most importantly, the critical infrastructure is now operational. “When I came here 18 months ago, I heard people say that Belgorod had always been Kharkov’s backyard. It made me wince every time. I felt like it should be the other way around,” Gladkov said in early June. People in Belgorod, who are not so much frightened as tired, have also had to put up with attacks on their peace of mind through fake news. For example, at one point, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were reported to have “occupied” Elementary School No. 2 in Sereda, a border town in Belgorod Region. It turned out, however, that there was no elementary school of that number there, only a kindergarten. Another fake report claimed that tap water in Belgorod Region was infected with cholera. School children in Shebekino initially spent a short time learning remotely, and then continued to study full-time in class. All the students had to take the final Unified State Exam in one school “that was the farthest from the Ukrainian border, while the truth was that it was perhaps a hundred meters farther than the other one,” locals told RT. “We hear explosions every night. Everyone is used to it by now,” Alina, a student from Belgorod Pedagogical College says. “The college management said that we’ll stop studying full-time only if the building gets hit. But even then, there’s a greenhouse, and if the college is bombed, classes may continue there,” she added. A military field hospital was once again set up in Shebekino, almost 80 years since WWII, when one functioned here in the summer of 1943. There is a small cemetery in the town for the soldiers who “died of their wounds” in the 1940s. These days, the town has three more memorial plaques honoring those who died “in the line of duty” during the 2022 military offensive. They were installed reverently in one of the town squares and are dedicated to Sergeant Dovydok (born in 1985), Corporal Brazhnik (born in 1999) and Corporal Nemytov (born in 1991). The local park is full of soldiers. Some say they are from the Amur Region in the Far East. Saleswomen, who sell mineral water to the soldiers, tell us that they have also become used to the whole thing: “The explosions used to start every night at midnight or a little after. Sometimes, shelling occurred during the day. Yet by mid-June, it got quieter. Before that, planes were circling over the town, flying really low. However, none of that stopped the urban improvement project that had been under way in the town and the surrounding area since February. Some people left when hostilities began. Some went to Belgorod, others went as far as Krasnodar {in the south of Russia}. But there is no point. If it gets you, it will get you anywhere.” A taxi driver, a veteran of the Second Chechen Campaign who RT was able to talk to on the way from Shebekino to Belgorod, is convinced that the Ukrainian side had been preparing for the conflict for a long time. This view is shared by local journalists and people living near the border. One of them, Nikolay Polishchuk, tells a story that is impossible to corroborate: in early winter, long before February 24, Ukrainian troops that had amassed near the border and were allegedly testing Western-made equipment during the night, including some NATO Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UVA). One of the drones unexpectedly changed its trajectory and crashed. The search in the snow continued for several hours. The soldiers were swearing in perfect Russian. Long before that, in the fall of 2021, local journalists reported activity on the Ukrainian side of the border, where soldiers provoked Russian border guards, shouted insults from afar, and even ran naked along the border. Alexey Nezhdanov, a Belgorod writer who spoke to RT said: “To be honest, it surprised me that people in Belgorod were so prepared for all this. Maybe it’s because we live near the border. It’s a fact that people in local villages are very peace loving. But now they have learned to tell an incoming from an outgoing [strike – RT] by the mere sound it makes. They can even tell what exactly it is: Iskander, air-to-surface, or Grad rockets... There is an active volunteer movement in the city and the region: people raise money to buy drones for soldiers, send them food and support them in any way they can. Local social media groups that help the Russian Armed Forces number thousands, and in some cases even tens of thousands, of members from all over Russia.” Some names have been changed to protect people's identities."
2022-07-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/555091-international-fracture-india-russia-cooperation/,Multi-polar world: Why the current crisis is bringing India and Russia even closer,"The Ukraine crisis has exposed a dramatic shift in the structure of international relations. This manifests itself in the acceleration of Russia’s shift towards Asia and in the divergence of interests between major powers. The breakdown is a symptom of a more fundamental process: A rift in mutual understanding. Something that is not a phenomenon restricted to the current year. Although we can hardly determine the commencement date – due to its blurred and volatile nature – the symptoms are visible. Sanctions policies, trade wars, controversies around Covid-19, protectionism, Iran and North Korea's nuclear issues, and the US withdrawal from Afghanistan are just a few examples of a world in a state of turmoil. The current crisis has only accelerated the widening gap and the growing misunderstanding. The new landscape necessitates a certain self-reflection and a reassessment of the values and principles of cooperation on different levels. At least this is how it seems from Moscow. However, the fact that similar signals are visible in other parts of the world is suggestive that the issues of reconfiguration are very relevant. This situation was well reflected by Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue. While countering criticism over New Delhi’s stance, he emphasized that the current crisis could be a “wake-up call” for Europe to also look at things that have been happening in Asia for ten years. This is a reflection to the state of somnambulism which is characterized by neglecting the crises in Asia and misunderstanding the national interests of the Global South. For example, it is now shown that the position of Western countries towards India amounts to “you are either with us, or against us.” Such a stance looks especially unfounded, given that for the first two months of the Ukrainian crisis the EU countries accounted for more than 70% of Russian fossil fuels exports, and the share of the US imports surpasses India’s. Moreover, it seems that Western attitudes show a lack of understanding of India’s role in the international arena and the history of the country’s development. After gaining its independence, the political culture of India was based on three pillars: The quest for a bigger political and economic status, the principle of neutrality, and the attempts to take and extend its moral stance as a voice of the post-colonial world whenever possible. The balanced policy stance was clearly marked by Jawaharlal Nehru even before the country's independence and eventually macro-objectives of this foreign policy became a matter of national consensus. On the international stage, this attitude was institutionalized in the Non-Aligned movement and, after the collapse of the bi-polar system, was modified in “multi-alignment.” Indeed, India’s policy from time to time showed some convergence with the USA and the USSR but it endeavored to counterbalance the positions of the countries. Notwithstanding conceptual modifications, the essence of the foreign policy remained intact: India is pursuing its well-balanced position and explicitly expresses the interests of developing countries. In general, this policy safeguarded functional, co-existential, and existential national interests of the country at that time. The core of the functional aspect is durable economic growth that was firstly oriented on the domestic market. At the end of the century, reforms on liberalization added an external dimension to this element. Despite some socio-economic obstacles, the results for now are obvious: India has become one of the major economic powers. The developmental pattern can be expressed as an interplay between the principles and interests of India’s national policy. For many in India, America’s policy was considered harmful towards the three above-mentioned dimensions. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and a difficult-to-predict sanctions policy towards Iran from two successive administrations are clear examples. Despite the fact that India and the US tried to calibrate their positions on Chabahar port and oil imports, the restrictions imposed added a factor of uncertainty, which halted economic and connectivity cooperation and hurt energy security, which is a matter of high relevance to India’s economy. Due to the fact that the current crisis does not send signals of attempts to reach mutual understanding, the only way to reassess the values is to find new goal-oriented ways and sources of cooperation. This would also be true for Russia, which is seeking Asian directions for economic interaction. It may also refer to India, which will receive political and economic benefits by being a mediator between the countries and gaining financial benefits from more lucrative deals and an increased role as an economic hub. One of the key areas of time-tested cooperation between Russia and India is a military sphere which has endured the test of time. For example, India’s military imports were a lifeline for the Russian sector after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But due to the fact that the overall commodities turnover is about $12 billion and contributes only 1.3% of the total trade, there is still room for improvement. Despite low dependence on agriculture imports, which is declining due to growing domestic production, Russia traditionally plays an important role in India’s access to edible oil and fertilizers. At the same time, the Russian Federation understands that with the course of the crisis, India is taking a more export-oriented position. This does not necessarily mean a conflict of interests. First of all, despite rather large grain reserves, the country is not immune to climate anomalies, especially heat waves, cyclones and floods. Secondly, domestic consumption will ensure the need for grains, oil, fodder (given the extensive growth of livestock) and other products in a mid-term perspective. Low-price transactions make this field of cooperation even more attractive. Thirdly, mutually beneficial partnership can be extended to other countries where there is a huge need to ensure food security. For example, in the case of Bangladesh, it will help to “mitigate” occasional tensions with India over migration. India is now pursuing energy transition initiatives that aim to increase the proportion of renewables. The key aspect here is the government’s commitment to ensure the country’s energy security, while the role of conventional sources of energy won’t be subject to a sharp decline. In this regard, Russia can become a profitable partner in the case of coal, gas and oil supplies. Such cooperation would avoid external risks, which partly caused last year’s coal crisis and energy shortage in certain states, yielding the possibility of a discount deal that would bring financial profits. A one dollar increase in the cost of a barrel of oil would take from the national budget more than one billion dollars. That is why India has placed orders on Russian oil that amounted to twice as much as it purchased in 2021 and is now increasing the share in the Sakhalin-1 project. Moreover, taking into account the smooth increase of gas shares which is supported by initiatives like “One Nation, One Gas Grid” – collaboration in the energy sector is highly beneficial for both sides. What often remains outside is that Russia can provide support for India’s energy transition initiatives. Firstly, the construction of small hydro stations in Uttarakhand, Arunachal-Pradesh, Himachal-Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir will help to eliminate energy shortages. Secondly, joint works in the sphere of nuclear power proved to be effective not only in India, but also in other countries – look at Rooppur Power Plant as an example. The relevance of energy multilateral regional projects (like Nepal-Bhutan-Bangladesh) will only increase. Many bilateral projects will require a boost in logistical infrastructure. For a long time, cooperation between India and Russia in the field of connectivity progressed very gently. Now, they are being put high on the agenda. First of all, the development of the North-South and Chennai-Vladivostok transport corridors are being updated and the joint implementation of them will ensure higher stability of supplies. Russia is now intensifying negotiations with Iran, the country that can be a “fulcrum” for many trade items. This will not only benefit the infrastructural development of Russian regions and increase bilateral trade. It can also become India’s gate to Central Asia, which is part of the “extended neighborhood.” However, the level of India’s trade there lags far behind not only the indicators of Russia and China. It is also far behind trade levels with other parts of the neighborhood. Bilateral trade with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) each account for more than 11 per cent of India’s total trade. Meanwhile, the trade level with Central Asia is more than 50 times lower. In theory, this project will increase India's position in the region and may become a “counter balance” to China's active economic policy, which is largely a cause for concern for the leaders of the Central Asian countries. What is also important is that the INSTC will be an alternative route to Europe with which India has recently signed a connectivity partnership agreement and which is also highly dependent on Chinese goods. With the increased focus on the Indo-Pacific, the Chennai-Vladivostok maritime corridor is also becoming very important. India does not see this conceptual framework as a strategy or as a club of limited members. The country is seeking to prevent any single power from dominating the region or its waterways. Thus there is a possibility to boost connectivity projects in order to increase bilateral trade and the roles of India and Russia in the region. Simultaneously, if India can be an alternative in Central Asia, Russia’s increased role can also be positively perceived in South-East Asia. In fact, the potential for cooperation is not limited to the above areas and can be realized in areas ranging from heavy industry to disaster-resilience infrastructure and smart city initiatives. The Russian position was well expressed by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to India Today. “With India, we supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s concept of ‘Make in India’. We started substituting the simple trade with local production, shifting production of the goods needed by India on their territory,” he said. In conclusion, in difficult times, the ability to find common interests and develop mutually-beneficial practice-oriented projects is particularly pertinent. This is how friendship is tested. At the same time, the Russian government understands that India will pursue its own national interests and “eternal friendship” does not exist in foreign policy. If earlier relations between countries were not always supposed to have a strong economic foundation, now things are changing. The Soviet-India strategic partnership arose because the countries had sought to find common interests. Nowadays, economic relations have become more relevant and the countries need to rediscover points of common interest in the economic sphere and develop particular models of cooperation. In order for them to become the hallmark of India-Russia cooperation, there is a huge need for political will from both sides, which derives from the history of our friendship and the principle of mutual respect."
2022-07-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/558507-medvedev-bible-apocalyptic-warning/,Medvedev quotes Bible to Russia’s critics,"Russia’s former president, Dmitry Medvedev, has warned against any attempt to establish an international tribunal of sorts over the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev. Those promoting such ideas have no moral right to do so, and might ultimately face the “wrath” of God should they persist in their desire to “judge” the country, he said on Wednesday in a social media post. “Who’s been screaming that it is necessary to set up a court over Russia and involve supranational bodies for this? Who is this daredevil or idiot?” Medvedev wrote, saying that it’s never a good idea to threaten a major nuclear power like Russia that way. “This high priest is known to everyone,” he added, referring to the US. “And he worked very hard to sow chaos and destruction all over the world under the guise of the notorious ‘true democracy’.” Moreover, Washington doesn’t have the moral right to judge anyone, let alone Russia, given the lengthy record of its “bloody wars of destruction” throughout its whole history, he pointed out. The US has excelled in imposing “its will crudely and primitively, using money, spineless vassals, – called ‘allies’ for the sake of decency – and weapons of the highest quality,” he added. What tribunal condemned the sea of blood shed by the US [in Vietnam] and in other places? Nobody! No supranational body was created for these purposes. But the number of victims of the criminal policy of the US today is comparable to the [number of] victims of the Hitler regime. While the US has been “killing people with impunity,” it has never faced any “real condemnation” from the “international structures it funds,” he said, concluding his post with an apocalyptic warning. The US and its worthless lapdogs must remember the words of the Scripture: ‘Judge not, that ye not be judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged’ (Mt. 7:1–2). ‘For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can withstand it?’(Rev. 6:17) The talk about establishing an international tribunal of sorts over alleged ‘war crimes’ said to be committed by Russian troops in Ukraine intensified last week, when the matter was brought up during a UN security council meeting joined by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky via a video link. Zelensky accused Moscow of deliberately targeting civilians, and reiterated his call for Russia to be declared a “terrorist state” and expelled from both the council and the UN. Zelensky’s calls were supported by Poland, Estonia, and the UK, yet no mechanism to dismiss a permanent member of the UNSC even exists, while Moscow holds veto power in it. Russia has denied any accusations of targeting civilians, instead accusing Kiev of using such tactics. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/558502-movement-ban-ukraine-lifted/,Zelensky speaks out on restricting rights of citizens,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has responded to his military's controversial announcement on restricting the movement of citizens, by instructing that this order had to be canceled as “mistakes should be corrected.” On Tuesday, Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Valery Zaluzhny announced that all men between 18 and 60 liable for military service had to obtain permission from the local recruitment office if they wanted to leave their registered area. The following day, following widespread criticism and a reprimand from the president, the order was canceled. “We sorted it out and reviewed the details of yesterday’s decision. The decision must be reversed,” Zelensky said at a press briefing on Wednesday, adding that “the details show that the decision was wrong.” He stressed that there was “no misunderstanding” between him and the military. “There is a war on. We must work as one team. This is how we work. If there is any inconsistency, then these mistakes must be corrected. They are small compared to the strength which our state, the Ukrainian people, and the Armed Forces demonstrate,” Zelensky said. Soon after the publication of Zaluzhny’s order on Tuesday, Yevgenia Ryabeka, the coordinator of the movement of lawyers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, admitted that the wording of the document could be “a little incomprehensible.” She clarified that obtaining permission for moving around the country was necessary only for men who wanted to change their place of residence and their registration, while anyone else could travel around the country without additional authorization. Despite these reassurances, Zaluzhny’s order immediately became the target of harsh criticism. Member of parliament Roksolana Pidlasa took to Facebook to condemn the “nonsense,” which, in her opinion, could have severe consequences. “The decision that without the permission of the military commission men (and soon women) cannot leave their city of residence is nonsense that will cause a social explosion and the collapse of the economy,” she claimed. On Tuesday evening, Zelensky addressed the matter, asking the military to not make decisions like this in the future without consulting him. He also pledged to sort this matter out. On Wednesday afternoon, following a meeting with the president, Zaluzhny announced that yesterday’s decision had been canceled. He stressed that the order “did not create obligations or restrictions on the rights and freedoms of citizens of Ukraine.” However, the commander did admit it “caused numerous manipulations, misreadings and even illegal actions to prevent the movement of citizens,” which threatened to discredit the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Since the launch of the Russian military offensive at the end of February, men aged from 18 to 60 have been banned from leaving the territory of Ukraine."
2022-07-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/558508-yanukovych-ukraine-tough-choice/,Ex-president says Ukrainians face tough choice,"Former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych has called on his fellow Ukrainians to decide if they wanted to return to peaceful life or continue to fight. In a written address to the Ukrainian people that was posted on Facebook by his press secretary on Tuesday, the former Ukrainian leader said that “an adequate assessment of the situation” in the country was required now more than ever. “Ukrainian citizens themselves must make a choice — should they fight ‘until the last Ukrainian’, or save what is left? It is important to give everyone who has constructive ideas the opportunity to speak and to give peace a chance,” he said, adding that this would save many Ukrainian lives. Yanukovych also called the incumbent Ukrainian authorities inexperienced, opportunistic, and untrustworthy. “There can be no talk of any unconditional trust in [the Ukrainian government] … But the constant lies by the authorities only accelerate their downfall, exacerbate the situation … They threaten the future of the Ukraine that we know and love,” he said. The former president also urged Kiev to show tolerance towards Ukrainians that do not share its views. “The leadership of Ukraine must, before it is too late, stop dividing Ukrainians into the ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ ones,” he stressed. Yanukovych also believes that Ukrainians do not trust their current government because they have been deceived by both their leaders and their Western allies. He also noted that his post-coup successor, Petro Poroshenko, confessed that Kiev never intended to abide by the Minsk agreements, which were meant to end the conflict in the country. In 2014, following violent riots in Kiev, Yanukovych, the democratically-elected president, was ousted from power. The aftermath of the coup d’etat was marred by a crackdown on opposition and a deadly conflict in eastern Ukraine."
2022-07-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/558498-ukraine-investigators-humanitarian-aid-corruption/,Ukraine alarmed over Western humanitarian and military aid,"Ukraine’s Financial Investigations Service says it has uncovered numerous cases where humanitarian and even military aid provided by the West has been appropriated and sold at a profit inside the country. Appearing on the TV news channel Ukraina 24 on Tuesday, the head of the investigative body, Vadim Melnik, lamented that “even goods destined for the military are being realized for money,” adding that his subordinates had “ascertained such facts.” The official went on to reveal that the service had launched around ten criminal probes in connection with the sale of humanitarian or military aid. According to Melnik, the true number of such cases is likely higher, as other Ukrainian law enforcement branches are also uncovering such crimes. “We need to set clear control algorithms of both arrival, distribution as well as the use of aid, which our international partners are giving us today,” the head of the Financial Investigations Service argued. Previously, Ukraine’s Prosecutor General’s office had reported multiple cases of misuse of Western humanitarian and military aid. Last month, RT spoke with an American volunteer, Andy Huynh, who had fought for Ukraine before surrendering to Russian forces. He claimed, among other things, that the “commanders were very corrupt and troops were very ill-prepared and supplied” in the ‘International Legion’ he had served in. Another US volunteer told journalists back in May that corruption was rampant in units made up of foreign fighters, “with basic equipment going missing.” “There’ll be weapons with no ammo, or no body armor or medical kit,” he explained."
2022-07-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/558495-kremlin-kneissl-death-threats/,Kremlin alarmed by death threats to former Austrian FM,"The Kremlin says the death threats made to former Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl must serve as “a wake-up call.” “As far as we are aware, she has indeed been subjected to persecution, ‘canceling’, and so on,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. “Completely unbearable conditions have been created for her,” Peskov added. “It’s a wake-up call for a society that is capable of such [mistreatment].” Kneissl, who served as foreign minister between 2017 and 2019, told the Washington Post on Tuesday that she had to leave Austria due to death threats. In May, she stepped down from the board of directors of Russian state oil giant Rosneft. Many countries, including EU members, imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia after it sent troops into Ukraine in late February. The Freedom Party of Austria (FPO), which nominated Kneissl for the ministerial post, has long been accused of having pro-Russian leanings. The party denies this claim. Kneissl’s wedding in 2018 made international headlines after Russian President Vladimir Putin attended the ceremony in Austria as a guest and waltzed with Kneissl. She has also written opinion pieces for RT, the last of which was published on January 31."
2022-07-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/558494-putin-schedule-g20-summit/,Putin will participate in G20 – Moscow,"Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to participate in the upcoming summit of G20 leaders in Indonesia, but how he does so will depend on the Covid-19 pandemic situation, the Russian Foreign Ministry indicated on Wednesday. A statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry said it received an invitation from Indonesia addressed to Putin, and sent preliminary confirmation that he will take part in the gathering in Bali. “The format of his participation is subject to clarification depending on the development of the situation in the world and the sanitary-epidemiological environment in Southeastern Asia,” the ministry added. Last week, the Italian prime minister claimed that the office of Indonesian President Joko Widodo ruled out Putin’s attendance. “President Widodo excludes it. He was categorical: He’s not coming,” Draghi said, suggesting that the Russian leader would join via videolink instead. Russia responded to the remark, stating that it’s not up to Italy to decide on how the summit is organized. Western nations have been pushing to isolate Russia diplomatically since it attacked Ukraine in late February. At international events, officials representing the US and its allies have tended to shun their Russian counterparts. The G20 summit is perceived by many political observers as a challenge for Western leaders, considering that Russia is a member of the economic forum. Many other members of the group, including China and India, have refused to join the US-led anti-Russian campaign, and some have openly criticized America’s policies regarding Ukraine. Widodo visited Russia last Thursday to meet with Putin."
2022-07-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/558475-russia-drone-gun-ukraine/,Russia tests anti-drone gun in Ukraine – media,"Russia has successfully tested its Stupor electromagnetic weapon against Ukrainian drones, the news agency TASS reported on Wednesday, citing a source familiar with the program. The field trial was the first for the device against an actual enemy, the agency said. Stupor is an electromagnetic projector that aims to disrupt a drone’s communication with its operator. This interferes with the mission of the targeted aircraft by rendering it unable to take commands or send back intelligence. The drone may simply fall to the ground or be hijacked afterwards. A robotics research center of the Russian Defense Ministry presented the device during an arms show in 2017. It said the futuristic-looking device was effective at a range of up to 2km, as long as the target was not obstructed. TASS said it was not able to learn where exactly the devices were tested, with the source only stating it was in the western part of the Donetsk People’s Republic. RT Russian spoke to the designer of the electromagnetic weapon, Dmitry Klochko, who said his firm delivered a total of 10 anti-drone guns to Donbass militias. He said some of them were gifts while others were sponsored by private donors. The feedback was quite positive, he said. The weapons designer said he had previously received requests for Stupor from the Russian military. Russian soldiers deployed in Syria reportedly used them to shut down primitive drones employed by Syrian militants against them. In May, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov claimed that an anti-drone laser weapon had been field-tested against Ukraine. He said it was nicknamed Zadira, or ‘Troublemaker’ in Russian, but offered few details about it."
2022-07-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/558492-ukraine-max-militarization-achieved/,Ukraine achieves ‘maximum militarization’ – official,"Ukraine has reached the state of “maximum militarization” in recent months, the country’s top security official says Around a million Ukrainians are gaining “combat and military” experience in the conflict with Russia, Alexey Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, has claimed. “In [four] months, maximum militarization took place instead of demilitarization,” Danilov wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “Ukraine is rapidly rearming according to NATO standards. Our Defense Forces are constantly accumulating and being saturated with Western weapons and technologies.” He also added that about a million Ukrainians “[are getting] combat and military experience.” Danilov was apparently referring to a speech Russian President Vladimir Putin gave in late February in which he explained the rationale for Russia’s military campaign. The president listed the “demilitarization” of Ukraine as one of the aims of the offensive in the neighboring country.

2022-07-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/558482-himars-destroyed-russia-donbass/,Russia says it destroyed American HIMARS in Ukraine,"Russian forces destroyed two US-made rocket launchers in Donbass, the defense ministry said on Wednesday. The US provided Kiev with eight High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and ammunition since the beginning of the Russian military offensive in Ukraine, according to a Pentagon fact sheet published on Tuesday. “In the area of the settlement of Malotaranovka in the Donetsk People's Republic, high-precision air-launched missiles destroyed two US-made HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems and two ammunition depots for them,” the Russian military said in a statement. At the end of June, the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR) said that an М142 HIMARS had been used by Ukrainian forces in Donbass, the first time that local authorities reported the US-supplied systems had been used in combat. Prior to that, the chief of Ukraine’s General Staff, Valery Zaluzhny, posted a video, purporting to show pro-Kiev forces operating the long-range rocket system. On June 23, Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov welcomed the arrival of HIMARS and expressed gratitude to his “American colleague and friend Lloyd Austin (the Pentagon chief) for these powerful tools.” “Summer will be hot for Russian occupiers. And the last one for some of them,” he wrote on Twitter. Russia has constantly warned the US and its allies against providing Ukraine with weapons saying that it would only lead to the prolongation of the conflict and the creation of long-term problems. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said on Tuesday that some of the foreign weapons intended for Ukraine were spreading throughout the Middle East and are turning up on the black market. The Russian military also made it clear that any foreign arms on Ukrainian territory would be considered legitimate targets. Late last month G7 countries pledged to provide support to Ukraine in all possible forms “for as long as it takes.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-07-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/558470-borrell-russia-war-sanctions/,EU doesn’t want war with Russia – top diplomat,"The European Union does not want a war with Russia, the bloc’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said, adding that economic pressure remains the key instrument in countering Moscow’s “aggression” in Ukraine. Writing for the Japanese outlet Yomiuri, the EU’s foreign policy chief said that the six packages of sanctions imposed on Moscow by the EU since late February have demonstrated that the bloc “can respond as Europe when provoked.” “The EU does not want a war with Russia, and economic sanctions are central to its response to the aggression,” Borrell wrote. Pointing out that the restrictions currently target about 1,200 individuals and 98 organizations in Russia, he claimed that they “have already begun to take effect and will increase further in the coming months.” “As far as advanced technology is concerned, Russia depends 45% on Europe and 21% on the United States. Only 11% for China,” he claimed, adding that the sanctions also limit the production capacity of precision missiles, which are being used in Ukraine. Borrell also mentioned automobile manufacturing, aviation and oil industries as the most affected by the sanctions. In Borrell’s opinion, one of “many miscalculations” Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly made was that he “probably thought that Europe was dependent on energy and would not have the courage to impose sanctions.” The top EU diplomat admitted that the measures taken against Moscow have also brought “serious difficulties to many EU member states and some sectors of the economy.” “But this is the price to pay to protect democracies and international law, and we are taking the necessary steps to address these issues in full solidarity,” he stressed. Meanwhile, back in April, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused the EU of devolving to the level of “NATO’s economic relations department.” She said this in response to Borrell’s tweet that the Ukrainian conflict “will be won on the battlefield.” Since the end of February, EU countries have been actively supplying Ukraine with weapons, despite multiple warnings from Russia that this would only prolong the conflict. Commenting in mid-June on the economic sanctions against Moscow, Putin called them “insane and thoughtless.” However, the Western attempts to “strike industry, finance and the standard of living of the people” have failed, the Russian president said. Previously, he accused European leaders of sacrificing their own economies to bolster Ukraine’s war effort, claiming that they were committing economic “suicide” under “pressure from their American overlord.”"
2022-07-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/558474-russia-compensation-covid-us/,US should pay compensation if Covid-19 claim confirmed – Russia,"The US may owe the world huge compensation for the damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the Russian State Duma, said on Wednesday. He cited remarks made by the chair of The Lancet commission on the disease, who suggested the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have originated from an American research program. Speaking in Madrid last month, economist Jeffrey Sachs called the current situation “a mess” and blamed diminishing American leadership for it, identifying the pandemic as one of the US failures. He said he was convinced that the virus “came out of US lab biotechnology” as opposed to evolving naturally, citing his experience with the authoritative British medical journal. Volodin asserted that the US government would not comment on Sachs’ remarks because President Joe Biden is “afraid that the world will know the truth about the true culprit of the pandemic.” He added that the suffering of millions of people who contracted the virus, including the many who passed away, and the economic crisis caused by the pandemic were the US’ responsibility. “The US must compensate the damage to all nations affected,” he demanded. The Russian official added that the US should “stop and declassify” its “military bioweapons research,” referring to the chain of biolabs scattered across the world that receive funding from the Pentagon’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency. The US says they are used to detect emerging pathogens, but some countries, including Russia and China, believe they may be used for clandestine military research. Sachs himself called his remark “provocative” and lamented that the theory “is not being investigated, not in the United States, not anywhere,” despite evidence that warrants such a probe. “They don’t want to look underneath the rug too much,” he said. The theory that Covid-19 started as a leak from a Chinese lab in Wuhan was popularized by the US government under President Donald Trump, who stated that Beijing should pay compensation for its supposed guilt. The Chinese government and Trump’s political opponents at home angrily rejected the idea. Major US tech companies even suppressed the lab leak theory as “disinformation” on their online platforms. The censorship was reversed under President Joe Biden's administration, which accused Beijing of failing to subject its microbiology research to international scrutiny. The outbreak was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which hosts a top biosecurity lab that has extensive records of doing research funded by American grants. The World Health Organization conducted a probe into the origins of Covid-19 and concluded last February that the virus most likely came from an animal host."
2022-07-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/558414-anti-corruption-ukraine-reform-conference/,Ukraine’s endemic corruption problems are suddenly forgotten as hungry Western investors smell ‘reconstruction’ profits,"The annual Ukraine Reform Conference has, since 2017, brought together Western officials and their local 'civil society' foot soldiers to discuss ways that Ukraine can reduce its rampant corruption. But this year, before getting underway this week in Lugano, Switzerland, it underwent a name change to the Ukraine Recovery Conference. Perhaps drawing attention to the existence of the country’s endemic corruption isn’t convenient for those looking to avoid heavy criminal penalties set up to explicitly prevent investment that fuels corruption? Simply changing the marketing of the conference does nothing to alter the reality. If anything, it’s counterproductive for Ukraine itself and serves to enable and perpetuate serious systemic problems that prevent the country from progressing. “The authorities are delaying the fulfillment of many important anti-corruption promises,” according to Andrey Borovik, executive director of the Ukraine office of Transparency International, an organization funded by Western governments and multinationals. As for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, “corruption just doesn’t seem to worry Mr. Zelensky much – at least when those implicated are close to him,” claimed Kyiv Independent (another Western funded outfit) editor Olga Rudenko in a guest piece for the New York Times in February, right before the Russian military operation started. Not exactly the kind of guy you’d want overseeing massive investment projects, one would think. These days, tackling corruption is taking a rhetorical backseat to the Western push to frame Ukraine as just your typical European country. “For the last two years, we have been discussing large European values, mostly a theoretical debate,” Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa has said. “Then, suddenly, we realised that those fundamental European values actually exist. And that they are threatened. And that Europeans are defending them. With their lives. In Ukraine.” Despite acknowledging that Ukraine would have to enact “a number of important reforms,” EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that “Ukraine has clearly shown commitment to live up to European values and standards. And embarked, before the war, on its way towards the EU.” In reality, the only thing that has actually changed is that Western officials saw an opening to exploit current public sympathy, if not ignorance, to gain acceptance for an idea that normally would be a much tougher sell to the average EU citizen. That is, the notion that Ukraine would be a net benefit to the bloc rather than an Achilles heel rife with problems that has no business being included in a zone that allows for free movement of people and goods among member states. EU leaders are leading their citizens straight into catastrophe in every imaginable sense through their knee-jerk handling of the conflict itself and now their push to turn the focus to reconstruction even as the bullets are still flying and the corruption rages. Western weapons supplied to Ukraine – and now apparently sold on dark-web marketplaces – are an example of the potentially deadly consequences of ineptitude. Meanwhile, the head of Interpol, Jurgen Stock, has warned EU nations in particular that “the wide availability of weapons during the current conflict will lead to the proliferation of illicit weapons in the post-conflict phase.” Neglecting to place Ukraine’s corruption problem uncompromisingly front and center in order to better peddle the premature public narrative of the need for investment under the guise of ‘reconstruction’ represents a threat to the EU – and one that Western officials are only too happy to facilitate, apparently. One has to wonder why that is. It’s hardly a secret that Western nations have historically leveraged foreign aid to gain economic and political footholds within other countries, either through state-backed programs, civil society funding, or corporate opportunities. But there’s also another catch. Current Western laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in the US, the UK Bribery Act, or the Loi Sapin II in France all create an obligation for any entity or individual investing in foreign countries to ensure a corruption-free transaction. If Western investment in Ukrainian reconstruction ends up in the wrong hands, then board members, employees, and managers could all end up facing criminal charges with penalties of prison. The prosecution of such cases tends to be highly selective, of course. How often do you hear of US entities being prosecuted for dealings in corruption-rife Nigeria, for example? You don’t. Because that is Washington’s stomping ground. The American law has often been used as a tool of selective prosecution against European companies for competitive reasons. This is why other countries have created their own similar rules, largely in the interests of having the legal tools available to jump in to prosecute their own in order to short-circuit American pursuits of foreign competitors. Western entities have an economic interest in portraying Ukraine as a safe place to invest. Otherwise, they’re easy pickings for the authorities of other foreign countries who might choose to use corrupt investment dealings in Ukraine as a means of taking a competitor off the playing field. The first interest of such Western enterprises has always been to sideline Russia as a trading partner for Ukraine and then treat the country like the latest iteration of the Wild West. They aim to get taxpayers back home to fund the venture risk, all the while harboring plans to subsequently compete among themselves for any treasure they find – with the added competitive bonus for Washington of having also weakened the EU by isolating it from Russia. But to get the green light, and to convince the average taxpayer to accept funding the risk, everyone has to make the venture sound benevolent – hence the Marshall Plan comparisons – and reduce any references to corruption to a minor detail."
2022-07-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/558468-west-responsible-civilian-deaths/,West responsible for civilian deaths in Donbass and Ukraine – Moscow,"The West should be aware of its responsibility for the deaths of civilians in both Donbass and Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday. During a press briefing in Vietnam, Lavrov was asked to comment on Kiev’s allegations that Russian forces are shelling their own cities to disrupt the supplies of Western weapons to Ukraine. “Well, in short, they lie,” the foreign minister said. He added that the Russian Defense Ministry presents the real facts on a daily basis, and that the West should acknowledge its own responsibility, “no matter what [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky and his team are saying.” Since the launch of the military operation in Ukraine, Moscow has warned the US and its allies against “pumping up” Ukraine with weapons, saying it will only prolong the conflict and lead to serious long-term problems in the future. Lavrov said the West “must be aware of its responsibility” for the deaths of civilians, as Kiev uses the weapons supplied from abroad as “a means of intimidation. This is state terror.” Earlier this month, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhail Podoliak claimed that Russian forces are shelling their own cities near the Ukrainian border in order “to accuse Ukraine of shelling Russian cities and disrupt the supply of Western weapons.” The Western countries providing Ukraine with weapons have made it clear that the arms should not be used to conduct attacks on Russian territory. Since the launch of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, the sides have accused each other of targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure. On Sunday, the Russian Defense Ministry said that Ukraine launched three Tochka-U ballistic missiles loaded with cluster munitions at the Russian city of Belgorod, killing four people."
2022-07-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/558457-kaliningrad-lithuania-trade-blockade/,Russian governor comments on response to Lithuania’s transit ban,"Russia could completely cut the flow of goods between itself and the Baltic states in response to Lithuania’s ban on the transit of sanctioned goods between the Kaliningrad exclave and the rest of Russia, the region’s governor has said. Anton Alikhanov said he had several proposals on how to deal with Vilnius’ ban on the movement of restricted products. “The most severe response would be a ban on the transit of all goods through the Baltic states,” he told Russian TV channel Rossiya-24 on Tuesday. According to the governor, Moscow could block cargo traveling from Asia to Baltic ports through Russia, as well as the goods entering Russia through those nations. The governor stressed that the measure would be “a serious, perhaps the most extreme response.” Kaliningrad Region is a small Russian exclave that lies between Lithuania and Poland. Last month, Vilnius banned the transit of some goods, including building materials, between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia, citing EU sanctions imposed over the military campaign in Ukraine. Russia blasted the move as illegal and promised to retaliate, while authorities in Kaliningrad scrambled to have the affected goods delivered via the Baltic Sea. Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, argued that Lithuania’s actions were necessary to “control the sanctions.” The region's governor denied that the flow of goods between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia was a way to avoid sanctions. “Europeans should have absolutely no concerns over the Kaliningrad transit. It can’t be used to bypass sanctions. Any statement to the contrary is nonsense,” he told RIA Novosti news agency on Tuesday. Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine reported last week that the EU was planning to allow Russia to resume sending sanctioned goods to Kaliningrad, but only in amounts “comparable” to deliveries before late February, when Moscow sent troops to Ukraine."
2022-07-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/558443-military-operation-ukraine-goals-reach/,Western weapons won't change outcome in Ukraine – security chief,"The arms that the US and its allies continue to send to Ukraine will not have an impact on the outcome of Russia's ongoing military operation, National Security Council Secretary Nikolay Patrushev said at a meeting on Tuesday. Russia’s “goals will be achieved despite the US and the West providing military assistance to Ukraine,” Patrushev, who formerly headed up the country's domestic security service, the FSB, said at a national security meeting in the far-eastern city of Khabarovsk. The official said that the operation was prompted by a whole range of threats that developments in Ukraine “posed not only to Russia’s security but to the whole world.” The Security Council secretary identified the spread of neo-Nazi ideology and the Ukrainian biological laboratories linked to the Pentagon as examples of such threats. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously stated that the operation was launched to “demilitarize” Ukraine and also to protect the people of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, the independence of which Russia recognized in February. Russia was left with no other options to end the years-long bloodshed in Donbass, the president said in March, less than a month after the start of the military action. In late June, Putin said that Russia’s objectives in Ukraine had not changed. The final goal is “to liberate Donbass, to protect these people and to create conditions that would guarantee the safety of Russia itself. That’s it,” he said in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, during his first foreign trip since February. On July 3, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced that Russian forces and the Donbass militias had seized control over the whole territory of the Lugansk People’s Republic. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

The child was torn apart by shrapnel, the grieving family told RT’s Ruptly video news agency. “My granddaughter has been blown into three pieces,” the girl’s grandfather told journalists. “Look there, there is blood everywhere,” he said, pointing to the metallic gates leading to the yard of his house. Pools of blood were still covering the street in the spot where the girl had been hit by the shell’s fragments. “She did not make it home,” the girl’s grandfather added, pointing to the girl’s sneakers, which were lying on the ground near her home’s gate. The girl’s body has already been taken to a morgue. “She and a boy … they were just walking around,” the girl’s mother said. “She sought to run home…” she began, before bursting into tears. The family’s neighbor told reporters she had heard a loud bang and rushed to the street only to find “one girl’s leg lying near a garden plot and another one here, at the gate.” Ukrainian forces were shelling different parts of the capital of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) on Tuesday, the city’s mayor, Aleksey Kuzmin, said in a Telegram post. Several people received shrapnel wounds, Kuzmin said, as he confirmed the girl’s death as well. The child’s identity has not been made public. According to the mayor, the Ukrainian soldiers had used 155mm caliber shells. This caliber is common in NATO artillery systems, while the Russian and Ukrainian artillery pieces usually have a caliber of 152mm. RT could not independently verify which artillery type was used by the Ukrainian forces. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, which were designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/558426-ukraine-communist-party-banned/,Zelensky's court bans another Ukrainian opposition party,"A Ukrainian court on Tuesday banned the country’s Communist Party (CPU), marking the end of an eight-year saga, and adding the communists to the blacklist of 15 allegedly ‘pro-Russian’ political movements that are outlawed in Ukraine. The Eighth Administrative Court of Appeal in the western city of Lviv announced that “the activities of the Communist Party of Ukraine are prohibited.” “Funds and other assets” of the party will be nationalized.Attempts to ban the party started in 2014, when the acting president at the time, Aleksandr Turchinov, ordered a review into the CPU’s activities. He did not rule out the possibility of banning it over its alleged involvement in protests in the eastern parts of the country after the violent Western-backed coup in Kiev overthrew the democratically-elected government. The party was formally outlawed in December 2015 by the District Administrative Court of Kiev. The court ruled that it “performs actions aimed at changing the constitutional order by force, violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, propagating violence, inciting interethnic hatred.” The Justice Ministry’s resolution on non-compliance of symbols and charter of the party with the law was also upheld. The party appealed the verdict and thus the court decision could not enter into force. In May of this year, the court finally completed consideration of the appeal and denied it. Tuesday’s court decision finalized the process.On the same day, along with the Communist Party, the ‘Happy Ukraine’ party was banned. Commenting on the court’s decisions, the Justice Ministry said that, as of today, “the activity of 15 pro-Russian political parties in Ukraine has been banned.” In March, following the launch of Russia’s military operation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky moved to suspend the activities of almost a dozen opposition parties, including the parliament’s second-largest group, Opposition Platform – For Life. All of them are now on the Justice Ministry’s list of banned parties."
2022-07-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/558430-space-agency-satellite-industry-nationalize/,Russia’s space chief speaks out on nationalization,"Russian officials should seize control over companies producing key satellite components like radiation-hardened electronics, the head of the Russian Roscosmos space agency, Dmitry Rogozin, said on Tuesday. Russia is looking to “double” its satellite fleet, Rogozin said during a meeting with the staff of a satellite-manufacturing plant that is part of Roscosmos. Moscow would like to have more satellites providing a variety of services ranging from satellite communications for the Armed Forces to facilitating broadband internet access and “the internet of things,” he said, according to a statement by the space agency. The Roscosmos chief admitted that satellite manufacturing remains “an issue of major concern” due to the lack of certain components, like radiation-hardened microelectronics. “This is our weak link,” Rogozin added, calling on this issue to be resolved. “I would suggest nationalizing these industries and handing them over to Roscosmos and [the Russian State Atomic Agency] Rosatom,” he said. The Kremlin has not commented on Rogozin’s proposal so far. In late February, the Russian space agency chief said Roscosmos might purchase the needed components in China if Western nations added them to the list of sanctioned goods. The space agency admitted as early as June 2021 that US sanctions on selling microelectronics to Russia had hit the nation’s satellite manufacturing industry and disrupted the timely launch of several satellites. Roscosmos has recently seen some of its suppliers refusing to provide components to the Russian side, the space agency’s first deputy head for economy and finances, Maksim Ovchinnikov, told Russia’s Interfax news agency on Tuesday. The US sanctions have barred the agency from accessing some “key technologies,” making it impossible for Roscosmos to fulfill its obligations under several government contracts, he added. The US and its allies responded to Moscow’s decision to launch a military operation in Ukraine in late February by slapping Russia with an unprecedented number of sanctions, targeting its banking and finance sectors, as well as aviation and space industries. In March, a major US space industry conference even censored the name of Yuri Gagarin, a Soviet cosmonaut and the first human in space, explaining it was due to “current world events.” The European Space Agency indefinitely postponed its ExoMars rover mission the same month because of anti-Russian sanctions. The launch of the rover was supposed to be carried out in partnership with Russia and was initially set for later this year."
2022-07-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/558412-zelensky-russia-foothold-europe/,The Russians are coming for Europe – Zelensky,"Russia could use Ukraine as a starting point for attacks on other European states, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said. He asked the West for security guarantees that Ukraine could enjoy while not being a member of the US-led military bloc NATO. “We need a system of security guarantees, which would be effective even while we are not part of the alliance,” Zelensky said on Tuesday at a roundtable hosted by The Economist. “Russia views the territory of our country as a foothold for capturing other European states. Which means, to ensure the security of Ukraine is to provide long-term security for the whole of Europe.” He argued that “gray zones” in European security have made it possible for Russia to send troops to Ukraine. Zelensky mentioned the Budapest Memorandum, a 1994 deal under which Ukraine surrendered its Soviet-era nuclear arsenal in exchange for promises from the US, Britain and Russia that they would “provide assistance” to Ukraine in the case of aggression. The three states also vowed not to attack Ukraine themselves. Zelensky said the guarantees provided under the Budapest Memorandum and similar “assurances” have now “been destroyed.” Russia has repeatedly said that NATO’s expansion has been undermining European security. President Vladimir Putin cited the bloc’s attempts to set up “a foothold” in Ukraine as one of the reasons for military action in the country. Moscow sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/558415-british-embassy-moscow-square/,Moscow trolls UK embassy,"British diplomats stationed in Moscow will now come to work at the UK embassy through a square named after the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR). Mayor Sergey Sobyanin’s office confirmed the move on Tuesday. The UK has been a vocal supporter of Kiev and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned the Ukrainian government against resolving the conflict with Russia with what he termed as a “bad peace.” LPR militias have been fighting alongside Russian troops since the beginning of the offensive in late February. On Sunday, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced that the last remnants of Ukrainian forces had been driven out of the republic. Authorities in Moscow previously renamed a square, where the American embassy is located, after the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). The Mayor’s office had several possible options for a location named after LPR – all of them linked to Western embassies. In an online poll, 57% chose Britain rather than Germany, Lithuania or Belgium. It was not immediately clear if the British embassy’s address will be changed accordingly. It is currently listed as Smolenskaya Naberezhnaya 10, after the closest embankment. In March, UK activists called to rename Kensington Palace Gardens in London, where the Russian embassy is located, in honor of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The local council, however, suggested that Ukraine needed non-symbolic gestures from Britain. A section of Wisconsin Avenue in Washington, DC closest to the Russian embassy in the US was renamed Boris Nemtsov Plaza in 2018. Nemtsov was a Russian opposition politician, who was assassinated in central Moscow in 2015. His killers were found and sentenced to lengthy prison terms, but the person who ordered the hit was never identified. The US embassy in Moscow has removed its old address from its website, but without indicating the new ‘DPR Square’ address"
2022-07-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/558404-weapons-shoigu-market-east/,Russia warns West about fate of weapons sent to Ukraine,"Some of the weapons sent by the West to Ukraine have failed to reach their intended destination and may fuel conflict further afield, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu warned on Tuesday Speaking at a ministry meeting, Shoigu said “the collective West, in hopes of dragging out the conflict in Ukraine, continues large-scale arms supplies to the Kiev regime.” “More than 28,000 tons of military cargo have already been delivered to the country,” the defense minister revealed. However, according to the Russian military’s information, “some of the foreign weapons supplied by the West to Ukraine are spreading throughout the Middle East region, and also end up on the black market,” Shoigu said. The minister’s remarks came soon after an RT Russian investigation revealed that deliveries of lethal aid from the US, UK, and other NATO countries to Ukraine led to the appearance of dark web marketplaces, where some of the weapons can be purchased. The Ukrainian traders claim to offer not just small arms or body armor, but also sophisticated hardware such as Javelin and NLAW anti-tank systems, and Phoenix Ghost and Switchblade explosive drones. However, it cannot be completely ruled out that the sellers do not actually have the weapons in stock, as the RT investigators did not complete any purchases. Late last month, the G7 countries pledged to provide support to Ukraine in all possible forms “for as long as it takes.” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron stressed that their countries would continue to supply weapons to Kiev in order to “strengthen their hand in both the war and any future negotiations.” Last month, the head of Interpol, Jurgen Stock, warned that the conflict in Ukraine will result in numerous weapons appearing on the black market. In April, a US official told CNN that the White House has “almost zero” ability to track the weapons it sends to Ukraine. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in May that he discussed the importance of tracking and safeguarding the US-supplied arms with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov, who assured him that they are keeping an eye on them. Moscow has warned against supplying Western weapons to Ukraine, arguing that it only prolongs the fighting, while increasing the risk of a direct military confrontation between Russia and NATO. Russia also made it clear that its forces would consider any foreign weaponry on Ukrainian territory to be legitimate targets."
2022-07-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/558400-nato-base-finland-kremlin/,Kremlin comments on possible NATO base in Finland,"Russia’s response to a possible NATO base in Finland would be outlined by the military, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday. Peskov was responding to Finnish media reports, which claimed that the mayor of a city close to the Russian border wanted an increased Western military presence there. “We have discussed on many occasions that relevant plans do exist [in the defense ministry] and that work is underway to ensure our security,” Peskov said, when asked about the comments. Russia’s attitude towards Finland’s looming accession to NATO did not change, he added. Last week, Finnish broadcaster Yle cited Lappeenranta Mayor Kimmo Jarva as saying that his city and the entire region could benefit from an inflow of investment after the country ascends to NATO. He said the city airport in particular could be used for military purposes. Lappeenranta, a city of some 70,000 residents, is located in the South Karelia region 20km from the Russian border. The speaker of the Russian State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, remarked that Jarva was wrong to believe that a NATO facility in his city would make residents safer. On the contrary, military infrastructure would be the primary target in case of a potential conflict, he pointed out in a social media post on Monday. Finland and fellow Nordic nation Sweden are set to join NATO soon. They requested membership in the wake of the Russian offensive in Ukraine in February. Helsinki and Stockholm broke national traditions of neutrality stretching back decades and even centuries to seek accession to the US-led military bloc. Both countries noted that they are not obliged to host NATO military bases after joining the alliance. Moscow said the two nations compromised their safety by joining the bloc, which Russia considers hostile and serving the interest of American hegemony. It said the Russian military will respond accordingly to a resulting shift in the balance of power in the Baltic region."
2022-07-05,https://www.rt.com/news/558402-uk-warships-black-sea/,UK reveals stance on Black Sea warship deployment,"Britain will not deploy warships to the Black Sea to help with the delivery of Ukrainian grain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. The shipments from Ukraine, a major grain exporter, have been disrupted following Russia’s offensive against the country. Speaking in Parliament on Monday, Johnson was asked to confirm if he was looking to breach the Montreux Convention, a 1936 international agreement that allows Turkey to block access to the Black Sea to warships from outside the region. The PM replied: “No, we’re not looking at that. There are alternative solutions that don’t involve the presence of the UK or other warships in the Black Sea.” Johnson suggested that the Danube and other rivers, as well as rail transport, could be used to ship the grain out of Ukraine. These methods could help to “get grain out in smaller quantities,” as opposed to arranging a maritime convoy, the PM said. “We’re looking at all the possible options,” Johnson said. Turkey shut down the Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits for naval vessels of non-Black Sea countries shortly after Russia launched its military campaign in the neighboring state. On Thursday, Russia evacuated troops from Ukraine’s Zmeyiny Island (Snake Island), near the port city of Odessa, which was captured in February. Moscow described the move as “a goodwill gesture” aimed at showing that Russia was not blocking attempts by the UN to organize grain deliveries from Ukraine. Western officials have accused Russia of not allowing Ukrainian grain to be exported from Odessa, while Moscow has argued that shipments were made impossible because Ukrainian troops had laid naval mines outside of its ports."
2022-07-05,https://www.rt.com/news/558393-germany-rebukes-ukraine-bandera/,Germany gives Ukraine advice on Nazi-collaborator national ‘hero’ – media,"Germany has tacitly criticized Ukraine for the apologism of Nazi-collaborator Stepan Bandera advocated by Kiev’s ambassador. The country should join the Berlin-based International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), where Bandera’s role in ethnic cleansings can be discussed, German anti-Semitism commissioner Felix Klein said on Monday. The IHRA is an “appropriate forum” for discussing the issue on the international level, Klein told Funke Mediengruppe. This suggestion was in response to claims by Ukrainian Ambassador Andrey Melnik, who said there was no evidence that Nazi collaborator Bandera was responsible for the persecution of Poles and Jews in Ukraine during World War II. Bandera is considered a national hero in Ukraine due to his role as a nationalist leader. Forces loyal to him were involved in mass killings and expulsions of non-Ukrainians, and sided with the invading Nazi German forces, hoping that Adolf Hitler would allow a Ukrainian state to exist under Berlin’s protectorate. The Germans arrested Bandera in 1941 after he refused to accept that his plan to proclaim an independent Ukraine would not be allowed. He was released three years later in hopes that he could lead his Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists to fight the advancing Red Army on the eastern front. Melnik’s attempt to whitewash Bandera’s role in the persecution of minorities in Ukraine prompted rebuke from Poland and Israel. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry distanced itself from the diplomat, saying he was expressing his personal views. Kiev reportedly wants to recall the ambassador from Berlin and appoint him deputy foreign minister. Klein said that he found Melnik’s comments problematic, because they allegedly “feed the Russian narrative” about Ukraine and “cause division and misunderstanding among friendly states.” Moscow believes the Ukrainian government is beholden to the whims of radical nationalists, some of whom openly espouse neo-Nazi beliefs, and that they prevented the government in Kiev from seeking reconciliation with the Donbass region in the east, while pushing for military action against them. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/558396-mercenaries-ukraine-killed-numbers/,Number of mercenaries recently killed in Ukraine revealed,"Scores of foreign mercenaries have been killed in Ukraine over the past ten days, Russian Defense Minister, Sergey Shoigu said on Tuesday. Speaking at a ministry meeting, Shoigu said that “as a result of the successful offensive” by both Russian and Donbass republics’ forces, “the number of foreign mercenaries and employees of private military companies operating in the country has decreased.” “Over the past 10 days, 170 foreign mercenaries have been killed, 99 have refused to participate in combat and left the territory of Ukraine,” he said. Earlier on Tuesday, Damien Magrou, a spokesman for the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine – a foreign military unit created in late February by the Ukrainian government at the request of President Volodymyr Zelensky – confirmed that a French fighter, named as Adrien D., had been killed in Kharkov Region. Speaking to BFM TV, Magrou said the fighter died of injuries in a field hospital on June 25, after spending some time in a coma. According to RTL radio, Adrien D. was one of the first foreigners to join the Ukrainian side. He is the second French national to be killed there. On June 1, his compatriot Wilfried Bleriot was killed, also in Kharkov Region. His funeral took place on June 30 in France. RTL reports that there are about fifty French nationals fighting for Kiev while in mid-June Magrou revealed that foreigners from 55 countries serve in the legion, with most of them coming from Poland, the US, the UK and Canada. All members of the legion “are servicemen in the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” Magrou added, arguing that they should be considered as prisoners of war, protected by the Geneva Conventions, if captured. “We hereby call on Russian authorities and Russian proxies to respect international humanitarian law and refrain from politically motivated criminal proceedings against lawful members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” Magrou said in a statement. Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said last month that the best thing the foreign mercenaries could expect was a “long term in prison.” He also claimed that attempts by Ukrainian officials to provide the foreign fighters with legal protection by adding them to the list of the Armed Forces or giving them Ukrainian passports would not save them from prosecution. He also revealed that hundreds of foreign mercenaries in Ukraine had been killed by Russian long-range precision weapons “shortly after their arrival at the places where they were undergoing additional training and where the tactical units were coordinated.” However, most of them, according to the spokesman, were killed “due to a low level of training and a lack of real combat experience.” Data from the Russian defense ministry shows that 6,956 foreign citizens from 64 countries arrived in Ukraine to become pro-Kiev combatants between February 24 and June 17. Some 1,956 of those have been killed, while 1,779 have left the country, the ministry said."
2022-07-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/558384-west-failed-support-confrontation/,Fyodor Lukyanov: Why the West has failed to get the rest of the world on board to support its confrontation with Russia,"The recent festival of big Western politics – which began with a meeting of the European Council, continued with the G7 Summit, and ended with a major NATO gathering – provides plenty of food for thought about the fate of the world. On the surface, what we have seen is impressive: The West is showing unprecedented unity in the face of the Russian campaign in Ukraine. America has gathered almost all of its allies. Right now, from Australia to Norway, from Singapore to Portugal, and from Japan to Iceland, the agenda is the same – to prevent the success of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who represents a rejection of the so-called ‘rules-based order’. The brutality and irreversibility of what is happening in Ukraine gives the situation the character of a moral choice. Almost all statements from Western leaders refer to a confrontation between ""civilization and barbarism"". Accordingly, they believe, there should be no doubt about which side to take. The Western community has now reached maximum capacity – its European flank (EU and NATO members plus Ukraine and Moldova), its Asian club (South Korea, Japan, and Singapore stopped wavering and took the ‘right’ side), the Oceania pairing, and of course, North America. The ‘free world’ has never been so vast. This raises a serious question, however. Has the West reached its natural limit beyond which expansion is no longer possible? And if so, what does it mean? In fact, the topic of the limits of Western influence stems from the notorious concept of the ‘end of history’, which is already so worn out that it is even inconvenient to bring it up. Nevertheless, it is appropriate in this context. Francis Fukuyama’s reflections (he was recently banned from entering Russia, as it happens) led him to conclude that with the collapse of the communist alternative, the only question that remained was how soon and how painlessly the Western economic and socio–political model – which had proved its virtues in the showdown with the USSR – would spread to the rest of the world. The author admitted that it would not be without snags, but in general, the direction was determined once and for all. How things actually played out after the collapse of the USSR is well known, and despite the fact that numerous crises in developed countries have dimmed the view of the expected path of development, the system has been preserved – and no one has yet come close to the Western world in terms of well-being and comfort. And the Western media still has a near-monopoly on determining the picture of what is happening on a global scale. This means it has a huge head start. But the limit seems to have been reached. Perhaps the main surprise resulting from the events of recent months is that the West has failed to engage so much of the world in a united front against Russia – the exceptions being those who are already part of the West and a few who passionately want to join the club. This is unexpected, since few people approve of Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Moscow is dealing with problems that are seemingly irrelevant to anyone but itself, and the harsh methods and humanitarian consequences of the conflict do not elicit much sympathy from outside. In other words, objectively, the West has an excellent chance to win over most of the rest of the world by taking the line that its cause here is about opposition to barbarism. But this is not happening. Why? There are perhaps three main reasons. Firstly, the non-Western world knows perfectly well that wars on the planet have never stopped, including in the last 30 years, and statements from the EU states about the era of ‘harmony and prosperity’ that Putin interrupted are perceived as both selfishness and hypocrisy. Telling people in the Middle East, for example, that Russia has violated every conceivable moral standard is, to put it mildly, difficult in light of what the region has experienced since the Cold War ended. Secondly, most in the former third world see the current events as the culmination of a long-standing conflict related to the assertive policies of the US and its allies regarding the territories directly adjacent to Russia. Their attitude is something like: ‘What did you expect would happen when you provoked the tiger?’ Finally, the reaction of the majority of the planet illustrates their irritation with the West as a whole. It is perceived as a hegemon with a colonial history which is always abusing its powers. The reason is not support for Russia’s actions, but opposition to the West’s attempts to impose its will on others, which often harms their own interests. Also, schadenfreude over America’s failed attempts to impose its will compensates for any doubts about the legitimacy of Moscow’s actions. In other words, it’s not about sympathy for Russia, but antipathy to the West. Western leaders are both surprised and alarmed by this situation. If the initial calls to join the boycott of Russia amounted to orders, now the demands have been replaced by exhortations and attempts to promise something in return. The selection of the G7 Summit guests – the presidents of India, Indonesia, Senegal, Argentina, and South Africa – is indicative. The invited parties were warmly welcomed. Everyone was in a hurry to tap Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the shoulder and give him attention. But apart from general statements, nothing happened. And almost in parallel with the events in Europe, Modi participated in a virtual BRICS summit, and Argentina, it seems, together with Iran, has applied to join this emerging association. The position of non-Western states is dictated not only by anti-colonial instincts, although they do exist. More importantly, in the new conditions, it is difficult for the West to offer the leading countries of the rest of the world anything that would force them to radically change their positions. There are now alternative sources of resources for development – ​​a number of members of the former third world today have money, skills, and to some extent, technology. The West is still ahead of them in many ways, but – and this is fundamentally important – it has now completely lost the desire to share its advantages. Simply because it now fears competition from them – the experience of American support for the development of China is considered a mistake by the current elites. Developing countries are of course interested in Western investment, but the nature of interaction is also changing. To put it mildly, the former third world is becoming more demanding and picky, and the West’s ability to impose its own conditions has weakened amid large-scale global changes. The series of meetings in Europe was intended to show that the West is still the undisputed vanguard of the world, which has both the right and responsibility to lead others. For instance, NATO is once again attempting to become a global organization rather than regional. The bloc’s most recent experience of this kind – in Afghanistan – ended in embarrassment. But now the approach is more natural – opposition to Russia. As they see it, Russia is a threat to Western European security (as it was in the glory days of NATO), but it is also a dangerous pariah for all mankind, so opposing it will help expand the US-led club globally. Moreover, the specter of China looms – a systemic competitor to the West and, even better, an accomplice of ‘the Russians’. How much the Western world itself is united for the full implementation of such a mission is a topic for another article. There are a lot of nuances here. However, even assuming that this is the case, there is no reason to think that NATO’s ambition will meet with understanding beyond its borders. As a consequence, the broad refusal to recognize the right of the West to lead means there will no longer be a world order based on Western rules."
2022-07-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/558372-us-eruope-bury-press-freedom/,West has ‘buried’ freedom of speech – Moscow,"The harassment of Russian journalists in the US, Europe and Ukraine has reached “a massive scale,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday. Moscow never wanted to take any measures that would affect journalistic freedoms, but Washington and its allies leave Russia with no choice but to reciprocate, the minister told reporters during a joint press conference with Venezuela’s top diplomat, Carlos Faria. Russia is interested in ending this “war on journalists,” Lavrov said, adding that the Western nations apparently cannot stop it without “losing face.” Moscow cannot just stand idly by given the pressure its journalists are facing, especially since the persecution has reached a scale “that is impossible to bear any longer,” he argued. “We initially did not want to give a mirror response that would affect journalists’ rights, but the West has buried the freedom of speech with its own hands,” the minister said. He did not announce any new measures against any foreign media in Russia, though. “It was not us who started this war,” Lavrov said, adding that the West “has just gone too far.” The minister accused Western governments of deviating from the norms of international law and instead creating their own rules that allow them to unilaterally decide what is “freedom of information” and what is “propaganda.” In particular, the minister referred to French President Emmanuel Macron’s decision to bar Russia’s RT broadcaster and Sputnik news agency, first from covering his campaign in 2017 and later from accessing the Élysée Palace in 2018. He also described both outlets as “organs of influence and propaganda.” “There is a large number of such examples,” Lavrov said on Monday. Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, which was launched in late February, has further strained relations between Moscow and the West, including in the media field. In response to Russia’s offensive, Western countries introduced bans and restrictions on certain media outlets. As a result of these measures, RT and Sputnik – and even their accounts on some social media platforms – were made inaccessible in the EU. Australia, Canada and the UK have followed suit. The US has a constitutional ban on overt censorship, but YouTube nevetheless blocked the accounts of RT and Sputnik. Russia responded by blocking the websites of several Western state-run outlets, including BBC, Deutsche Welle, Svoboda, and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty."
2022-07-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/558362-aslin-dpr-sentence-appeal/,British fighter files appeal against death sentence,"The defense of Aiden Aslin, a British citizen who had been fighting for the Ukrainian Armed Forces and sentenced to death by a Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) court on June 9, has appealed the conviction, his lawyer, Pavel Kosovan, told TASS on Monday. Kosovan revealed that the defense is contesting two counts of the verdict – ‘commission of crimes by a group of persons’ and ‘forcible seizure of power or violent retention of power’ – and to dismiss the case in this part “due to the absence of corpus delicti in the actions of the defendant.” Aslin was found guilty on three counts – the third was ‘mercenarism.’ The Donetsk People’s Republic’s Criminal Code provides for punishment under this article for a period of up to seven years. Aslin is the last of three foreign fighters facing death sentences in the DPR to appeal the decision. Late last month, the lawyer of his compatriot, Shaun Pinner, asked the court to replace the death sentence with life imprisonment. The court said at the time that the cassation would be considered within two months of the date the case was sent to the Supreme Court. Last Friday, the defense for Moroccan Saadun Brahim also said it had filed a complaint with the court. The court confirmed the receipt of all three complaints. The three fighters were captured in or near Mariupol, a port city that the DPR claims as part of its sovereign territory, and which saw weeks of intense fighting and eventually a blockade of thousands of Ukrainian troops at a steel plant. They later surrendered to Russian and DPR forces. London has demanded that its citizens be treated as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions. However, Britain is not formally at war with the DPR. The authorities in the DPR have said they consider the men to be mercenaries, who are not granted the same privileges as regular combatants under international law."
2022-07-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/558350-ukraine-military-letters-church/,Conscription letters served at Ukrainian churches – MP,"Officials were seen distributing conscription notices outside a church in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Sunday, a member of the nationlal parliament has claimed. Ukraine declared a general mobilization of men aged 18 to 60 shortly after Russia launched its military campaign against the country in late February. The law does not specify where notices must be handed out, but they all must be served in person. Nikolay Knyazhnitsky, a member of the European Solidarity party, criticized the practice of serving notices at places of worship in a Facebook post. “It’s Sunday in Lviv. People are traditionally going to church. And someone had an idea to serve notices from military enlistment offices outside of church,” Knyazhitsky wrote. “Outraged priests are making phone calls. They have a reason to be outraged.” “There are many ways to invite people to an enlistment office. [Like serving a notice] at home, or a workplace. You certainly shouldn’t do it at church,” he added. “People go there for spiritual protection and support. It’s not a place where one has to walk around and serve notices in the middle of a prayer.” At the same time, the lawmaker mentioned that “many people” want to join the Ukrainian Armed Forces but are “getting turned down.” Last week, police and military officials inspected more than 400 establishments in Kiev, including night clubs, and served notices to 219 military-aged patrons. Most military-aged men are barred from leaving Ukraine under a presidential decree issued in February. A group of MPs introduced a bill last month that would make it illegal for men aged 18 to 60 to leave Ukraine during martial law. On Sunday, MP Georgy Mazurashu proposed granting more exemptions to military-aged men seeking to travel outside of the country, including those with small children or certain work contracts abroad. The authorities have not released the precise numbers on mobilization, but Deputy Defense Minister Anna Malyar said last month that “hundreds of thousands” had been mobilized."
2022-07-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/558345-russia-members-un-security/,Russia comments on UN Security Council expansion prospects,"Moscow supports expanding the UN Security Council (UNSC), but not by admitting Germany and Japan, the Russian ambassador to China, Andrey Denisov, said on Monday. Speaking during the plenary session of the UN World Peace Forum in Beijing, Denisov, whose key statements have been published on the embassy’s social media accounts, claimed that the Security Council has become a place where “the Western colleagues carry out propaganda, presenting their views as the ultimate truth.” Therefore, he argued, there is a pressing need to reform the UN. “Our country is in favor of expanding the composition of the UN Security Council on the basis of a broad consensus. To do this, it is necessary to increase the share of African, Asian and Latin American states,” Denisov said, explaining that this would make the council “more democratic.” He added that Russia is open to the idea of membership for India and Brazil, but not Germany and Japan, “since this will not change the internal balance in any way.” His remarks followed multiple calls from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to strip Russia of its membership, amid Moscow’s military operation in his country. The US, however, has repeatedly made it clear that Russia will remain a permanent member of the UNSC, as there is no way to exclude the country. There have been discussions about increasing the number of permanent Security Council members since the approval of the UN Charter in 1945. Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan have made the strongest demands. The UNSC, whose primary responsibility is “the maintenance of international peace and security,” is the only UN body authorized to issue binding resolutions on member states. Its five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK, and US – can block any resolution. The bloc of Western democratic and generally aligned permanent members – France, the UK, and US – is often called the ‘P3’."
2022-07-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/558340-ukraine-seeks-subsidies-eu/,Ukraine seeks ways to get more EU money,"Ukraine will need to learn from Poland how to use EU money “in such a way that they give you even more,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said in an interview, published soon after his country received EU candidate status. Speaking to news outlet Levy Bereg, Kuleba cited a recent conversation with a counterpart from “a very influential European country,” who said he had realized for the first time that the bloc is considering accepting such a “huge country.” The last nation of similar size to join the bloc was Poland, Kuleba’s counterpart noted. Responding to a comment by the interviewer that Poland is still the largest recipient of EU subsidies, the Ukrainian foreign minister said, “this logic is correct from the point of view of a Ukrainian consumer: Europe, money...” “By the way, Poland was not flooded with money, Poland learned to take European money and use it in such a way that they give you even more. And this is why we in Ukraine need to learn at the local level, because that’s where the money should go.” Kuleba added that it is difficult “to find the right argument to explain to every skeptic” why Ukraine should be granted EU candidate status now, saying the decision to do so has meant “a real psychological break” for the EU leaders, as no one in the bloc talked seriously about Kiev’s ambitions for the last 30 years. The foreign minister dismissed claims that candidate status will not lead anywhere, noting, “I see how mechanisms for working with Ukraine, as a future member of the European Union, are already being deployed at the level of the European Commission.” According to Kuleba, the European Commission is “beginning to reflect” how Ukraine’s accession will impact the bloc, how many deputies will be needed in the European Parliament, and how Ukrainian agriculture will influence EU agricultural policy. “The second thing I see is how the doors are really opening in the European Union to include us in the internal market. This is the zeroing of rates on imports, this is also visa-free for transport. The process goes in that direction,” he said. At the same time, the bloc itself will need reform, Kuleba noted, explaining that he is looking at accession not from the point of view that “we are so big and we will ask a lot,” but from a political perspective: “how can a tandem of, for example, Ukraine and Poland, change the balance of power in the European Union itself.” “This is a completely different reality,” Kuleba said, adding that the reforms which have already begun are “mega cool.” “We, as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, must ensure that Ukraine’s accession to the EU takes place on the most favorable terms.” Kuleba’s remarks come a few days after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Kiev needs to implement more reforms and make new institutions actually work, if it wants to progress towards EU membership. Last month, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo signaled that granting Ukraine EU-candidate status is an important “symbolic message” to support Kiev amid its ongoing conflict with Russia. Actual EU membership, however, is still “many years” away, and the country must first meet European standards, he said. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed that the European Council’s decision to grant EU candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova proves that the bloc’s goal is to ‘contain’ Russia. In June, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia has no objections to Ukraine joining the EU as, unlike NATO, it is not a military bloc. However, he pointed out that the country would require a lot of financial aid to meet the Brussels’ standards and warned about the risk of Ukraine becoming “a sort of semi-colony.”"
2022-07-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/558339-ukraine-admit-join-nato/,Ukraine admits no potential to join NATO anytime soon,"Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba has said that he doesn’t see how NATO might change its stance on Kiev’s accession to the bloc in the near future. “Ukraine still pursues Euro-Atlantic integration, but I do not see the potential in the near future for NATO to change its position in a way the European Union did, and to take concrete steps to ensure Ukraine's accession to the alliance,"" he told local media. Kuleba noted that while the EU has radically altered its stance on Ukraine’s membership after Russia began its military offensive, NATO is still dwelling “in a pre-conflict world” despite having opened its doors to Kiev in 2008. “As of February 24, NATO had an edge over the EU in this respect, because it had a decision on Ukraine eventually becoming a member of the alliance… Over the past four months, the EU outpaced NATO, taking the process to the second stage, while the alliance is standing still,” he said. In late June, the EU granted candidate status to Ukraine, although, according to various European leaders, it might take Kiev decades to finally join the bloc, considering that it has to enforce a slew of economic, democratic and anti-corruption reforms. At the same time, Ukraine’s prospects of becoming a NATO member look even bleaker, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky saying in mid-March that Kiev should accept this reality. “Ukraine is not a member of NATO. We understand that. We have heard for years that the doors were open, but we also heard that we could not join. It’s a truth and it must be recognized,” the president conceded at the time."
2022-07-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/558329-shoigu-report-putin-donbass/,Defense minister updates Putin on latest Ukrainian losses,"In just two weeks, Ukraine has lost almost 5,500 troops, including over 2,000 killed, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said on Monday while delivering an update on the conflict with Ukraine to President Vladimir Putin. The minister made his second report to the Russian leader in as many days. On Sunday, he confirmed that Russian and allied forces had assumed full control of the territory that the government of the Lugansk People’s Republic claims as its own, after the capture of the city of Lisichansk. The report, delivered in-person, provided additional details on the outcome of the operation. According to Shoigu, Ukrainian troops sustained 5,469 casualties over the last two weeks, including 2,218 fatalities. The fighting also cost Kiev a significant amount of hardware, including 12 warplanes, six long-range air defense missile systems, 97 rocket artillery launchers and almost 200 tanks and other armor, the defense minister reported. Ukrainian troops abandoned some of the weapons in Lisichansk, including almost 40 vehicles, he said. Earlier, Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, reported suffering heavy losses in the east, with an average of 200 casualties per day. Kiev claimed its troops were vastly outgunned by Russia and its allies in artillery and urged Western nations to speed up delivery of promised military aid to Ukraine. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

2022-07-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/558333-uzbekistan-amendment-revoked-riots/,Uzbek govt concedes to protesters’ demands after deadly riots,"Uzbekistan has scrapped the idea of revoking the autonomy of the northwestern region of Karakalpakstan after deadly riots broke out there on Friday. The Legislative Chamber, the lower house of the country’s parliament, said on Monday that, according to a proposal by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, the articles of the constitution guaranteeing Karakalpakstan’s autonomy will “remain unchanged, and the existing norms will be retained.” The house voted to extend “popular discussions” regarding the planned amendments to the constitution until July 15. Mirziyoyev promised not to revoke the region’s special status during a trip to Karakalpakstan’s capital of Nukus on Sunday. “Not a single article [of the constitution] will be amended, if the people of Karakalpakstan are dissatisfied,” he said. The riots in Nukus left 18 dead and 243 injured, including 38 police officers, the Prosecutor General’s office said on Monday. According to the National Guard, 516 people were detained. The authorities declared a month-long emergency in Karakalpakstan and imposed a nighttime curfew in the region. The protests in Nukus began after the government unveiled a proposal to remove references to the region’s autonomy from the constitution. The authorities have since insisted that some protesters were driven by “the incorrect interpretation” of the proposed reform. Mirziyoyev promised that the final draft of the amendments would be put to a referendum."
2022-07-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/558321-rus-pivoting-toward-nonwest/,Dmitri Trenin: Russia has made a decisive break with the West and is ready to help shape a new world order,"Just before the G7 leaders met at Elmau Castle in Bavaria last week, their counterparts from the five BRICS countries held an online summit under the Chinese presidency. Russia had been discussed as a threat at the G7 gathering but was a key participant in the latter. Long gone are the days when Moscow could straddle the divide between the West and the non-West. Following the 2014 Ukraine crisis, the G8 reverted to its previous G7 format; in the wake of the Russian military action in Ukraine last February, Russian-Western confrontation degenerated into a full-blown “hybrid war,” complete with an actual confrontation – if so far a proxy one. Having tried, after the end of the Cold War, to become part of the new West, and having failed at that endeavor, Russia is now focusing on developing its ties with Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. This is both a difficult and a necessary task, for a number of reasons. First, there is a powerful inertia from the past. At least since the days of Peter the Great, Russian elites have looked westward, adopting Western ways of appearance and behavior (while remaining distinctly Russian beneath the garb and manners); adapting Western institutions (even if often only superficially); borrowing Western patterns of thinking (while creatively developing them, as with Marxism); seeking to become a great European power; then, in Soviet days, a global superpower; and, more recently, a key component of a greater Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok. This is a pathway hard to wean off from. Yet, now, for the first time ever, Russia is facing a united West, from North America, the European Union, and Britain, to Japan and Australia. What’s more, there are no allies in the West that Moscow can turn to – even notionally neutral states such as Finland, Sweden, Austria, and Switzerland, have all ditched their neutrality. Russia’s political rupture with the West is thus complete, and any new norm of relations between them can only emerge as a result of the “hybrid war,“ which will take years, if not decades, to fight out. Second, Moscow’s economic relations have been largely built with the West. Historically, Russia has been a resource for Western European industry; a breadbasket of the continent; and a major importer of industrial products and technology. Until recently, Russia’s trade with the European Union alone accounted for more than half of Russia’s foreign commerce, and Germany was the lead exporter of machinery and technology to Russia. Since the early 1970s, oil and gas pipelines from Russia to Western Europe have formed the backbone of economic ties and provided for general stability on the continent, even in the dangerous decades of the Cold War and in the turbulent times of the disintegration of the Soviet Union itself. This, too, is on the way out, however. The severe sanctions imposed on Russia by the US, EU and UK will not be lifted even when the actual fighting in Ukraine stops, and the painful experience of foreign exchange and asset seizures will leave a huge imprint on any future Russian approach to economic ties with the West. Third, in cultural terms, Russians have traditionally identified themselves with the rest of Europe. Christianity; the legacies of Ancient Greece and Rome; the ideas of French Enlightenment and German philosophy; European literature and the arts, music, and dance – all of this helped shape and form Russia’s own culture, giving it a powerful stimulus for self-development. Despite the recent political rupture and the geo-economic shift, the foundations of Russian culture remain definitely European. However, a number of elements of today’s cultural scene in the West, particularly the dominant cult of individual self-expression, runaway liberalism that is turning increasingly oppressive, the erosion of family values and the proliferation of genders, jars with the more traditional cultural code of the majority of the Russian population. That said, the obvious necessity for Russia to now look beyond the West means it can probably overcome the historical inertia, the legacy of previous geo-economic priorities, and cultural affinities. With the West shunning Russia, trying to isolate and sometimes 'cancel' it, Moscow has no choice but to kick its old habits and reach out to the wider world beyond Western Europe and North America. In fact, this is something that successive Russian leaders vowed to do repeatedly, even when relations with the West were much less adversarial, but the Europe-oriented mindset, the apparent ease of trading resources for Western goods and technologies, and the ambition to be accepted into Western elite circles prevented that intention from turning into reality. It has been noted, however, that people start doing the right thing only when there are no other options. And certainly, capitulating to the West is no option for Russia, at this point. Things have gone too far. Beyond the necessity of an overhaul of Russia’s foreign relations there are real opportunities to pursue. Since the end of the Cold War, the leading countries of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America have risen spectacularly in all respects, from economically and politically to technologically and militarily. Even before the outbreak of the “hybrid war,” China had overtaken Germany not only as Russia’s principal trading partner, but also as the leading exporter of machinery and equipment to Russia. India, a traditional importer of Soviet and Russian weapons, is now emerging as a major technology partner for Moscow. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are Russia’s principal partners in regulating oil output in the OPEC+ format. Turkey and Iran are major independent players in a key strategic region. The fact that the vast majority of non-Western countries refused to condemn Russia for what it is doing in Ukraine – many of them despite strong US pressure – is most encouraging for Moscow. In the sense that those who are not against us could be considered to be with us. From Indonesia to Brazil, and from Argentina to South Africa, there are many dynamic and ambitious countries that Moscow is seeking to engage. To be able to do that, Russia’s foreign policy needs to come up with an appropriate strategy. Above all, it needs to give relations with non-Western countries priority over the de facto firmly frozen ties with the West. Being an ambassador to Indonesia should be more prestigious than an ambassadorship in Rome, and a post in Tashkent should be viewed as more important than one in Vienna. There needs to be an audit of potential economic and other opportunities for Russia in the BRICS countries, and a plan to work on them. Apart from economics, student exchange programs should be expanded, and Russian tourism encouraged to move east, and south. The Russian media would be right to increase coverage of developments in the key non-Western nations, educating the Russian elite and the broader public about the economic realities, politics, and culture of those nations."
2022-07-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/558325-scholz-weapons-ukraine-pace/,Germany explains its stance on arming Ukraine,"Germany is unable to provide Kiev with weapons at a similar pace to the United States because its resources are more limited, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz explained on Sunday, responding to allegations that his country has been “overpromising and underdelivering” when it comes to Ukraine. In an interview with CBS News, the chancellor stressed that amid Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine his country made “a very, very hard decision” to change its long-term political strategy of never providing a country in conflict with weapons. “Germany sent all the weapons we had in our stocks in our military infrastructure. And we decided also to deliver new weapons from our industry, which takes a longer time because they have to be produced,” he explained. He added that certain weapons systems require the Ukrainian soldiers to be trained, which also slows down the delivery process. The CBS interviewer then pointed out that the US sometimes provides weaponry within 48 hours “of the president signing and carrying out training,” whereas for Germany it takes much longer. “I think you should understand that there is a difference if a country like the United States spends that much for defense, which is a very big (long pause) investment, and you have a lot of weapons at your stocks,” Scholz responded. While Germany is sending weapons “with the means and ways” it has, the chancellor stressed, it is still “one of the countries that is doing the most” because it is sending to Kiev “the most sophisticated technology you can use.” He emphasized that Berlin was “using all the means” it has to help Ukraine and will continue to do so to avoid a peace on Russia's terms – something that, he believes, neither Ukraine nor the West will accept. “But the most important thing is that we are not just now supporting Ukraine, we are changing the way how we spend money for defense,” Scholz said. The “big increase” in defense spending, he argued, will allow Germany to react faster if there is a threat to NATO or to its own security. Scholz’s remarks followed a report by Foreign Policy magazine that the training provided to Ukrainian personnel has dropped off in recent weeks. Ukrainian officials cited by the magazine complained the pace of Western aid was “too slow” but also admitted that beyond training for HIMARS (high mobility artillery rocket systems) and Western artillery, military training for their troops has declined, leaving them unable to operate more advanced systems. Russia has repeatedly urged the West not to provide Kiev with weapons, saying it will only prolong the conflict and lead to long-term problems. It has warned that Russian forces would consider any foreign weapons on Ukrainian territory to be legitimate targets. Last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that “pumping up” Ukraine with Western weapons will only lead Russia “to perform more missions on the ground.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/558315-lithuania-kaliningrad-economy-blockade/,Russia could destroy half of Lithuania’s economy – governor,"Moscow could bring down half of Lithuania’s economy in response to the partial trade blockade of Kaliningrad Region, Russia, its governor has said. “The transport sector of the Baltic states could be destroyed if Russia implements counter-sanctions on the goods coming in and out of the Baltic states,” Kaliningrad Region Governor Anton Alikhanov told Russian newspaper Vedomosti on Monday. “Russia could make half of the Lithuanian economy disappear,” he said. “There’s an impression that Lithuania doesn’t understand that Kaliningrad Region is part of Russia, and that we have someone to come to the rescue. We’re not alone in the face of the problem.” Kaliningrad Region is a small Russian exclave nestled between Lithuania and Poland, both EU members. Last month, Vilnius banned the transit of certain goods between the region and the rest of Russia, citing the EU’s sanctions on Moscow over its military campaign in Ukraine. Russia has said the move is illegal under international law and promised to retaliate. Alikhanov said the “blockade” hurts the region, which relies on the free flow of building materials, among other goods. “Yes, the ban doesn’t include food, but without concrete we can’t build schools or hospitals. So it’s an issue for the normal existence of more than a million people and for the economy of our region.” While the Kaliningrad authorities have managed to reroute the flow of sanctioned goods to the Baltic Sea rather than via rail and road, the dispute with Lithuania must be resolved as quickly as possible, Alikhanov said. Last week, Reuters reported that the EU was close to a compromise that would allow Kaliningrad’s trade through Lithuania to resume. Many countries, including the EU, imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia after it sent troops into Ukraine in late February."
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558311-ukraine-separatists-lisichansk-minister/,Ukraine angry at French state media,"Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko on Sunday accused France’s Agence France-Presse news agency of falling for “Russian propaganda” by calling forces of the Lugansk People’s Republic “Ukrainian separatists” rather than “Russia’s invading army.” Lugansk and Russian forces announced that they retook the city of Lisichansk on Sunday. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced on Sunday that Russian and Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR) troops had successfully driven Ukrainian forces out of the city of Lisichansk, which had remained under Ukrainian control since the LPR declared independence in 2014 following a pro-Western coup in Kiev. Hours beforehand, AFP reported that “Ukraine separatists say they have encircled Lisichansk,” referring to the troops of the LPR, whose independence Russia recognized days before launching its military operation in Ukraine. Nikolenko took issue with AFP’s description of the LPR’s forces. “AFP became a victim of Russian propaganda,” he tweeted. “It egregiously calls Russia’s invading army ‘Ukraine separatists’, presenting Russia’s war against Ukraine as an internal conflict – Kremlin is cheering.” #BREAKING@AFP became a victim of Russian propaganda. It egregiously calls Russia’s invading army “Ukraine separatists”, presenting Russia’s war against Ukraine as an internal conflict - Kremlin is cheering. What next - “Ukraine separatists” fire cruise missiles from the Caspian? https://t.co/5kk0fO6LVn Despite Nikolenko’s indignation, LPR troops have been in conflict with Ukrainian forces off and on since 2014, eight years before Russia recognized the republic’s independence and sent its troops into Ukraine. Moscow stated that one of the reasons for its offensive on Ukraine was Kiev’s failure to abide by the Minsk agreements, which were designed to give Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014, and former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” According to AFP, Ukrainian officials denied on Saturday that Lisichansk had been encircled, and insisted that the Ukrainian army was still in control of the city. By Sunday afternoon, however, the Ukrainian general staff admitted that “after heavy fighting for Lisichansk, the defence forces of Ukraine were forced to withdraw from their occupied positions and lines.” Nikolenko has griped with Western media outlets before. Back in May he demanded that Reuters call the “Pro-Moscow Kherson region” of Ukraine the “Russian-occupied Kherson region,” and insisted that grain exports from the city should be called “stolen grain shipments,” despite Ukrainian and Russian officials disputing the status of the grain."
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558304-pistols-law-ukrainians-carry/,Ukraine announces major gun control move,"Ukrainians could gain the right to carry pistols for self-defense as early as next year, according to an adviser to the country’s minister for internal affairs. Citing an unspecified poll, Viktor Andrusiv claimed on Sunday that 70% of Ukrainians support the relevant legislation, which was approved at the first stage by the country’s parliament on February 23 – the day before Russia launched its military offensive. He said amendments were now being prepared for the second reading of the bill. “The legislation will be adopted during the summer [or] autumn,” Andrusiv said, adding that the creation of weapon registries would take some time after that. “Perhaps additional decisions will be made so that we can maintain control over the circulation of weapons – check whose it is, how the registration process will take place, in which periods the gun owner must undergo inspections,” the ministerial adviser explained. He emphasized that the whole discussion is “only about pistols,” not about grenade launchers or Kalashnikov assault rifles. According to the explanatory note of the legislation, which was supported at the first reading by 274 out of 352 MPs, the law would allow citizens who find themselves “in a situation of extreme necessity” to protect their own, as well as other people’s “life and health,” with the use of firearms. According to the note, “firearms are the most effective means for citizens to exercise their constitutional right to self-defense.” The legislation’s authors also claim that a “vast majority of the developed countries of the world” have provided their citizens with this right and thus reduced the number of violent crimes. As of February, the number of unregistered firearms in Ukraine amounted to between three million and five million, according to the document. Therefore, a main purpose of the bill is to streamline the rights and obligations for the production, acquisition, ownership, disposal, and use of weapons and ammunition. On June 3, Fyodor Venislavsky, a member of the Rada’s Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence, spoke out in support of legalizing automatic firearms in Ukraine, not just short-barreled ones. Following the launch of the Russian attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that his government would “give weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country.”"
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558300-uzbekistan-riots-curfew-imposed/,Curfew imposed after deadly unrest in Uzbekistan,"A curfew has been imposed in a region of Uzbekistan as the country’s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev responded to unrest, acknowledging that people have been killed in clashes with police this week. “Government buildings were attacked. Unfortunately, there were casualties among civilians and law enforcement officials,” Mirziyoyev told local MPs in the city of Nukus on Sunday, the site of Friday’s riots. The president did not specify how many people had lost their lives. The authorities had previously said a “criminal group” instigated street protests and attempted to seize power in Uzbekistan’s northwestern region of Karakalpakstan. A one-month state of emergency came into effect in the region on Sunday, with a curfew fixed from 9pm to 7am. Other measures include a ban on protests and “restrictions on the freedom of movement,” according to a document published on the president’s website. The demonstrations ostensibly began after the government unveiled a plan to revoke Karakalpakstan’s autonomy as part of a package of constitutional amendments. Mirziyoyev, however, argued that the backlash was fueled by “misunderstood interpretations” of the proposed reform. Mirziyoyev has promised that the status of Karakalpakstan will remain unchanged, and that the final draft of the amendments will be put to a referendum. At the same time, the president warned of “harsh measures” against “those who try to disturb the peace, calm and public safety.”"
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558299-lavrov-uk-grain-pretext/,Moscow suspects UK of seeking to ‘infiltrate’ Black Sea,"The UK is looking for a “pretext” which would allow the Royal Navy to “infiltrate” the Black Sea and to take charge of the release of grain stocks from Ukrainian ports, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed on Sunday. Kiev and Western nations have accused Russia of blocking food exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, allegedly contributing to surging global food prices. Moscow denies the allegation, saying it has been offering safe passage to freighters but that Ukraine is preventing civilian ships from leaving the ports, including Odessa. Russia also says Kiev’s deployment of sea mines has created a threat to shipping in the area. In an interview for Rossiya 24 news channel, Lavrov noted that some countries are trying to use the food security issue “in the worst possible way” by accusing Moscow “of something it is not involved in” and by “whitewashing” Ukraine. In this context, the Russian minister pointed to the statements of the Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Foreign Minister Liz Truss. From Lavrov’s point of view, they “are clearly trying to create conditions, to find pretexts for the Royal Navy to infiltrate the Black Sea and become almost in charge of all the processes of releasing grain from those ports that have been mined by Ukrainians and which Ukrainians must clear.” According to the Russian foreign minister, there are “many manifestations of those convulsions” in the Western politicians’ actions, especially now, when they are facing various domestic problems amid elections which have to take place “every two, three or four years.” Lavrov claimed that “the principles of neoliberal democracy” require these politicians to divert the attention of the population. Therefore, the minister argued, it makes sense to follow the debates about possible advantages of “states with a strong central government” and the ways they are responding to the various crises. During the recent G7 summit in Germany, the British prime minister called for urgent action to help move grain supplies out of the Black Sea ports, adding that British expertise in “remote de-mining” and insurance of shipping in contested waters could help in fulfilling this task. The UK also pledged £10 million ($12.1 million) in materials and equipment to Ukraine Railways to repair rail infrastructure and help get grain out of the country by rail. The government is also putting £1.5 million ($1.8 million) to develop a testing process “to identify whether grain sold by Russia on the world market has been illegally taken from Ukraine.”"
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558301-west-prevent-kiev-think-peace/,West bars Kiev from thinking about peace – Kremlin,"The US and its allies are still interested in continued conflict in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Sunday. Western nations effectively prevent the government in Kiev from even thinking about any potential peace talks, the official added. When asked about potential reasons that have led German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron to no longer call Russian President Vladimir Putin, Peskov called this another sign suggesting that western leaders are not interested in achieving peace through dialogue and negotiations. “At the moment, the western nations are actively betting on the continued war,” Peskov told the TV show ‘Moscow. Kremlin. Putin.’ on Russia’s Rossiya 1 channel. The position of the western nations –led by Washington– leads to a situation where they “allow Ukrainians neither to think nor talk about or discuss peace,” the Russian president’s spokesman added. The Kremlin believes that “common sense” would eventually prevail and the sides will return to the negotiation table. “Now, the demand for pacifying the situation is low,” Peskov commented, adding that “we are sure … that the time for talks will come.” Kiev will still have to “once again understand” all the demands put forward by Moscow before the talks could continue, the Kremlin spokesman pointed out. The Ukrainian government is well aware of Russia’s position, he said, adding that Kiev just needs to “sit down at the [negotiation] table” and “sign a document that has already been largely agreed.” Moscow and Kiev started peace talks just four days after the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine in late February. The sides have held several rounds in person in Belarus and then continued the talks via a video link. In late March, the delegations from Russia and Ukraine met once again in Istanbul. Since then, however, the talks have completely stalled, as the Ukrainian side has insisted it would only come back to the table when it was in a “stronger negotiating position.” In April, Putin accused Kiev of bringing the process to a deadlock. Peskov said at that time that Russia had provided Ukraine with a draft agreement and was awaiting a response. In June, Ukraine’s top negotiator David Arakhamia suggested that Kiev believes it could achieve this “favorable position” by late August after it conducts “counteroffensive operations in certain areas.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558298-ukrainian-grain-ship-detained/,Turkey detains Russian-flagged vessel carrying grain – media,"Turkey has seized a Russian-flagged cargo ship after Kiev claimed it was involved in “illegal” transport of Ukrainian grain, Reuters reported on Sunday, citing the Ukrainian ambassador to Turkey, Vasily Bodnar. ""We have full co-operation. The ship is currently standing at the entrance to the port, it has been detained by the customs authorities of Turkey,"" Vasily Bodnar told Ukrainian national television. According to the ambassador, investigators will decide on the vessel’s fate on Monday. The move comes two days after Ukrainian diplomats called on the Turkish authorities to detain the vessel, the Zhibek Zholy, arguing that it was transporting “stolen” Ukrainian agricultural produce. The ship departed from the Azov Sea port of Berdyansk, located not far from the city of Mariupol – which is controlled by Russian forces and Donbass militias – and arrived at the Turkish port of Karasu, Bodnar wrote in a series of Twitter posts on Friday, asking Turkey to “take relevant measures.” The diplomat also said that the mission had “good communication and close cooperation” with the Turkish side on the matter, and he was sure the “agreed decisions” would “prevent attempts to violate the sovereignty of Ukraine.” The ship allegedly loaded around 4,500 tons of grain in Berdyansk, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed Ukrainian official. The news agency also noted that the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s Office sent a letter to Turkey’s Justice Ministry in late June, claiming the vessel had been involved in the “illegal export of Ukrainian grain.” According to the letter, the vessel had 7,000 tons of cargo on board. Ukraine then asked Turkey to “conduct an inspection of this sea vessel, seize samples of grain for forensic examination” to determine its origin, and expressed its readiness to launch a joint investigation with the Turkish authorities. The Kazakhstan-based KTZ Express company, which owns the Zhibek Zholy, told Reuters that the ship was leased to a Russian firm called Green Line, which is not subject to any sanctions. Russian authorities have not yet commented on the development. Ukraine, a major grain producer, is unable to export its grain by sea due to the ongoing conflict in the country, with an estimated 22-25 million tons of grain currently stuck in the country’s ports. Kiev has previously accused Russia of “stealing” its grain – something Moscow has denied. The Western nations have blamed Russia for blocking the ports. Moscow has repeatedly stated it would guarantee safe passage for the grain shipments if Kiev clears its ports of mines. Ukraine, in turn, has accused the Russian forces of mining the Black Sea ports. Russia suggested exporting the grain through the Russian-controlled ports of Berdyansk and Mariupol."
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/news/558295-liz-truss-putin-woman/,Liz Truss warns the world of evil women,"British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has argued that calling Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine an example of President Vladimir Putin’s “toxic masculinity” is not the best way to help Kiev. Prime Minister Boris Johnson previously suggested that Putin would have behaved differently on the world stage if he were a woman. “I don’t pretend that I can conduct a psychological analysis of him,” Truss told Times Radio this week. “Nor do I think it’s helpful because, ultimately, what we need to make sure [of] is that we are supplying the Ukrainians with all of the equipment, all of the political support that they need to win this war.”Asked if female leaders were less aggressive than their male counterparts, Truss replied: “I think that both women and men are capable of terrible and appalling acts.” Truss’ comment came after Johnson suggested this week that the Russian president would not have launched a “macho war of invasion” in Ukraine if he “were a woman.” He also labeled Russia’s actions in Ukraine “a perfect example of toxic masculinity.”Putin himself responded to Johnson’s claims, recalling how former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher ordered the armed forces to fight Argentina over the Falkland Islands in 1982. “Here’s a woman, deciding to launch military action,” Putin said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also responded to Johnson’s remarks, saying: “Old Freud would have dreamed of such a research subject during his lifetime.”"
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558296-slovakia-mig-planes-ukraine/,EU country cleared to donate MiG-29s to Ukraine,"Slovakia can donate its Soviet-designed MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, after the Czech Republic agreed to patrol Slovakian airspace from September onwards, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said on Sunday. The MiG deal has reportedly been in the works for several months. “We will help Slovakia until it has new planes at its disposal,” Fiala said during a televised debate with Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger. “I don't see any problem there, the government will certainly approve it.” The Slovak Air Force is believed to operate 12 MiG-29s, which were left in its inventory after the collapse of the USSR. Rumors that Slovakia would donate these planes to Kiev began circulating days after Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine in February, when EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell announced that the bloc would source Soviet-made jets from Eastern European countries for Ukraine’s battered air force. Borrell’s plan never came to fruition, with Poland and Bulgaria – two other operators of Soviet jets – never sending their planes to Ukraine. However, Heger stated in April that he would be willing to hand over his country’s dozen MiGs, should Slovakia’s allies be willing to cover its defense needs until the MiGs were replaced with American warplanes. Slovakia’s MiGs were originally scheduled to be replaced with 14 US-made F-16 fighters this year, but the delivery date has since been pushed back to 2024. The US squashed a Polish plan to transfer its own Soviet fighters to Ukraine in March, but the Pentagon stated in April that it “certainly would not object to” the Slovakian scheme. However, no progress toward sending the MiGs to Ukraine was announced since. With the deal now apparently cleared, questions remain around how Slovakia would actually transfer the jets across its eastern border with Ukraine. Flying these planes into Ukraine from a Slovakian base could be perceived by Moscow as an act of war, dragging NATO into open conflict with Russia. On the other hand, delivering the jets by land could risk transport vehicles being targeted by Russian jets or missiles once they cross into Ukrainian territory. Slovakia has given more than $160 million in military aid to Ukraine since February, and opened its repair yards to damaged Ukrainian military vehicles. Last month, Bratislava sent five Soviet-built helicopters and thousands of 122mm rockets to Kiev’s forces, and is reportedly considering sending 30 T-72 tanks, should its allies provide suitable replacements."
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/557927-hitler-invasion-pearl-harbor/,The US and Russia mark Pearl Harbor and Hitler's invasion very differently – that tells us a lot about national identity,"Last month, Russia marked June 22, the date Operation Barbarossa – or Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union – began in 1941. As a former American officer from a military family, whose close ancestors fought in World War II, I could not but reflect on why in America the date that war began for us – December 7, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor – is not observed as solemnly as June 22 is in Russia. My father was a career Air Force officer, which meant that when I was a child we moved from place to place, depending on the needs of the service. In the early 1970’s, we were fortunate to be stationed at Hickam Air Force Base, on the island of Oahu in the state of Hawaii. My father was assigned to the headquarters of the US Pacific Air Force. The building he worked in bore the bullet holes made when Japanese aircraft strafed it during the attack. These scars of war, together with similar holes in the wooden banister of the interior staircase, were retained as part of an official policy designed to instill the mantra, 'Never Again' in everyone who saw them. The other constant reminder of Japanese perfidy existed across Pearl Harbor Bay, off Ford Island, where on December 7, 1941, the US Pacific Fleet was moored. There, one could find the rusting hulls of the USS Arizona and USS Utah, left where they sank, a permanent cemetery for the thousands of sailors who lost their lives in the Japanese surprise attack. Over the remains of the USS Arizona a white structure had been built, a memorial to those lost that day. One could reach it by ferry. I visited it often, and always found myself staring at the holes in the ship’s structure where the massive turrets containing the Arizona’s mighty 14-inch guns had been mounted. I took solace in the thought that one of these turrets had been recovered and re-mounted on the USS Nevada and was used to bombard Japanese positions during the battles for Iwo Jima and Okinawa; even as a child, one can learn to hate, especially when gazing upon the graves of so many. My grandmother on my father’s side came to visit us while we were in Hawaii. Her husband, Irving Ritter, had served in the US Air Corps during the first World War, flying Curtiss ‘Jenny’ fighters (the war ended before he could be sent to the front). Irving and my grandmother had three children: Helen, Shirley, and my father. Helen married a Marine Corps veteran of the battle of Iwo Jima, and Shirley married a US Army weatherman who was crippled in a training accident before he could participate in a covert mission behind enemy lines in Burma to collect climate data used to direct US bombing attacks on the Japanese. My father was too young for World War Two, but he served a tour in Vietnam, and was now in Hawaii. My grandmother insisted that we visit the Pearl Harbor Memorial. There was no love lost on her part for the Japanese, something that became apparent as she told us stories about how she listened to the news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and, later, President Roosevelt’s address to the nation, where he declared that a state of war existed between the US and Japan. Always the proper lady, my grandmother dressed up for the visit, wearing a modest dress and her hair up, befitting the occasion. To get on the ferry to the memorial, you had to purchase tickets. As we stood in line, my grandmother noticed bus loads of Japanese tourists arriving at the ferry wharf, tickets in hand, waiting to board the ferry to the memorial. It was 1972, some 31 years since the Japanese attacked the sleeping US fleet, and given the age of many of the tourists, men and women in their fifties and sixties, they had not only been alive when the attack took place but had been active participants in the society that carried it out. My grandmother was a well-bred lady of a certain stature in society, not prone to making scenes or using foul language, but when she saw the Japanese tourists, she turned to my father, and in as an indignant voice as can be imagined, asked loudly, “Why are there so many goddamned Japs here?” The Americans in line with us looked at my grandmother with sympathy; they could tell by her age, and where we were standing, that her emotional outburst was coming from a place of authenticity. All eyes were turned to the Japanese, many of whom had heard her words, and were now looking down at the ground in shame and embarrassment. It was not a comfortable moment for anyone present. My father explained that many of the Japanese had come as an act of atonement, to show respect for the dead. He outlined that times had changed, and that we were now friends with the Japanese, and that we didn’t use words like ‘Japs’ when referring to them. My grandmother listened in silence, seething. But she retained her composure, and we completed the tour without further incident. Afterwards, as we drove home, she wept quietly. “They have no right,” she said, referring to the Japanese. “That place is not meant for them.” Her pain was real, and there was no amount of time that could pass which would cure the wounds she felt in her heart. She died later that year, and her memories of the war passed with her. Every December 7, I pause and reflect on the meaning of that day. I re-read President Roosevelt’s address and pay special attention to the notion that it was “a date which will live in infamy.” Infamy. According to Merriam-Webster, the word means an “evil reputation brought about by something grossly criminal, shocking, or brutal.” My grandmother certainly believed that was the case, and having experienced Pearl Harbor through her eyes, so did I. I could, and have, forgiven the Japanese for what they did that day. But I will never forget. Sadly, I can’t say the same thing about my fellow Americans. When was the last time we, as a nation, formally marked Pearl Harbor Day? Yes, every year the US military holds a solemn ceremony at the USS Arizona Memorial, attended by local politicians and senior military officers. But does Poughkeepsie, New York pause and reflect? Mobile, Alabama? Bangor, Maine? Kalamazoo, Michigan? No. As a nation, we have no collective memory of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the underlying infamy attached to those who perpetrated it. History has no meaning if you don’t ingrain it into your very being. For me, the memory of my grandmother’s indignation at the very site of the infamy in question left an indelible imprint. But unless one has a similar moment of clarity, history is but a collection of stories from a bygone era, merely the experience of strangers, and is thus seldom learned, never cherished, and easily forgotten. In June 1988, I was part of a five-person advanced party of US personnel sent to Votkinsk, a Russian city located some 750 miles east of Moscow, in the foothills of the Soviet Union, where the Soviets maintained a factory that produced ballistic missiles. I was working for the On-Site Inspection Agency, whose job it was to implement the provisions of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, one of which was to build a monitoring facility outside the gates of this missile factory. We arrived in Votkinsk on June 18. The first team of US inspectors was due to arrive on July 1. We had a little less than two weeks to get things ready for their arrival. The Soviets put us up in an upscale dacha (country house) on the outskirts of the town that had been built to host former Defense Minister Dmitry Ustinov during his frequent visits to Votkinsk. Now it played host to five Americans. A few days after arriving, I woke and went for a morning run, accompanied by a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official whose job it was to make sure I didn’t “get lost.” After breakfast, the Soviets drove us to the factory, which we were seeing for the first time. I walked the perimeter of the factory, initiating what was to become a routine for all future inspection teams (the inspection provisions called for a perimeter patrol to be conducted twice a day.) We then toured the rail sheds outside the factory gates, took measurements of places where equipment was scheduled to be installed, and returned to the dacha for lunch. On the television, I saw images of the Second World War being broadcast. I quickly realized what day it was and turned to my Soviet hosts. “This is the anniversary of the German attack on the Soviet Union,” I said. “Are there any ceremonies taking place to mark the occasion? If so, I’d like to attend, and pay my respect.” My hosts were appreciative of my grasp of history but told me that there were no official ceremonies. “The veterans and their families might visit a memorial,” they said. “But the official holiday for the Great Patriotic War is on May 9, Victory Day.” That night, as we walked along the lakefront in Votkinsk, my hosts took me to a downtown memorial. There were bundles of flowers laid out in front. As we watched, families would pass by and lay more flowers. “In America,” I told my hosts, “we have an official holiday to mark our entry into the Second World War: ‘Pearl Harbor Day’. I’m surprised you don’t have something similar here to commemorate the German attack.” The Ministry of Foreign Affairs official thought about what I said for a moment, before responding: “Perhaps we chose to memorialize the victory. Those were dark days. Maybe it is best to remember them in private.” On June 22, 2022, I watched the Russian president lay flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and at the Hero Cities memorials, in commemoration of the Day of Remembrance and Sorrow. Eighty-one years ago, on that date, the forces of Nazi Germany began their attack on the Soviet Union, beginning nearly four years of conflict that impacted virtually every family in the country. At least 27 million Soviet citizens lost their lives. As I watched the solemn ceremony, I was struck by the contrast between the conversation I had in Votkinsk some 34 years prior and the events of the present. What had changed? In short, history. Or at least how a nation collectively opted to remember its history. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought with it a fundamental change in the way Russians viewed their history. The Soviet Union was largely denigrated, and that which had been celebrated in the name of Soviet glory was left to languish amid an atmosphere of frustration and recrimination. Russia, as a nation, floundered, its identity as confused as its future. To create a foundation of historical fact that could be used to redefine the character of modern Russia, its first president, Boris Yeltsin, in 1996, instituted June 22 as a national memory day, the Day of Remembrance and Sorrow. In keeping with the solemnity of the occasion the law mandated that there be no entertainment programs broadcast on TV or radio. Over the years, June 22 has grown to resonate with many of the Russian people. History, it seems, is learned. More than fifty years after the end of the Great Patriotic War, the people of Russia were compelled to re-learn an aspect of their collective history that had been neglected by earlier generations. The May 9 celebration remained, for sure – everyone wants to celebrate a victory, especially one as grand as the occasion of the defeat of Nazi Germany. Days of remembrance and sorrow, however, are more difficult to embrace, especially by those who have not been directly touched by the events occasioned. While it is true that every family in Russia was affected in some way, shape, or form by the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, as the grandparents who fought in the war die off, and the children of those veterans themselves age and deal with the realities of the present, the grandchildren are left contemplating a nation whose identity could very well be dominated by the challenges of the future. By making June 22 a holiday of remembrance and sorrow, where no extraneous entertainment will be brooked lest the memories of what happened be somehow sullied, Russia is manufacturing history. This manufacturing is not being done by fabrication or distortion, but by simply taking the building blocks of history that had been allowed to collapse from past neglect and shaping them into something that the present generation could identify with, absorb, and make a real and present part of their identity as citizens of Russia. In the United States, we have allowed the memory of what happened to be erased from our collective history and confined it to the myriad instances of family lore, until it dwindled to mean nothing for the nation as a whole. Not so in Russia. The Russians put a halt to the whisper game, instead ensuring that everyone was told the same thing at the same time about a horrible event in their collective past that should never be forgotten, lest such events happen again. There is a reason why the issue of “denazification” in Ukraine resonates with Russians more so than anywhere else in the world. Russia has, through its actions, made sure that June 22 will not go the way of December 7. I think my grandmother would have approved."
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558294-security-guarantees-ukraine-germany/,Germany comments on potential security guarantees for Kiev,"Security guarantees for Ukraine will be inferior to those afforded to NATO members, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Sunday. In an interview with ARD radio, Scholz said Berlin has been discussing the issue of security guarantees with its “close friends,” and the process is ongoing. “It is clear that it will not be the same as for a member of NATO,” he stressed, referring to the principle of collective security, which applies within the alliance but not to third parties. However, he said the issue of providing some security guarantees for Kiev is “now being carefully prepared by diplomats” for when the current conflict ends. In the interim, Scholz said the West would maintain pressure on Russia through the use of sanctions. Ukraine had earlier signaled that it would give up its NATO ambitions and agree to remain neutral as demanded by Russia in exchange for security guarantees from the West. On July 1, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the establishment of a special group on international security guarantees for Kiev. The group is headed by former NATO secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and Zelensky has said it includes “influential figures from various democratic countries of the world – Australia, USA, Sweden, Great Britain, Germany, Poland, France, Italy and, of course, Ukraine.” “The main task of the group is to develop a format of security guarantees for our country, which will work long-term and realistically, so that there are no future aggressions,” the Ukrainian leader said. In late April, Zelensky set out his vision for how security guarantees would work. He said guarantors would need to make decisions within hours rather than days or weeks, as any delay in providing emergency military assistance would cost lives. The president explained that he is not insisting on NATO-style provisions. He also emphasized that nobody knows how NATO would act if one of its members were attacked, as such a situation has never arisen and “God forbid that it arises.” While a number of countries have indicated willingness to provide such guarantees, no one has officially offered them so far. Moscow, which has long viewed NATO’s expansion eastwards as a direct threat to its security interests, cited the possible accession of Ukraine as one of the key reasons for its decision to launch a military attack in February. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558291-us-embassy-address-donetsk/,US Embassy reacts to Donbass-themed address change,"The US Embassy in Moscow has removed from its website the building’s old street address, which was “nullified” by the city authorities, while also failing to indicate the new address, Donetsk People’s Republic Square. The embassy replaced the traditional address with the geographical coordinates: 55,75566° N, 37,58028° E. The former address – 8 Bolshoy Deviatinsky Pereulok – can still be found in a tab listing all US diplomatic missions in Russia, even though it was renamed by authorities in the Russian capital on June 22. On that day, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin’s official website published a statement announcing the change. “The US Embassy in Russia has received a new official address. Now the diplomatic mission is located at: Building 1, blocks 1–9, Donetsk People's Republic Square, Presnensky District, Moscow, Russian Federation,” the mayor’s office announced. According to the document, the new name of the square along with several alternatives had been put to a vote via the city’s online portal, Active Citizen. A total of 278,684 Moscow residents took part, the statement said. The Donetsk People’s Republic Square option garnered the support of 45% of respondents. Both Donbass republics – the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics – declared their independence back in 2014 following the Maidan coup in Kiev. After an eight-year conflict, which the German- and French-brokered Minsk agreements sought to resolve without success, the republics claimed in early 2022 that Ukraine was poised to retake them by force. Days later, the leaders of the DPR and LPR asked Russia to officially recognize them. Both chambers of the Russian parliament adopted a bill calling on President Vladimir Putin to do so, and on February 21, the Russian head of state signed the recognition documents. Over the last eight years, Moscow has consistently accused Washington of destabilizing the situation in Ukraine. Since the beginning of its so-called “special military operation,” Russian authorities have warned the West against “pumping up” Ukraine with weapons, claiming it will only prolong the fighting. Moscow is not the first city to name or rename a square or street outside a foreign power’s embassy in a symbolic manner. Back in February 2018, Washington authorities named the square outside the Russian embassy after murdered Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, who was gunned down on a bridge outside the Kremlin on February 27, 2015. Russian law enforcement later apprehended the hitmen involved in the crime, who were sentenced to lengthy prison terms. However, the people who ordered the killing of Nemtsov have not been identified to date."
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558202-jens-stoltenberg-ukrainian-civil-war/,NATO boss lets the cat out of the bag: US-led bloc has ‘been preparing since 2014’ to use Ukraine for proxy conflict with Russia,"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg may have said the quiet part out loud on Wednesday when he revealed to reporters that NATO’s push into Eastern Europe since 2014 was done specifically with Russia in mind. “The reality is also that we have been preparing for this since 2014,” he said. “That is the reason that we have increased our presence in the eastern part of the alliance, why NATO allies have started to invest more in defense, and why we have increased [our] readiness.” The NATO chief went on to insist that Russia has been “using force in the eastern Donbass since 2014.” What he neglected to mention, though, was the role Western powers played in the outbreak of civil violence in Kiev on February 24, 2013 that led to the Maidan coup and, ultimately, to the current situation. The US and its influence on the ground in Ukraine, channelled through ""civil society"" groups it bankrolled, was largely responsibility for that mess. Even Victoria ‘F**k the EU’ Nuland (then-US assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs) admitted as much in April 2014 when she said Washington had invested $5 billion dollars into “spreading democracy” in Ukraine – apparently because such efforts worked so well before. Russia’s greatest ‘crime’ at the time was to provide an alternative route to national development for Kiev. The US Diplomatic Forces flew into swift action on November 21, 2013 when the government of then-Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych made the sudden decision not to sign the European Union-Ukraine Association Agreement (AA), which the West had been insisting upon, opting for closer ties to Russia and the Eurasian Economic Union. Here is where all the talk about “building democracy” was exposed as the lie it was. “It would be a huge shame to see five years of work and preparation go to waste if the AA is not signed in the near future,” Nuland said at the December 13, 2013 US-Ukraine Foundation conference. “So it is time to finish the job.” That sounds more like an implicit threat than any sort of call to democratic principles. As Ukraine would soon discover, Washington considers as ‘democratic’ only those countries that obey its will. While Nuland was taking multiple trips to Kiev in the midst of the Maidan melee, passing out snacks alongside John McCain and the US Ambassador, very strange things were happening that have never been adequately explained. To this day no definite result has come from investigations into the infamous ‘Maidan snipers’ that killed dozens of both protesters and police officers. Conflicting reports and claims by various sides name them as working for the embattled government, the protesters, Russia – all in the name of stoking tensions further. According to some of the snipers themselves, they received direct orders from a US officer. Would that be something that NATO (or someone linked to NATO) could have sanctioned? It’s impossible to say with any certainty, but the killings went far towards enraging the masses, which ultimately drove Yanukovych out of the country. Meanwhile, Reuters, then not yet so sure of Kiev’s innocence, asked (back in 2014) why no one was charged with killing policemen, especially when it is considered that the prosecutors and the minister in charge of the investigation all played a part in fueling the uprising. By way of evidence, the General Prosecutor of Ukraine Vitaly Yarema was videotaped striking a traffic cop in the face during the protests. To what degree were Yarema and numerous other Kiev officials corrupted and compromised by Western money will never be known, but it’s a question still worthy of asking. Another thing to question is why the Western media barely reported Kiev’s shelling of the Donbass, home to millions of Russian speakers and passport holders, over the course of the last eight years? At the same time, numerous reports – many of them from Ukrainian citizens caught up in the fighting – describe atrocities and war crimes being committed by Ukrainian forces, many of them outright neo-Nazis, such the Azov Battalion. These forces have been indiscriminately bombing schools, hospitals and residential areas, and, to emphasize, these eyewitness accounts are coming from the Ukrainian people themselves. Back to NATO and Ukraine. The brutal reality, as summed up by Jens Stoltenberg’s remark, is that Ukraine is already a de facto proxy member of NATO, and has been since at least 2014. As the scholar John Mearsheimer explained, “The alliance began training the Ukrainian military in 2014, averaging 10,000 trained troops annually over the next eight years.” The arming of Ukraine happened regardless of who was in the White House. In December 2017, the Trump administration, together with other NATO states, began sending ‘defensive’ weapons to Ukraine, while Kiev took a major role in military exercises held on the Russian border. The US and Ukraine have been co-hosting Exercise Sea Breeze, yearly naval drills in the Black Sea. The July 2021 iteration was the largest to date, including navies from 32 countries. In September the same year, the Ukrainian army led ‘Rapid Trident 2021’, which the US Army describes as “A US Army Europe and Africa-assisted annual exercise designed to enhance the interoperability among allied and partner nations.” The key word here is “interoperability,” which would give ‘non-NATO partner’ Ukraine much of what was already being given to regular paying client states. Yet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky just keeps asking for more, and NATO is happy to oblige. Some may argue that Ukraine was absolutely right to join forces with NATO, considering that Russia had ‘annexed’ the Crimean Republic and absorbed it into its ‘empire’. That’s the view being sowed across NATO and its partner states. In reality, the Crimean population held a democratic referendum that asked whether they wanted to rejoin Russia as a federal subject, or if they wanted to restore the 1992 Crimean constitution and peninsula's status as a part of Ukraine. The result should have silenced the critics, but instead it just infuriated them more: a 97% vote for integration of the region into the Russian Federation with an 83% voter turnout. Consequently, President Putin signed a decree, after its formal ratification in the State Duma, recognizing Crimea as a sovereign state –without so much as a drop of blood being shed. It would take a dyed-in-the-wool Russophobe to take in all of the above and not, at the very least, understand why Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine."
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558288-belarus-explains-nuke-talks/,Belarus explains nuke talks with Russia,"The idea of returning nuclear weapons to Belarus was prompted by Poland’s wish to deploy atomic weapons from the US on its territory, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko explained on Saturday. “This topic with the President of Russia appeared after the Poles turned to the Americans and asked them to bring nuclear weapons to Poland. Then I told President Putin: ‘Why are we pretending that nothing is happening?’” Lukashenko said in his Independence Day speech in Minsk, the nation's capital. Lukashenko explained that his talks with Putin on the matter should not be considered as “nuclear blackmail.” He claimed that the conclusion that Minsk should be able to provide a reciprocal response to potential hostile action “within 24 hours” came after a long period of consultations. “To do this, we need to prepare. And we will prepare. We do not threaten anyone, we do not blackmail anyone,” he said. On June 25, Lukashenko asked his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to help Belarus “to adapt” Su-35 planes, which, he stressed, “can carry nuclear charges.” Putin gave the green light to modernization of “a fairly large group” of aircraft and also pledged that “within the next few months” Russia will send its ally Iskander-M tactical missile systems, which can use both ballistic and cruise missiles “in both usual and nuclear versions.” The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later stressed that there was no talk about the transfer of missiles with nuclear weapons to Minsk. In his Independence Day speech Lukashenko reminded of the fact that in the past Belarus has moved its nuclear arsenal to Russia and therefore he has the right to demand “from the president of fraternal Russia” to ensure that the Belarusian state border is properly protected. “This is what I did,” he said. Lukashenko has always criticized his predecessor’s decision to withdraw nuclear weapons from Belarus, calling it the “worst mistake.” In early April, Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski said that if the US asked his country to store its nuclear weapons, Warsaw “would be open to that.” “It would significantly increase the deterrent against Moscow,” the premier said, adding that, at the moment, such a question is not on the agenda. Dmitry Peskov responded to Kaczynski’s remarks, saying that such a line from Polish leadership causes “deep concern.” “The line is extremely militant, anti-Russian. The proposed actions can only lead to a further increase in tension on the continent,” he said. American officials, meanwhile, insist that it is Russia that has upped the nuclear ante, with both Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair General Mark Milley accusing the country of “nuclear saber-rattling” following an April media interview with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who argued the risk of atomic war is “serious, real, and we must not underestimate it.”"
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558281-lugansk-control-shoigu-minister/,Donbass republic fully liberated – Russian defense minister,"The last remnants of Ukrainian forces have been driven out of the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR), Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced on Sunday. He reported the news to President Vladimir Putin, the Defense Ministry said in a statement. Shoigu said Russian troops and Donbass forces had completely seized Lisichansk, the last major city which had remained under Ukrainian control since 2014, when the LPR declared its independence shortly after a coup in Kiev. Russia and Ukraine reported heavy fighting around Lisichansk earlier this week, with the most fierce combat occurring at the city’s oil refinery. News of the capture of Lisichansk comes after Ukrainian troops retreated from Severodonetsk, a nearby city on the opposite side of the Seversky Donets River, last week. The fighting for Severodonetsk had lasted for several months. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558197-ukraine-decided-eradicate-rus-culture/,"With attempts to 'cancel' Pushkin, Ukraine's drive to eradicate Russian language and culture has reached the level of farce","The first attempts to divide Ukrainian citizens into ‘natives’ and ‘outsiders’ began almost immediately after the country gained independence in 1991, and have continued with varying degrees of intensity to this day. However, since the Western-backed 2014 Maidan coup, which overthrew the elected government and split the country, these efforts have acquired a truly all-encompassing scale with a clearly anti-Russian orientation. Over recent years, the Russian language issue played a specific role – with a ban on using the tongue in various settings, from the media and education to government agencies. Now, the Ukrainian authorities have begun to demolish monuments to Russian cultural and political figures, as well as renaming streets and squares named after them. What consequences can the next wave of de-Russification of Ukraine have, and how capable is Russia of influencing this situation during its ongoing military offensive? The course towards Ukrainization was taken, with some reservations, immediately after the country gained independence in 1991. The first long-term programs aimed at inducing educational institutions and the media to use the official state language appeared in the 90s. “Ukrainization is the restoration of justice,” the country’s second president, Leonid Kuchma, wrote in his landmark book, ""Ukraine is not Russia."" But at that time, the Russian and Russian-speaking population was still able to create political movements, operate cultural centers, and use its native language in the public sphere. This balance was finally broken after the events of 2014, when the struggle against everything linked to Moscow became a symbol of the development of a new statehood. From then on, Russians were given the choice of either completely abandoning their identity, becoming Ukrainians, and learning a foreign language in their native land, or remaining a national group without full rights. This is despite the provisions of Article 10 of the Ukrainian Constitution, which guarantees the free promotion and use of the Russian language. In the period from 2020 to 2022, a number of acts were adopted at different levels to implement the policy of Ukrainization: At the same time, statistics from recent years have shown that Ukraine has made little progress in this regard, remaining a solidly bilingual state. Data from Google, which contradicts the statistics released by the Ukrainian government, has revealed that most of its Ukrainian users use Russian. Moreover, a survey, conducted by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) at the end of 2020, indicates that almost 50% of Ukrainians consider the Russian language to be a historical asset that needs to be maintained. At the same time, about 60% of residents believed that Ukrainian would become the country’s main language in the future, against 32% who predicted that Russian would reattain its status as an official state language. The situation remained fairly stable, radically changing only after February 24, when Russia launched its “special military operation”. Although there are no statistics indicating changes in language preferences so far, it is difficult to deny that a considerable part of the Russian-speaking population, which previously sympathized with Russia or was apolitical, has revised its views on loyalty to Ukraine. That is why, in most of the country, the current policy of de-Russification is perceived, if not positively, at least with an understanding that it is a catalyst for nation-building in the face of conflict. In other words, even among Russian-speaking Ukrainians, the opinion that Ukrainization is the right path, a kind of ‘return to roots’, has become more popular. This process has slowly intensified since the events of 2014. Even then, all public protests against Ukrainization were considered to be acts hostile to the government and the nation, which were organized by openly ‘pro-Russian’ political forces. Propaganda also partially contributed to this. The population was convinced that the Ukrainian language had been artificially supplanted by Russian in Ukraine, and that it should be 'returned', even in regions where it had never existed before. After Crimea and the Donbass broke away from Kiev, there were considerably fewer regions in the country with a high proportion of Russian speakers, and it was even easier for the authorities to ignore their opinion. Moreover, most of the country’s residents now understand Ukrainian well and have no problems if they need to use it. Consequently, there is no obvious opposition to the prohibitive measures. Meanwhile, the de-Russification policy is gaining momentum. For example, very soon, it will be illegal to publish books by foreign authors in Russian, as well as books written by Russian citizens. It will only be possible to publish classics in Russian legally. “Russian books written in the original language can be published in Ukraine with serious restrictions. There are no limits on publishing Russian classics in Russian, but it will be impossible to import, publish, and distribute popular foreign literature translated into Russian. Such books should be translated from the original language into Ukrainian,” Yulia Grishina, a member of the national parliament’s Committee on Education, Science, and Innovation, said after the Verkhovna Rada adopted a law banning the import of printed products from Russia and Belarus. In addition, Ukrainian schools will no longer study the classical works of Russian literature – for example, Leo Tolstoy’s novel, War and Peace. However, Ukraine’s First Deputy Minister of Education and Science, Andrey Vitrenko, claims that the list of works by Russian writers to be banned in Ukrainian schools has not yet been drawn up. Despite this, the director of the Ukrainian Institute of Books, Alexandra Koval, hastened to calculate that millions of books that she considers harmful to citizens will have to be removed from Ukrainian libraries. “Of course, I want to do it faster, but it would be good if at least ideologically harmful literature published in Soviet times, as well as Russian literature with anti-Ukrainian content, were removed before the end of the year,” says Koval. Her views were echoed by Ukraine’s Minister of Culture, Alexander Tkachenko, who believes that all the impounded books “can go to recycling.” Besides the prohibition on printed materials, from September 1, the use of Russian will banned in schools in many parts of Ukraine, even in the country’s southeastern regions where Russian is the predominant language, such as in the cities of Odessa, Nikolaev, and Kharkov. In the western parts of the country, local authorities have gone even further. For example, in the Khmelnytsky and Ivano-Frankovsk Regions, a moratorium has been imposed on the public use of Russian-language cultural works in any form. The original idea was for the pause to last until the end of the “special military operation”. For example, in Ivano-Frankovsk, a local musician who sang in Russian was reportedly beaten on the street. At the end of 2020, Ukraine reported an unusual achievement – the last two monuments in the country dedicated to the leader of the world proletariat, Vladimir Lenin, were discovered and demolished. Ukraine’s ‘Lenocide’ began during the 2013-2014 political crisis, which was sparked by Euromaidan. The process was kicked off by dismantling the Lenin monument in Kiev in December of 2013. No criminal or civil charges were ever filed as a result of the unauthorized destruction of that monument. This provoked a wave of monument demolitions in other parts of the country. In 2015, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a package of laws on decommunization and the elimination of Soviet monuments. Soviet symbols, including the anthem of the Ukrainian SSR, were also banned, and the Communist Party of Ukraine (KPU) was shut down. Place names associated with the Soviet Union were targeted as well, and cities and streets began to be renamed en masse. This wasn’t about restoring historical names – place names from the time of the Russian Empire were also abolished as ‘colonial’. The opinion of local residents was not taken into account, even if they actively opposed this, as was the case with renaming Kirovograd to Kropyvnytskyi. Before the USSR, the city, founded in the 18th century, was called Elisavetgrad, and the majority of citizens voted for this version of the name. Since the beginning of Ukraine’s decommunization drive, 2,500 Soviet monuments have been dismantled, while 987 settlements and 52,000 streets have been renamed. At the same time, the nationalists have emphasized from the very beginning that the erasure of the Soviet past was part of a larger project aimed not so much at decommunization, but at de-Russifying the country – namely, the destruction of any reference to connections between Ukrainian and Russian culture. “Decolonization is getting rid of the legacy that can be used to restore the empire,” said the former head of the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory, Vladimir Viatrovich. Now, the next stage of ‘decolonization’ is underway: the Ukrainian authorities have moved from demolishing monuments to Soviet figures to dismantling those dedicated to Russian cultural icons, like the poet Alexander Pushkin. If earlier this initiative was about de-Sovietization, now it’s about cleansing the country of all Russian historical heritage. And this applies, first of all, to cities directly connected with Russian culture and history. For example, in Kharkov, a monument to Prince Alexander Nevsky was demolished, and in Kiev, debates continue about the need to take down a monument to the writer Mikhail Bulgakov, which was erected at his house-museum on Andreevsky Descent. In Odessa, some demand the removal of a monument to Russian Empress Catherine the Great and General Alexander Suvorov, the founders of the city. A letter addressed to the chairman of the Odessa State Regional Administration by Maxim Marchenko stated that “Russia’s aggression obliges Ukrainians to rethink and reassess the two countries’ history and relations on a fundamental level… Newly-voiced imperial narratives, as well as Soviet colonial narratives, are being used today to justify Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, which has led to a broad public demand for de-Russification, as these narratives have been deliberately linked to the colonization of Ukrainian territory at all levels of the imperial Russian and Soviet-communist systems.” The Odessans themselves joke that the current situation resembles an anecdote related to the demolition of monuments and renaming of Soviet place names. At an Odessa marine terminal, a mother and her young son are hurrying to catch the steamship Sergei Yesenin. – Mom, who is Sergey Yesenin? the son asks. – Stop bugging me! she replies. A passing dock worker intervenes in the conversation: – Boy, why are you bothering your mom? How can she know that Sergei Yesenin used to be Lazar Kaganovich? (RT reference: Sergey Yesenin is a Russian poet who died in 1926, Kaganovich is an associate of Stalin who fell into disgrace in the late ’50s: everything named after him was subsequently renamed). De-Russification is also in full swing in Kiev, where new names for metro stations and streets have already been decided upon. For example, Tula Square in the Obolonsky District is to be renamed ‘Heroes of the UPA Street’ (Nazi-collaborators the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, banned in Russia), and a street named after Soviet General Vasily Tupikov, who died near Poltava, will now bear the name of Andrey Melnik, an active participant in the Ukrainian nationalist movement during the first half of the 20th century. They also want to name Bakunin Street (a well-known anarchist theorist) in honor of the writer Ulas Samchuk, the editor of the Volyn newspaper, which was published in Rivne during the Nazi occupation and contained anti-Semitic materials. To show how serious they are about de-Russifying the country, the Ukrainian authorities have created an expert Council on De-Russification, Decommunization, and Decolonization to eradicate Soviet and Russian cultural heritage more effectively. At the same time, the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine claims that the approach to getting rid of monuments will be ‘civilized’. “It is unlikely that you will see hundreds of ‘Pushkin Streets’ in any European country. Of course, they should only be located where it is appropriate,” said Ukrainian Minister of Culture Aleksandr Tkachenko, noting that experts will help decide which names and monuments to remove and which to leave. While streets connected with Russia are being renamed in Odessa, metro stations are being rebranded in Kiev, and monuments to Pushkin, Maxim Gorky (Soviet author — RT), and other Soviet figures are being removed from public spaces in other cities. Although most members of the political elite advocate the steady adoption of appropriate measures, some politicians are skeptical about eradicating Russian culture and language, as they remain relevant to a large part of the country’s indigenous population. Concern about the growing hatred of everything Russian has been expressed by the mayor of Odessa, Gennady Trukhanov, who opposed the renaming of Pushkin Street, explaining that “Odessa is the intercultural capital of Ukraine.” In addition, Trukhanov pointed out that Odessa was founded by Russian Empress Catherine II. A similar opinion was shared by Daniil Getmantsev, a Verkhovna Rada deputy from the president’s Servant of the People party, who spoke out against the ban of Russian literature in schools, claiming that Bulgakov, Pushkin, and Tolstoy transcend nationality. Words of bewilderment can also be heard at a higher level. For example, the notorious adviser to the president of Ukraine, Alexey Arestovich, spoke in support of the Russian language and attacked Ukrainian activists. In his Telegram channel, he wrote that all areas that the activists reach are beginning to deteriorate: Ukrainian culture impresses and captures “until activists were allowed there,” Arestovich writes. At the same time, he believes “the Russian language issue is fundamental to the future of Ukraine.” In his opinion, if the ‘nationalist’ and ‘Euro-optimistic’ projects win over the country, Ukraine will lose parts of its territories forever, join the European Union, and dissolve into a ‘family of peoples’ of the West. “If we want to remain within our borders, lead Putin’s Russia to collapse, regain our history, and become a strong state, we need another project. In this case, the Russian language is needed, which means Russian culture and a set of ideas associated with it,” Arestovich is convinced. However, Arestovich, Getmantsev, and Trukhanov will hardly be able to stop the general growth of Russophobia in Ukraine. Much more important in the political discourse are the conditions Ukraine will have to meet to join the EU. Among them is “the reform of the legislative framework on the rights of national minorities, which is currently being prepared according to the recommendations of the Venice Commission,” said the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Andrey Yermak. The law On Full General Secondary Education eliminated all Russian-speaking schools in Ukraine as of September 1, 2020. Since then, they have been conducting classes in Ukrainian from the 5th grade, while national languages are introduced as a separate subject. At the time, the Venice Commission stated that Article 7 of this law violates the rights of national minorities to education in their native language. Later, Ukraine adopted a law on indigenous peoples that allowed Crimean Tatars, Karaites, and Crimeans to study in their own tongue, and wider opportunities for EU languages were also spelled out, but the possibility of studying in Russian was omitted. However, these concessions have failed to satisfy the European Commission’s conditions for the country’s membership. Given the pace of de-Russification that began after the start of Russia’s “special operation,” whether Ukraine will fulfill them is a big question. On the other hand, it will not be easy for Ukraine to ignore these conditions. Hungary (an EU member), which has long criticized Ukraine for its language policy and infringement of the rights of the Hungarian minority, will surely insist on their implementation. And without Budapest’s vote, Kiev can't join the EU. “In the Odessa Region, Russian language and literature textbooks have been removed, and all Russian writers have been eradicated from the educational program. In Nikolaev, the Russian language has been banned in schools… Residents of Ukraine shouldn’t be in a hurry to throw out Russian language textbooks. Put it off, let them sit on the shelf until September 1, so you won’t have to look for them later,” said the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, commenting on Ukraine’s de-Russification policy. Since the first weeks of the “special operation,” Russian officials, particularly Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, have never ceased declaring that one of Russia’s goals in waging this conflict was to restore the rights of the Russian language in accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine and to repeal anti-Russian laws. After 2014, Russia lost almost all political levers of influence on its neighbor, and any attempts of Ukrainian citizens to self-organize within the country were interpreted as separatism and fraught with serious consequences. Given the circumstances, Russia had only one recourse: to develop a broad strategy for political action and build up its cultural and humanitarian influence in Ukraine, as total de-Russification of the once ‘fraternal republic’ would inevitably lead to the emergence of a Ukrainian political nation with a rigidly and irrevocably anti-Russian stance. It hasn’t been just Russia’s policy that has led to such radicalism, but also the whole logic of Ukraine as a political project, which from the very beginning has been built on a national identity that opposes internal and external enemies. These include the ‘Yanukovych regime’ (the former president overthrown by Euromaidan – RT), the ‘quilted jackets’ (a Soviet garment and name that Ukrainian nationalists use for Ukraine’s pro-Russian population – RT) of the southeast, the country’s communist heritage, and the ‘aggressor country’. The situation has changed: With Russia's military recording victory after victory in the East, and large parts of the south under Moscow's control, Kiev's military is creaking. This makes the post-Maidan order more brittle and may hasten the end of the Zelensky regime. It also allows Moscow to implement cultural and humanitarian projects in the areas where its forces are present. The Western-backed leader has banned the country's largest opposition party and jailed his opponents. But recent history show us that things can change very quickly in Ukraine."
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558279-belgorod-shelling-ballistic-missiles/,Ukraine fires ballistic missiles at Russian city – MoD,"Ukraine launched three Tochka-U ballistic missiles loaded with cluster munitions at the Russian city of Belgorod, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Sunday. It added that all three had been intercepted mid-air, but that parts of one of the missiles had hit a house. Regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said that three people were killed and four injured overnight. He added that 11 apartment buildings and at least 39 smaller houses were damaged. Gladkov later said that the death toll had grown to four. Three of the victims are Ukrainian nationals and one is a Russian citizen, he added. Russian news outlet Baza later reported that two more bodies were recovered from under the rubble, raising the death toll to five. This has not yet been confirmed by officials. Belgorod is located around 40 kilometers from the Russia-Ukraine border. Defense Ministry spokesman Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov said that Ukraine had also sent two Tu-143 Reys drones, “loaded with explosives,” towards Kursk, another Russian city close to the border. He said both drones were destroyed by air defenses before reaching the city. Konashenkov said that Ukraine targeted residential areas, which had “no military sites.” The Russian authorities have repeatedly accused Ukraine of shelling cities and villages close to the border. Moscow previously warned that it would hit Ukrainian “decision-making centers, including Kiev” if attacks on Russian territory did not stop.Kiev accused Russian troops of attacking residential areas and killing civilians throughout Ukraine. Moscow insists its forces are only striking military targets.Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.”In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558277-german-minister-boycott-culture/,German minister speaks out against boycott of Russian culture,"Boycotting Russian culture is “completely wrong,” German Federal Commissioner for Culture and the Media Claudia Roth said in an interview with Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung, which was published on Saturday. Some Western institutions have started to remove Russian-linked works of art and culture since the beginning of Moscow’s military offensive in Ukraine in late February. In the interview, Roth cited a recent story involving a mayor in North Rhine-Westphalia who banned a youth orchestra from playing music by the famous Russian composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky. He subsequently had to make a U-turn and allow the music to be performed following public backlash. However, Roth claimed that there is still “a great deal of uncertainty” when it comes to dealing with Russian culture. “I believe that a boycott is completely wrong, because it is often the Russian artists who try to maintain the last freedoms,” the minister said. She added that Russian classic culture, be it music or literature, should not be boycotted either. “I’m not going to let Putin take Chekhov from me!” she said. Debates about how to deal with Russian culture amid Moscow’s “special military operation” are ongoing in many Western countries with some German politicians among the most outspoken critics of culture bans. Sergey Loznitsa, a prominent Ukrainian director and screenwriter of Belarusian origin, said in his acceptance speech at the Cannes Film Festival that all cultural figures had suddenly found themselves “on the front line.” He spoke out against ‘canceling’ Russian culture, claiming that “there is no logic or sense” to respond to the “barbarism” by “demanding the destruction or abolition of what has always opposed barbarism.” The Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra in Wales removed Pyotr Tchaikovsky’s famous 1812 Overture, which celebrates Russia’s successful defense against Napoleon, from its program, claiming it was “inappropriate.” Meanwhile, a university in Milan, Italy tried to suspend a course on acclaimed Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky, saying it was trying to avoid tensions by focusing on Ukrainian authors instead. After a public backlash, the decision was reversed. The Royal Opera House also canceled the traditional summer season of Bolshoi ballet, while Netflix paused the production of ‘Anna K’, an adaptation of Leo Tolstoy’s novel ‘Anna Karenina’. Russian President Vladimir Putin has likened efforts by the elite in the West to weaponize “cancel culture” against famous Russian composers and writers to Nazi book burnings."
2022-07-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/558276-belgorod-suspected-shelling-russia/,Three dead after suspected shelling in Russian city near Ukraine,"Three people have been killed, four injured, and several houses damaged in powerful explosion in Belgorod, a Russian city 40km from the border with Ukraine, according to the regional governor. “We currently have information about three fatalities,” Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on his Telegram channel on Sunday morning, adding that the city’s air defenses may have been activated overnight. Russian news outlet Baza later reported that two more bodies were discovered, raising the death toll to five. This has not been confirmed by officials. The injured residents include a 10-year-old child, while 11 apartment buildings and at least 39 houses are damaged. It appears to be the worst single-day damage in the city since Russia launched its military campaign in Ukraine in late February. Gladkov earlier said several “loud bangs” were heard overnight and a building had caught fire. “We are working to determine the causes,” he wrote, adding that air defenses may have detected an incoming projectile. Russia’s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper reported that Belgorod was shelled from the territory of Ukraine at around 3am local time. Security camera footage, posted on social media, shows what appears to be a large explosion in the city. Also on Sunday, Kursk Region Governor Roman Starovoyt said two Ukrainian drones were shot down after crossing into Russia. The Russian authorities repeatedly accused Ukraine of shelling cities and villages close to the border. Last month, officials said houses were damaged in the village of Hotmyzhsk, also in the Belgorod Region. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/558275-uzbekistan-protests-deaths-injuries-report/,"Deaths, injuries reported amid mass protests in Uzbekistan","Massive protests engulfed northwest Uzbekistan on Friday over the Central Asian nation's plan to revoke key rights from its autonomous region, Karakalpakstan, amid constitutional changes. The standoff between police and protesters turned violent, with videos on social media appearing to show people severely injured, and bodies lying on the streets. “Horrible scenes; an entire street covered with blood,” reads a caption to one video published by a Telegram channel run from neighboring Kazakhstan. Footage apparently taken from the roof of a low-rise building showed red liquid covering parts of a road, with an armored police vehicle driving nearby. A loose crowd of protesters can also be seen approaching a squad of police wearing protective gear and carrying shields. The officers do not appear to be taking any aggressive actions. Footage appeared on social networks, shot, presumably, in #Uzbekistan, in the city of Nukus (the capital of the autonomous #Karakalpakstan). They show blood on the pavement after the demonstrations. pic.twitter.com/lXBafm9CrQ Other videos showed protesters supposedly carrying the injured to safety, and several people covered in blood, lying on the streets of the city of Nukus in northwest Uzbekistan. According to posts on Telegram, they were injured by police during the unrest. Several photos also showed what appear to be dead bodies. RT has not so far been able to independently verify the authenticity of the videos and photos. The Uzbek authorities have so far not commented on the casualties. Uzbekistan’s President, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, imposed a state of emergency in the Uzbek autonomous region of Karakalpakstan on Saturday, due to the unrest. Protests continue in Nukus, #Uzbekistan, the capital of #Karakalpakstan. Clashes between protesters and security forces are reported. There is information about the deaths as a result of the protests, but their exact number is unknown, pic.twitter.com/Yb8AydMD7d The emergency measures, which take effect on Sunday night, will remain in place until early August, the presidential administration said in a statement on Telegram. The restrictions will include a nighttime curfew between 21:00 and 07:00 local time, Uzbek media have reported. Mirziyoyev arrived in Nukus on Saturday and suggested removing some of the most controversial constitutional amendments during a meeting with the regional lawmakers. The Uzbek Interior Ministry reported arresting a “criminal group” they suspect of masterminding the protests and seeking to illegally seize power in Karakalpakstan. The authorities have also blamed the demonstrations on “malicious foreign interference attempts” provoked through a “targeted” disinformation campaign. 🇺🇿Узбекские силовики перекрыли дорогу на Нукус в поселке Канлыкол. Сообщается, что 10 тысяч человек пытаются прорваться в столицу Каракалпакстана. pic.twitter.com/66gbbSs5OJ The wave of public anger stems from draft constitutional amendments that were made public in late June. The changes were expected to be reviewed by July 5 and later put to a nationwide referendum. The draft changes involve 200 amendments, including a ban on the death penalty. The protests were sparked by two specific passages related to Karakalpakstan – a region covering around 40% of Uzbekistan’s territory that traditionally enjoyed broad autonomy. The draft amendments suggested the region would no longer be called “sovereign” and would be barred from gaining independence from Uzbekistan through a referendum."
2022-07-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/558269-less-training-ukraine-weapons/,Decline in Western training of Ukrainian troops – media,"Ukraine’s forces have received less training over the recent weeks, which impacts their capacity to operate some advanced weapons systems, magazine Foreign Policy (FP) reported on Friday, citing sources. Since the launch of Russia's military offensive in the neighboring country in late February, Ukraine has been constantly asking its Western partners to provide them with more heavy weapons and to do so as quickly as possible. However, as a senior US defense official told FP, “the drumbeat of faster, faster, faster” does not always work well because “the Ukrainians needed to have the training to be able to effectively use these systems.” Meanwhile, the Ukrainian officials cited by the FP, complained on the one hand about the “too slow” pace of Western aid but, on the other hand, admitted that “beyond training for the HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems) and Western artillery, military training for their troops has dipped in recent weeks, leaving them unable to operate more advanced systems.” “For [Ukrainians], it is always going to be too little and too late, for natural reasons. However, sending things without training and logistics is a sure way they’ll have no longevity,” Oscar Jonsson, a researcher at the Swedish Defense University, commented on the matter, as quoted by FP. According to the magazine, Western officials are now “unclear” about what system they can provide next to Kiev. “It could take months to train the Ukrainians to fly F-15 and F-16 jets, even though Ukrainian military officials insist that many of their pilots are currently sidelined without enough planes to fly, giving them the ability to leave the country for training,” the report says. Foreign Policy’s article was published on the same day the Pentagon announced an additional $820-million package of military aid for Ukraine, including two surface-to-air missile defense systems. The new deliveries will include ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), two National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), up to 150,000 rounds of 155mm artillery ammunition, and four additional counter-artillery radars. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his gratitude to the US and personally to President Joe Biden for the package, and especially for NASAMS systems, capable, in his opinion, to “significantly strengthen” Ukrainian air defense. At the end of June, Britain said that it would provide Kiev with “sophisticated air defense systems,” drones, electronic warfare equipment and “thousands of pieces of vital kit” worth £1 billion ($1.2 billion). The announcement came less than two weeks after the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson offered Ukraine a major training program for its troops, “with the potential to train up to 10,000 soldiers every 120 days.” Russia has repeatedly urged the West not to provide Kiev with weapons, saying it will only prolong the conflict and lead to long-term problems. It has warned that Russian forces will consider any foreign weapons on Ukrainian territory as a legitimate target. Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that “pumping up” Ukraine with Western weapons will only lead Russia “to perform more missions on the ground.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-07-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/558268-ukraine-envoy-bandera-remarks-outcry/,Kiev distances itself from envoy over controversial remarks,"Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry has distanced itself from claims made by Kiev’s ambassador to Berlin, which have sparked outrage in Poland and Israel. Earlier the diplomat, Andrey Melnik, denied that Stepan Bandera – a controversial Ukrainian national hero who collaborated with the Nazis during WWII – was implicated in the mass murder of Jews and Poles. There are “no issues” that divide Kiev and Warsaw now, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday as it praised Poland for supporting Ukraine in its ongoing conflict with Russia. Both nations understand “the need to preserve unity,” it added. “The opinion that the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Andrey Melnik expressed in an interview with a German journalist is of his own and does not reflect the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine,” the statement added. The comment came after Poland’s top diplomats demanded Kiev clarify its stance on Bandera and his role in the massacre of Jews and Poles, committed by Ukrainian nationalists along with the Nazis, during the WWII. On Friday, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz sharply criticized Melnik’s views on Bandera. “Such an opinion and such words are absolutely unacceptable,” he told the online news portal Wirtualna Polska. Such words “are inconsistent with reality,” “do not help,” and drive a wedge between Kiev and Warsaw, he added “We are interested in the position of the Ukrainian government,” Przydacz said. Poland’s Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau said on Friday he contacted Ukraine’s top diplomat, Dmitry Kuleba, over what he called “false statements on history” made by Melnik. Rau also thanked Kuleba for “a quick public intervention” on the matter. I had a conversation with my friend, the MFA of Ukraine, @DmytroKuleba, about the false statements on history of @MelnykAndrij . I thanked min. Kuleba for a quick public intervention in this matter. The Israeli embassy in Kiev also denounced Melnik’s words, calling them an “insult” to the memory of Ukrainian nationalists’ victims. “The statement made by the Ukrainian ambassador is a distortion of the historical facts, belittles the Holocaust and is an insult to those who were murdered by Bandera and his people,” the embassy statement read, according to the media. Speaking to German podcaster Tilo Jung on Wednesday, Melnik repeatedly denied Bandera’s involvement in any massacres committed by Ukrainian nationalists and Nazi collaborators during WWII on the territory of the modern-day Ukraine, and insisted he was a hero and a freedom fighter who “acted in a very difficult environment” and had no need to abide by rules. “There are no laws for those who fight for freedom,” Melnik told Jung at that time, insisting Bandera “was no mass murderer of Jews and Poles.” According to data brought up by Jung during the interview, Bandera’s followers, along with the Nazis, murdered a total of 800,000 Jews as well as up to 44,000 Poles in Ukraine during World War II. It is unclear how exactly Kiev resolved the issue, since Melnik appeared to double down on his statements after the interview. On his Twitter page, the outspoken diplomat shared a post by Sergey Sumlenny, former head of the Kiev office of Germany’s Heinrich Boell Fund, where he called on Germans to “humbly shut up about Bandera at last, or (better and recommended) kneel and ask for forgiveness.” Melnik’s caption to the post read: “Worth reading.”"
2022-07-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/558260-hungary-sanctions-oinflation-ceasefire/,Hungary suggests solution to curb global inflation,"A ceasefire in Ukraine instead of anti-Russia sanctions is necessary to stop ‘wartime inflation’, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed on Friday. However, he said his was the only country advocating this solution. Speaking on Radio Kossuth, Orban explained that the majority of EU countries believe in imposing sanctions on Russia. He said Hungary, despite having some “red lines” including an oil embargo, has chosen to swim with the tide on this strategy. However, the prime minister stated that what is needed is not sanctions, but an immediate ceasefire, which would allow both sides to discuss a peace negotiations framework. “It is in the interest of Hungary and all countries to have peace,” Orban said. He added that his government is taking certain economic steps, such as limiting prices for certain products, to curb inflation, but this can only serve as a temporary solution. Stressing that Hungary “must be on the side of peace,” Orban emphasized that the events of the past few months made it clear to Budapest that the speed of the country’s military development should increase substantially. He explained that the situation in Ukraine is “very serious” and “there is every chance” that the front would move closer to Hungary. “If we want peace, we must significantly increase our military capabilities now,” he said, adding that “superhuman work” would be needed for that. NATO, he added, “also feels that there is a problem.” “The eastern wing of the alliance should be strengthened,” he said. EU statistics office Eurostat said on Friday that inflation in the euro area had jumped 8.6% in June on an annual basis as the cost-of-living crisis deepened. The rate was up from 8.1% recorded in May, and was higher than expected by economists. Recession is a period of economic decline, when trade and industrial activity drops, which gradually leads to a fall in GDP. It may result from regulatory actions that focus on battling inflation instead of stimulating economic growth, for instance with rate hikes. Since the start of the year, many nations, including the US and most European countries, have been fighting soaring prices propeled by the Ukraine crisis and anti-Russia sanctions. And now more and more analysts warn that by prioritizing the fight against inflation over growth, these countries will inevitably find their economic growth slowing."
2022-07-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/557982-us-push-china-from-africa/,Western elites can’t decide if they should sanction or seduce Africa in their attempts to counter Russia and China,"In trying to find ways to effectively counter Russia and China’s partnerships in Africa, Washington – and its Western followers – is not content to just go for the honey or the vinegar – so officials are resorting to both at the same time. Typically, the Western modus operandi has been to establish a footprint in the target foreign country through military intervention under a security pretext with the hope of eventually pivoting to an economic one. Recent history suggests that elites haven’t quite been able to make the transition before their plans go pear-shaped. Unable to get their hands on the prize – typically, the country’s natural resources – they eventually either get kicked out (as was the case with France in Mali), or end up cutting their losses (like the US did in Afghanistan). Russia and China have been able to effectively exploit the void created by misguided Western foreign military adventures. In the case of Mali, Russia offered the transitional government military helicopters, radars, and weapons, in addition to “soldiers and trainers” reportedly operating in the African country (according to reports, these are from the Wagner private security company, but officials have distanced themselves from the group). Moscow is now parlaying that foothold into expanded cooperation. “We paid special attention to the practical aspects of organizing deliveries from Russia of wheat, mineral fertilizers and petroleum products that are so much needed by the people of Mali today in conditions of illegitimate Western sanctions,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during a press conference, in May, with his Malian counterpart, Abdoulaye Diop. France and the US sanctioned the country in the wake of delayed elections following two coups, all under the watch of Paris' Operation Barkhane and the EU’s training mission headquartered in the capital, Bamako. And now Washington is forging ahead with a new tool to threaten African countries that defy its interests. The ‘Countering Malign Russian Activities in Africa Act’ would target African governments, officials, and businesses doing business with Russia, qualified as “manipulation” and “exploitation” of Africans to Russia’s benefit. The plan is in the same spirit as the ‘Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017’ and the ‘Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act’, targeting Iran, Russia, and North Korea… but which also risks threatening India for purchasing a S-400 Russian missile defense system. The same act was leveraged to halt the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline for the transport of Russian gas into Western Europe under threat of American sanctions – effectively opening up a potential new market for US liquified gas exports. At the same time, the Western G7 bloc has proposed a $600 billion plan to build foreign infrastructure in Africa and Latin America, with Washington pledging $200 billion and the EU another $300 billion, and private businesses expected to get on board to invest. What are they going to do – sanction some of these countries and then demand that they take Western cash? How awkward. The idea is to counter China’s Belt and Road project, albeit a decade late and hundreds of billions of dollars short. The message here is clear. These countries can either deal with Russia, China, and other American adversaries and get buried in sanctions, or else they can accept this wonderful opportunity to let Washington and its Western allies into the country to build nice things. A long-standing US criticism of China is that it exploits its Belt and Road project to ‘debt trap’ countries and impose its influence. But it’s not like Washington’s intent towards underdeveloped countries is purely altruistic. For an example, look to how the US-funded Marshall Plan for post-WWII Europe helped establish CIA front companies around the continent. Or when Washington funds ‘civil society’ projects in underdeveloped target countries that end up being exposed as operations to subvert the government – one such example being a Twitter-like social media project in Cuba, funded by USAID and uncovered by the Associated Press in 2014. Speaking at the G7 Summit in Germany, US President Joe Biden said that investment projects include an industrial-scale vaccine manufacturing facility in Senegal, a global subsea telecommunications cable passing through the Horn of Africa, new solar projects in Angola, and a nuclear reactor plant in Romania. But at best, it’s playing catch-up with the $59 billion spent by China last year alone on the 144-country venture. Only time will tell how much of the announcement is window dressing and marketing – a valid concern given that this is the second year in a row that the proposal has been tabled at the G7 Summit, only to be rebranded and recycled a year later with little else happening in the interim. “These strategic investments are areas of – critical to sustainable development and to our shared global stability: health and health security, digital connectivity, gender equality and equity, climate and energy security,” Biden said, evoking all the warm and fuzzy buzzwords expected of him. But the true measure of the initiative will be in whether it can successfully replace Washington’s strategy of setting fire to foreign nations for the primary purpose of being able to step in afterwards and offer to help clean up."
2022-07-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/558252-ukraine-media-arbitrary-restrictions/,Ukraine accused of ‘arbitrary restrictions’ against journalists,"Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has criticized Ukrainian authorities over “abuses” against foreign and local journalists covering the conflict with Russia. It urged Kiev to swiftly eliminate obstacles for the media. “Some 9,000 or so reporters covering the war in Ukraine have difficulties gaining access to certain places and difficulties filming or taking photos, and even are occasionally detained,” the organization, which safeguards freedom of information around the globe, said in a statement on Friday. Those “arbitrary restrictions” are complicating the work of the press in the field and should be lifted, it insisted. “In a democratic country, war is no reason to hamper the work of journalists,” said Jeanne Cavelier, the head of RSF’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk. “Restrictions linked to national security are legitimate, but must be proportionate.” However, RSF believes the Kiev government is creating “unjustified obstacles to the production of reliable and objective reporting” on the ground. The claim was backed by the accounts of several media workers who have been reporting on the conflict over the past four months. “The Ukrainian authorities see foreign journalists as influence relays rather than information vehicles,” one reporter, who opted to remain anonymous, told RSF. “I was detained for several hours by local militias and then interrogated by [the Security Service of Ukraine] over harmless photos, although my accreditation was in order.” French photojournalist and war reporter Veronique de Viguerie also said she felt under pressure to always present Ukrainian soldiers as victims and not as attackers. “When it came to taking photos on the front line, there was always a ‘no’ that arrived from nowhere,” she complained. “Sometimes journalists are just not allowed into the field” on their own, the statement by RSF said, adding that “this was the case in Kharkov for a while.” In those conditions, their only hope is to be embedded with the Kiev forces, which is problematic due to “the confusing selective approach” of Ukrainian press officers, who may easily decide “to take a local blogger to visit a strategic location while refusing to take reporters from international news agencies.” Another issue is that many Ukrainian troops are completely unaware of the rights of accredited journalists, the group pointed out. A reporter for the French daily Les Echos, Guillaume Ptack, recalled being detained several times at checkpoints by territorial defense unit members, who had no idea that media are allowed to work despite the curfew. Ukrainian journalists have told RSF that they had to apply “self-censorship” and only report data that’s been confirmed by the Ukrainian authorities over fears of liability for revealing the positions of their troops. However, some media workers, like Zhitomir.info news website editor Tamara Koval, are still facing charges despite following all the rules, the group said."
2022-07-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/558245-crimea-bridge-attack-ukraine/,Ukraine reiterates threat against Crimean Bridge,"Ukraine still has plans to strike the bridge – Europe's longest – connecting the Russian peninsula of Crimea to the nearby Krasnodar Region, Alexey Arestovich, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, has said. On Friday, alarming reports emerged of large plumes of while smoke coming from an area near the Crimean Bridge, also known as the Kerch Bridge. But the Crimean authorities later said there was no reason to panic, explaining that Russian police were holding drills near one of the sections of the 19km-long structure. When asked about those exercises during an interview with activist Mark Feygin on YouTube, Arestovich said the authorities “were right to be preparing.” “Nobody is being sentimental. If such a need arises, we’ll strike the Crimean Bridge, at the right moment,” he said. However, the presidential aide acknowledged that the weapons currently possessed by the Ukrainian military were “technically incapable” of reaching the strategic bridge. “But the time will come and we’ll be able to do it. In this war, there have long been no constraints. It’s only about technical capability,” he insisted. The Kerch Bridge was built between 2016 and 2018, becoming a symbol of Crimea’s reunification with Russia. During the conflict with Kiev, Moscow has been using it to transport armored vehicles and other military hardware. Several Ukrainian officials and military commanders have issued warnings over the past four months that the multi-billion-dollar infrastructure could become a target for Kiev’s forces. Arestovich, who was among those who issued warnings, acknowledged last month that delivering significant damage to the bridge was a tough task, even with weapons of adequate range, as one of its 595 pillars would need to be destroyed. “It’s built in a way that one would need to use tactical nuclear weapons to bring it down,” he claimed. The Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said in mid-June that Moscow “was aware and took notice” of the Ukrainian threats. The security of the Kerch Bridge and the whole of Crimea was “guaranteed” by preventive measures taken by the Russian Armed Forces, he said."
2022-07-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/558244-pentagon-aid-military-ukraine/,Pentagon provides Kiev with surface-to-air missile systems,"The US Department of Defense is providing an additional $820 million package of military aid for Ukraine, including two surface-to-air missile defense systems, Pentagon spokesman Todd Breasseale announced on Friday. This brings total US security assistance provided to Ukraine to approximately $6.9 billion since the start of Russia’s offensive in late February. The new deliveries will include ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), two National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), up to 150,000 rounds of 155mm artillery ammunition, and four additional counter-artillery radars. Breasseale stressed that Washington continues to work with its allies “to provide Ukraine with capabilities to meet its evolving battlefield requirements.” “In particular, DoD recognizes Norway’s cooperation to enable the historic provision by the United States of modern air defense systems that will help Ukraine defend against Russia’s brutal air attacks,” the Pentagon spokesman said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has responded to the latest military supplies, expressing his gratitude to the US and personally to President Joe Biden for the package which, he stressed, “also includes very powerful NASAMS systems.” “This is an anti-aircraft missile system that will significantly strengthen our air defense. We worked hard for such a supply,” the Ukrainian leader said. Russia has repeatedly urged the West not to provide Kiev with weapons, saying it will only prolong the conflict and lead to long-term problems. It has warned that Russian forces will consider any foreign weapons on Ukrainian territory as a legitimate target. Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that “pumping up” Ukraine with Western weapons will only lead Russia “to perform more missions on the ground.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-07-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/558233-gerasimov-ukraine-troops-visit/,Russia’s chief of staff visits troops in Ukraine,"Russia's Chief of General Staff has paid a visit to the country’s troops in Ukraine amid the ongoing military operation there, the ministry has confirmed in a statement. “Army General Valery Gerasimov listened [to reports from] the commanders on the use of troops in the course of carrying out the tasks of a special military operation, as well as from other officials on issues related to combat support of the actions of Russian units in various areas,” the statement reads. The army general worked alongside senior commanding officers at command posts of the Russian military units, paying “special attention to the use of automated combat control systems during combat operations,” the ministry added, without providing any further details. The announcement comes a week after the Russian military revealed the troops involved in the ongoing conflict were visited by Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu. The minister presented top state awards, including Gold Star medals, to soldiers “who showed heroism and dedication in performing combat missions during the special military operation.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-07-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/558214-ukraine-helped-north-korea/,Nuclear family: How Ukraine helped North Korea develop the world's deadliest weapons,"North Korea’s (DPRK) nuclear missile program remains a major headache for the United States, and much of the wider world. Its development would not have been possible, however, without Pyongyang’s access to Soviet technology, specifically nuclear-capable hardware that remained in Ukraine after the collapse of the USSR. This article delves into the unlikely story of the part Ukraine played in making North Korea a major threat to America and its Asian allies. The US, South Korea and Japan share a lot of common goals, one of them being the complete de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. US President Joe Biden has once again made this point clear at the 2022 NATO summit in Madrid. Meanwhile, Washington’s allies in Asia have recently found a new reason for concern – on June 14, South Korean Foreign Minister Park Jin announced that North Korea had completed preparations for a new nuclear test. Prior to that, in March 2022, Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un effectively ended his country's self-imposed 2018 moratorium on testing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching US soil. Now, both Seoul and Washington are anxiously awaiting news about new test launches. How does a country which is effectively cut off from the rest of the world even achieve this level of technology? You might be surprised, but we must go to Ukraine for answers. Today, we can say with near absolute certainty that, when designing and constructing its intercontinental ballistic missile, the DPRK used RD-250 rocket engines produced at the Ukrainian Yuzhmash machine-building plant in the city of Dnepropetrovsk. Like most of the still-functioning industrial enterprises in Ukraine, Yuzhmash is part of the Soviet legacy. The plant was built in 1944 with World War II in full swing; later, during the Cold War, its engineers designed and produced the USSR’s most advanced missiles to compete with the US in the arms race. In the 21st century, Washington once again feels threatened by certain Yuzhmash products – despite the fact that Ukraine, following its 2014 coup, became a satellite of the US, and the plant has since signed contracts with the Americans (to produce rocket stages, engines for these stages, as well as various hardware used in their launch vehicles). In August 2017, The New York Times, citing Michael Elleman, a missile expert with the lobby group Institute of International Strategic Studies (IISS), reported that the DPRK had most likely used the RD-250 engines to design its own intercontinental ballistic missile. “It’s likely that these engines came from Ukraine – probably illicitly... The big question is how many they have and whether the Ukrainians are helping them now. I’m very worried,” Elleman said. The experts at the IISS, however, believed that the official authorities in Kiev were not involved in the smuggling operation. The design bureaus of Yuzhmash, as well as Yuzhnoye Design Office, a similar enterprise in Dnepropetrovsk, were emphatic in their denial of any collaboration with Pyongyang and its nuclear missile program. Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Aleksandr Turchynov even suggested that the accusations were part of an ‘anti-Ukrainian campaign’ carried out by Russian intelligence. He claimed it was Moscow’s way of concealing its own assistance to North Korea. However, in a 2018 report by the 1718 Sanctions Committee (DPRK), the Ukrainian authorities admitted that, in all likelihood, the engine for North Korea’s ballistic missiles was created using components of the RD-250 engine produced by Yuzhmash. They added that, in their opinion, the deliveries must have been made through Russian territory. Of course, they would say this. Vasily Kashin, Director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE), told RT that this controversy about North Korea receiving liquid-fuel engines from Yuzhmash remains the only incident officially on record. “It wasn’t Ukraine sending their engines to North Korea – it was the work of North Korean scientific and technical intelligence in Ukraine that made it all happen. Apparently, the liquid-fuel rocket engines had been acquired there illegally even prior to 2014,” the expert concluded. At the same time, relations between Kiev and Pyongyang have never been friendly and heartfelt enough to suggest Ukraine’s willingness to provide North Korea with powerful nuclear weapons. However, there is documentary evidence of Ukraine’s corruption-based cooperation with other countries in the nuclear missile field at the turn of the 21st century, which may invite precisely this kind of thinking. In 1994, Kiev finally discarded the last of its remaining nuclear arsenal, of around 1,000 missiles it had retained after the collapse of the USSR. The plan was to pass half of them on to Russia and to destroy the rest – as part of the US-funded disarmament program. But in 2005, ex-president of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko confirmed that the previous administration had sold X-55 cruise missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead to Iran and China “through several figureheads,” as he put it. The range of these missiles is 2.5 thousand kilometers, so this scam practically meant an increased threat of nuclear attack for Israel and Japan. However, it seems that North Korea had other ways of getting what it wanted. Starting from the 1990s, representatives of North Korea were caught red-handed trying to get hold of Soviet nuclear missile technology on many occasions. Kashin believes Pyongyang has been conducting scientific and technical intelligence in Ukraine for quite a while now. “According to declassified KGB documents, North Korean scientific and technical intelligence efforts in Ukraine date back to Soviet times. There was a criminal case, for example, involving their agent, a worker of the Arsenal Factory in Kiev, who was caught stealing parts of anti-tank missiles. North Koreans had ample opportunity to get hold of Soviet military technology in the 1990s and early 2000s in Dnepropetrovsk where they were snooping around all the time. And the Ukrainian government was not involved in any of this. There is nothing to confirm that they were selling their technology deliberately, of course. They just took advantage of the gaps in Ukraine’s flawed counter-intelligence system,” Kashin said. Mikhail Khodarenok, a military analyst and retired colonel, reminded RT about the chaos and anarchy that reigned in post-Soviet Russia and Ukraine, affecting many areas of life in the 1990s. “Back then, Ukraine saw much of its critically important technology leak out of the country. We can trace Ukrainian influence in both China’s and Iran’s strategic cruise missile arsenals. And it’s not surprising – everyone did their best to survive in those turbulent times. And many things may indeed have been done without the involvement of [the] Ukrainian leadership.” “But I don’t believe North Koreans were able to steal much. I am inclined to think that, in many cases, it was all based on deals, on mutual agreement. It’s just that the government was not part of it,” Khodarenok concluded. And 20 years after the Soviet Union collapse, espionage attempts by North Korea continued. On 12 December 2012, the DPRK became the 10th nation to join the global space club by placing its Kwangmyongsong-3 (or KMS-3) satellite in Earth orbit. It was the same year when a high-profile spy case involving North Korean nationals was investigated in Ukraine. It resulted in two citizens of North Korea (employees of a trade mission in Belarus) being sentenced to eight years in prison. They were caught trying to buy technical documentation and scientific works containing important R&D results from the staff of the Yuzhnoye Design Office in Ukraine. And they offered to pay a modest fee of $1,000 for every research paper on liquid-fuel engine systems. An unnamed source later informed the Strana.ua web portal that the Koreans had taken a particular interest in the design of the legendary R-36M (or Satan) intercontinental ballistic missile engine. It’s the most powerful missile of its kind. Another issue that has likely played into the hands of North Korean technology hunters is the ‘brain drain’ phenomenon, with dozens of Soviet engineers fleeing abroad after the Belovezh Accords were signed in 1991, disbanding the USSR. The post-Soviet de-industrialization of Ukraine took stable income and career prospects away from dozens of professionals working at the Ukrainian aerospace manufacturer Yuzhmash. So these people were forced to look for other ways to make a living. Choices were limited. They could either try their luck in the wild post-Soviet labor market (attempting to start a business or becoming a salesperson) or agree to a tempting –albeit questionable in terms of patriotism and legality– offer to help other countries with their nuclear missile programs. Many of them found themselves in difficult circumstances –personally and professionally– after the fall of the Soviet Union. It's even believed that some of them went to North Korea, Iran and Pakistan. Former US Ambassador to Ukraine Carlos Pascual later admitted that the importance of this phenomenon, when top-level specialists lost their jobs, was overlooked. It wasn’t just a matter of their personal turmoil – this was an important factor for the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The US and EU, however, took some initiatives in the mid-1990s. They funded the Science and Technology Center in Ukraine, an intergovernmental organization that was supposed to make sure that expertise and experience in the area of weapons of mass destruction didn’t leak. Executive Director Curtis Bjelajac admitted that there was a point where the center basically gave out money to certain specialists. In the end, millions of dollars were spent on former Soviet engineers and scientists specializing in missile and nuclear technology. The general consensus is that this helped stop the flow of professionals into countries that are toying with dangerous technology. But were there any ‘leaks’? According to Mikhail Khodarenok, there is an understanding within the community of experts that it was the work of Yuzhmash specialists that helped North Korea develop its missiles. “You can’t really judge Yuzhmash engineers – everyone tried to survive back then, and those countries paid good money. I think that many went there for work. North Korea would not have made such advances without the expertise in the critical technology. The Soviet Union also had to borrow – it used Wernher von Braun's research after the war,” Khodarenok said. (Von Braun was a German aerospace engineer and Nazi Party member who later worked in the US — RT). Compared to Western Europe and the US, South Korea has been very reserved in its help to Kiev during this year's crisis, providing mostly moral support and supplying non-lethal military aid. Some are surprised by this reaction. Why doesn’t Seoul do more? Maybe South Korea is concerned with the possibility that the equipment received by Ukraine might someday magically reappear north of the 38th parallel? Khodarenok thinks that this is unlikely but he finds the theory interesting. He says that the real reason South Korea is not going all in is that “every Russian family owns several things manufactured in South Korea, and the country doesn’t want to lose that market”. However, Seoul may change its stance under pressure from Washington, the expert warns. Kashin sees the connection between South Korea’s reserved reaction and the North’s nuclear problem, but he finds it elsewhere. “South Korea knows that if it helps Ukraine, Russia will stop complying with the sanctions against North Korea. Seoul understands that it shouldn’t burn all bridges with Russia, whose military operation in Ukraine was supported by North Korea (one of very few countries). And since Russia’s relations with all developed [sic] countries went south, Moscow might decide to get creative with its North Korea partnership. And nobody wants that – especially not South Korea. Israel, by the way, is guided by the same considerations – it has refused to supply Ukraine with any lethal equipment, because Russia might respond by providing Iran with some unpleasant weapons,” he commented."
2022-07-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/558011-foreign-ships-leave-mariupol/,"As West blames Moscow for 'food crisis', ships sail from Mariupol with Moscow's help while Ukraine holds vessels in its ports","Without much notice in the West, on June 21, the first foreign ship departed from the Port of Mariupol since Ukrainian and foreign mercenary forces were fully forced out of the Donbass city a month prior. Escorted by Russian naval boats, the vessel’s departure set the precedent for a resumption of normal port activity to and from Mariupol. Russian 🇷🇺 Sappers make Mariupol safe from the deadly mines planted by 🇺🇦 https://t.co/NCXvOtyotj Russia’s Defense Ministry on May 20 announced the liberation of the Azovstal plant from Ukraine’s Nazi Azov Battalion, and some days later stated that sappers had demined an area of one and a half million square meters around the city’s port. In early June, the ministry declared the facility ready for use anew. “The de-mining of Mariupol’s port has been completed. It is functioning normally, and has received its first cargo ships,” Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said at the time. Russia promised to give ships safe passage, and on June 21, the Turkish ship Azov Concord left with a Russian escort. At Mariupol port that day, prior to setting off, the captain of the ship, Ivan Babenkov, spoke to the media, telling us that the vessel, without cargo, was heading to Novorossiysk for loading, and then on to its destination. Rear Admiral Viktor Kochemazov, commander of the Russian naval base in Novorossiysk on the Black Sea’s northeastern coast, down the Kerch Strait from Mariupol, explained that while the corridor has been operational since May 25, the nearly one-month delay in departing was because “ships were significantly damaged during the conduct of hostilities.” Notably, he also said that some ships were deliberately damaged by Ukrainian forces in order to prevent them from leaving. From aboard a Russian anti-sabotage forces boat, media watched the Azov Concord leave port. Further on, the ship would be met by warships of the Novorossiysk base and escorted to the Kerch Strait where FSB border control ships would continue to escort the ship. A Bulgarian ship, the Tsarevna, was readying to depart the port next, “also following the same humanitarian corridor to its destination in accordance with plans for the use of the court by the owner,” Rear Admiral Kochemazov said. Western press ignoring developments Predictably, just as the Western media continues to ignore Ukraine’s war crimes against the Donbass republics, including not only the bombing of houses, hospitals, and busy markets – plus the killing and maiming of civilians – so too do they omit coverage of anything positive emanating from areas where Ukrainian forces have been ousted and stability restored. Instead, Western media continues to spin the story that it’s Russia that’s blocking ports and preventing grain exports, and blame Moscow for “aggravating the global food crisis” – when in reality, it is Ukraine that has mined ports and burned grain storages. More blatant disinformation from our US colleagues. They perfectly know that the Ukrainian ports are mined by Kiev and our offers of humanitarian sea passages were repeatedly rejected. And don’t trigger famine in #Ukraine by depriving it of grain-don’t tell us we didn’t warn you! https://t.co/Y9PqG9hoJZ In fact, according to Russia’s Ministry of Defense, “70 foreign vessels from 16 countries remain blocked in six Ukrainian ports (Kherson, Nikolaev, Chernomorsk, Ochakov, Odessa and Yuzhniy). The threat of shelling and high mine danger posed by official Kiev prevent vessels from entering the high seas unhindered.” While Russia maintains it has opened two maritime humanitarian corridors in the Black and Azov Seas, Kiev is apparently not engaging with representatives of states and ship-owning companies about the departure of docked foreign ships. Meanwhile, in the same vein, media outlets like the New York Times (writing as always from afar) claim that Mariupol is “suffering deeply” under Russian rule (citing the runaway former mayor, nowhere near the city for months, who is the source of previous war propaganda) even describing the Azov Neo-Nazis as “the city’s last military resistance.” Yet, what I’ve seen in multiple trips to Mariupol in the past couple of weeks is rubble being removed so that the rebuilding process can begin, newly established street markets, public transportation running, and calm in the streets. Life returning to Mariupol. Reconstruction has already begun. pic.twitter.com/FGHzOuzDhq The people of Mariupol have indeed suffered, but now that the Azov Nazis and Ukrainian nationalists no longer reign, they can live without fear of persecution, execution, rape, torture, and all of the other ‘democratic values’ of the forces backed by the West. The rebuilding will take time, but with the port functioning anew, and the possibility now of also bringing reconstruction materials by sea, it can begin, ship by ship."
2022-07-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/558221-online-voting-andrei-stenin-photo-contest/,Online voting kicks off in Andrei Stenin International Press Photo Contest,"The jury is out on which shot submitted by a young photojournalist is the most impressive in 2022, and internet users are welcome to share their opinion and help decide who wins this year’s Andrei Stenin International Press Photo Contest. The contenders vying for the prize come from 14 countries. All a user has to do to cast their vote is follow this link and click the icon next to the shot they like most. Potential jurors have the whole of July ahead of them to browse through the works shortlisted this year, and make an informed choice. The entries are divided into four categories: ‘Top News,’ ‘Sports,’ ‘My Planet,’ and ‘Portrait. A Hero of Our Time.’ Unlike last year, internet users do not need to have a social media account to participate. The author of the most-upvoted photo will be announced in early August, receiving a certificate from the organizers. In September, the contest’s committee will unveil the prize-winners from the shortlist, as well as the winner of the Grand Prix. By the end of the year, the organizers hope to set up a roadshow featuring the winners’ works. The exhibit is expected to make landfall in various cities across the world, though for now no further details are forthcoming. Last year’s main prize was split between Russian photographer Mary Gelman and her colleague from Turkey, Sebnem Coskun. Gelman’s work depicted the moving love story of an elderly couple with Down syndrome living in a special social village. Her Turkish counterpart enchanted the public and the committee alike with her shot, illustrating the impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on the environment. The photo showed a freediver surrounded by plastic waste as she made her descent in the Bosphorus. The photos shortlisted this year depict, among other themes, the fight against Covid 19 in the Philippines and the so-called migrant caravan in Central America. The annual event is organized by Rossiya Segodnya, Russia’s state-run media group, with RT being one of the contest’s media partners. The competition’s objective is to jump-start young photojournalists from around the world, and help them make a name for themselves in the industry. It also seeks to remind the public of just how important and, at times, challenging the job of photojournalism is. The contest is named after Russian photojournalist Andrei Stenin, who was killed in 2014 while covering the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. The car he was traveling in came under artillery shelling."
2022-07-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/558218-ukraine-us-nato-poll/,Ukrainians blame own govt alongside Russia for conflict – poll,"Ukrainians tend to believe that not only Russia, but their own government, the US, and NATO should all share the blame for the conflict in their country, a recent poll has found. The survey, done by phone among 1,005 Ukrainians between June 9 and 13, was carried out by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago and paid for by the Wall Street Journal. The participants were united on Russia’s role in the conflict, with 82% saying that the country bears “a great deal of responsibility” after sending its troops into Ukraine on February 24. Only 9% believed Moscow had nothing to be blamed for. However, the poll made it quite clear that most Ukrainians don’t seem to agree with the narrative of President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Western backers that Moscow’s military operation in their country was an unprovoked aggression. A whopping 70% of those surveyed said that the actions of the Ukrainian government also contributed to the outbreak of the conflict, with 47% assigning “a great deal of responsibility” to Kiev for it. The US, which has been providing Zelensky’s government with billions of dollars in military and economic aid during Russia’s military operation, has been labeled the culprit by 58%. According to 26% of respondents, Americans bear “a great deal of responsibility” for the current state of affairs. Ukrainians evaluated the role of the US-led NATO bloc similarly to the one of Washington, with a difference of just a couple of percent points. NATO’s eastward expansion and plans to make Ukraine a member of the alliance have been labeled a national security threat by Moscow and singled out as one of the main reasons for its offensive. Another reason cited by the Russian authorities was the need to “denazify” Ukraine, but only 35% of respondents said they thought that the country’s “ultra-right nationalists” had any role to play in provoking the conflict. Despite Russia’s steady advances in Donbass, Ukrainians appeared to be optimistic about the overall outcome of the fighting. Only 6% said that it was “extremely” or “very likely” that Moscow would be able to retain all of the areas it now controls in Donbass and southern Ukraine if a ceasefire occurs. According to 66% of those surveyed, Kiev is going to win back all of its lost land eventually, and things will go back to normal. Russia sent troops into Ukraine four months ago, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc."
2022-07-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/558210-eu-demands-urkaine-reforms/,EU gives Ukraine to-do list,"Kiev needs to implement more reforms and make new institutions actually work, if it wants to progress towards EU membership, the bloc's top official has told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the country’s MPs. “The next steps are within your reach. But they will require hard work, determination and, above all else, unity of purpose,” Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission said on Friday, in a video address to a special session of the Ukrainian parliament. The German official lavished compliments on Ukrainian lawmakers and Zelensky, praising them for resisting Russia on the battlefield and for securing EU candidate status, which she said required Kiev “to showcase everything Ukraine has achieved” since the 2014 Western-backed coup in Kiev, an event she described as a “Revolution of Dignity,” as the current Ukrainian authorities also prefer to call it. Thank you President @ZelenskyyUA for inviting me to address this special session of @ua_parliament.Ukrainians are fighting back bravely.Europe will do everything in our power to help Ukraine win this war.And we will not rest until you prevail. https://t.co/fQgNeN9ryy She promised massive Western investments to help with the country’s eventual reconstruction, but said Ukraine had to implement “a new wave of reforms” to ensure that foreign aid is spent effectively. The EU leader called on President Zelensky to appoint new heads of various anti-corruption bodies – which were created under Western pressure – as soon as possible. “You have created an impressive anti-corruption machine, but now these institutions need teeth and the right people in senior posts,” she said. The country needs to adopt new legislation on appointing judges to the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, von der Leyen said. In 2020, Zelensky had a bitter quarrel with the top justice body, which he accused of shielding corruption. The president attempted to have the parliament sack the chief justice Aleksandr Tupitsky through a law, which, the court said, would have violated the country’s constitution. Zelensky ultimately prevailed in ousting Tupitsky from office – allegedly by physically restricting his access – but remaining justices refused to accept two new members of the court, whom the president nominated to replace the chief justice and another judge. In her speech, von der Leyen called on the Ukrainian government to curb the influence of “oligarchs” on the Ukrainian economy, mentioning that the country had a special law aimed at this objective. The controversial piece of legislation, which was passed last September and came into force this week, authorized the presidential-controlled national security council to formally label wealthy individuals as “oligarchs” and to subject them to various restrictions. Such designated persons are not allowed to own media or to fund political parties and are obligated to inform state officials about their being on the list. The EU executive also called for the adoption of a new media law. The Zelensky government banned several opposition media outlets in the country, claiming that they were spreading Russian propaganda. That crackdown took place last year, as the president’s approval rating was dwindling. The Ukrainian security council has outlawed numerous opposition parties, which it labeled pro-Russian, including the largest – Opposition Platform, For Life. This faction has opposed Kiev's Western integration. The party's leader, Viktor Medvedchuk, was placed under house arrest last year. Ten other anti-Zelensky groupings have also been prohibited. Despite this, the West has maintained the pretence that Ukraine is a democracy. “You have kept your state and your democracy running against all odds,” von der Leyen told the Ukrainian officials. She pledged that Brussels will be with the country “every step of the way for as long as it takes” as Ukraine works to become an EU member."
2022-07-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/558154-ukrainian-envoy-nazi-collaborator-hero/,Ukrainian envoy likens Nazi collaborator to Robin Hood,"Ukraine’s controversial national hero, Stepan Bandera, was a true freedom fighter despite his collaboration with the Nazis during World War II, Kiev’s envoy to Germany has suggested. The diplomat defended Bandera after a German journalist challenged him with evidence. During an interview with Ambassador Andrey Melnik on Wednesday, German podcaster Tilo Jung brought up the diplomat’s visit to Stepan Bandera’s grave in Munich. The interviewer asked the Ukrainian ambassador whether he revered the controversial figure despite the crimes attributed to Bandera not only by Russian historians, but also those in Germany, Israel and some other countries. Melnik replied in the affirmative, arguing that the Ukrainian nationalist leader “acted in a very difficult environment,” being sandwiched between Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and Poland as well. The diplomat went on to proclaim that “there are no laws for those who fight for freedom.” He then proceeded to liken Bandera to Robin Hood, who “is being revered by everyone” despite being someone who “didn’t act according to the law that was in force then.” Jung parried this by bringing up Bandera’s close association with Fascist Italy’s leader Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, as well as the Ukrainian nationalist leader’s dream of establishing Ukrainian fascism, and his enmity to Jews, Poles, and Russians. The podcaster noted that Bandera’s followers, along with German Nazis, murdered a total of 800,000 Jews in Ukraine during World War II. They also carried out a massacre of Poles in western Ukraine, killing up to 44,000 civilians, Jung added. Melnik, however, dismissed all of the above, claiming there is no evidence to back up those accusations. The diplomat repeatedly insisted that Bandera was not involved in anti-Semitic policies, even when the interviewer read aloud a resolution approved by Bandera in the spring of 1941, prior to the Nazi invasion, which classed Jews as the biggest enemy of the Ukrainian people, and called for their extermination or forced eviction. The host then quoted from a few leaflets by Bandera’s organization that were spread as Nazi troops took over parts of Ukraine, reading “People, this you must know: Muscovites, Poles, Hungarians, Jews – they are your enemies. Destroy them! You must know this. Your leadership. Your leader, Stepan Bandera.” Jung queried how Melnik could still call someone a hero, who was a mass murder of Jews and Poles. The ambassador simply replied: “Bandera was no mass murderer of Jews and Poles.” Ukraine’s envoy to Germany insisted that “there is no evidence” Bandera “issued an order to exterminate Jews.” Melnik concluded that, in the absence of proof that would convince him, he would not distance himself from the nationalist leader. Bandera was the leader of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, which was known for its radical anti-Semitic ideology. According to historians from various countries, the organization’s militant wing – the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) – assisted Nazi Germany’s troops in the extermination of Jews on multiple occasions. As a result, Bandera is generally viewed as a Nazi collaborator in Germany and Israel. Poland, while it is Kiev’s ally in its current conflict with Moscow, has an ax to grind with Bandera’s legacy as well. Back in 2016, the Polish parliament recognized the so-called Volyn Massacres as genocide at the hands of UPA militants. In 2018, Polish President Andrzej Duda signed a bill that banned the promotion of the ideology associated with Stepan Bandera. In Russia, too, the general consensus is that the Ukrainian nationalist leader was a Nazi collaborator, responsible for the killing of civilians during and after World War II. In Ukraine, however, Bandera is hailed as a national hero. Then-President Viktor Yushchenko posthumously bestowed the title on the controversial figure back in 2010. The move was criticized by the Simon Wiesenthal Center at the time, which expressed the “deepest revulsion” at Yushchenko’s decision. In its statement, the organization said Bandera’s followers “killed thousands of Jews and other people during World War II.” Supporters of the controversial figure, on the other hand, insist that he was fighting against the Soviet regime to establish an independent Ukrainian state. His crimes are usually glossed over or denied by Ukrainian officials and nationalists. Ambassador Melnyk is no stranger to controversy, having repeatedly used undiplomatic language when criticizing top German officials for their perceived unwillingness to provide Ukraine with weapons in recent months. He famously described Chancellor Olaf Scholz as an “offended liverwurst” back in May, only to publicly express regret a month later."
2022-07-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/558187-kissinger-ukraine-zelensky-nato/,Kissinger outlines three possible outcomes in Ukraine,"Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who recently turned 99, has shared his thoughts on how the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine could end. “There are three possible outcomes to this war – all three of them are still to some extent open,” Kissinger said in his interview with The Spectator magazine. The first scenario would be “if Russia stays where it is now, it will have conquered 20% of Ukraine and most of the Donbass, the industrial and agricultural main area, and a strip of land along the Black Sea.” If this happens it would be “a victory” for Moscow that will also show that “the role of NATO will not have been as decisive as earlier thought,” the veteran politician pointed out. The second possible outcome “is an attempt is made to drive Russia out of the territory it acquired before this war, including Crimea, and then the issue of a war with Russia itself will arise if the war continues,” Kissinger warned. “The third outcome… is if the Free People can keep Russia from achieving any military conquests and if the battle line returns to the position where the war started, then the current aggression will have been visibly defeated,” he said. This would see Ukraine rebuilt the way it was before the Russian military operation started on February 24 and rearmed by NATO, “if not [made] part of it,” the former secretary of state suggested. “The remaining issues could be left to a negotiation. It would be a situation which is frozen for a while,” but the deadlock would be overcome with time, he assured. According to Kissinger, this “third outcome” is the same that he sketched out during his video-address to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos in May. In the speech that made international headlines, he insisted that “negotiations on peace [in Ukraine] need to begin in the next two months,” otherwise the conflict could turn from “a war about the freedom of Ukraine, which had been undertaken with great cohesion by NATO,” into a “war against Russia itself.” The ideal outcome of those talks would be a “return to the status quo ante,” he said. The proposal angered many in Ukraine, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying that Kissenger “emerges from the deep past and says that a piece of Ukraine should be given to Russia” in order to appease Moscow. He suggested that the former secretary of state forgot that it was 2022 and thought that he was talking to an audience in Munich in 1938. The latter was a reference to the Munich Agreement, which saw the UK, France and Italy agreeing to cede a part of Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany in a vain attempt to avoid a major conflict on the continent. World War II started the next year. Kissenger’s name also appeared on the infamous Mirotvorets (‘Peacemaker’) website, which hosts a publicly searchable database of whom its authors believe to be enemies of Ukraine. He was branded “an accomplice in the crimes of the Russian authorities against Ukraine and its citizens.” The veteran politician told The Spectator that “the purpose of the Davos statement was to point out that the issue of war aims needed to be faced before the momentum of war made it politically unmanageable.” As for Zelensky’s criticism, “in his most recent statements he has essentially accepted what I outlined in Davos,” Kissinger insisted."
2022-06-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/558177-lavrov-iron-curtain-europe/,Russia warns of new ‘Iron Curtain’,"A new “Iron Curtain” is being drawn across Europe, this time by Western powers seeking to cut off Russia and Belarus over the conflict in Ukraine. While meeting his Belarusian counterpart in Minsk on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the EU destroyed relations with Moscow, built over decades, practically overnight. His Belarusian counterpart, Vladimir Makei, added “The Iron Curtain is now being erected by Westerners themselves.” He clarified he was referring not just to the severance of political and economic contact, but to the physical barrier erected along the Poland-Belarus border. Makei said the isolationism was one-sided, as Belarus continues to advocate for dialogue with the West and seek diplomatic solutions to problems. “It is practically already up,” Lavrov agreed, adding that Western countries “are only doing it carefully, so as not to pinch anything off, but the process is underway.” “The summits that took place twice a year, and the meetings of the Russian government and the European Commission, and the common spaces along which the four ‘road maps’ were built, twenty sectoral dialogues, a visa-free dialogue ... All this was brought down overnight,” Lavrov said, referring to the events of 2014, when Brussels condemned what it called the Russian “annexation” of Crimea. “Relations have been nonexistent since then.” Moscow remains open to diplomacy and dialogue, but will make a decision on how to re-engage with its own interests in mind, the Russian diplomat said. “I can only say that from now on, we will not trust neither the Americans nor the EU. We will do everything necessary so we don’t have to depend on them in critical sectors,” said Lavrov. The phrase “Iron Curtain” was coined by Winston Churchill, who led the UK through Word War Two. A year after the Nazi surrender, he accepted US President Harry Truman’s invitation to speak at a college in Fulton, Missouri in March 1946, and heralded the upcoming Cold War by declaring that “an iron curtain has descended across the continent,” in reference to the establishment of socialist governments in territories liberated by the Red Army in Eastern Europe. Western historiography holds that the original “Iron Curtain” was destroyed in 1989, with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany – followed by the collapse of the USSR two years later."
2022-06-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/558173-kiev-donbass-genocide-putin/,Putin accuses Ukraine of ‘crimes against humanity’,"Kiev’s actions against the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics amount to “crimes against humanity” and effectively constituted “genocide” of local population, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. The president made the remarks on Thursday in his address to participants of the 10th International legal forum in St Petersburg. “Russia is open to dialogue on ensuring strategic stability, preserving agreements on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and improving the situation in arms control,” Putin stated. “We are focused on joining efforts on crucial issues like the climate agenda, fighting famine, providing stability in food and energy markets, and fair rules in international trade and competition,” he added. Ensuring proper and meticulous international cooperation on various issues could, in the future, help to avoid crises like the one currently unfolding in Ukraine, the president stressed. With this approach, we could avoid crises such as the current one in Donbass that is happening to protect its residents from genocide – and there can be no other definition for the Kiev regime’s actions than “a crime against humanity.” Moscow’s “foreign affairs agenda has always been and remains constructive,” Putin said. Russia seeks to develop “multipolar relations” with anyone “interested in them” and places “great value” on cooperation “within the UN, the G20, BRICS, the SCO” and other groups, he added. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked. Over the course of the conflict, Kiev and Moscow have traded accusations of committing assorted crimes against civilians. Ukraine’s rhetoric has been backed and amplified by the top Western politicians, with US President Joe Biden, for instance, accusing Russia of committing “genocide” in the country. The White House, however, has tried to downplay such remarks, insisting they do not constitute Washington’s official policy. The UN refused to describe the ongoing conflict as such, stating that it had not “documented patterns” that could amount to “genocide.”"
2022-06-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/558168-nato-defensive-alliance-global-cop/,NATO has completed its post-Cold War transformation from Europe's guard dog into America's attack dog,"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, has just wrapped up its annual summit in Madrid, Spain. The one-time trans-Atlantic defensive alliance has, over the past three decades, transformed itself from the guardian of Western Europe into global cop, seeking to project militarily a so-called values- and rules-based posture. NATO’s first Secretary General, Lord Ismay, famously noted that the mission of the bloc was “to keep the Russians out, the Germans down, and the Americans in.” In short, NATO served as a wall against the physical expansion of the Soviet Union from the perch it had established in eastern Europe at the end of the Second World War. Likewise, the creation of NATO prevented a treaty from being concluded between Germany and the Soviet Union that would enable the reunification of Germany. And lastly, the existence of NATO mandated that the US retain a significant full-time military presence in Europe, helping break America’s traditional tendency toward isolationism. At the Madrid Summit, NATO radically redefined its mission to reflect a new mantra which could be encapsulated as “keep the Russians down, the Americans in, and the Chinese out.” It is an aggressive–even hostile–posture, premised on sustaining Western (i.e., American) supremacy. This mission is to be accomplished through the defense and promulgation of a so-called “rules-based international order” which exists only in the minds of its creators, which in this case is the United States and its allies in Europe. It also represents a radical break from past practice which sought to keep NATO defined by the four corners of its trans-Atlantic birthright by seeking to expand its security umbrella into the Pacific. The guard dog had, it seems, been re-trained as an attack dog. When an organization undergoes such a radical transformation in terms of its core mission and purpose, logic dictates that there exists a reason (or reasons) sufficient to justify the consequences attached to the action. There appear to be three such reasons. First and foremost is the fact that Russia refuses to accept NATO demands that it exist as a junior “partner” whose sovereignty must be subordinated to the collective will of post-Cold War Europe. Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin, has made it clear that Russia considers itself to be a great power, and fully expects to be treated as such–especially when it comes to issues pertaining to the so-called “near abroad”–those former Soviet republics, such as Ukraine and Georgia, whose continued ties with Moscow are existential in nature. NATO, on the other hand, while calling Russia a “partner,” was never serious about extending a viable hand of friendship, instead undertaking a thirty-year program of expansion which violated verbal promises made to Soviet leaders, leaving Russia weakened and not to be taken seriously by the self-proclaimed “victors” of the Cold War. When Russia pushed back, a process marked by Putin’s iconic speech to the 2007 Munich Security Conference, NATO undertook a more aggressive stance, promising Georgia and Ukraine eventual membership in the Alliance and, in 2014, supporting a violent coup against a government in Ukraine that kicked-off a series of events which culminated in the ongoing military operation being conducted by Russia in Ukraine. Speaking at this week’s NATO Summit, the Secretary General of the organization, Jen Stoltenberg, ended all pretense that the bloc was an innocent bystander in the events leading up to Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine, noting with pride that NATO had been preparing to fight Russia since 2014–that is, since the US-led coup. Indeed, NATO has, since 2015, been training the Ukrainian military to NATO standards. Not to bolster the self-defense of Ukraine, but rather for the purpose of fighting ethnic Russians in the Donbass. NATO, it seems, was never interested in a peaceful resolution to the crisis, which flared up when Ukrainian nationalists began brutalizing the region’s Moscow-leaning majority. Two NATO members, France and Germany, helped perpetuate a fraudulent peace process, the Minsk Accords, which former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko recently admitted was nothing more than a sham perpetrated for the purpose of buying time so that NATO could train and equip the Ukrainian military for the purpose of forcibly seizing control of both Donbass and Crimea. All the 2007 Munich Summit really did was strip away any pretense that NATO was serious about peacefully coexisting with a powerful, sovereign Russian nation. A truly defensive alliance would have readily embraced such an outcome. NATO, it is now clear, is anything but. NATO has been exposed as little more than a component of American global power projection, providing supplementary military and political backing for an American empire defined by the “rules-based international order” premised on sustained US military and economic supremacy. Keeping America on top, however, is proving to be a bridge too far, largely because the American empire itself is crumbling at its foundations, struggling economically to sustain the so-called “American Dream” and politically to keep alive the flawed promise of American democracy which underpins the very image the US seeks to promote abroad. The extent that the US can function with a modicum of credibility in the international arena today is determined purely by the level of “buy in” by the rest of the world to the golden idol that is the “rules-based international order.” While the US has been able to strong-arm both NATO and its economic doppelganger, the G7, into actively promoting the “Rules based international order,” Russia and China have come together to create an alternative world view. That is international law, premised on the concepts enshrined in the United Nations Charter. The G7 declared that the BRICS economic forum, comprised of nations who are more aligned with a “law-based” world order, and not a US-dominated “rules-based” one, represents the greatest threat to its relevance on the world stage. NATO, likewise, has declared that the Russian and Chinese challenge to the “rules-based international order” represents a major threat to NATO’s core values, prompting an expansion of NATO’s reach into the Pacific as a counter. In short, NATO (together with the G7 group) is declaring war against the principles of international law that are encapsulated in the United Nations Charter. At its Madrid Summit, NATO has made it clear that it’s ready to shed blood to defend a legacy whose legitimacy exists only among the collective imaginations of its members. And not all of them, either. The goal of the rest of the world now needs to be to seek to minimize the damage done by this beast and find a way to dispose of it before it can do any more harm to the global community."
2022-06-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/558155-kremlin-pow-exchange-priorities/,Kremlin explains priorities in POW exchange with Ukraine,"Bringing captured Russian soldiers back home is the top priority for Moscow, the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday. The official made the remarks following a major POW exchange between Moscow and Kiev. “The return of our soldiers and all the soldiers who fought and are fighting for the right to live of the people of the LPR and DPR is the main thing for us,” Peskov told reporters. The exchange, first announced by Ukraine’s military intelligence service, took place on Wednesday. Moscow returned 144 captured Ukrainian soldiers in exchange for the same number of Russian servicemen, as well as fighters from the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics. The Russian Defense Ministry commented on the swap on Thursday, revealing it had been authorized personally by President Vladimir Putin. The exchange was “organized and carried out on the direct orders of the supreme commander of the Russia Armed Forces,” said Defense Ministry spokesman, General Igor Konashenkov. Safeguarding “the lives, the health, the release of our servicemen, the fighters of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, who make up the majority of those returned, is the most important task,” he stressed. According to Kiev, the exchange included 43 fighters of the notorious Azov regiment. Hundreds of members of the neo-Nazi unit ended up in Russian custody after surrendering at the Azovstal plant in the port city of Mariupol. All in all, more than 6,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been captured during the ongoing conflict, according to the Russian military. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocol, brokered by Germany and France, was first signed in 2014.

Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-06-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/558059-second-class-citizens-language/,'Russian-speakers will be second-class citizens unless they give up their language': A view on Ukraine's future from Donbass,"During his 2019 election campaign, Ukraine's current President Volodymyr Zelensky constantly repeated that his mission was to unite the country and breach the ideological gap between the EU-leaning West and the Russian-speaking East. This was the division that resulted in the declaration of independence by the Donbass republics, in 2014. However, but the differences are so deep that even the present, and obvious, threat to the state’s territorial integrity has failed to fully unite Ukrainians. One of the principal issues is language, those in the West prefer to use Ukrainian and the east is mostly Russian speaking. There is a historical reason, of course. Modern Ukraine was created – by the Soviet Union – as a result of sticking various territories together. Thus, parts of the south-west came from Hungary and Romania, a large chunk of the West is historically Polish land and places like Odessa and Kharkov have long been Russian. Indeed, many soldiers from the western regions don’t want to risk their lives fighting in the East, but would happily defend their home regions. RT spoke with Vladislav Ugolny, a journalist and expert on the history of Novorossiya, about the attitude of one group in Ukrainian society towards the other. We also asked Vladislav if there is any hope for reconciliation. –We keep seeing videos online showing soldiers from western Ukraine refusing to fight in the East. It seems that they don’t want to risk their lives defending the eastern territories. [Some of] the territorial defense units mobilized in western Ukraine have different objectives. They are not eager to die for Kharkov or Kiev; they don’t feel that it’s their land and they have no warm feelings towards the people living in these cities. We’ve seen the video showing the mother of a Ukrainian soldier from Dnepropetrovsk who tried to receive humanitarian aid in Lviv, where she had been evacuated, and she was refused because she spoke Russian. This is very typical. They join the army in western Ukraine only because it gives them a chance to get their hands on a weapon. The territorial defense forces in Lviv have turned into the personal guard of Mayor Andrey Sadovoy and are well-equipped and well-trained. Instead of defending ‘the motherland’, this team serves as leverage in Sadovoy’s negotiations with Kiev. Large shipments of humanitarian aid and weapons from Western Europe and the US get stuck in western Ukraine and never make their way to the frontline. This boosts the separatist potential of the West. We can look at this in the context of the Donbass conflict. Just imagine Viktor Yanukovych winning after the 2014 political crisis. In that case, we could’ve expected an armed conflict in Galicia (a historical and geographical region that includes western Ukraine — RT). They could’ve also played out the Crimea scenario. Galicia has always been a separatist region, it’s just that right now separatism is not in their best interest. – Why not? They are dominating right now. The western [Ukrainian] elites have usurped power in the country. The same happened previously in Donbass. The Donbass ‘clan’ was very successful – especially under [President Viktor] Yanukovych. The Donetsk elites were powerful, and you don’t need separatism when you have power. The Donbass started pulling away from Ukraine when those elites began to lose power. – So the soldiers from the southeastern regions are more motivated to defend the Ukrainian identity? You have to understand that Ukrainian nationalism has various iterations. The western ‘strain’ is the classic one – with Stepan Bandera, the usual bogeyman of the Russian media. This is your ‘rural’ ideology based on deep hatred of Russians, Poles, and Jews. But there are more sophisticated varieties of Ukrainian nationalism that originated in the East. Right Sector (banned in Russia), Azov and some other organizations represent this type of nationalism. You can see from the videos of Azov’s POWs that many of them come from the Russian-speaking regions in southeastern Ukraine – Novorossiya – mostly the Dnepropetrovsk area. These are the areas that fostered the ultra-right ideology that Russians are familiar with. The nationalism in eastern Ukraine is more militaristic and employs Third Reich aesthetics, similar to many ultra-right groups in Western Europe and Russia for that matter. Many international students, especially from Asia and Africa, attended universities in Kharkov. And they were always threatened by racist skinheads from football fan clubs. Similar things happened in Dnepropetrovsk and Odessa, although to a lesser degree. The people living in southeastern Ukraine also have more experience with formal military structures, because they have a history of fighting in all the major wars that Russia was involved in, whereas Galicia mostly draws on its tradition of fighting for its land in guerilla wars. –Strangely, after 2014 the southeastern part of Ukraine was very concerned about the nationalist ideology of the Kiev regime… The southeast is very diverse. You have Odessa and Kharkov on the one hand, where there is still significant potential for separatism. Then there is Zaporozhe, where the separatist mindset is present but not as prevalent. This is why the pro-Russian civil-military administrations have been successful in places like Melitopol for example. Dnepropetrovsk, on the other hand, has always been the domain of Ukrainian nationalism. –Why Dnepropetrovsk? The situation here is largely defined by the consequences of the fall of the Soviet Union. Dnepropetrovsk was a major industrial center, and many Communist Party leaders [such as Leonid Brezhnev historically] came from this city and remained in power after Ukraine gained independence. These elites had to find a new foundation for Ukrainian statehood. They were used to having ideological principles in the Soviet Union, and now they had to separate themselves from Russia, which was wealthier and more attractive. The new authorities also understood that they would be ‘devoured’ by Russian elites if Ukraine decided to reintegrate. This was happening regardless. We are speaking here in central Donetsk, near the old office of Sberbank. This Russian bank was operating in Ukraine, whereas Ukrainian banks never managed to bring their businesses to Russia. Ukrainian nationalism was the only way for them to justify Ukraine’s independence. –How come western Ukraine is now perceived as the cradle and citadel of Ukrainian nationalism? Western Ukraine has never been a major industrial or wealthy region, but the elites there were always very good at capitalizing on their ideology and advancing their political and cultural agenda. They worked hard to spread this agenda using the finances of the elites of the southeast, who wanted to gain their independence from Russia by funding these processes. - But didn’t the Ukrainian government try to do something after 2014 to include south-easterners in the country’s political life, to unite the nation, so to speak? It was a purely economic thing. After the recession of 2014-2015, money began to pour into the eastern regions. But nothing concrete was done to incorporate them into the common Ukrainian national identity. We must remember, though, that the Ukrainian national state was the only political project in Ukraine after Euromaidan, with no alternatives. And people either faced pressure or chose a version of Ukrainian identity that they felt was the least nauseating. Some bought the story that Ukraine is Europe [in the EU sense], and Europe is where you can make money. In fact, most were offered economic incentives, while the most passionate could join the army. That was until Zelensky came along. Zelensky’s presidency offered a different vision. In a nutshell, his ideology was that you can speak any language you want, as long as you fight for Ukraine against Russia. However, he was not a pioneer in this regard. Similar ideas had been put forward by former Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs Arsen Avakov, the oligarch Igor Kolomoisky, and the leader of the Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) party, Yulia Tymoshenko. Unlike nationalists from western Ukraine, who had only deepened the rift inside the country, these people had a clear idea of what to do and how to do it – they were building a stable state. - They don’t seem to have been particularly successful. Here’s the problem. You have to understand that there are only two unique centers of urban culture in Ukraine: Lviv in the west and Odessa in the east. Lviv has touted itself as a piece of Europe, a fragment of the Habsburg Empire. Odessa has also drawn on imperial nostalgia, but in relation to the Russian Empire. However, after the two Maidans, Odessa found itself under great ideological pressure as the Lviv cultural paradigm became dominant. Dnepr and Kharkov have nothing to offer the rest of Ukraine in terms of culture. But Galicia has an ideology, a ready package of Ukrainian identity. And even though Galicians have never been able to come to power in Ukraine – simply because the region doesn’t have that much money – they will impose their agenda on any Ukrainian government that tries to disassociate itself from Russia. - Could the current conflict strengthen the ideological position of southeastern Ukraine? Look, there is [former Ukrainian President] Petro Poroshenko with his ‘Armiya, Mova, Vira’ (‘Army, Language, Faith’, his slogan for the 2019 presidential campaign). This is a man who relied on western Ukraine and who embezzled huge sums of money in defense contracts. And then there is Zelensky, who didn’t use nationalist rhetoric and who didn't embezzle money from the army, which seriously improved Ukraine's defense capabilities, and generally did a lot to strengthen the Ukrainian identity and the Ukrainian national project. But guess who is loved and who is despised in western Ukraine. - Yes, Zelensky has always had little support from western Ukraine. Even in the 2019 elections, when he garnered a record vote, people from the west supported Poroshenko. Exactly. Eastern Ukrainians (“skhidnyaks” is the derogatory term used in the western parts of the country) may go to the front and die all they want. When no one has to die any longer, they will be put in their proper place. For Galicians, Russian-speaking people will always be second-class citizens. Their version of Ukrainian identity, which is about loyalty to the state, loyalty to the passport, and not what language you speak, has no chance of becoming dominant. However great the contribution of Russian-speaking southeasterners to Ukraine’s defense, Galicians will always dominate. And the Russian speakers will remain second-class citizens until they give up their language – at the very least. Any attempts to end repressions against Russian speakers, to separate Ukrainian identity from ethnicity and language and to center it around the Ukrainian state will always be doomed to fail. It is true that the elites currently in power in Ukraine come from the southeastern regions. But they have no other identity except what Galicians, with their cult of Bandera, have to offer. The collective Lviv will always maintain that as long as you speak Russian, you’re an “agent of the enemy,” that is, an agent of Russia – even despite the fact that Russian-speaking ‘skhidnyaks’ are bearing the brunt of the combat. All that common people from the southeast can hope for in the Ukrainian statehood project is to die for it. The only party that benefits from this situation in the southeast is the ‘big money,’ that is, those who own the means of production. And, as I’ve said, they will never have any other choice but to support Ukrainian nationalism."
2022-06-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/558164-melnik-appeal-german-intellectuals/,"‘Go to hell,’ Ukrainian ambassador tells German intellectuals","Kiev’s ambassador to Berlin has insulted a group of German intellectuals, who penned an open letter advocating the end of arms deliveries to Ukraine. The signatories called on the West to make Volodymyr Zelensky's regime negotiate peace. Commenting on their appeal, Andrey Melnik tweeted “Not again” on Thursday, adding in English: “What a bunch of pseudo-intellectual loosers (sic).” Referring to some of the signatories by their last names, Melnik suggested they “should go to hell with [their] defeatist advice.” The open letter, which infuriated the Ukrainian diplomat, was published in Germany’s Die Zeit newspaper on Wednesday, titled “Ceasefire now!” In it, a group of 21 German academics, philosophers, journalists, artists and ex-diplomats urged the “West to end the Ukraine war through negotiations.” Nicht schon wieder, what a bunch of pseudo-intellectual loosers 🤦‍♂️Ihr alle Varwicks, Vads, Kluges, Prechts, Yogeshwars, Zehs & Co. sollt euch endlich mit euren defätistischen „Ratschlägen“ zum Teufel scheren. Tschüßhttps://t.co/maeCCkxrBUpic.twitter.com/R6W19c66om According to the signatories, it is the EU’s duty to “restore and secure peace on the continent.” To this end, countries should come up with a strategy, which would bring the hostilities to an end as soon as possible, the appeal suggests. “Ukraine has so far been able to defend itself against the brutal Russian aggressive war thanks to, among other things, massive sanctions and military support,” they argued. However, the longer these measures last, the less clear their end game is, they added. In these intellectuals’ eyes, it is highly unlikely that Ukraine will be able to regain control of “all occupied areas including Donetsk and Lugansk regions and Crimea,” as Russia is “militarily superior and has the ability to mount further military escalation.” In light of these considerations, the letter urges Western nations supporting Ukraine militarily to ask themselves “what goal they are pursuing and whether (and for how long) weapons deliveries are still the right way.” The signatories go on to warn that the continuation of the armed conflict would mean thousands more deaths, as well as “massive humanitarian, economic and ecological emergencies all around the world.” The letter refers to food shortages in Africa and rising prices further afield as further proof of this point. The West, the authors argue, must be united in its opposition to “Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and further revanchist aspirations.” However, the “continuation of the war in Ukraine is not the solution,” the German intellectuals say. This is not the first time German public figures have penned a public letter calling for the end of Western weapons deliveries to Kiev."
2022-06-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/558156-russia-nato-founding-act/,West violated key NATO-Russia treaty – Lavrov,"Neither Russia nor NATO has ever formally denounced the 1997 Founding Act, but in practice it does not work because the bloc is in violation of it, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov assessed on Thursday. There were some who believed that the key document would be scrapped by NATO during the summit of its leaders in Madrid. “In a legal sense, the Founding Act continues to exist, we have not initiated the procedure for terminating this agreement,” the minister said during a press conference. “The decisions that were taken [in Madrid] grossly violate the terms of the Founding Act, first of all the parts regarding NATO’s obligation not to host on a permanent basis any significant troops in the territories of the new – meaning Eastern European – member states,” Lavrov said. He was referring to NATO’s decision this week to further build up its military presence at the Russian border. The Russian minister’s assessment of the viability of the 1997 document coincided with that of his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock, who is one of the most vocal critics of Russia. “The Russian government has made it clear that the NATO-Russia Founding Act is no longer worth anything to it. So we now have to acknowledge that this basic act was also unilaterally terminated by Russia, not by NATO,” Baerbock told reporters after a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in May. The key treaty was adopted as NATO was planning to expand in Europe, triggering concerns from Russia. Moscow said doing so would violate prior assurances that the alliance would not move past a unified Germany, as that posed a threat to Russian national security. The first post-Cold War wave of NATO enlargement that incorporated the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland into the bloc came two years later, with more waves following against Russian objections. Moscow has long complained about the inefficiency of the NATO-Russia Council, a forum where the two parties were supposed to settle grievances, which was established by the Act. However, the alliance used it to simply stonewall Russia, it claimed. Russia fully suspended its office at NATO HQ in Brussels in October 2021, after the organization kicked out eight Russian diplomats for allegedly working for Russian intelligence. NATO’s office in Moscow was consequently shut down."
2022-06-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/558144-medvedev-sanctions-casus-belli/,Sanctions can be perceived as casus belli – Medvedev,"Unilateral sanctions can be perceived as an “act of international aggression” and Russia has a right to self-defense, its former President Dmitry Medvedev has warned. Speaking at the 10th International legal forum in Saint Petersburg, Medvedev blasted the “cynical practice of unilateral restrictive measures against Russia, the illegality of which has been repeatedly emphasized at all levels.” This practice is “somewhat akin to a declaration of economic war, as our opponents themselves say,” he added. Under certain circumstances, such hostile steps can be perceived as an act of international aggression. And even as a casus belli. In response to them, the state has the right to individual and collective self-defense. However, Moscow still holds “weak hope” that the West will abandon its “vicious practices” and “repent of its own stupidity,” Medvedev stated. “It is our hope that our former Western partners will have the courage to admit their strategic miscalculations, which, according to the UN itself, have affected more than 1.5 billion people and provoked a surge in global inflation, food shortages, and the growth of poverty,” he said. Should such hopes not materialize, Russia “will live” on its own without the West, the ex-president explained. “Today’s world is not at all limited to the borders of Western countries,” he said. Over the past few years, Russia has repeatedly been subjected to assorted sanctions by the US and its allies. This pressure began to grow exponentially after Moscow launched its large-scale military operation in neighboring Ukraine in late February. Since then, Russia has been hit by several waves of restrictions, ultimately becoming the most-sanctioned country in the world. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked."
2022-06-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/558140-russia-withdraws-snake-island/,Russia makes ‘goodwill gesture’ to alleviate food crisis,"Russian troops were withdrawn from Ukraine’s Snake Island on Thursday, the defense ministry announced during a daily briefing. The move was described as a goodwill gesture meant to alleviate concerns over Moscow allegedly blocking attempts to haul grain out of Ukraine. “This demonstrated to the international community that the Russian Federation does not hinder the UN effort to organize a humanitarian corridor to ship agricultural products from the Ukrainian territory,” Col. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the spokesman for the ministry, said. Konashenkov assessed that with no Russian presence on the island, Kiev would find it more difficult to accuse Russia of exacerbating the global food crisis by citing the Russian Navy’s control of the northwestern part of the Black Sea as a roadblock to the movement of grain. “The ball is now in the court of the Ukrainian side, which would not remove mines from its Black Sea coast, including the areas near ports,” the Russian official said. Western nations and Ukraine have been accusing Russia of blocking seaborne exports from Kiev-controlled ports like Odessa, claiming that it was a major factor of the global hike in food prices. Moscow has denied the allegations, saying that its Navy offered safe passage to civilian ships. It’s Ukraine, Russia insists, which has prevented foreign ships from arriving and leaving its ports. Ukraine’s use of old sea mines, which are prone to coming untethered during storms, created a major problem for traffic, Moscow argued. Russia captured Snake Island, which is located 35 kilometers off the Ukrainian shore near its border with Romania, in the early days of its attack on Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky initially claimed that border guards defending the territory had all been killed after defying overwhelming Russian forces. It later turned out they’d actually surrendered. Kiev reportedly launched at least two major attempts to retake the island from Russia. Russian troops reported inflicting serious damage on their opponents in both cases. Moscow rebuked the Ukrainian operations as senseless attempts by the Ukrainian government to score publicity points.

2022-06-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/558136-ukraine-pow-exchange-putin/,Putin authorized major POW swap – Moscow,"Russia has confirmed that 144 Ukrainian soldiers have been handed over to Kiev, in exchange for the same number of Russian prisoners, saying the decision was approved by President Vladimir Putin. The exchange took place on Wednesday and was “organized and carried out on the direct orders of the Supreme Commander of the Russia Armed Forces,” Russia’s Defense Ministry spokesman, General Igor Konashenkov, said on Thursday. The order was given by Putin because “the lives, the health, the release of our servicemen, the fighters of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, who make up the majority of those returned, is the most important task,” Konashenkov said. All of those who took part in the POW exchange are “wounded or seriously wounded” and have already been provided with the necessary medical assistance, he added. Since the conflict with Kiev broke out four months ago, more than 6000 Ukrainian service personnel have been captured by or surrendered to the Russian forces, the spokesman said. The “144 for 144” prisoner exchange was first announced by Ukraine’s military intelligence service on Wednesday. It also published photos of the swap taking place. According to Kiev, those brought back to Ukraine include 43 fighters from the notorious Azov regiment. Hundreds of members of the neo-Nazi unit surrendered to Russia in May after being holed up for weeks at the Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol.

2022-06-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/558123-first-grain-laden-ship-leaves-ukraine/,Grain-laden vessel leaves Ukrainian port – official,"A vessel carrying 7,000 tons of grain left the port of Berdyansk on Thursday morning, marking the resumption of normal operations, the head of the Zaporozhsky Region has claimed. In late March, the Russian defense ministry accused Ukraine of planting hundreds of mines along the coastline of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Moscow insisted that the explosives were a “direct threat” to commercial shipping. Evgeny Balitsky, the self-described “head of the military-civil administration of Zaporozhsky Region,” made the announcement on his Telegram channel. According to the post, “after several months of downtime, the first merchant vessel has left the Berdyansk sea trading port.” Balitsky revealed that the ship was carrying grain destined for “friendly countries.” He noted that several Russian Navy warships were providing protection for the vessel. Balitsky also pointed out that the city and its harbor are “completely safe” after the Russian Navy removed mines from there. He says the port’s facilities and personnel are ready to resume work. In his post, the official noted that Berdyansk has always been a port city, with its economic prosperity largely dependent on it. Speaking to journalists in mid-June, Alexander Saulenko, the head of the district's interim administration said: “We have the prospects of signing contracts with Turkey.” He emphasized that since there was “quite a lot of grain” in the region, the authorities were eager to free up warehouses to make room for a new harvest as well as to help local farmers make money. Saulenko claimed that the port was already “up and running” by then. Russian forces seized the city in late February, just days after Moscow launched its offensive. Zaporozhsky Region is located near Russia’s Crimea and the Donetsk Republic. By late May, the Russian military seized over 70% of the region, according to an official from the pro-Moscow local administration. Following the start of the armed conflict, Kiev and its Western allies have repeatedly accused the Kremlin of blocking Ukrainian grain from passing through the Black Sea. The West claims that by allegedly disrupting the sale of Ukrainian grain to a number of African and Middle Eastern nations, Russia is deliberately provoking famine in those countries to put pressure on Ukraine’s allies. Moscow, argues that it is Ukrainian mines that are making the route impassable to commercial vessels. In early June, President Vladimir Putin guaranteed the safe passage of Ukrainian grain through Russian-controlled ports in the south of the country. He also denied any responsibility for the food shortages. At the time Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the “share of this Ukrainian grain in question is less than 1% of the global production of wheat and other cereals.” He doubled down on the claim that the “current situation with Ukrainian grain has nothing to do with the food crisis.”"
2022-06-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/558124-lithuania-kaliningrad-eu-transit/,Blockade of Russia’s Kaliningrad could be lifted soon – Reuters,"Lithuania could lift its restrictions on goods passing by rail between mainland Russia and its western exclave of Kaliningrad as soon as early July, unnamed EU officials told Reuters on Wednesday. Moscow and Brussels have been locked in disagreement since June 17, when Vilnius moved to suspend the transit of sanctioned goods between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia. The Lithuanian authorities said they were acting on instructions from Brussels, and in line with restrictions imposed on Moscow over the conflict in Ukraine. The ban left Russia with only sea routes to supply its small, but well-armed, exclave sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland. The sources told the agency that it’s proving hard for the bloc to maintain its strict sanctions while also avoiding further escalation with Russia. As a result, EU officials are in talks on exempting Kaliningrad from the sanctions, potentially paving a way for a deal in the coming days. According to the officials, Lithuania fears that if the blockade remains, Moscow could use force to create a land corridor through its territory connecting the exclave with the rest of Russia. Germany, which is reportedly actively backing the search for a compromise, is also concerned that the presence of its troops in the Baltic country could see it and the rest of NATO sucked into a direct military confrontation with Russia, the sources said. “We have to face reality,” one of the officials “with direct knowledge of the EU discussions” said, conceding that the eventual outcome of the Kaliningrad standoff may appear unfair for the bloc. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin “has much more leverage than we have. It's in our interests to find a compromise,” the official was cited as saying. Earlier this week, former Russia’s President Dmitry Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of the country’s National Security Council, warned that Moscow’s response to the actions by Lithuania could be “asymmetric” and include economic measures “capable of cutting off the oxygen to the Baltic neighbors who have taken hostile actions.” At the weekend, European Parliament member for Lithuania Petras Austrevicius also said that “heated” discussions have been underway in Brussels regarding the Kaliningrad blockade, and that Russia was “winning at the moment.” “A document has been born, which would allow the movement of sanctioned goods through the EU territory ‘from Russia to Russia,’” Austrevicius wrote in a Facebook post. The MEP called upon the EU “to stick to the earlier agreed stance and not succumb to the Russian pressure.” He also said that Lithuania could well veto a decision on Kaliningrad if it’s made by Brussels."
2022-06-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/558109-putin-ukraine-nato-goals/,Putin speaks about Ukraine during first foreign trip since February,"Russia’s objectives in Ukraine have not changed, Russian President Vladimir Putin explained on Wednesday during a press conference in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. The president clarified that while the goals stay the same, the tactics used to achieve them may change according to what the military considers appropriate. However, he insisted that “everything is going according to plan.” “Nothing has changed,” Putin insisted, saying the final goal is “to liberate Donbass, to protect these people and to create conditions that would guarantee the safety of Russia itself. That’s it.” “I'm not talking about deadlines, I never do, because that’s life, this is reality. Imposing deadlines is wrong, because it is related to the intensity of fighting, and the intensity is directly linked to the possible casualties. And we have to first and foremost think about preserving the lives of our guys,” he said. Commenting on NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg's acknowledgement that the bloc had been getting ready for a conflict since 2014, Putin said that it was “nothing new” for Moscow. He added that, for a long time, the US has been looking for an external enemy in order to rally its allies around Washington, and Russia was a better fit for that role than Iran. This once again confirms what we have been saying all along: that NATO is a Cold War relic. We were always told that NATO has changed, that it is a political bloc now, but everyone was looking for a chance and a justification to give it a new momentum as a specifically military organisation. And there you go, they do it. Responding to questions about Finland and Sweden joining the bloc, Putin said the West’s portrayal of this as a defeat for Russia, in its attempt to keep NATO away, is completely false. “We don’t have the kind of problems with Sweden and Finland that we unfortunately do with Ukraine,” he said. “We have no territorial disputes, we have nothing that would worry us with regards to Finland and Sweden’s NATO memberships. If they want to, let them.” “They have to clearly understand that they didn’t have any threats before, but now, if military forces and infrastructure are located there, we will be forced to respond tit-for-tat, and create the same threats for the territories we are threatened from,” Putin warned. “This is obvious. Do they not understand it? Everything was fine before between us, but now there will be tension, of course, I repeat, if we are threatened.” However, Putin underlined that Moscow does not view the potential threats from Stockholm and Helsinki as being as dangerous as those coming from Kiev in recent years. For us, Finland and Sweden in NATO is entirely different from Ukraine in NATO.

During the latest G7 summit, the UK leader joked that his allies should take their clothes off for the photoshoot – to show that they are “tougher than Putin.” “I don't know how they wanted to undress, waist-high or not, but I think it would be a disgusting sight either way,” the Russian president quipped. “Everything should be harmoniously developed in a person, both the body and the soul. However, in order for everything to be harmonious, one has to abandon excessive drinking and break other bad habits, start exercising, take up a sport.” Johnson also suggested that what he described as a “macho war of invasion” in Ukraine would not happen “if Putin was a woman, which he obviously isn’t.” The Russian leader responded: “I just want to remind you about the events of modern history, when Margaret Thatcher made a decision to launch military action against Argentina over the Falkland Islands. Here’s a woman, deciding to launch military action. Where are the Falkland Islands and where is Britain? And this was dictated by nothing but imperial ambitions.” “So coming from a current British Prime Minister, this is not exactly a correct remark in regards to what is happening today.” Vladimir Putin visited Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, on Wednesday, during his first foreign trip since the start of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine.

Ukraine’s military intelligence service was the first to announce the deal, releasing photos of the swap. The batch included 43 fighters from the notorious Azov regiment, Kiev noted. Hundreds of fighters of the neo-Nazi unit ended up in Russia’s custody after surrendering at the Azovstal steel plant in the city of Mariupol, last month. While Moscow has remained silent on the swap so far, the exchange was confirmed by the head of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin. “Today, 144 fighters of the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Russian Federation, captured by the enemy, we are returning home,” Pushilin wrote in a social media post. “We gave Kiev the same number of prisoners from the armed forces of Ukraine, most of whom were wounded. Several of them are privates of nationalist battalions, their condition is deplorable: the wounds are severe, with amputation of limbs and other complications,” he added. Both Russia and Ukraine claim to have captured scores of each others’ soldiers since Moscow launched its military campaign in the neighboring country in late February. Early in June, Moscow said it was holding nearly 6,500 Ukrainian fighters in custody. Ukrainian officials previously reported that 11 rounds of exchanges had taken place, with dozens of prisoners swapped.

The girl was fatally wounded when the Ukrainian military shelled the city of Makeevka, located just to the northeast of the city of Donetsk. On the day of the deadly shelling, Nina with her husband and their three daughters, as well as her neighbor with her three children, went for a walk in a garden located near a local school. “It’s just, you know, they are shooting everywhere – we didn't know where to take a walk with the kids. And at that time there was an explosion,” Nina says. The six-year-old was riding her bicycle when “everything started exploding above our heads”, the mother recalls. The family dropped to the ground to take cover from the shelling, but Alina was hit in the head by a piece of shrapnel. I jumped up and my baby was lying down. She, it turns out, was near the bike. And a pool of blood. And I grabbed her, started shouting for an ambulance to be called. The girl was rushed to the hospital, but her wound turned out to be fatal. The piece of shrapnel penetrated deep into Alina’s brain, and it was impossible to even attempt surgery to try and save her, the chief doctor of the Makeevka hospital, Anna Rudnichenko, told local media. The Ukrainian military has repeatedly subjected residential areas of Donetsk and other settlements across Donbass to heavy artillery and rocket shelling amid the ongoing conflict with Russia. Moscow has accused Kiev of deliberately targeting residential areas located nowhere near military targets, blasting such actions as “barbaric.” “We’re seeing absolutely barbaric shelling of civilian facilities. They’re barbaric. In recent days, we’ve witnessed these shellings intensify,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier this month.

Budanov made the warning in an interview with the Financial Times over the weekend, claiming that Moscow has been already facing “partisan activities” in the Ukrainian territories seized amid the ongoing conflict that began in late February. The attack and sabotage operations are not limited to these areas and “are held everywhere, and they were and will be held in Russia and many other places,” he told the newspaper. Budanov now faces charges in Russia over “threatening to stage a terror act.” According to Russian law, such an offense incurs a heavy penalty and can land someone convicted behind bars for up to 15 years.

Norwegian media outlets had previously cited the authorities as confirming that the Russians on Svalbard were denied an exemption from sanctions that were imposed on Moscow over its conflict with Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry said that miners and other personnel have been unable to receive “critical” goods, including food, medical equipment, building materials, and spare parts. Moscow promised “appropriate retaliatory measures” if the issue was not resolved. Svalbard has been a flashpoint of diplomatic tensions between Moscow and Oslo before, when Norway tightened entry requirements following the 2015 visit of a senior Russian official under EU sanctions on account of Ukraine. Norway is not a member of the bloc. Russia protested that such behavior was violating the 1920 treaty that established Norwegian rule over the islands. This month, Moscow also accused Lithuania of breaking international law by suspending the transit of sanctioned goods in the Kaliningrad Region, a small Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea, and the rest of Russia."

Zelensky made the remarks as he addressed the NATO summit in Madrid via a video link on Wednesday. “It’s either urgent aid to Ukraine sufficient for victory, or a delayed war between Russia and you,” Zelensky told NATO leaders. The country needs both direct military and financial aid, Zelensky stated, adding that some $5 billion a month was needed to cover its budget deficit. Top Ukrainian officials have repeatedly called upon the West to provide financial support. “Financial aid for Ukraine has no less significance than arms deliveries,” Zelensky said. “We need some $5 billon every month, you know that. And this is a fundamental thing, needed for defense and protection.” To help Ukraine now end this war with a victory on the battlefield, that is, to give a really strong response to Russia’s actions – this is what we, and the entire alliance, the whole Euro-Atlantic community need. Once the conflict is over, Ukraine must be provided with a decent place in the Western security architecture, Zelensky insisted, rejecting the prospect of Ukraine remaining in a “gray zone” between Russia and the NATO bloc. “We need security guarantees, and you must find a place for Ukraine in the common security space,” he stressed.

Among other things, Kiev plans to launch rocket artillery strikes from the city of Krivoy Rog in the Dnepropetrovsk Region, according to a statement by Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev. Ukrainian nationalists would fire from a location in a residential area at a hospital in a Russia-controlled community, he claimed. “The Ukrainian neo-Nazis want to trigger return fire and then accuse the Russian armed forces of indiscriminate attacks against civilian infrastructure and Ukrainian non-combatants,” Mizintsev said. In a separate case, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has been in contact with health officials in Odessa Region to “work out issues with reception and treatment of people injured by toxic chemicals,” the official added. The Russian military believes this to be an indicator that Kiev wants to stage a fake chemical weapon attack and blame it on Russia. Mizintsev is the head of the National Defense Control Center of Russia, and also supervises the Russian military’s humanitarian mission for the Ukraine operation. In his statement, he addressed Western nations and international organizations such as the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross, warning that Kiev is preparing “these and other similar provocations” against Russia, using the supportive media to make the claims seem credible.

There were no casualties or damage on the ground from the crash, the official reported. The governor published photos from the crash site and said Russian authorities were investigating the incident. First produced in the 1970s, the Tu-141 is a six-ton drone with a range of about 1,000km (621 miles), which places Kursk easily within its reach from most of Ukraine. Russia has not used the model for over 30 years. Ukraine inherited several Tu-141s during the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

The court now has up to two months to review the verdict. According to the news agency, Pinner’s locally appointed lawyer asked the court to reduce the sentence to life imprisonment. Pinner was captured by Russian and Donbass troops during the siege of Mariupol, and was accused by the DPR of being a mercenary and waging an illegal war against the republic. He was sentenced to death this month along with another British national, Aiden Aslin, and Saadoun Brahim, who is originally from Morocco. The British government said it was “appalled” by the verdict and promised to fight for the release of Pinner and Aslin. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said that Aslin and Pinner should be treated as POWs, not mercenaries, and called their trial in Donetsk a “sham judgment with absolutely no legitimacy.” The Kremlin maintains that the trial itself and the sentencing is the domestic affair of the DPR. Andrey Kelin, Russia’s ambassador to the UK, said last week that he had received a “contemptuous and condescending” letter from London regarding the two captured Britons. The tone of message was “not a call for dialogue,” he added, advising the UK government to contact the DPR authorities directly."
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/558032-lavrov-kremenchug-weapons-ukraine/,Russia warns West of consequences of arming Ukraine,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned the West that continuing to supply Ukraine with advanced weaponry will only prolong the conflict in the east European country. Speaking at a press conference, on Tuesday, the veteran diplomat stated that the position of the West regarding Ukraine is “absolutely counterproductive and harmful.” “Pumping up” Ukraine with Western weapons will only lead Russia “to perform more missions on the ground,” he added. “The more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer this conflict will last, the longer the agony of the Nazi regime, which is supported by Western capitals, will last,” Lavrov outlined, commenting on accusations from Ukrainian and Western politicians related to a shopping mall in Kremenchug, which was allegedly hit by Russian forces on Monday. Lavrov referred to an earlier statement by the Russian Defense Ministry, according to which the military targeted a hangar with American and European weapons and ammunition. The detonations that resulted set fire to the mall, which was empty, the foreign minister stressed. Kiev has claimed that around 1,000 people were inside the building. An assertion which isn't supported by the available video evidence. “I am saying it to emphasize the fact that the longer weapons are supplied, which are designed to prolong the conflict, prolong the suffering of civilians who constantly live under shelling by the Ukrainian neo-Nazi movement, the more missions we will perform on the ground,” Lavrov said. He added that “these missions will be completed.” Lavrov’s remarks came as the G7 leaders agreed to continue supporting Ukraine, both militarily and financially, “for as long as it takes.”"
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/558034-unsc-ukraine-zelensky-kremenchug/,Russia and West clash at UN Security Council,"Russia does not target civilians in Ukraine and did not strike a shopping center in Kremenchug, Moscow’s envoy to the UN told the Security Council on Tuesday. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said the mall caught fire due to an explosion of Western-supplied weapons and ammunition, stored at the nearby factory and intended to used in shelling civilians in the Donbass, making it a legitimate military target. He also criticized the UNSC for breaching protocol and allowing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to address the council via video-link, after refusing such a request from the Central African Republic. “In reality, there was no strike on the mall,” Polyanskiy told the council, as Russia targeted a storage facility at the Kredmash factory next door. The weapons and ammunition stored there were bound for the front, where Ukrainian artillery has been bombarding the civilians of Donbass, for many years, to no objection from the UN, he added. “The Russian strike stopped that.” Polyanskiy pointed out that Ukrainian media clearly shows images of intact merchandise inside the Amstor shopping center, and windows of nearby residential buildings that had not shattered. The fire was caused by explosions of the Western-supplied ammunition at Kredmash, he said. Moscow’s envoy accused Ukraine of waging a propaganda war, using fakes and lies such as the ‘Snake Island 13’ and the ‘Ghost of Kiev’ to campaign for more weapons and financial aid from the West. Actual testimonials of civilians from Donbass show that they blame only the Ukrainian military, which deploys around residential homes and uses civilians as human shields, Polyanskiy argued. Tuesday’s session was convened by Albania, a NATO member state which chairs the UNSC through the end of June. It was opened by Rosemary DiCarlo, a US diplomat currently serving as UN under-secretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs. She said that entire cities in Ukraine were being “leveled” by the Russian military and described Monday’s incident in Kremenchug as “one of the most shocking attacks of the conflict.” The keynote speaker, however, was Zelensky. Appearing via video-link – in what Polyanskiy objected to as a breach of protocol – the Ukrainian president once again demanded that the UN declare Russia a “terrorist state,” expel it from the Security Council and the General Assembly, and set up an international tribunal, as had been done for the Rwandan genocide. “Deprive the terrorist state of its powers!” he told the council. Zelensky accused Russia of waging a “full-scale war of conquest” against Ukraine and being a “terrorist and enemy of humanity.” Russia only has a permanent seat in the UNSC due to the “shortsightedness” of the West at the end of the Cold War, he insisted, and ought to be expelled from the UN outright. Russia is the world's largest nuclear power. A subject Zelensky didn't mention. Representatives of Poland, Estonia, and the UK voiced support for Kiev. Polyanskiy insisted that Russia launched its military operation to prevent Ukraine from becoming an anti-Russian weapon in the hands of the West. “Until these goals are achieved, our operation will continue,” the Russian envoy said."
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/558029-driving-ukraine-putin-help/,Driving alone helps Putin – Ukrainian MP,"Driving alone is not a smart way to use resources amid the current energy crisis, so those who are wasting petrol are helping Russian President Vladimir Putin, Andrey Gerus, the head of the energy committee of the Ukrainian parliament, has claimed. Speaking during a briefing on Tuesday, Gerus expressed gratitude for oil supplies from Western Europe and the fact that the situation at gas stations was stabilizing and, he hoped, will further improve. In June, Ukraine was able to increase fuel imports by 50% compared to May – up to 600,000 tons, Geros said. However, he argued, citizens should also be responsible. It would be nice to cooperate and to have several people in the car. We can say that if you are driving alone – it means you are driving Putin. If you have a seat on the right and free seats behind it, this is not the optimal use of resources. Gerus, who represents Ukraine’s ruling party ‘Servant of the People’, also revealed that at some gas stations there is a limit of 40 liters per car, and at others it's restricted to 20 liters. He pledged that in July these quotas would “either be raised or removed.” The EU has faced an energy crunch over the past few months, as member countries have taken steps to decrease Russian energy supplies since Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine. EU officials have accused the Kremlin of using energy resources as a political weapon, claiming that the Ukrainian conflict is responsible for the soaring price of petrol and diesel, spikes in inflation, and the skyrocketing cost of living. Moscow has rejected the accusations, saying that the current crisis is a result of systematic economic policy mistakes implemented by Western leaders."
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/558023-tanker-oil-embargo-sanctions/,US stops tanker with Russian oil – media,"The US Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has detained for inspection a tanker loaded with fuel oil and vacuum gasoil traveling to the state of Louisiana from Russia, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday citing people familiar with the matter. The vessel, called the Daytona, is owned by the Greek company TMS Tankers Ltd. and was chartered by the Swiss-based commodities trader Vitol. Vacuum gasoil is refined into diesel and gasoline, while fuel oil is typically used for heating. The Daytona was supposed to dock in New Orleans on Sunday with a cargo it picked up in early June from Russia’s Taman Peninsula. The Black Sea port on the other side of the Kerch Strait from Crimea is a terminus for a pipeline from Kazakhstan, among other things. A Coast Guard official confirmed to the WSJ that the Daytona is undergoing checks by the CBP. TMS Tankers had no comment on the situation, while Vitol told the Journal that they operate “in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations, including sanctions.” The US banned all imports of Russian oil, coal and liquid natural gas in March, citing the conflict in Ukraine. The embargo does not apply to products that transit through Russia – including those from Kazakhstan, whose fuel oil and vacuum gasoil exports account for about 25% of the Taman terminal’s business. According to the Journal, however, the commodity tracking platform Kpler indicates that the Daytona’s cargo is Russian in origin. At a meeting in Germany on Tuesday, the G7 countries announced they were considering an embargo on all Russian oil shipments around the world, unless Moscow agrees to sell it at a Western-imposed price cap. The proposal comes as energy costs have risen across the globe in response to the anti-Russian sanctions by the US and its allies."
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/558016-ukraine-russian-missile-hit/,Ukraine confirms Russian missile hit plant adjacent to burned down shopping mall,"The Russian military on Monday targeted the Kredmash vehicle plant in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchug, the chairman of the factory’s supervisory board, Nikolay Danileyko, has confirmed. The plant is located right next to the shopping mall that was destroyed in a blaze after the missile strike, with 18 people reported killed and over 50 injured. The factory was a civilian facility and had not produced military vehicles or parts for them since 1989, Danileyko told local media. The plant’s workers were not injured in the attack, he added. Footage from the scene aired by local media shows a large crater in the middle of one of the factory’s hangars. The strike inflicted heavy damage on the building, blowing away parts of its roofing and walls and rupturing underground piping. While Kiev was quick to accuse Moscow of deliberately attacking the shopping mall itself, the Russian military maintained it had targeted a stockpile of Western-supplied weaponry on the premises of the Kredmash plant. Secondary detonations of the destroyed weapons sparked a fire that spread to the shopping mall, the Russian military claimed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed the shopping mall was tightly packed, with “more than a thousand civilians” visiting it at the time of the strike. Footage from the scene taken moments after the strike, however, showed that the parking lot by the mall was almost empty, with several armed individuals in military uniform roaming the area. The mayor of Kremenchug pinned the blame for the civilian casualties on the venue’s operators, accusing them of ignoring a warning of an imminent air attack. “Ukraine is at war, so ignoring an air raid alert is a crime, which the tragedy in Amstor [mall] demonstrated once again,” the mayor, Vitaly Maletsky, wrote on social media."
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/558022-bulgaria-diplomats-expelled-intelligence/,Bulgaria expels dozens of Russian diplomats,"Bulgaria will expel 70 employees of Russian diplomatic missions, the country’s Prime Minister Kirill Petkov told journalists on Tuesday, claiming that many of the staff members worked “for foreign intelligence services.” The prime minister refused to provide any further details about the decision, citing confidentiality. “I can say that a large part of [the diplomats] have worked for foreign intelligence services and their diplomatic role was just a cover,” Petkov said. He stressed that the measure should not be considered an act of aggression against the Russian people. “I would like to tell all foreign countries, not just Russia, that anyone who works against Bulgaria’s interests will be expelled back to the country they came from,” Petkov said. The prime minister said that all the diplomats would leave on the same plane on Sunday. A spokesperson for the Russian embassy in Sofia told the TASS news agency that among those being expelled are the mission’s deputy head Filip Voskresensky, as well as the heads of the consulates general in the cities of Varna and Ruse, and the director of the Russian cultural and information center. The consulate general in Ruse remains without any diplomats or technical staff, while the one in Varna is almost without staff, the embassy’s spokesperson said. The diplomatic mission later announced that the consular department of the embassy and the consulate general in Varna are suspending operations, while the consulate general in Ruse is closing. The Russian Foreign Ministry said that the Bulgarian authorities’ actions would be met with “an appropriate response.” The ‘diplomatic war’ between the West and Russia has significantly intensified since the launch of the Russian military offensive in Ukraine in late February. In March, Bulgaria expelled twelve Russian diplomats, accusing them of violating the Vienna Convention. In late April, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed that since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine on February 24, around 400 diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries. Russia views the expulsions as “unfriendly” actions, or, in the words of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, as acts of “boorishness.” Moscow has previously warned that it would retaliate against all such moves."
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/557903-us-calls-rus-decolonize/,World’s largest imperial power sponsors calls for Russia to ‘decolonize’ and the lack of self-awareness is palpable,"On June 23, 2022, an organization funded by the US Congress, the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe – also known as the Helsinki Commission – held a virtual conference calling for the “decolonizing of Russia.” This begs the question of why they are not seeking the decolonization of the United States. After all, the country was literally founded by the successors of white colonists who had crossed an ocean to violently seize the territory from its indigenous people. While the conference speakers, who can be listened to here, used the current crisis in Ukraine as a jumping off point, they demanded that the Russian Federation “decolonizes” from regions and republics which have been governed by Moscow since the 16th century (e.g. Siberia and Tatarstan) and others going back to the early 1800’s (e.g. Chechnya). This is, of course, tantamount to calling upon the US to relinquish nearly all of its territory from the Atlantic to Pacific, not to mention more recent holdings such as Hawaii. Indeed, when a conference attendee asked what the US should do with Hawaii in light of this “decolonization” discussion, the panel speakers danced around this issue and quickly changed the topic, showing they are not so concerned about “decolonization” at all, but are truly interested in breaking up the Russian Federation for its own sake. The conference speakers focused greatly on Soviet-era Russia, though again the republics they cited were part of Russia long before the multi-national 1917 Revolution. If anything, the USSR gave these places greater independence than they ever had. Raising the specter of the Soviet Union, and conflating it with modern-day Russia is the standard canard used to drum up hysteria against Moscow as some type of imperial power seeking to conquer the world. But this attempt fails, for the irony, of course, is that, as great historians such as Eric Hobsbawm and Jean Bricmont have emphasized, there was no country in the world that supported Third World liberation struggles against colonialism (and this was invariably Western colonialism) more than the Soviet Union. And, certainly after World War II, it was the US which fought mercilessly to retain Western colonialism. Thus, when one looks at the cases of Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Palestine and Nicaragua, just to name a few examples, it was the USSR that aided the national independence struggles of these countries, while the US militarily defended the ancien régimes. Of course, the most notable case of this was South Africa and the southern African frontline states where the US, and its partner Israel, tried desperately to maintain Apartheid and settler colonial domination while the Soviet Union, and its ally Cuba, fought, and quite successfully, to end these systems. In addition, it must be emphasized that it was the Soviet Union, more so than any other country, which led the fight, in the 1940s, against the attempt of Nazi Germany to colonize Europe – and indeed the rest of the world. And the USSR lost 27 million people doing so. Meanwhile, since WWII, the US has created an empire on a scope hitherto unknown in the world. It is now estimated that “the United States has approximately 800 formal military bases in 80 countries, a number that could exceed 1,000 if you count troops stationed at embassies and missions and so-called ‘lily-pond’ bases, with some 138,000 soldiers stationed around the globe.” No other country in the world has, or ever has had, such a military reach. Indeed, the relatively few other countries that have military bases abroad have a combined number of bases totaling not even one-tenth the number of US bases. Thus, “only 11 other countries have bases in foreign countries, some 70 altogether. Russia has an estimated 26 to 40 in nine countries, mostly former Soviet Republics, as well as in Syria and Vietnam.” (emphasis added). And speaking of Syria, while the Helsinki Commission speakers attempted to claim that Russia has been engaged in some type of neo-colonial effort there, it is in fact the US which is the uninvited (and therefore illegal) invader in Syria and is now occupying one-third of the country against the wishes of the Syrian government and regularly plundering Syrian oil from this occupied land in violation of the Geneva Conventions. And of course, it is the US, not Russia, which has, in just the past 29 years, traveled halfway around the world to invade, and invariably destroy, other nations such as Iraq (twice), the former Yugoslavia, Libya, Somalia and Afghanistan. In a brazen act of colonial theft, the US simply stole $7 billion (or about 40% of national revenue) from Afghanistan after its 20-year war there. The US continues to hold these funds even as Afghanistan faces a looming famine and the after effects of a devastating earthquake. Similarly, the US purloined Venezuela’s greatest single source of national revenue – its US-based oil company CITGO, which is now being sold off by Washington in pieces. And of course, the US stole billions of dollars of Russian financial reserves held in American banks earlier this year. Meanwhile, Washington continues to maintain its colonial hold over territories such as Puerto Rico, Guam, Guantanamo Bay, and Hawaii, not to mention the fact that the entire territory of what is now known as the United States of America represents lands stolen from indigenous peoples and Mexico. In short, the US government and its compliant NGOs have no business talking about “decolonizing” anyone before they get down to the business of decolonizing their own lands. Such an effort could start with the removal of US military bases from around the world and the accompanying withdrawal of all US foreign troops; the return of all stolen monies and resources to such countries as Afghanistan, Syria, Venezuela and Russia; the return of Guantanamo Bay to Cuba; holding referendums in Puerto Rico and Hawaii on independence; and paying major reparations to the indigenous peoples of the United States and the descendants of former slaves. Such a focus on one’s own country’s sins is not only the right thing to do but has greater prospects for success and also avoids the risks attendant in advocating the forced break-up of other nations, such as the Russian Federation – something the Helsinki Commission is at least implicitly calling for in its demand for the “decolonization” of Russia."
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/558020-demography-ukraine-refugees-expert/,Impact of refugee exodus on Ukraine’s demographics evaluated,"The population of Ukraine might decrease by up to five million people if the military conflict with Russia becomes protracted. The warning was issued by Ella Libanova, director of the Ukrainian Institute of Demography and Social Research, who said many refugees might remain abroad permanently. Speaking during a national TV marathon, Libanova said that the main factor for the country’s demographics now is the duration of the “hot phase” of the Russian offensive. “If it is over by the end of the year, I think that we will lose about 500,000 – 600,000 people. It’s a lot, but not a disaster. If the hot phase of the war lasts, say, 2 years, then it could be up to five million,” Libanova said, adding that the longer war lasts, the more people will leave. In her opinion, when the restrictions on departing the country imposed on men aged 18-60 are lifted, “family reunification will take place not in Ukraine, but abroad.” The situation with internal migration is even more complicated, the demographer said. She claimed that even when the military conflict is over, people will be aware of the fact that Russia remains an “aggressive neighbor.” Therefore, she argued, families and businesses might choose not to return to the regions close to the Russian border. “Therefore, I am not convinced that we will be able to restore the pre-war distribution of the population {and} business,” she said. Earlier this month, Libanova proposed a set of measures which, in her opinion, the Ukrainian government should take in order to minimize the impact of the conflict on the country’s demographic situation. Most important, she stressed, is for the state to maintain contact with those who have left by providing them with opportunities to work and study remotely. She also warned that Ukraine should not expect a baby boom immediately after the end of the conflict. “Children will be born only when there is a rapid increase in living standards and improvement in quality of life, when there are living conditions for parents. But this will not happen immediately after the war,” she said. Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that approximately 12 million Ukrainians had left their homes since the beginning of the Russian operation. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as of June 21, nearly 5.3 million refugees from Ukraine have been registered for national protection schemes in Europe. However, the total number of Ukrainians fleeing the country seems to be higher: the agency reports more than 8 million border crossings from Ukraine. Prior to February, Ukraine’s population was estimated at 41.2 million people. As Europe deals with one of the most serious migrant crises in modern history, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the West in late March of a new influx of migrants, which, in his opinion, will “inevitably” follow the food crisis."
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/558002-svalbard-norway-blockade-sanctions/,Russians in Arctic face Norwegian blockade,"A Russian Arctic mining operation in the Svalbard Islands is facing shortages after Norwegian authorities held up over 20 tons of supplies in the port of Storskog, citing the EU sanctions against Moscow over the conflict in Ukraine. The foreign ministry in Oslo acknowledged on Tuesday that the Russian application for a humanitarian exemption had been rejected. The special permit application submitted by the Russian embassy and the mining company Arktikugol was rejected on June 15, the Norwegian national broadcaster NRK reported on Tuesday. Arktikugol runs the mining town of Barentsburg, which is mainly inhabited by Russian nationals. The archipelago, about halfway between the Arctic circle and the north pole, has fewer than 3,000 residents and has been under Norwegian jurisdiction for about a century. Norwegian laws apply in Barentsburg, even though its residents are Russians, Siri R. Svendsen of the foreign ministry told NRK. Therefore, she said, the cargo bound for the islands is subject to EU sanctions against Moscow. Barentsburg relies on a single ship that ferries goods from Tromsø to the islands every ten days. Previously, Russian supplies were brought by truck from Murmansk and loaded on the ferry. However, Norway has held up the supplies at the Storskog border crossing with Russia. Arktikugol fears a humanitarian crisis in Barentsburg if the goods are not allowed through, according to a letter the company sent to the Norwegian authorities last month. Russian consul general Sergey Gushchin has told NRK that fruits, vegetables, flour, and dairy were running short, but described the situation as “stable” for now. Spare parts, medical, and technical equipment were also blockaded on the border, however. “I can assure you that no one will suffer harm in any direction as long as it is Norway that has full and complete control over the archipelago,” Svalbard governor Lars Fause told the national broadcaster. The government is in “ongoing dialogue” with Arktikugol, he added. Svalbard has been a flashpoint of diplomatic tensions between Moscow and Oslo before, when Norway tightened entry requirements following the 2015 visit of a senior Russian official under EU sanctions on account of Ukraine. Russia protested that such behavior was violating the 1920 treaty that established Norwegian rule over the islands."
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/557990-reporter-rape-ukraine-blacklist/,Journalist branded enemy of state by Ukraine,"Ukrainian journalist Sonya Lukashova ended up on the notorious Mirotvorets (‘Peacemaker’) website after penning an article claiming that a vast majority of Russian military rape allegations produced by the country's now former human rights chief, Lyudmila Denisova, were false. Mirotvorets, widely believed to be run by Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU), lists individuals deemed to be “enemies of Ukraine.” The bombshell expose was published by the Ukrainskaya Pravda (Ukrainian Truth) newspaper on Monday. According to the piece, citing various official sources, a vast majority of allegations of “sexual atrocities,” purportedly committed by Russian troops amid the ongoing conflict, were false. The allegations have been spread by human rights chief Denisova, who got ousted in late May after a no-confidence vote over her failure to organize humanitarian corridors and prisoner exchanges as well as “inexplicably focusing” on spreading unverified and unsubstantiated claims. According to the report, Ukrainian law enforcement officials tried to investigate Denisova’s claims but found no evidence to back them up. After interrogating Denisova several times, officials discovered she had received all her explosive revelations from her daughter, Alexandra Kvitko, “over tea.” The latter ran a ‘psychological hotline’ for victims of wartime violence, established in collaboration between Denisova’s office and UNICEF. The hotline lacked transparency, and while Kvitko reportedly told investigators it received over 1,000 calls in only a month and a half, with some 450 of them detailing the rape of minors, the hotline’s logs suggested it got only 92 calls. The exact nature of the calls remained unclear as well, since Kvitko failed to provide investigators with any details on the alleged victims, according to the report. Multiple Ukrainian public figures condemned the expose, insisting that reporting on the activities of the disgraced human rights chief and her daughter helps Russia. Political commentator and prominent supporter of ex-president Petro Poroshenko, Taras Berezovets, for instance, bluntly accused the reporter of producing prime material for “Russian propaganda.” “The author of the Denisova investigation, Sonya Lukashova, who accused the former human rights chief of creating numerous fakes about the rape of Ukrainian children, ended up on the Mirotvorets database. Lukashova’s material has been very heavily cited by Russian propaganda,” Berezovets said in a social media post. The Mirotvorets listing for Lukashova states that the reporter’s activities are somehow “incompatible with journalist ethics.” The journalist stands accused of actively participating “in special information operations of the Russian aggression against Ukraine,” as well as of “manipulating publicly significant information.” The report published by the newspaper amounts to “concealing evidence of crimes” allegedly perpetrated by the Russian military, according to Mirotvorets. The Mirotvorets website was created in 2014 as a public database of “pro-Russian terrorists, separatists, mercenaries, war criminals, and murderers.” The website provides links to social media accounts and personal information, such as home addresses, phones, and emails. Over the years, numerous high-profile public figures and politicians have ended up on the Mirotvorets list over actions deemed to be “anti-Ukrainian.” Hungary’s PM Viktor Orban and former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger are among the latest additions to the database."
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/558008-macron-refuses-designate-russia/,Macron refuses to designate Russia ‘sponsor of terrorism’,"French President Emmanuel Macron did not support the proposal of his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky to designate Russia a “sponsor of terrorism,” explaining that Paris doesn’t need any “definitions” to sanction Moscow or condemn its alleged “war crimes.” On Monday, Zelensky claimed that “the Russian state had become the largest terrorist organization in the world.” “And this must be a legal fact,” the Ukrainian president wrote on Telegram. Commenting on Zelensky’s statement during a press conference on Tuesday, Macron said that his country does not follow such “methodology” and has been consistent in its approach to Russian “war crimes.” Referring to the alleged murder of civilians in the city of Bucha by Russian forces (something that Moscow vehemently denies), Macron stated that “these are war crimes.” He stressed that Paris condemns them and supports investigations that will eventually bring those responsible for the atrocities to “Ukrainian and international justice.” Moreover, France does not need any judicial definitions for sanctioning Russia, Macron claimed. “We sanction Russia and we do not need any definitions to carry out these sanctions,” the French leader said. He added that as “Russia cannot and should not win” in the conflict, France and its allies will continue to impose restrictions on Moscow and to support Ukraine, both economically and militarily, for as long as will be necessary. According to Macron, the goal is to ensure that Kiev can negotiate with Russia “on its terms and at the moment it chooses.” Macron has consistently refused to use judicial terms for describing the situation in Ukraine. In April, he said that he would not use the word ‘genocide’ to describe Russia’s conduct in Ukraine, explaining that “the word ‘genocide’ must be qualified by jurists, not by politicians.” Zelensky, meanwhile, claimed that everyone in the world should know that “buying or transporting Russian oil, maintaining contacts with Russian banks, paying taxes and customs duties to the Russian state means giving money to terrorists.” Since the launch of the Russian military offensive in Ukraine, Moscow and Kiev have been accusing each other of targeting civilians and committing other war crimes. On Monday, Ukraine claimed Russia attacked a shopping center in the city of Kremenchug, killing and injuring many civilians. The Russian military responded that it had targeted a stockpile of Western weapons but that the detonation of the munitions caused damage to a nearby shopping mall, which, according to Moscow, was non-functioning. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/557988-roscosmos-posts-nato-coordinates/,Russian space agency mocks NATO,"The Russian space agency marked the start of a key summit of NATO leaders in Madrid on Tuesday by releasing satellite images and coordinates of Western seats of power. While the leaders of the 30 members of the US-led bloc are busy with their deliberations in the Spanish capital, “Roscosmos publishes satellite images of the proverbial ‘decision making centers’ that support Ukrainian nationalists,” the agency said in a post on social media, which included the photos. “We are providing coordinates of the sites. Just in case.” The coordinates were the not-so-secret locations of the White House and Pentagon in the US, No. 10 Downing Street in London, the Élysée Palace in Paris, the German Chancellery in Berlin and NATO’s own headquarters in Brussels. During the NATO summit in Madrid this week, members of the organization will adopt a new Strategic Concept of the alliance, which is expected to identify Russia as a major security threat and cite China as a concern. The bloc will discuss plans to support Ukraine against Russia, boost the militaries of member states and enlarge itself by accepting Finland and Sweden as new allies. Earlier in June, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told Al Jazeera that Moscow would strike “decision-making centers” if Kiev used the weapons it had received from the United States to attack Russian territory. “It is obvious what those decision-making centers are: the defense ministry, the general staff and so on,” he added. “But it should be understood that, in this case, the ultimate decision-making centers are regretfully not even on the territory of Kiev.”"
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/557981-ukraine-mall-air-alert/,Ukrainian mayor blames shopping mall management for deaths,"Management at a Ukrainian shopping mall, where 18 people were reported killed on Monday after a nearby Russian air strike, ignored a warning of an imminent air attack, the mayor of Kremenchug reported on Tuesday. “Ukraine is at war, so ignoring an air raid alert is a crime, which the tragedy in Amstor demonstrated once again,” Vitaly Maletsky wrote on social media. He threatened public venues with criminal prosecution if they fail to evacuate patrons and employees when a warning is given by the authorities. The mayor posted a screenshot of what he claimed to be the official social media account of the outlet, which informed that it would remain open during alert periods. The policy change took effect last Thursday, according to the timestamp. Ukraine claimed that a Russian airstrike killed and injured scores of civilians at the mall in Kremenchug. President Volodymyr Zelensky called it one of the “most brazen terrorist attacks in European history”. On Tuesday, Moscow confirmed attacking the city, but denied targeting the shopping venue. The strike hit a nearby plant where West-supplied munitions were stored before being shipped to the frontline, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. Detonations of the ammo caused damage to the shopping center, the report claimed. The ministry described the mall as not operational at the time of the attack. The Russian military regularly launches missile attacks deep in Ukrainian territory but claims it only targets sites of military importance. On several occasions during the four-month-long conflict with Ukraine, it has hit a major oil refinery in Kremenchug, which presumably processed fuel for Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s air defense regularly warns the residents of areas that the authorities believe may be hit by Russia, prompting them to seek shelter. The entire Poltava region in central Ukraine, where Kremenchug is located, had been considered under threat on Monday before the mall incident, according to local media. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/557977-urkaine-friendly-fire-claims/,Foreign mercenaries shot allied Ukrainian troops – Moscow,"A lack of competence among Ukrainian forces, including foreigners recruited to fight for Kiev, has resulted in at least two known cases of friendly fire, the Russian military claimed on Tuesday. In one reported mix-up, recruits arriving at the position of the 97th battalion of the 60th infantry brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were shelled by the same people they were supposed to be joining. Another incident occurred with soldiers of the 28th mechanized brigade, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. A recon team of that unit was attacked by foreign mercenaries, who killed four troops and injured three others, the ministry said in a daily briefing. The report did not offer further details about when and where the alleged accidents happened. Accounts of friendly fire incidents have also come from Western fighters. Last week, a Rolling Stone story about US war veterans killed or captured in Ukraine mentioned instances like these, among other issues that foreign combatants regularly experience there. “We had a two-hour firefight that later turned out to be against Ukrainian special forces. It is unbelievable what goes on here,” Tristan Nettles, a member of an English-speaking squad fighting in Ukraine, told the magazine. “Bridges blown up while friendly forces are still on the other side, no communication between units, friendly fire all the time,” he said regarding the situation on the battlefield. Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, following Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/557971-us-multiple-launch-rocket-systems-ukraine-debut/,Ukraine hits Donbass with American HIMARS – LPR,"US-supplied М142 HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems have already been used by the Ukrainian military in Donbass, the authorities in the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR) reported on Tuesday. On their Telegram channel, the LPR’s representatives from the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination on ceasefire and stabilization of the demarcation line (JCCC) posted a message that read, “shelling has been detected from the positions of Ukrainian armed groups: at 7:20AM … using the М142 HIMARS (1 missile).” This is the first time the local authorities have reported that the US-supplied systems have been used in combat. Taking to Facebook on Saturday, the chief of Ukraine’s General Staff, Valery Zaluzhny, wrote: “Multiple rocket launcher M142 HIMARS are already working in the interest of Ukraine’s defense.” He added that Ukrainian troops “skillfully hit certain targets – military targets of the enemy on our, Ukrainian, territory.” Zaluzhny also posted a two-minute video clip, said to show how the pro-Kiev forces operate the long-range rocket system. The arrival of several M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System units in Ukraine was also confirmed last Thursday by Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov. In a Twitter post, he expressed his gratitude to “colleague and friend @SecDef Lloyd J. Austin III for these powerful tools!” HIMARS have arrived to Ukraine.Thank you to my 🇺🇲 colleague and friend @SecDef Lloyd J. Austin III for these powerful tools!Summer will be hot for russian occupiers. And the last one for some of them. pic.twitter.com/BTmwadthpp Also on Thursday, acting Pentagon press secretary Todd Breasseale revealed that Washington would send Kiev four more HIMARS systems, in addition to the four already delivered. On top of that, Britain is shipping three tracked M270 MLRS systems, while Germany has pledged to contribute another three. Ukrainian officials, however, insist they need far more weapons to achieve parity with Russia’s forces. Plans to deliver the four HIMARS units were announced by US President Joe Biden in early June. According to media reports, the White House had initially been concerned that Ukrainian forces could hit targets inside Russia with the help of these long-range systems, which could be construed as further escalation by Moscow. The US said it would provide GMLRS guided rockets with the systems, which have a range of 32-60km. The HIMARS platform can also fire a single guided missile with a range of up to 300km, but the US has not yet provided Ukraine with these projectiles. Following the announcement, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, the “Ukrainians have given us assurances that they will not use these systems against targets on Russian territory.” However, several senior Ukrainian officials have since said that Kiev reserves the right to use US-supplied weapons on targets in Crimea, which both Ukraine and Russia consider part of their own territory. The peninsula became a Russian region following a referendum in 2014, in which the vast majority voted for reunification with Russia after the Maidan coup in Kiev."
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/557962-ukraine-world-war-nato/,Attack on Crimea could spark WW3 – Medvedev,"Ukraine could unleash a world war by attacking Crimea, if it becomes a full-fledged NATO member, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has warned. “For us, Crimea is part of Russia. And that will be so forever. Any attempt to infringe upon Crimea is a declaration of war against our nation. If a NATO member does that, it would mean a conflict with the entire North Atlantic Alliance. World War III. Total disaster,” he said in an interview with the newspaper Argumenty i Fakty published on Tuesday. Crimea broke away from Ukraine after the 2014 coup in Kiev, and voted to re-join Russia in a referendum. The move was rejected by Ukraine, which considers the peninsula a Russian-occupied territory. Ukrainian officials have said that their pledge not to use Western-supplied weapons against Russian territory does not apply to Crimea. Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chair of the Security Council of Russia, described the scenario while commenting on why NATO expansion into Ukraine would be more dangerous than Finland and Sweden joining the bloc. He said Russia does not like the proposed expansion in Northern Europe, but can live with it. “We don’t have and don’t expect to have any territorial disputes with those nations, or even possible causes for one. If they feel better and safer by joining the alliance, let them have it. NATO is already next to our nation without Sweden and Finland,” he said. This, however, comes with the caveat that Russia would react to the expected admission of the Nordic nations by deploying nuclear weapons in the Baltic, among other things, Medvedev noted. “Nobody is excited about that, including the citizens of the two NATO candidates. Having our Iskander [tactical missiles], hypersonic missiles and nuclear-armed warships on one’s doorstep is not something to be thrilled about.” He added that the escalation of tensions with Russia will require military buildup in Finland and Sweden, with resources that could be used to fund civilian programs being poured into defense instead. Medvedev described this as “senseless and not cheap.”"
2022-06-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/557965-russia-comments-alleged-shopping-mall-strike/,Russia comments on alleged mall strike in Ukraine,"The Russian military has confirmed an airstrike on the Ukrainian city of Kremenchug on Monday, but claimed it targeted a stockpile of Western weapons. The detonation caused damage to a nearby non-functioning shopping mall, Tuesday’s report said. Kiev had claimed that Russia attacked the shopping center, killing and injuring many civilians. The Russian Defense Ministry said the location of the arms stockpile was near the Kredmash factory. The Amstor Mall, where a fire was reported by Ukrainian sources on Monday, is right next to it. The military claimed that the Western munitions detonated and caused a fire at the facility, which was no longer operating. Ukrainian officials claim that the mall was packed with people at the moment Russia allegedly attacked it. However, video showed that the car park outside was almost empty. According to the latest casualty report, 18 people were killed and 59 injured in the incident, with 25 of the wounded taken to the hospital for treatment. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the incident in Kremenchug as “one of the most blatant terrorist attacks in European history.” He stated that the site posed no threat to the Russian military and had no strategic value. Kremenchug is a city in central Ukraine around 250km southeast from Kiev. The Russian military had previously attacked a major oil refinery in the city, denying the Ukrainian military fuel for their vehicles."
2022-06-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/557948-moscow-threatens-kaliningrad-baltic/,Russia threatens ‘to cut off oxygen’ to EU member,"Moscow’s response to the Lithuanian ban on Kaliningrad transit could be tough enough to “cut off oxygen” to the Baltic countries, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has warned. Kaliningrad is a small Russian exclave nestled between Lithuania and Poland. Earlier this month, Vilnius’ national rail operator suspended the transit of sanctioned goods between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia, citing instructions from Brussels. In an interview with the Argumenty i Fakty newspaper, Medvedev claimed that the EU did not insist on imposing restrictions and thus Lithuania “obsequiously bowed to American benefactors, once again demonstrating its moronic Russophobic attitudes.” Emphasizing that the transit ban was a part of a “proxy war” unleashed by the West against Russia, Medvedev promised that retaliatory measures from Moscow would be “very tough.” According to him, many of the possible retaliatory steps would be of an economic nature and “capable of cutting off the oxygen to the Baltic neighbors who have taken hostile actions.” Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of the Russian National Security Council, stressed that Russia could also apply ‘asymmetric’ measures. “Such an escalation is a bad choice. And those who suffer from it are the ordinary citizens of Lithuania, whose standard of living, by European standards, is just beggarly,” Medvedev claimed. His remarks came two days after Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said that his country would maintain the ban and that “there cannot be any ‘corridors’, nor can there be any appeasement of Russia in response to the Kremlin’s threats.” The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, earlier explained that the bloc was not seeking to impose a “blockade” on Russia’s Kaliningrad Region and would review its sanctions guidelines to avoid “blocking” traffic into and out of the exclave. He also explained that Lithuania’s actions were aimed foremost at preventing the circumvention of anti-Russia sanctions imposed over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine."
2022-06-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/557945-killnet-ddos-lithuanian-websites-kaliningrad/,‘Pro-Russian’ hackers take revenge for Kaliningrad blockade,"Self-styled ‘pro-Russian’ hacking group Killnet took down numerous Lithuanian government and corporate websites with a major DDoS attack on Monday, two days after warning Vilnius that failure to unblock the railway and road corridor to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad would result in such an attack. The hackers bragged that they had attacked over 1,000 Lithuanian websites. Those reportedly offline on Monday or experiencing difficulties included the country’s State Tax Inspectorate, Integrated System of Administrative Services, Central State Archive, the city websites of Vilnius and Kaunas, the Lithuanian website of Swedish telecom Telia, and major accounting service provider B1. Lithuania’s cybersecurity agency claimed to have noted an increase in DDoS attacks starting on Friday targeting government agencies, transportation services, and the financial sector. The hackers had posted multiple videos to social media over the weekend warning the Vilnius government it had 48 hours to remove the blockade against Kaliningrad or risk a “pinpoint strike at the heart of the Lithuanian system” affecting “more than 500 companies.” A Monday evening post to the Telegram group ‘We Are Killnet’ vowed to continue the attack on Tuesday. The same Telegram group earlier shared a list of Lithuanian target websites, though it was unclear if it was a ‘wishlist’ or if all the sites listed had been hacked at some point. Some were still accessible, while others were glitchy or unavailable altogether. The hacking group reportedly encourages volunteers to join its DDoS attacks, listing the domains and IP addresses of targets in order to maximize damage. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda doubled down on the blockade on Sunday, declaring “it is absolutely clear that Lithuania must and will implement EU sanctions” in a Facebook post ruling out the possibility of “corridors” or “appeasement of Russia.” Both Lithuania and the EU have insisted Vilnius is acting according to the demands of the bloc, rather than imposing any national-level decision. Moscow has repeatedly ordered the blockade to be lifted, calling it a violation of international law and warning that maintaining the ban on transit of sanctioned goods will “have a serious negative impact on the people of Lithuania.” While Kaliningrad is part of Russia, Lithuania and Poland sit between it and the rest of the country, meaning the only open route left is by sea. Killnet surfaced in March, introducing itself as a “friend” to Russia and attacking the websites of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the neo-Nazi militia group Right Sector, and the hacking collective Anonymous, which at the time had just declared “cyber-war” on Moscow."
2022-06-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/557929-kremenchug-ukraine-mall-rockets/,Zelensky claims Russian missiles hit Ukrainian shopping mall,"A shopping center in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchug caught fire after what the government said was a Russian missile strike on Monday. President Volodymyr Zelensky said “over a thousand civilians” were inside the mall. The regional governor later reported ten were killed and around 40 injured. Russia has denied targeting civilians during its offensive in Ukraine. “The occupiers fired rockets at the mall, where there were more than a thousand civilians,” Zelensky announced on Monday afternoon. “The mall is on fire, rescuers are fighting the fire, the number of victims is impossible to imagine.” He said the shopping center posed “no danger” and had “no strategic value” to the Russian military. Preliminary reports from Ukrainian emergency services said two people were killed and at least 20 injured at the Amstor shopping center, after a blaze broke out “as a result of rocket fire” in the afternoon. Twenty vehicles and over 115 firefighters have been deployed to contain the blaze. Poltava regional governor Dmitry Lunin later said that there were ten dead and more than 40 wounded. Longer video. pic.twitter.com/hsiBBS6Z9D Videos from the scene showed dozens of men – many in military uniforms – running in the mostly empty parking lot outside the burning building, as black smoke rose into the sky. There was no explanation as to why there were so few cars, if 1,000 people were really inside the facility. The Russian military has not commented on the incident so far. Multiple social media users have pointed out, however, that a factory for production and repair of heavy machinery – Kredmash – was located right on the other side of the shopping center. Also nearby was a railway junction, often a target of Russian missile strikes. Previous local reporting also indicated that Kredmash had been involved in repairing and refurbishing military armored vehicles. Moscow has maintained that the Russian military takes great pains to avoid civilian casualties and targets only the military and logistics assets of the Kiev government with high-precision weapons. On Sunday, the Ukrainian government claimed that a Russian missile had struck a residential building in Kiev, killing one person and injuring four. The military in Kiev also said it had shot down two out of the six incoming Russian missiles. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, however, four precision missiles were aimed at the Artyom rocket plant in Kiev, which produced ammunition for Ukrainian artillery. No civilian infrastructure was damaged in the process. Two Ukrainian S-300 air defense missiles sent to intercept the Russian rockets were shot down by friendly fire from Ukrainian Buk 1M systems. The debris of one of them struck the residential building and caused the civilian casualties, claimed Russian Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov."
2022-06-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/557938-putin-g20-summit-indonesia/,Putin to attend G20 summit – Kremlin,"Russian President Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Indonesia this November, the Kremlin announced on Monday. While multiple Western leaders have demanded Russia’s expulsion from the event, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is hosting this year's gathering, has invited Putin to the meeting in Bali. Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov announced Putin’s attendance, but told reporters that it is still unclear in what capacity the Russian leader will participate. “I hope that the pandemic will allow this important forum to be held in person, but I cannot guess,” Ushakov said. The G20 summit brings together leaders of the world’s 20 largest economies, with representatives of the European Union also attending alongside European heads of state, and several international organizations, including the United Nations and World Health Organization, given guest invites every year. US President Joe Biden called on Widodo, in March, to exclude Putin from this year’s meeting, while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared that “it can't be business as usual to have Vladimir Putin sitting around the table pretending that everything is OK. Because it's not OK and it's his fault.” However, Widodo did not cave in to the pressure campaign and invited Putin as planned. The Indonesian leader has also called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to travel to Bali in November. Widodo attended the G7 summit in Germany as a guest this weekend, and after leaving on Sunday he will travel this week to Kiev and Moscow to meet with Zelensky and Putin. In a Twitter post on Sunday, Widodo said that he aims to “invite the two leaders to open dialogue and stop the war.” His efforts, however, could be in vain. Since the start of the conflict in February, Zelensky has swung between calling for talks and vowing to seize the Donbass republics and Crimea by force. With the G7 leaders allegedly promising to keep Ukraine armed and afloat “for as long as it takes,” Zelensky reportedly told a French diplomat over the weekend that he “will negotiate when he will be in a position to do so.” While Russia has not ruled out a return to the negotiating table, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has stated that Zelensky’s “statements that contradict each other” make it “impossible to fully understand [Kiev’s] intentions and whether it is ready to take a sober approach and acknowledge the real state of affairs.”"
2022-06-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/557935-kiev-nightclubs-raided-conscripts/,Ukrainian cops scour nightclubs for draft dodgers,"Police in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev have raided hundreds of nightclubs, handing out fines for curfew violations and drug possession, and summoning 219 men for mandatory military service. Around 420 establishments were targeted in raids over the weekend, Kiev Police Chief Ivan Vihivsky announced on Monday. Two clubs were found to be operating at night, defying the city’s curfew, and 413 people were found as violators of the same regulation. Criminal charges were pressed against people in possession of drugs, and 173 partygoers were charged with “petty hooliganism.” Additionally, Vyhivsky announced that his officers had searched men “of conscription age” for their military papers, and summoned 219 men to the enlistment office. Ukraine currently requires all men aged between 18 and 60 to register for military service, and has forbidden men in this age range from leaving the country. While only those with prior military experience were initially sent to the front lines, mounting losses mean that even men who volunteered for the country’s Territorial Defense Units – stationed in their home towns and cities as a last line of defense – are now being sent to fight Russian forces. Moscow's troops are steadily gaining ground in eastern Ukraine, backed by superior air and artillery power. Meanwhile, Kiev recently admitted to losing as many as 1,000 troops per day, and is reportedly replenishing its beleaguered forces with conscripts, women, and convicts. In addition to searching nightclubs for potential draftees, military officials are serving draft notices to men “at malls, recreation areas, gas stations – it doesn’t matter where,” a source within the Ukrainian military has told RT. Unenthused at the prospect of being sent to confront the might of the Russian military, some men of recruitment age are hiding out in the countryside, while those in the cities have set up Telegram channels to track the movements of recruiters and avoid being served their call-up papers. Back in Kiev, Vihivsky’s says his main role is to ensure that the public complies with martial law. “Police together with military commissars patrol the city streets, squares and parks at night, as well as focus on inspections of night entertainment venues,” he stated. “We will continue to conduct such tests, because every resident of the capital must understand the seriousness of the situation and be aware of the danger that still exists.”"
2022-06-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/557922-zelensky-no-talks-russia/,Zelensky refuses to negotiate peace – French media,"Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his country is not prepared to hold peace talks with Russia, a source in the French government has told the state news agency AFP. He reportedly made the position clear when speaking to leaders of the G7 on Monday. “President Zelensky gave a very clear response that now is not the time for negotiations. Ukraine will negotiate when it is in a position to do so, that is, when it has basically re-established a position of strength,” a French official cited by AFP said. “In the meantime, he needs to end the war as quickly as possible,” the official added. The Ukrainian president has repeatedly rejected calls to negotiate with Russia, claiming that the time for diplomacy will only come after Russian troops are pushed out of Ukraine entirely. He has stuck to that uncompromising position even as Ukrainian troops have suffered several defeats on the battlefield in Donbass.Kiev has lost roughly a quarter of its territory in the east and south since late February when Russia launched its offensive. In March, an attempt to negotiate a peaceful solution was made with Turkey’s mediation. Moscow says Kiev offered several concessions on Ukraine’s future neutral status and that the Kremlin penned a formal document based on those suggestions, but Kiev has ignored it. Moscow said Ukraine was emboldened by the supplies of heavier Western arms and encouragement from politicians like UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who told officials to fight on. This won’t change the course of the Russian campaign in Ukraine, Moscow stated, so the delays only prolong the conflict and cause unnecessary casualties and damage for the parties involved. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

2022-06-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/557932-russia-claims-eliminate-mercenaries/,Mercenaries involved in murdering POWs eliminated – Russia,"Russian forces have eliminated a group of Georgian mercenaries, fighting on the Ukrainian side, who were allegedly involved in the abuse and murder of prisoners, the spokesman for the Defense Ministry in Moscow, Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, said on Monday. According to Konashenkov, on June 26, three kilometers from the Lisichansk oil refinery in the Lugansk People’s Republic, Russian units “destroyed two sabotage and reconnaissance groups of mercenaries with a total number of 14 militants.” The first group, according to the spokesman, “consisted of citizens of various European countries,” while the second listed only mercenaries from the so-called Georgian Legion. According to Konashenkov, “Georgian militants were involved in the brutal torture and murder of Russian servicemen near Kiev in March this year.” Since the launch of the Russian military offensive in Ukraine at the end of February, Moscow and Kiev have been accusing each other of abuse and torture, as well as of atrocities against civilians. In May, the Russian Investigative Committee said it was looking into a video published on social media, showing a Georgian mercenary beating a captured Russian soldier. Tatyana Moskalkova, Russia’s top human rights official, voiced concerns this month over the treatment of Russian prisoners in Ukraine. The International Red Cross had not provided any information about visits to check on the conditions the Russian POWs have been kept in, she claimed.

2022-06-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/557919-ukaine-attack-sabotage-operations-military-intelligence/,Russia to face ‘attacks & sabotage operations’ – Kiev,"Russia should brace for “attacks and sabotage operations” within its territory, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Kirill Budanov, told the Financial Times over the weekend. He mentioned the murder of a local official in Kherson Region as an example. It has been treated as an act of terrorism by the city’s authorities. “Partisan activities” have been emerging within the territories Russia seized since the start of its military operation in Ukraine in late February, Budanov said, pointing to two explosions in the Kherson Region, which borders Crimea. The area has seen two attacks apparently targeting local officials. On June 22, a roadside bomb went off in the town of Chernobayevka as a local administration head was driving by. The official survived, sustaining only light shrapnel wounds. Two days later, the head of the Kherson Region Department of Family, Youth and Sports was killed in a similar attack. An improvised explosive device was planted in his car. On June 24, the local authorities said they were treating the incident as a terrorist attack. According to Budanov, these types of attacks will not be limited to territory that was once under Ukrainian control. Attacks and sabotage operations “are held everywhere, and they were and will be held in Russia and many other places,” he told the Financial Times. He did not say if Kiev is behind any of the incidents. The military intelligence chief also said he has “little hope” that Russian forces will retreat and leave the positions they currently hold. “They will fight as much as they can,” he said, adding that Russia has “no other option” but to “fight to the end.” Budanov slammed the Western military aid to Ukraine as insufficient, saying Kiev needs “more than … yesterday or the day before yesterday.” Ukraine recently received the first batch of US-made HIMARS multiple-rocket launch systems, as well as a dozen German PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzers and 12 French Caesar artillery systems. According to the Financial Times, Ukraine is still heavily outgunned by Russia. Russian troops have 10 artillery systems for each one on the Ukrainian side, the outlet said, citing “western assessments,” while adding that shelling duels kill around 100 Ukrainian troops per day. Budanov also said Russian forces leveled Ukraine’s defensive positions in the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR) city of Severodonetsk, and forced the Ukrainian troops to retreat to avoid becoming entrapped. “This was absolutely the right decision … a tactical regrouping,” he insisted. The Russian Defense Ministry reported the “freeing” of Severodonetsk – one of the two major cities in the LPR that had remained under Ukrainian control – on June 25. Now, Lisichansk – Severodonetsk’s sister city just across the river – remains the only major city still held by Ukrainian troops in the LPR.

As far as actions to defend [our] interests are concerned, [we are] making them on a regular basis,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday. Peskov’s statement came after several news agencies reported that the US was purchasing a medium-to-long range surface-to-air missile system for Ukraine. The Associated Press said the system in question is the Norwegian-developed NASAMS – one of the weapons Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has requested in the past. The US and other NATO countries have been increasingly supplying Kiev with heavy weapons to help it fight Russian troops. The recent deliveries include US-made M142 HIMARS multiple rocket launchers and M777 howitzers. Peskov said this month that “flooding” Ukraine with foreign weapons will not change the course of the conflict and will only lead to more suffering and destruction in Ukraine.

2022-06-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/557906-moscow-strike-kiev-rocket-plant/,Russia strikes Kiev rocket plant,"Russia’s Ministry of Defense reported on Monday that it successfully carried out a missile strike on a rocket manufacturing plant in Kiev, which was being used to produce ammunition for multiple launch rocket systems. The strike was carried out on Sunday with four high precision missiles, all of which reached the Artyom rocket-manufacturing plant, located in the Shevchenkovskiy district of Kiev, without damaging civilian infrastructure in the city, the ministry reports. The authorities in Kiev reportedly tried to intercept the Russian high precision missiles using anti-aircraft weapons stationed around the city, including S-300 and Buk M1 anti-aircraft missile systems, which reportedly launched 10 rockets during the strike. The ministry also noted that due to the apparent lack of communication between the anti-aircraft defense systems located in the city, two S-300 rockets were shot down by Ukrainian Buks, one of which fell on a residential building. Western media outlets, including NPR and AP, reported on Sunday that it was Russian missiles that fell on “at least two” apartment buildings in the Ukrainian capital, according to Kiev Mayor Vitaly Klitschko, who called the attack symbolic, ahead of this week’s NATO summit in Madrid. Klitschko wrote on his Telegram channel on Sunday that one person died and four people were hospitalized as a result of the incident, while 24 other residents were evacuated from the building. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force claimed that Russian aircraft had launched up to six missiles at Kiev on Sunday and that two of them were intercepted mid-air.

2022-06-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/557901-ukraine-russia-nuclear-cooperation/,Ukraine pulls plug on nuclear cooperation with Russia,"Ukraine’s nuclear regulator announced that it has been ordered to stop working with Russia due to the hostilities between the two nations. A short statement published on Monday by the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine said that, last week, acting Chief Inspector Oleg Korikov ordered that two agreements with Moscow on nuclear regulation be nullified. Signed in 1996 and 2002, they set the legal framework for the agency’s cooperation and information sharing with its Russian counterpart, Rostekhnadzor. The Ukrainian agency cited “Russian aggression” against the country as the reason for pulling the plug on the agreements. It said it notified the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry about the decision. Ukraine’s civilian nuclear industry was built when the country was part of the USSR, and for decades it relied on Russian expertise to keep it running. The Russian producer of nuclear fuel rods, TVEL, has long been the primary supplier of fuel for the nation’s power plants. The 2014 crisis dealt a serious blow to the cooperation between the two countries, with Kiev declaring that it would use Western fuel instead. However, attempts by America’s Westinghouse Electric Company to create replacement products for Soviet-built plants in Eastern Europe only met with limited success. Ukraine also needs the domestic infrastructure to store nuclear waste, a problem which Russia typically deals with for its clients. As late as 2018, officials in Kiev said they wanted TVEL to open a subsidiary manufacturer in Ukraine, despite the souring relations between the two nations at the time.

The Emirati proposals are being considered as the lists of personnel slated for the swaps are finalized, the report said. Both Russia and Ukraine claim to have captured scores of each others soldiers since Moscow launched its military campaign in the neighboring country in late February. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said on June 7 that nearly 6,500 Ukrainian fighters have been detained. Ukrainian officials previously reported that 11 rounds of exchanges had taken place, in which dozens of prisoners were swapped. Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of atrocities and the mistreatment of civilians and POWs. Tatyana Moskalkova, Russia’s top human rights official, voiced concerns this month over the treatment of Russian prisoners in Ukraine. She also accused Kiev of holding Russian civilians hostage. She added that the International Red Cross had not provided any information about visits to check on the conditions the Russian POWs have been kept in. Russia attacked the neighboring state following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-06-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/557875-turkey-russia-spokesman-balance/,Turkey explains why it hasn't placed sanctions on Russia,"Turkey does not follow the Western lead in sanctioning Russia because it is guided by pragmatic economic considerations and “a policy of balance,” the Turkish president’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin has said. In an interview with Haberturk TV, Kalin said that Ankara is pursuing “a policy of balance” when it comes to its relations with Russia. “As we are dependent on foreign sources for energy, we develop relations with Russia as we do with Iran,” he explained, noting that Turkey also enjoys good relations with the US and other Western countries. “We do not impose sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine war. Of course, we have to protect the interests of our country,” he said. In Kalin’s opinion, imposing sanctions on Moscow “will harm Turkey's economy more than Russia’s.” “We took a clear stand. At present, the Westerners have also accepted it. They do not say anything about Turkey's position for geopolitical reasons,” Kalin claimed. He also emphasized that his country does not support the policy of imposing personal sanctions against Russian businessmen. “Those who are called billionaires in the West are called oligarchs when it comes to Russia. Are there no such leaders in the US or Europe?” Kalin asked. Kalin made it clear that his country views Russia's military operation as an “invasion” and states it “clearly and unequivocally.” However, he stressed that Turkey continues to talk to both Ukraine and Russia as “the longer the war, the higher the cost.” “Frankly, there is no other country that makes an effort to bring the two sides together. It will set an example that cooperation can be made on certain issues even in a war environment,” Kalin claimed. He emphasized the role Ankara was playing in negotiating solutions to certain globally important issues, such as grain supplies from the conflict-torn region. “Who will eventually talk to Russia if everyone burns the bridges?” he asked. Kalin admitted that he cannot predict at which point Russian military forces will leave Ukraine but stressed that “war has short-term, medium and long-term effects.” “My prediction is that we will be busy with the war and its effects for the next 10 years. The war may end, but its effects will continue in a different way,” Kalin said. In his opinion, the world is facing a new kind of cold war, with strong anti-Russian sentiment in the West and “anti-Westernism” spreading in Russia. “There will be massive tectonic repositions,” Kalin claimed. Commenting on the reasons behind the Russian offensive in Ukraine, the spokesman refuted Western claims about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ‘irrationality,’ saying that sometimes the West prefers to “irrationalize the issue instead of confronting it.” In his opinion, the problems in relations between Russia and the West started in the 1990s when Russia, in response to a changing global geopolitical order, offered the West the chance to make “a new balance agreement” that would reflect those changes. “Those who wanted to suppress the countries wishing to get out from below said: let’s go the way of conflict,” he explained. Stressing that “this never justifies the Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Kalin pointed to the importance of not ignoring the cause-and-effect relationship. “We also object to this irregular order and this unfair [global] order,” he added. Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, following the neighboring state’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-06-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/557871-g7-support-ukraine-indefinite/,G7 leaders agree to support Ukraine indefinitely – Bloomberg,"The Group of Seven (G7) will pledge to provide support to Ukraine in all possible forms “for as long as it takes,” according to a draft communique of its ongoing summit, seen by Bloomberg. The three-day meeting of the G7 leaders began on Sunday in Bavaria, Germany, with the Ukrainian conflict dominating the agenda. “We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,” reads the draft of the leaders’ statement. Russia has warned the US, EU and their allies against providing Ukraine with weapons, saying that it will only prolong the conflict. However, Western leaders have ignored the statements. On Sunday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to continue supporting Kiev militarily to “strengthen their hand in both the war and any future negotiations.” The G7 leaders appear to have agreed to maintain economic pressure on Russia as it continues its offensive in Ukraine. The British government earlier announced that during the summit the US, UK, Canada, and Japan would ban the import of Russian gold. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken later claimed that the embargo would deprive Moscow of around $19 billion in annual revenue. According to Reuters, the G7 is also holding “very constructive” talks about a potential cap on the price of Russian oil imports. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz admitted on Sunday that the Western world is now facing many challenges: falling growth rates, rising inflation, shortages of raw materials and disruption of supply chains. However, he expressed confidence that the G7 “will succeed in sending a very clear signal of unity and decisive action from this summit.” His remarks were echoed by US President Joe Biden, who claimed that while Russian President Vladimir Putin had been hoping “that somehow NATO and the G7 would splinter,” they haven’t done so and are not going to. Putin, meanwhile, spoke about the G7 on Friday, claiming that the current economic turmoil around the globe has little to do with the conflict in Ukraine and is the result of “many years of irresponsible macroeconomic policies” adhered to by its members."
2022-06-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/557866-drilling-rig-shelled-ukraine/,Ukraine again shells Russian offshore rig,"A Russian offshore drilling rig in the Black Sea has been shelled, in the second similar attack in less than a week, a spokesperson for Crimea’s emergency services told TASS on Sunday, blaming the strike on the Ukrainian military. Earlier, the Baza Telegram channel, citing its own sources, reported that a projectile which had hit the Chernomorneftegaz-owned Tavrida floating drilling rig overnight, left a hole in the platform’s helipad. “This is shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, there are no casualties,” the region’s emergency services spokesman said without providing further details. On June 20, the head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, revealed that Ukraine had shelled the Chernomorneftegaz drilling platforms 71km from Odessa. Three platforms were damaged, including the Tavrida. One of the platforms (BK-1) was completely destroyed. Seven people are missing, and three sustained injuries. In total, there were 109 people on the platform, with the majority of them subsequently evacuated. The Russian Investigative Committee opened a criminal case in relation to the June 20 shelling. Earlier this month, the Ukrainian presidential representative for Crimea, Tamila Tasheva, said Kiev is now relying on military means to ‘return’ Crimea to Ukraine, and that Russia’s military campaign prompted Kiev to largely abandon diplomacy regarding the peninsula’s ‘de-occupation’. Ukrainian troops have been losing territory to Russia and allied forces in Donbass, even as Western nations supply more sophisticated weapons to Kiev. Several Ukrainian officials have stated that the pledge to not use foreign weapons to attack targets in Russia does not apply to Crimea, which Kiev considers part of its territory. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

2022-06-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/557863-shoigu-troops-inspection-awards/,Russian defense minister inspects troops in Ukraine,"Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu conducted an inspection of troops involved in the military operation in Ukraine and presented state awards to the most distinguished servicemen, the ministry said on Sunday. Commanders reported to the minister on the situation on the ground, with Shoigu paying special attention to the “organization of comprehensive support for the military action, as well as to creation of all necessary living conditions for Russian military personnel at temporary deployment points.” “Also, the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation, General of the Army Sergei Shoigu, presented state awards: the Gold Star medal of the Hero of the Russian Federation and the Order of Courage to Russian servicemen who showed heroism and dedication in performing combat missions during the special military operation,” a statement outlined. It did not specify where or when the events took place. Earlier this week, the Defence Ministry's spokesman, Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, named the commanders of the troops fighting in Ukraine. Colonel General Alexander Lapin is responsible for formations and military units of the Center grouping of troops. Meanwhile, General Sergey Surovikin, who in 2017 was awarded the title of Hero of Russia for his role in the military operation in Syria, leads the Southern grouping. The inspection by the minister came in the wake of a major success for the Russian and allied forces. On Saturday, the Konashenkov announced that the important city of Severodonetsk, together with a number of other locations nearby, had been “completely liberated.” The news meant “the entire left-bank territory of the Seversky Donets river within the borders of the Lugansk People’s Republic had come under its full control,” Konashenkov explained. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

A Russian missile hit an apartment complex in western Kiev, Mayor Vitaly Klitschko wrote on his Telegram channel on Sunday. He said one person died and four people were hospitalized, including a seven-year-old girl. The official added that 24 residents were evacuated. Emergency services said a nine-story building was shelled by “the enemy,” and that “a Russian bomb” left a large crater on the grounds of a kindergarten. Officials said that there were no children in the facility at the time. Yury Ignat, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force, said that Russian aircraft launched up to six missiles at Kiev on Sunday, two of which were intercepted mid-air. The Russian Defense Ministry did not report any airstrikes on Kiev in its daily press briefing. Moscow previously said that it only hits military targets, such as artillery installations and weapons depots. In late April, Russian missiles struck the Artyom missile development and production plant, located in the same Shevchenko district of Kiev. Donbass officials have accused Kiev of shelling Donetsk and other cities since the start of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, which was launched in late February. The Donetsk People’s Republic said this week that 188 civilians have been killed in on its territory over the last four months. Ukraine also claims that it only strikes military targets. Russia attacked the neighboring state following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

2022-06-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/557843-iskander-belarus-putin-lukashenko/,Russia to supply neighbor with Iskander-M missile systems,"Moscow will provide Minsk with Iskander-M mobile short-range missile systems, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced during a meeting with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko on Saturday. “The decision has been made. Within the next few months, we’ll transfer to Belarus the Iskander-M tactical missile systems, which can use both ballistic and cruise missiles, in both their conventional and nuclear versions,” Putin announced as the two leaders met in St. Petersburg. The Russian president suggested that the defense ministers and chiefs of the general staff of the neighboring countries should now get together and start “working out all the details of this joint work.” During the meeting, Lukashenko also asked Russia for assistance in upgrading Belarusian jets so that they could carry missiles with nuclear warheads. He said he was increasingly concerned by training flights of US and NATO nuclear-capable warplanes near Belarusian airspace. Putin agreed to help, saying that “this modernization should be carried out at aircraft factories in Russia. We’ll agree on how to make it happen.” In May, Lukashenko announced that Belarus had purchased the “required” number of Iskander-M mobile missile systems and S-400 air defense systems from Russia. He also said that Moscow would assist Minsk in producing missiles, including those used by the Iskanders. Iskander-M systems (the NATO reporting name is SS-26 Stone) were put into service with the Russian military in 2006. They can fire missiles with both conventional and nuclear warheads a distance of up to 500km."
2022-06-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/557833-lithuania-kaliningrad-transit-stance/,Lithuania clarifies stance on transit to Russian exclave,"Lithuania will maintain the ban on the transit of sanctioned goods between the Kaliningrad Region and other parts of Russia, its President Gitanas Nauseda has warned. “It is absolutely clear that Lithuania must and will implement EU sanctions,” Nauseda wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday. “Lithuania must and will maintain control over the goods passing through its territory, and there cannot be any ‘corridors’, nor can there be any appeasement of Russia in response to the Kremlin’s threats. I have made clear to the president of the European Commission how Lithuania sees the situation.” Kaliningrad is a small Russian exclave nestled between Lithuania and Poland. A week ago, Lithuania’s national rail operator suspended the transit of sanctioned goods between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia, citing instructions from Brussels. Given the EU closed its airspace to Russian planes in February, the only remaining option for the authorities in Kaliningrad is to ferry cargo using Russia's Baltic ports. The EU imposed sweeping sanctions on Moscow in response to the military campaign in Ukraine, which was launched in late February. Nauseda reiterated on Saturday that Vilnius was acting in accordance with the EU’s fourth package of restrictions, which was adopted “with Lithuania’s active participation.” The EU earlier backed Lithuania in its move to partially ban the transit of Russian goods. Russia has argued that the disruption of transit is illegal under international law and threatened to retaliate. The Times reported on Thursday that Italy and several other European governments have asked the European Commission to defuse the crisis. Petras Austrevicius, a European Parliament member from Lithuania, said on Friday that an unnamed EU member state proposed that the Commission allow Russia-to-Russia transit of sanctioned goods. Austrevicius urged Brussels not to “succumb to pressure from the aggressor and create extraterritorial exemptions and concessions.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov expressed hope that the decision to partially ban the transit could be reversed. “Let’s hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. Which is what we do all the time,” he told reporters on Friday."
2022-06-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/557827-kiev-calls-deepfake-mayors/,EU city leaders targeted by ‘fake’ Kiev mayor,"Mayors of three European capitals – Berlin, Madrid and Vienna – have found themselves engaged in video calls with an imposter claiming to be their Kiev counterpart, Vitaly Klitschko. Berlin’s mayor, Franziska Giffey, wrapped up the conversation after “its course and the setting” made her suspect that the person she was speaking to was not Klitschko – something that was later confirmed by the Ukrainian Ambassador Andrey Melnyk, the mayor’s office revealed on Friday. Police are investigating the incident which is apparently a deepfake video, according to the office. Deepfakes use artificial intelligence to create animations of politicians, among other things. “Unfortunately, it is part of the reality that the war is being waged with all means – including online, with use of digital methods to undermine trust and to discredit Ukraine’s partners and allies,” Mayor Giffey said in a statement. The conversation of José Luis Martínez-Almeida with a ‘fake’ Klitschko went along a similar scenario: Madrid’s mayor interrupted the suspicious call, according to his spokesperson Daniel Bardavio Colebrook. The mayor of Vienna, Michael Ludwig, was apparently the only one to complete the conversation. On Wednesday, he announced on Twitter that he had talked to Klitschko. The post was removed on Saturday. Instead, the Austrian capital’s account published a statement saying that Ludwig had become a victim of a “serious case of cybercrime” and stressing that he was not the only victim. “There was no evidence that the conversation was not conducted with a real person…” the mayor’s office claimed, adding that the aim of cybercriminals is “to shake trust in politics and to discredit Ukraine and its supporters.” The matter is being investigated, the city authorities said. Vitaly Klitschko, who used to be a professional boxer prior to becoming a politician, has responded to the news of his fake ‘twin,’ saying that “the enemy is not calming down and is waging war on all fronts” to discredit Ukrainian politicians. He called on law enforcement agencies to investigate the incidents. “By the way, the hybrid war, the misinformation from Russia – is one of the topics of the panel discussion in which my brother and I are to take part in [at] the NATO summit in Madrid next week,” said Klitschko, whose brother Vladimir is also a former world boxing champion."
2022-06-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/557825-putin-disagrees-with-lukashenko/,Putin disagrees with ally on NATO nuclear threat,"Russian President Vladimir Putin told his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko, on Saturday, that he doesn’t support the latter’s suggestion of offering “a mirror response” to NATO aircraft training flights. During their meeting, in St. Petersburg, Lukashenko shared his concern over US and NATO aircraft “that are training to carry nuclear warheads and nuclear charges.” He asked his Russian colleague “to consider mirroring the answer to these things,” or at least to help Minsk to upgrade its planes. Putin responded to the proposal by saying that while “there is no need” for reciprocity, Russia and Belarus have to take measures to ensure their own security, “as well as, probably, that of other members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization.” In this context Putin suggested the modernization of “a fairly large group” of Belarus’ SU-25 aircraft in Russia and to start training of flight personnel. He also pledged that “within the next few months” Russia will send its ally Iskander-M tactical missile systems, which can use both ballistic and cruise missiles “in both usual and nuclear versions.” Both proposals were welcomed by Lukashenko. During the meeting Putin also updated his counterpart on NATO’s capabilities. He claimed that “Americans have 200 nuclear tactical munitions in six European member countries of the North Atlantic bloc,” with 257 aircraft, “not only American ones,” prepared for their possible use. The meeting came on the day when Ukrainian intelligence accused Moscow of attempts to “drag” Belarus into its military action against Kiev. The Chief Directorate of Intelligence of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry claimed that early on Saturday morning, Chernigov, Kiev and Sumy regions suffered “a massive missile shelling” by rockets fired from the city of Petrikov, Belarus, approximately 50-to-60km from the Ukrainian border. It also added that on Friday, “Russian sabotage groups” arrived in the city of Mozyr in Belarus with the intention of blowing up local residential buildings, schools and hospitals in order to blame Ukraine for it. Putin and Lukashenko did not comment on these allegations."
2022-06-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/557824-ukraine-doesnt-want-to-join-nato/,Ukraine won’t pursue NATO membership – Zelensky adviser,"Ukraine has accepted that NATO membership is off the table, and will not take any further steps toward joining the US-led military bloc, Igor Zhovkva, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, told the Financial Times on Saturday. Nevertheless, Kiev wants a say in NATO’s policy making. The bloc’s leaders are set to meet in the Spanish capital of Madrid next week. During two days of meetings and consultations, the organization will unveil its Strategic Concept – a document that outlines its mission and stance toward perceived threats, including China and Russia. Zhovkva told the Financial Times that Zelensky’s government wants NATO to acknowledge that Ukraine is “a cornerstone of European security,” and to reaffirm its partnership with Kiev, first established in 1997. However, he said that Ukraine will not push to become a member of the bloc. “Nato members have declined our aspirations. We will not do anything else in this regard,” he said. Ukraine’s prospective membership was a key factor behind the current conflict with Russia. The previous Petro Poroshenko-led government added the goal of becoming a NATO member to the country’s constitution in 2019, despite Moscow’s warnings that having the bloc’s forces and weapons on its border would constitute an unacceptable security threat. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has insisted that membership remains open for interested nations, but has not promised or ruled out accession for Ukraine in the near term. Under the 2008 Bucharest Declaration, NATO’s official position is that Georgia and Ukraine “will become members of NATO” at an unspecified future date. NATO’s Strategic Concept has not been updated since 2010. That version of the document states that the alliance seeks “a true strategic partnership” with Russia. Zhovkva wants NATO to purge any mention of Russia as a “partner” from the coming update. “We expect in the Nato strategic concept . . . there will be more strict and severe warnings to the Russian aggressor,” he said, urging the alliance “don’t be shy” in inserting anti-Russian text. Furthermore, Zhovkva said that he wants the Ukrainian conflict to be described in the strategy document, arguing “it’s not enough just to cross out the word ‘partner.’”"
2022-06-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/557823-strategic-donbass-severodonetsk-taken/,Strategic Donbass city 'freed' – Russia,"The major city of Severodonetsk has come under the full control of the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR), Russian military spokesman Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov announced in a statement on Saturday. He said the LPR cities of Severodonetsk and Borovskoye, along with the settlements of Voronovo and Sirotino, had been “completely liberated” following “successful offensive operations” by the republic’s forces, which were supported by Russian troops. Today’s announcement means “the entire left-bank territory of the Seversky Donets river within the borders of the Lugansk People’s Republic has come under its full control,” the spokesperson added. Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Severodonetsk “an epicenter of the confrontation in the Donbass.” “In many ways, the fate of our Donbass is being decided there,” he claimed. On Friday, Sergey Gaidai, whom Ukraine considers to be the head of Lugansk Region, announced that the country’s troops had been ordered to leave Severodonetsk. Earlier, he said that 90% of the city had been destroyed. With fighting in Ukraine passing the four-month mark on Friday, Russian forces continue to seize territory in Donbass. Earlier this month, a top Ukrainian commander, Volodymyr Karpenko, revealed that his country had lost up to 50% of its heavy-weapons stock, including 400 tanks, since the launch of the Russian attack in late February. Karpenko’s announcement came soon after Ukrainian presidential aide Alexey Arestovich revealed that the country’s armed forces had lost around 10,000 personnel. He claimed, however, that Moscow’s losses were several times bigger. He offered no evidence to support his assertion. The figures released by the Russian Ministry of Defense regarding the Ukrainian Army’s losses are significantly higher than those cited by Arestovich – 23,367, as of April 18. Moscow has not revealed its more recent losses in relation to equipment or personnel. Russia attacked its neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocol was designed to give the two regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/557819-russia-trying-drag-belarus/,Russia trying to drag Belarus into conflict – Ukraine,"Russia is “dragging” Belarus into its military offensive against Ukraine, Kiev's top intelligence agency claimed on Saturday, commenting on the alleged shelling of several of its regions, which purportedly came from the territory of its northern neighbor. In a statement on Facebook, the Chief Directorate of Intelligence of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry described what it called “a large-scale provocation by Russia for the purpose of further dragging Belarus into the war against Ukraine.” It claimed that after 5am on Saturday, the Chernigov, Kiev and Sumy regions suffered “a massive missile shelling” by rockets fired by six Russian bombers from the city of Petrikov, Belarus, approximately 50-to-60 kilometres from the Ukrainian border. “This is the first case of an air strike across Ukraine directly from the territory of Belarus. Today’s shelling is directly related to the efforts of the Kremlin authorities to drag Belarus into the war in Ukraine as a direct participant,” the intelligence agency said. It also added that on Friday “Russian sabotage groups” arrived at the city of Mozyr in Belarus with an intention to blow up local residential buildings, schools and hospitals. “Possible provocations can be presented as Ukraine's response to the air strikes,” the directorate warned. Earlier it said that such provocation would ensure that President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko “will not be able to avoid participating in the war.” Moscow and Belarus have not yet responded to Kiev’s allegations.Ukraine's northern military command said earlier in a statement that twenty rockets had targeted the village of Desna in the Chernigov region. Infrastructure was damaged but no casualties have been reported, according to the military. The Ukrainian statements came on the day when Russian President Vladimir Putin meets his Belarusian counterpart President Lukashenko in Saint Petersburg. Belarus is not officially involved in the current conflict in Ukraine but remains one of Russia’s key allies and provides Moscow with logistic support. President Lukashenko reiterated earlier this month that he had no desire to get involved in Ukraine and would not do so unless his hand was forced. Since the beginning of the Russian attack on Ukraine, each side has been accusing the other of preparing provocations and staging events. Earlier this month Russia’s Ministry of Defense claimed that Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) is plotting “another provocation with the use of hazardous chemicals” as part of Kiev’s smear campaign against Moscow. Moscow and Kiev have also repeatedly blamed each other for targeting civilian infrastructure and for committing various war crimes. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

2022-06-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/557743-neo-nazi-regiment-azov-ideology/,"Ukraine's neo-Nazi Azov Battalion has built a 'state within a state,' and it despises both Russia and the liberal West","Despite the surrender of the Azov regiment at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works during the fighting in Mariupol last month, the legend of this unit has turned out to be enduring. The Ukrainian command has already announced that new Azov special operations forces will be created in Kharkov and Kiev. At the same time, a partial rebranding has been carried out. A medieval heraldic symbol – a trident (the coat of arms of Ukraine) consisting of three swords – is now depicted on the chevron of the ‘new’ Azov in place of the stylized Wolfsangel (‘wolf's hook’) that has attracted so much criticism from not only Russia, but also the West and fellow Ukrainians. This condemnation is for good reason, as the symbol was used on the lapels of the SS’s Das Reich and Landstorm Nederland divisions, as well as the logo of the Dutch Nazi Party. The Azovites have rejected all such accusations, claiming their regimental symbol was not a Wolfsangel, but rather the first letters of the phrase ‘National Idea’, allegedly written in the old Ukrainian alphabet, which was a mix of Cyrillic and Latin letters. And this is not Azov’s first rebranding – at one time, the ‘wolf’s hook’ on their chevrons replaced the occult ‘black sun’ symbol, which was used in SS rituals and decorated the floor of the order’s castle in Wewelsburg. However, back then, the Azovites didn’t bother trying to explain how the ‘black sun’ had notional Ukrainian roots. The rejection of the Wolfsangel is clearly intended to make it possible to say, “Yes, there used to be ultra-right elements in Azov, but that is all in the past now. The regiment is moving forward with new symbols and new ideas.” However, this is not the case. On the contrary, the rebranding shows Azov has only strengthened its ideology, becoming more mature and discarding youthful outrage along with its Nazi symbolism, which alludes to an ideology that the regiment, as an organization, never really shared. To understand this, it is enough to look at Azov not only as a military movement, but also a political project. Azov was founded by radicals crossing over from Patriot of Ukraine. This organization was based in Kharkov, a city in the northeast of the country, which has always had a predominantly Russian-speaking population. Therefore, Azov’s brand of nationalism was different. Unlike Ukrainian nationalists, they did not focus on issues pertaining to Ukraine’s language, ethnicity, or religion. They perceived the nation as a statist project in the spirit of Italian fascism. Actually, Patriot of Ukraine’s main ideologist, the 20th-century Ukrainian publicist Dmitry Dontsov (whose ideas were also a major influence on the Nazi collaborators of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists), called his ideology of ‘integral nationalism’ the Ukrainian version of nationalism developed in the 1920s, while repeatedly referring to the works of Benito Mussolini and Giovanni Gentile, the main authors of fascism. At the same time, Dontsov equated the concepts of nation and race. The latter he divided into master and slave races. According to Dontsov, Ukrainians are a race of masters, while Russians are a race of slaves seeking to enslave Ukrainians. The clash between Ukrainians and Russians is of an absolute, existential nature and can only end with the destruction of one of the parties, Dontsov believed. Romanticism plays a key role in this struggle, which he defines as the will to sacrifice, the coherence of multiple individuals’ will to attain power, and directing all efforts towards one goal – the building of a Ukrainian nation. It is this romanticism that ensures that the individual belongs to the collective whole and directs the nation on the path of expansion. Dontsov's romanticism is based on the myth of the ‘final battle’ from German-Scandinavian paganism. In this scenario, the destruction of the world and its subsequent rebirth will come. The worship of the idea espoused in this myth must take the form of religious fanaticism. This is the only way an idea can penetrate into the inner sanctum of a person’s character and bring about what Dontsov calls a radical revolution in the human psyche. Aggression towards bearers of other views should be engendered in adherents to this idea, allowing them to reject universal morality and ideas about good and evil. The new morality should be anti-humanist, based only on the will to take power. Personal interests must submit to the common good, anything that makes the nation stronger should be considered ethical, and everything that prevents this should be declared immoral. Dontsov's concept is completely elitist. To him, the people are just an inert mass with no independent will. The masses are deprived of the ability to develop their own ideas; they can only passively absorb them. The main role is reserved for the active minority, that is, a group capable of formulating an idea for the unconscious masses that is easy to understand and motivates them to engage in the struggle. The active minority should always be at the head of the nation, according to Dontsov. What the Azovites took from the German Nazis was their strategy of attaining power. They tried to create a shadow ‘state within a state’ that was supposed to take control of all government institutions at a time of acute political crisis. A huge network of civil organizations has grown up around the Azov regiment over the eight years of its existence. These include book publishers, educational projects, scouting clubs, gyms, and other associations. It even has its own political party, the National Corps, with a paramilitary wing dubbed the National Militia. The regiment’s veterans play a key role here. With the help of these organizations, recruits have been enlisted for both the regiment itself and Azov’s civil movement. Azov veterans have also actively joined Ukraine’s Armed Forces and law enforcement agencies, including its police, Army, and Security Service, where they continued to spread Azov’s ideology of integral nationalism. A serious ritual component permeates all aspects of life within the Azov regiment itself and its civil movement. The three swords now depicted on the chevrons of the ‘new’ Azov are actually a reflection of a quite tangible symbol. A ceremonial complex with three wooden swords was built at Azov’s main base in the city of Urzuf near Mariupol, where almost all of the regiment’s rituals were carried out. The most significant of these is the commemoration of fallen comrades. During the ritual, the Azovites stand holding wooden shields and torches. The shields bear the regiment’s main symbols – the ‘black sun’ and Wolfsangel, as well as the names of fallen members. The master of the ceremony calls out each of their names, after which a soldier with the corresponding shield lights a memorial light and says “We remember!” to which the others answer, “We will take revenge!” This ritual is not an original invention. The Azovites borrowed it from the Italian fascists of the 1920s, who called it Presente! This and other rituals were developed by a special ideological unit within Azov, the ‘Standard-Bearer’ service. In fact, the choice of the three swords as a new symbol is telling. A new generation is coming into Azov’s top positions. These are no longer the rowdy football fans who once created the battalion and for whom sporting SS symbols and spouting Nazi ideology was a form of protest. Now, the show is being run by people who were brought up within the Azov system with Azov’s ideology of integral nationalism. Ties with the European ultra-right, the so-called ‘white nationalist’ movement, are no longer as important to them. The center of their worldview is Ukrainian statehood and the Ukrainian nation, doomed to fight against both Russia and the liberal values of the West. Of course, for the Azovites, the best part of the Ukrainian nation is themselves. The surrender of the main part of the regiment at Azovstal has only crystallized the Azov ideology. For the Azovites, the current Russian-Ukrainian conflict has become the very eschatological ‘final battle’ depicted in Wagner’s opera. It is to be waged against the Russians and the liberal West, which does not want to provide enough military assistance or enter into an open clash with Moscow. If necessary, it will even be waged against its own government, which promised to evacuate the defenders of Azovstal but did not keep its word. The last battle must be fought to the end, and the Azovites could not care less how many Ukrainian citizens will burn in its fire in the name of imposing their ‘National Idea.’"
2022-06-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/557810-polish-fighters-killed-airstrike/,Dozens of foreign fighters killed in Donbass strike – Russia,"Russian aircraft have struck a zinc factory in the Donbass, killing dozens of Polish fighters, the Russian Defense Ministry asserted on Saturday. “Up to 80 Polish mercenaries” were killed, and 20 armored vehicles and eight Grad multiple rocket launchers were destroyed in the town of Konstantinovka, Defense Ministry spokesman, Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, said during his daily briefing. He added that artillery pieces, personnel and drones had been targeted in other areas. Konashenkov said a Tochka-U ballistic missile had been intercepted mid-air near the town of Molodyozhnoye in southern Ukraine. Numerous fighters from EU member states and countries such as the US and Canada have been operating in Ukraine. Earlier this month, a court in the Donetsk People’s Republic handed death sentences to two British nationals and one Moroccan, who were serving with the Ukrainian forces. The men have not yet been executed. Russia attacked its neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-25,https://www.rt.com/news/557805-nato-stoltenberg-ukriane-negotiations/,NATO predicts how Ukraine conflict will end,"The conflict between Russia and Ukraine will probably end with a negotiated settlement, but that does not mean the West should stop sending arms to Kiev or reduce sanctions pressure on Moscow, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Saturday. “Most likely, this war will end at the negotiating table,” Stoltenberg told the Spanish newspaper El Pais, acknowledging that an outright military victory was not on the cards. “Our responsibility is to ensure that Ukraine is in the strongest possible position and to help it remain a sovereign and independent European nation,” he said. The best way to bolster Kiev's position ahead of talks with Moscow is “to provide strong military support, economic support, and push through tough sanctions against Russia,” the NATO chief added. However, he declined to say when negotiations between Russia and Ukraine could take place. “Peace can always be achieved if you surrender. But Ukraine is fighting for its freedom, for its right to exist, for the right to be a democratic nation without submitting to the power of Russia. And the Ukrainians are ready to pay a very high price, to sacrifice themselves for these values. It's not for us to tell them how far their sacrifices should go,” Stoltenberg said. When asked whether the West’s arming of Kiev is fuelling the conflict and increasing loss of life in Ukraine, the NATO chief replied that “we help them because they're asking for it.” “Throughout history we've seen nations willing to accept great sacrifices for freedom,” he added. Stoltenerg also noted that despite weaponry being provided to Ukraine by the US and the EU, “there is no total war between NATO and Russia.” Moscow has repeatedly warned against deliveries of foreign weapons to Kiev, arguing that they will only prolong the fighting and increase the risk of a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO. In April, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov described the conflict in Ukraine as a proxy war waged by the US-led military alliance against Moscow. Russian and Ukrainian delegations of various levels held several rounds of peace negotiations shortly after the outbreak of the fighting. But there have been no face-to-face meetings between the sides since late March, when they met in Istanbul. Moscow was initially optimistic about the outcome of the talks in Turkey, but later accused Kiev of backtracking on the agreements that had been reached there, declaring it had lost all trust in the Ukrainian negotiators. Russia attacked Ukraine following Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow's eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/557803-police-military-supplies-ukraine-troops/,Police take action over Ukrainian bulletproof vest fraud,"Ukrainian police have opened an investigation into a suspected fraud after troops and volunteers were sold substandard bulletproof vests, the office of the country's Prosecutor General disclosed on Saturday. A Kiev resident is said to have been running the sales scheme online. The man, whose identity has not been revealed, sold “low-quality bulletproof vests for the needs of the Armed Forces [and to] volunteer organizations” which provide assistance to the Ukrainian military, the statement said. The suspect had advertised his products, through social networks and messengers, as bulletproof vests that contain armor plates made of high-quality industrial steel. The man recruited several other Ukrainian citizens to his “criminal scheme” as “accomplices,” the release continued. The suspect himself has been taken into custody, according to law enforcement. It is unclear if any of his accomplices have been detained as well. The vests that he was actually selling contained low-quality metal plates that did not meet the army's standards, the Prosecutor General’s office explained. The supposedly bulletproof vests were not in fact as described and were easily penetrated by bullets and turned out to be ineffective even against shrapnel and shell fragments. Each vest was sold for a price amounting to between 10,000 and 16,000 hryvnas (about $340 up to $540), according to law enforcement. The Prosecutor General’s office has not revealed the amount."
2022-06-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/557799-ukraine-moldova-eu-peskov/,Kremlin reacts to Ukraine’s EU-candidate status,"It’s the business of Brussels to decide on whom to grant EU-candidate status, but it should be done in a way that wouldn’t create more problems for Russia, the Kremlin press-secretary Dmitry Peskov said on Friday. When asked to comment on the European Council’s decision to grant Ukraine and Moldova the status of EU candidates, Peskov pointed out that “those are, of course, internal European affairs.” However, he added that “it’s very important for us that those processes won’t create more problems for us and for our relations with those countries.” “There’s enough of those problems already,” the spokesman acknowledged, referring to Russia’s ongoing military operation in Ukraine and the course on severing ties with Moscow taken by Moldova since Maia Sandu became president last year. Giving EU-candidate status to former Soviet Republics also shouldn’t lead to further deterioration of ties between Moscow and Brussels, Peskov continued.He regretted that Moldova “for some reason associates its candidate status with taking an increasingly anti-Russian stance.” “They think that the more anti-Russian they became they more the Europeans will like them. We really don’t want that to be happening.” Peskov also stressed that securing candidate status was no guarantee of becoming an actual member of the EU. He recalled how back in the Soviet times he’d worked as a diplomat at the embassy in Turkey and the country “was ready to give up a lot in order to become an organic part of Europe.” “Well, we see that Turkey hasn’t yet gone anywhere further than this candidate status, but at the same time became a sovereign, independent country,” the spokesman argued. Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova had some harsher words to say about EU’s decision to make Ukraine and Moldova candidates to join the bloc. Zakharova claimed Brussels was continuing its strategy of “active geopolitical development” of the former Soviet space in order to “contain"" Russia. “All means are being used,” she added, “from financial and economic leverage to military support.” Earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia has “no objections” to Ukraine taking the path of joining the EU as, unlike NATO, it wasn’t a military bloc. However, he pointed out that the country would require a lot of financial aid to meet the standards set by Brussels and warned about the risk of Ukraine morphing into “a sort of semi-colony” from becoming a member of the bloc."
2022-06-25,https://www.rt.com/news/557783-african-union-zelensky-hostage/,African leaders shun Ukraine's Zelensky,"Just a handful of African heads of state tuned in to personally listen to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as he accused Russia of holding their continent “hostage,” amid ongoing Western attempts to pin the blame for the global food crisis solely on Moscow. Few details emerged from Zelensky's virtual meeting with the African Union, held behind closed doors on Monday, more than two months after the Ukrainian leader first tried to arrange a conference with the continent's leaders. Out of 55 nations only four were represented by heads of state, while the rest sent subordinates, according to the BBC. However, Le Journal de l'Afrique claimed only a handful of ambassadors and ministers were actually present. “They are trying to use you and the suffering of the people to put pressure on the democracies that have imposed sanctions on Russia,” Zelensky told the African Union representatives, adding that “Africa is actually a hostage... of those who unleashed war against our state.” Following the conference call, the President of Senegal and AU Chairperson, Macky Sall, indicated that Africa’s position of neutrality over the conflict remains unchanged. Roughly half of African states refused to support the UN General Assembly’s resolution to condemn Russia’s actions in Ukraine, and no country on the continent has so far joined the sanctions. Ukrainian president @ZelenskyyUa addressed the @_AfricanUnion Assembly today. We reiterated the AU position of the urgent need for dialogue to end the conflict to allow peace to return to the Region and to restore global stability. pic.twitter.com/1RaIIp2UbC “Africa remains committed to respect for the rules of international law, the peaceful resolution of conflicts and freedom of trade,” he said in a tweet, thanking Zelensky “for his friendly address to the virtual meeting of the AU Extended Bureau.” During his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi earlier this month, President Sall said Western sanctions against Russia threaten Africa with a food security crisis. Last week he noted that the exclusion of Russian banks from international payment systems makes it harder for African states to pay for grain, while EU states made exceptions for gas and oil that they need. This Friday, he joined a BRICS+ video conference, where Putin also criticized the West for its “cynical attitude” towards the food supply of the developing nations. The EU has repeatedly expressed concerns over the prospect of a food crisis if Ukrainian grain cannot reach its traditional markets. On Friday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock echoed Zelensky's “hostage” claims, accusing Moscow of “deliberately” using global hunger as “a weapon.” Simultaneously, foreign ministers of the G7 denied that anti-Russia sanctions have any impact on the global food crisis. Ukraine, a major grain producer, has been unable to export its grain by sea due to the ongoing conflict, with an estimated 22 to 25 million tons of grain currently stuck at the country’s ports. Western nations have accused Russia of blocking the ports, while Moscow has repeatedly stated it will guarantee safe passage for grain shipments if Kiev clears its ports of its own mines. It also suggested exporting the grain through the Russian-controlled ports of Berdyansk and Mariupol."
2022-06-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/557752-brics-reserve-currency-west-hegemony/,"By taking on American hegemony and challenging the dollar, BRICS members represent the best hope for a fairer world order","The 14th BRICS Summit in Beijing is just wrapping up amid a turbulent international geopolitical landscape, which highlights the importance of the organization in general. Given the combined challenges of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, global conflict, a looming economic crash and climate change – the current international system is failing and a new, multi-polar alternative must take its place. It’s worth noting the context of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) format. Started in 2009 amid a financial crisis, the main goal of that year’s first BRICS (or BRIC as it was then) summit in Yekaterinburg was to improve the global economic situation and reform financial institutions. Although these countries are not joined by any particular ideology, each saw the need to democratize the global economic system that had been crashed pretty much single-handedly by the United States in an extraordinarily irresponsible – even illegal by US law, in some instances – manner. The head of China’s Central Bank bluntly called for abandoning the dollar as the global reserve currency in 2009 because of a lack of faith in US monetary leadership. That was 13 years ago, yet the necessity of a new reserve currency could not be more relevant these days. In fact, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on June 22 just ahead of the latest BRICS summit that the group was indeed developing its own reserve currency based on a basket of their currencies. With this, Putin said the group is hoping to develop alternatives to the existing international payment scheme. While this could be seen as provocative in the West, it is actually for the betterment of mankind and is not aimed strictly at one country or one coalition of countries. To note, India pushed back against any “anti-US” rhetoric in the group’s joint statement, being a country that is considered part of the Global South, e.g., a developing country, and also has strong relations with the West. Yet, at the same time, it’s clear that all BRICS states, including India, would benefit from a democratized global economic and financial system. That is why New Delhi has not joined Western-led sanctions against Russia over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, because doing so does not serve India’s economic interests – and it would also establish a bad precedent where countries could essentially be excluded from the international community over political disagreements. Indeed, BRICS and its members have gone a long way to pursue zero-strings-attached development cooperation. China alone had already replaced the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank as the world’s largest net creditor at the beginning of the last decade, expanding investments in tangible assets across the Global South (and beyond) through the Belt and Road Initiative. But in a direct challenge to these two previously mentioned US-led institutions, which have morphed into weapons of economic coercion, BRICS established the New Development Bank in 2014. Another area where BRICS is currently not active but could be is security. Financial and economic stability is an inextricable part of security; without a stable economic and financial system there can be no sustainable peace. Likewise, without a stable security framework, there can be no drive for the human development that BRICS and its partners desire. Unfortunately, the connection between these two facets has not been established in the prevailing liberal international system, but BRICS could help tie them together which would be an extraordinarily beneficial development. Meanwhile, as BRICS wraps up, the G7 and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), two US-led international formats, will convene soon. Of note, NATO will draft its first “strategic concept” – the document which defines the organization’s objectives and principles – since 2010. It is anticipated that it will expand the military bloc’s reach far beyond Europe and probably to the Asia-Pacific, representing a serious challenge to China’s neighborhood. This probably explains why Chinese President Xi Jinping denounced “small circles” built around hegemony in his BRICS address. At a minimum, BRICS has a serious role in balancing out the malignant influence of the US, NATO and the prevailing Western-led world system. Finance and economics are no small part of this, and BRICS’ drive to establish alternatives to the dollar-based Bretton Woods system, providing credit to the Global South without political conditions and establishing a new reserve currency, is an extraordinary push toward a multi-polar future."
2022-06-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/557774-zakharova-eu-status-ukraine/,Russia blasts EU expansion strategy,"The European Council’s decision to grant EU candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova proves that the bloc’s goal is to “contain” Russia, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Friday. She claimed the EU is continuing its strategy of “active geopolitical development of the CIS space” in order to “contain” Moscow. “Moreover, all means are being used – from financial and economic leverage to military support,” Zakharova added. The spokeswoman said this strategy is making the bloc turn a blind eye to the strict accession criteria which has been applied to other EU candidates. “The future of ‘United Europe’, its ‘ideals’ of democracy are being sacrificed for the sake of the unrestrained expansion of the EU, the political and economic enslavement of its neighbors,” Zakharova said. According to the spokeswoman, the bloc has once again proven that it has very little to do with the economy and that there is almost no “creative force” left in it. She claimed that, by providing Ukraine with military support, the EU is “investing” in the “continuation of hostilities” in the country. In her opinion, Kiev will demand even more weapons given its new status. “To kill civilians with them, destroy civilian infrastructure, and fire at the positions of the Russian Armed Forces,” Zakharova said, referring to the ongoing Russian military offensive in Ukraine. She said that “such an aggressive approach” by the EU could result in the emergence of “new, deeper lines of division and crises in Europe as a whole.” “This policy of Brussels has nothing to do with the real needs of the inhabitants of Ukraine and the EU countries,” she concluded. The European Council agreed to grant candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova during an EU summit on Thursday. While Georgia fell short, the bloc recognized “the European perspective” of the country. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made it clear that all three countries “have work to do before moving to the next stage of the process.” Earlier, she had said that Ukraine had done a lot for strengthening the rule of law but reforms were still required. “To fight corruption, for example, or to modernize this well-functioning administration, to help attract investors,” she explained. Joining the EU has been a prominent talking point for pro-Western Ukrainian politicians for decades. Ukraine’s drive to join the bloc has been reinvigorated since its conflict with Russia, which broke out in late February."
2022-06-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/557750-ukraine-draft-convicts-women/,Ukraine replenishes combat losses with convicts and women – RT source,"A large-scale hunt for conscripts is underway across Ukraine as the military conflict with Russia continues, a source within Kiev’s military has told RT Russian. Kiev is reportedly unscrupulous about those being recruited and the means of delivering draft notices to them. The military recruiters are now allowed to hand out draft notices to people not only at their place of residence, but also in the streets and at restaurants, entertainment facilities and other locations. “Ukraine needs fresh manpower,” an employee of an active recruiting station in Kiev, who chose to remain anonymous, told RT. Draft notices are “being given in public places – everyone knows that. It happens at malls, recreation areas, gas stations – it doesn’t matter where. The goal is to recruit as many people as possible for the military reserve,” he said. A man from the south-eastern Zaporozhye Region recalled how he and his friend were stopped at a checkpoint and told to present their military IDs, which they didn’t have. The duo were only released by the troops by promising they would go to the recruitment stations right away and obtain the necessary papers. “Now we are hiding in a small village. We mainly stay indoors. There’s no talk of going to the city,” he revealed. The man he knew could face criminal charges over this behavior, but he said that it was still better than going to the front. All males, aged between 18 and 60, have been told to stay in the country and fight after Russia launched its military offensive in late February. In the Black Sea port of Odessa, some locals – who are trying to avoid being called up – have set up a special channel on Telegram to share real-time data on the areas where the draft notices are being handed out in the city. The health condition of the recruits apparently also doesn’t bother Kiev authorities too much. The medical examination includes “only four doctors: A surgeon, a neurologist, a psychiatrist, and an ophthalmologist. No in-depth checks are being carried out. Doctors only ask questions, that's all,” one draftee told RT. The recruits are being given the most basic training, if any, and mainly assigned to territorial defense formations intended to carry out guard duties on the home front. But there have been more and reports in recent weeks of such units being sent to Donbass to face the advancing Russian forces. According to the law, which has been put forward by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukrainian women who hold certain jobs should now also obtain military registration, and are faced with a fine if they fail to do so. Obtaining new employment has also been made impossible without the relevant papers from a recruitment station. Those women can only be assigned civilian roles in the Defense Ministry, but in some parts of Ukraine, volunteer female units are being formed with the aim of actually going to the front. The mayor of the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk announced in April that the local all-women battalion would “fight alongside men.” Inmates of Ukrainian prisons have also been used as a source of manpower by Kiev. In late May, the country’s justice minister announced that 363 convicts were released so they could join the military. Prisoners went through thorough screenings to ensure they posed no danger, he insisted. Such a massive draft campaign is due to heavy losses suffered by the Ukrainian army, military expert Colonel Viktor Baranets told RT. “There are not enough contract soldiers and officers. The personnel shortage in the Ukrainian army is increasing because during the special operation a large number of seasoned Nazis were put out of action. And those reservists, who are now sent into battle aren’t fit for the task. But, more importantly, there are staff shortages not only in the military, but also in territorial defense. That’s why even women are being called up too,” Baranets explained. Earlier this month, Zelensky’s top aide Mikhail Podolyak revealed that the Ukrainian military was losing up to 100 to 200 troops daily in the battle for the Donbass. Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov refused to give an exact number of soldiers killed in the fighting, but said he hoped the figure was below 100,000."
2022-06-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/557740-arestovich-lgbtq-friendly-image/,Western media is silent as top Zelensky aide exposes its false presentation of Ukraine as LGBTQ-friendly,"In the 21st century, with the proliferation of social media and other mass forms of communication, it has become easier to bastardize certain causes that may in some form be noble in order to pursue one’s own political or geopolitical purposes. We have seen it before with the weaponization of women’s rights during the US military campaigns in the Middle East. Also, with the weaponization of concepts like “freedom” and “democracy” in the West’s propaganda wars concerning Venezuela, Russia, Cuba, Bolivia, and others. One of the issues that has also been weaponized against countries not accepting US or Western hegemony is rights for lesbians and gay men. This theme has been used to demonize states and sweeten the taste for war against them amongst the Western public. For example GLAAD, a mainstream corporate-backed NGO which “advocates” for the rights of LGBT people, released a questionable statement in March regarding Ukraine and Russia. It argues that “The Russian invasion of Ukraine is built on the demonization and persecution against the LGBTQ community and has a disproportionate impact on LGBTQ people in Ukraine, who had just started to experience visibility and equality.” That’s curious in a couple of different ways, but one wonders what GLAAD would say in regards to the recent controversy surrounding Ukrainian presidential aide Alexey Arestovich. Arestovich has recently been accused of homophobia for stating that he views LGBT folk as “people with deviations.” He also positioned himself as vehemently opposed to what he called “gay propaganda.” Which basically means his point-of-view aligns with a 2013 Russian law that was aggressively derided in the West, by celebrities, politicians and other figures. KyivPride, a Ukrainian NGO devoted to promoting LGBTQ rights, promptly called for his dismissal. Arestovich’s response was to tweet a picture of himself dressed up as a woman from a comedy film which he starred in, back in 2012, before he got into politics. He captioned the screenshot with the words, “The LGBT community is outraged. But look at this photo and you will understand who should be truly outraged. I think I’m being persecuted, no? I demand tolerance.” In a country which has falsely positioned itself as a modern state with progressive European views and values, this response from one of President Volodymyr Zelensky’s top advisers is quite curious. While liberal outlets across the West continue to heap praise upon everything that is Ukraine and Zelensky, they have been quiet on this homophobic attitude present in his administration. No US-based LGBT organization has released a statement on the matter, which is unsurprising considering any type of criticism against Ukraine or its government is considered sacrilegious by the mainstream media in the West. Meanwhile, the same outlets have made it a point to cover feel good stories about LGBT soldiers in Ukraine displaying unicorns on their uniforms. They seem to conveniently leave out the fact that Ukraine continues to lack protections for LGBTQ people in most areas of life. It is, of course, the right of any sovereign nation to have its laws and regulations decided by their own people and legislatures, but for a country that has attempted to wrongly paint itself as a cosmopolitical haven – as opposed to the supposedly evil and medieval Russia – this is a glaring inconsistency. Even more so, considering the absolute flood of praise and approval that Western LGBTQ communities have heaped upon Ukraine in the past few months, it is perplexing that these same communities and organizations ignore the reality in Ukraine that their organizations were founded to change in the first place. When Arestovich isn’t calling supporters of his boss “vulgar a***oles”, or referring to Westerners who argue for peace as “dumb f**ks”, it seems he is willing to unknowingly expose the hypocrisy of the Zelensky administration. While Ukraine has been – and continues to be – the poorest country in Europe, one wonders why he feels now is the time to antagonize the LGBTQ community and threaten “tantrums” if Kiev isn’t given the weaponry his government is begging for."
2022-06-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/557764-putin-germany-world-hunger-weapon/,Putin responds to claims about world hunger,"Western nations are deliberately stirring up tensions regarding Ukrainian grain exports, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday during a BRICS+ video conference. He was responding to comments by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who has accused Moscow of holding the whole world “hostage” by blocking Ukrainian grain shipments. Putin said Russia is not impeding exports, and criticized the West for its “cynical attitude” towards the food supply of the developing nations, which have been worst affected by soaring prices. He said rising inflation in the West was “a result of their own irresponsible macroeconomic policies.” Moscow is ready to provide free passage to international waters for ships carrying grain, Putin said, adding that Russia had reached an “understanding” on that issue with the UN Secretariat. The Russian president suggested that the Ukrainian military should demine the country’s ports to further facilitate exports, however, and said “a constructive approach on Kiev’s part” is the only thing that is lacking. According to the president, Russia itself may be able to export between 37 and 50 tons of grain this year. Earlier on Friday, Baerbock blamed Moscow for the looming food crisis at a conference in Berlin. Russia is “deliberately” using global hunger as “a weapon,” the minister said, claiming that Moscow had taken “the whole world hostage.” The German minister also spoke about a potentially “life-threatening wave” of hunger that the world is facing, since around 345 million people are currently threatened by food shortages. The crisis has been a result of a number of factors like droughts and various regional conflicts, as well as the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, Baerbock admitted. However, she claimed it was Russia that “made a tsunami out of this wave.” Her words have sparked an angry reaction from Moscow. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has said on Telegram that “using hunger as a weapon” is “Germany’s historical tradition,” apparently referring to crimes committed by the Nazis. Former Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, also pointed to the blockade of the city of Leningrad (St. Petersburg) by the Nazis during World War II, which lasted for 900 days, causing massive hunger in the city, and claiming the lives of almost 700,000 people. Zakharova also pointed to the fact that Germany had continued to actively import food after the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, despite concerns about its potential consequences for global food security. March alone saw Germany import food worth €3.4 billion ($3.59 billion), she said, citing data provided by the Trading Economics website. The EU has repeatedly expressed concerns over the prospect of a food crisis that could break out if Ukrainian grain does not reach its traditional importers. Ukraine, a major grain producer, has been unable to export its grain by sea due to the ongoing conflict in the country, with an estimated 22 million to 25 million tons of grain currently stuck in the country’s ports. The Western nations have blamed Russia for blocking the ports. Moscow has repeatedly stated it would guarantee safe passage for grain shipments if Kiev clears its ports of mines. It also suggested exporting the grain through the Russian-controlled ports of Berdyansk and Mariupol. Meanwhile, Germany has suggested setting up a test corridor for exporting Ukrainian grain by rail through Poland. “Germany plans to facilitate this, in particular with the help of German railways,” Berlin’s ambassador to Ukraine, Anka Feldhusen, said on Monday."
2022-06-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/557756-number-encircled-ukrainian-troops-reveal/,Huge number of Ukrainian troops encircled – Moscow,"Up to 2,000 Ukrainian troops, nationalists and foreign fighters have been surrounded by Russian forces and the Donbass militias, Moscow claimed on Friday. The soldiers are encircled in two neighboring towns in the Lugansk People’s Republic. Four Ukrainian battalions. as well as an artillery unit are among those trapped, the Defense Ministry announced. The encircled forces also include around 120 fighters from the notorious 'Right Sector,’ a neo-Nazi group of up to 80 foreign fighters, according to the ministry. The troops are in the towns of Gorskoye and Zolotoye, located south of the major cities of Severodonetsk and Lisichansk, which have recently become one of the major targets for both sides amid the continued fighting for the territory of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics. The Russian military has also claimed that the trapped units have lost over 60% of their strength. According to the defense ministry, 41 Ukrainian soldiers encircled in the area have surrendered. The Defense Ministry has also published a video supposedly showing those who have laid down their arms. The head of the Ukrainian Gorskoye military administration, Aleksey Babchenko, confirmed to the Ukrainian media on Friday that the town has been fully seized by the Russian forces and the Donbass militias. Sergey Gaidai, who Ukraine calls the head of the “Lugansk Oblast,” has also said on Telegram that the Ukrainian forces might soon retreat from Lisichansk since their defensive positions had been destroyed by the Russian forces and there is “little sense” in staying. The Russian Air Force has also successfully hit a Ukrainian artillery battery equipped with the US-made M777 howitzers in the Kharkov region. Earlier, Washington vowed to supply 90 such artillery pieces to Kiev, according to a May report by the New York Times. The news comes just days after the Russian military claimed to have killed hundreds of Ukrainian troops in a strike on a shipbuilding plant in the Ukrainian port of Nikolaev. Last week, the defense ministry also claimed to have killed scores of Ukrainian officers after striking a compound where a meeting of commanders of several Ukrainian units was taking place. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements. The Minsk Protocol was designed to give the regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/557749-ukraine-russia-resuming-talks-lavrov/,Russia warns of conditions for resuming Ukraine peace talks,"Two months after talks aimed at ending the Ukraine conflict broke down, at Kiev's instigation, Russia has issued a warning about the possibility of restarting the process. If Ukraine seeks to return to the negotiating table, Moscow will have to look at the “situation on the ground,” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview on Thursday. He accused some Western countries of not allowing the Kiev authorities to re-engage with a diplomatic effort to stop the fighting. “When [Ukraine] deigns to turn to us with a proposal to resume the diplomatic process, which, as I understand it, the Europeans are urgently asking them to do, but the Anglo-Saxons do not allow this, we will look at the situation on the ground,” Lavrov said in an interview with Belarusian state TV. “There are liberated areas, and the majority of the population there don’t even entertain the thought of returning under the control of neo-Nazi authorities or authorities that indulge neo-Nazism in every way possible,” he added. Talks between Moscow and Kiev have stalled since they were last held in Turkey in late March. Since then, the Ukrainian side has maintained that it will resume talks only when it is in a “stronger negotiating position,” while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that he would restart negotiations only after Kiev recovers land lost after February 24. Last week, Ukraine’s top negotiator David Arakhamia said the authorities in Kiev believe they could achieve a “favorable position” by late August by conducting “counteroffensive operations in certain areas.” He reiterated that Ukraine “will never accept the loss of territory,” insisting this is “legally impossible,” and that a minimum agreement with Moscow could only be considered if Russian troops return all the territory seized since the start of its military offensive. “We could consider some political treaty like the one proposed in Istanbul. For example, we would not touch on the Crimean issue for several years. We would do it not militarily but diplomatically,” Arakhamia noted. Meanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba stated in an op-ed published last week that if Kiev received enough heavy weaponry from the West, it could defeat Russia and take back its land by force. He also urged the West not to suggest “unacceptable” peace terms for Ukraine. Russia attacked Ukraine following Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/557741-nato-europe-coalition-war-moscow/,EU and NATO forming coalition ‘for war against Russia’ – Lavrov,"The actions taken by the EU and NATO essentially amount to the formation of a “new coalition” targeting Russia, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told journalists on Friday, comparing the steps taken by Brussels to the actions of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler before attacking the Soviet Union. Moscow has “no illusions” about the prospect of “Russophobic sentiments” within the EU dissipating any time soon, Lavrov said. Russia will closely follow all the “real steps” taken by the bloc and its candidate states, he added in a probable reference to Ukraine, which was granted EU candidacy status on Thursday. “Hitler rallied a significant part, if not most, of the European nations under his banner for a war against the Soviet Union,” the foreign minister said, adding that “now, the EU together with NATO are forming another – modern – coalition for a standoff and, ultimately, war with the Russian Federation.” Lavrov’s remarks came just one day after he branded a proposal to assemble an international naval coalition to escort ships carrying Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea as an attempt to interfere in the region under the auspices of the UN. Such schemes are not needed to facilitate Ukrainian grain exports, he argued, adding that Moscow guarantees vessels security all the way to the Bosphorus Strait, a key Black Sea access channel controlled by Turkey. Earlier this month, the minister also stated that Washington was seeking to use the conflict in Ukraine to deprive Russia of its independent status on the international arena and force it to play by rules set by the US. America and its allies will not succeed in such an endeavor, he warned at the time. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force. The US and its allies reacted to the development by slapping Russia with an unprecedented number of sanctions, targeting its banking and finance sectors as well as aviation and space industries. The US and Canada put an embargo on oil and gas imports from Russia. The EU followed suit by introducing a partial embargo on Russian oil in early June. The Western nations have also been supplying Ukraine with weapons since the start of the Russian military operation there."
2022-06-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/557714-microsoft-ukraine-cyber-censorship/,US censorship of Russian media has failed – Microsoft,"Silicon Valley’s efforts to suppress what it terms “Russian propaganda” – meaning outlets like RT and Sputnik – on behalf of Ukraine may have reduced their reach, but they are still accessed by more Americans than before the outbreak of fighting between Moscow and Kiev. That's according to Microsoft, in a report on the ongoing internet-war on behalf of the Ukrainians. Kiev has relied on a “coalition of countries, companies, and NGOs” for cyber defense, moving its digital infrastructure to the public cloud hosted in the West, according to the report titled “Defending Ukraine: Early Lessons from the Cyber War,” published on Wednesday and signed by Brad Smith, president and vice chair of Microsoft. The 30-page pamphlet seeks to label any news reports coming out of Russia as Kremlin propaganda and “global cyber influence operations” to support the war effort in Ukraine. They “combine tactics developed by the KGB over several decades with new digital technologies and the internet” to “take advantage of the longstanding openness of democratic societies and the public polarization that is characteristic of current times,” according to Smith. Microsoft claims that “Russian cyber influence operations” led to an 82% increase in the spread of propaganda in the US and 216% in Ukraine, and that “the tech sector’s efforts in early March to curtail the amplification of narratives from RT and Sputnik likely helped reduce the spread of Russian propaganda back to pre-February levels.” According to Microsoft’s estimates, RT and Sputnik still get anywhere from 60-80 million average monthly page views in the US, making alleged Russian influence “on par with a major publication like the Wall Street Journal.” The company co-founded by Bill Gates bases these estimates and assessments on the Russian Propaganda Index (RPI), a tool developed by its “AI For Good Lab.” The lab has also used “a wide variety of internet sources and other identifying characteristics” to determine and even predict which sites might be considered Russian propaganda online, relying in part on outfits like NewsGuard and the Global Disinformation Index (GDI). The US has a constitutional ban on overt censorship, but the Silicon Valley-based YouTube has blocked access to “Russian state media” channels across the globe since the conflict in Ukraine broke out. Having blocked RT and Sputnik in the European Union in March at the request of EU governments, YouTube announced days later that it was expanding this censorship globally, and including all channels “associated with Russian state-funded media.” The EU’s Council of Ministers banned RT and Sputnik on March 2, citing the conflict in Ukraine, and said it would remain in effect until Russia stops conducting what it called, “disinformation and information manipulation actions against the EU and its member states.” Australia, Canada and the UK have followed suit."
2022-06-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/557718-transport-plane-crash-ryazan/,Military transport plane crashes in Russia,"Several crew members were killed when a transport aircraft crashed on Friday morning near the Russian city of Ryazan, some 200 kilometers southeast of Moscow. Pictures and videos circulating on social media indicated the jet was an Ilyushin Il-76, and the Russian Defense Ministry later confirmed it was a military flight. “During a training flight, without cargo, an engine malfunction forced the crew to perform an emergency landing on rough ground,” the ministry said, adding that the aircraft “partially” fell apart upon striking the ground. The military has yet to confirm the number of victims, but initial reports indicated there were nine or ten people on board. At least two of them died, while six survivors were rushed to local hospitals, according to Russian media reports citing emergency services. The Baza and 112 telegram channels reported that one of the jet’s engines was on fire before it attempted an emergency landing. There were no reports of injuries or damage to infrastructure on the ground, as the plane apparently went down in a field near a freeway. The blaze was swiftly brought under control as multiple fire crews and ambulances were seen responding to the crash."
2022-06-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/557717-russia-belarus-defense-minister/,Russia and Belarus discuss joint defense plans,"Moscow and Minsk need to take “urgent measures” to bolster their military capabilities in the face of an “undeclared war” by the West, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu warned on Thursday, after meeting with his counterpart from Belarus, Viktor Khrenin. “Belarus is our most important strategic partner, closest friend and ally,” Shoigu said after the meeting in Moscow, adding that the bilateral cooperation between two members of the Union State is currently developing amid “an undeclared war against our countries” by the West. “Circumstances dictate the necessity of urgent measures to fortify the defense capabilities of the Union State,” Shoigu added, including the reinforcement of an integrated air defense system. Russia is “ready to provide any support” Belarus might need, he added. Shoigu also commended the determination of Belarus to “resist the confrontational course of the United States and its allies” and invited Khrenin and a delegation from Minsk to the upcoming Moscow Security Conference and the International Army Games. Russia will share its “best practices” and other discoveries with its allies there, the defense minister said. Belarus is not officially involved in the current conflict in Ukraine, but the US and its allies have imposed related embargoes on Minsk nonetheless. Russia and Belarus signed the Union State treaty in 1999, envisioning the establishment of a joint cabinet, parliament, courts and other institutions. While integration has not progressed to that extent, Moscow and Minsk announced further plans to strengthen the union last year."
2022-06-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/557715-macron-ukraine-moldova-candidate/,Macron hails ‘strong signal’ from EU to Russia,"Granting Ukraine and Moldova candidate status for EU membership is a “political gesture” that sends a “strong signal” to Russia, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday. However, while Kiev and Chisinau celebrated, other EU leaders warned that the accession process could take years, with reforms and negotiations standing in the way of actual membership. The EU’s recognition of the “European perspective of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia is a strong signal towards Russia in the current geopolitical context,” Macron said at a press conference in Brussels. Granting candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova sends “a very strong message,” he added. “We owe this to the Ukrainian people. They’re fighting for our values,” Macron said. “From day one of this conflict Europe has been reacting in a quick, historic and united way. Firstly with the sanctions, then macro economic, military and financial support and now by this political gesture.” European Council President Charles Michel also called it “a historic moment” and a “crucial step” on Ukraine and Moldova’s path towards the EU. “27 times yes!” said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, referring to the number of member countries. “Here's to good cooperation in the European family!” Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo also praised the “symbolic message” of the EU’s decision, but noted that this doesn’t mean Kiev will be joining the bloc anytime soon. That is “a process of many years with a lot of reforms which will be very difficult,” he said. The process of joining the EU consists of 35 chapters, and can be suspended or reversed at any point. EuroNews described it as “lengthy, complex and often tortuous.” The European Commission is demanding Ukraine carry out seven major reforms by the end of the year, including implementing a law “meant to curb the excessive influence of oligarchs in the economy” and “the protection of national minorities” – which presumably refers to Russian-speakers and ethnic Hungarians. By becoming candidates, Ukraine and Moldova join Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey in the EU’s waiting room. Ankara has been a candidate since 1999. Meanwhile, the former Soviet republic of Georgia was merely given an EU “perspective,” with candidacy contingent on further political reforms."
2022-06-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/557712-ukraine-drones-pilots-jets/,US drones won’t survive over Ukraine for long – Foreign Policy,"As Washington reportedly stalls on selling Gray Eagle combat drones to Ukraine, military officials in Kiev are asking for fighter jets such as the F-15 and F-16 instead, saying they have a better chance against Russian air defenses. Ukraine is “not Afghanistan” and the expensive drones would just get shot down, one pilot told Foreign Policy this week. Retired US officers and pundits like Moscow-born Max Boot have loudly advocated for the delivery of Gray Eagles to Ukraine, calling it a potential “game changer” in the conflict. However, the White House has put plans to send four such drones to Kiev “on hold,” Reuters reported last week, due to fears they could fall into Russian hands. While the Ukrainian generals would like to get their hands on the drones, the pilots would prefer US fighter-bombers, according to Foreign Policy. “We are not advocating for the Gray Eagles,” one pilot, who went only by ‘Moonfish’, told the outlet. “It’s very dangerous to use such expensive drones in our case, because of the enemy’s air defense,” he added. “It’s not Afghanistan here.” The MQ-1C Gray Eagle is the latest in the General Atomics lineage of strike drones used during the US “war on terror,” from Afghanistan and Iraq to Somalia and Yemen. It is armed with Hellfire missiles, which have a range of about eight kilometers – less than the Switchblade or Phoenix Ghost suicide drones the US has sent to Ukraine already. “It could be useful” on the frontline, said another fighter pilot, introduced as ‘Juice’. However, he added, the Gray Eagles would probably not survive for more than a mission or two. Each drone costs $10 million. Ukraine has made a big deal out of having Turkish Bayraktar TB2 strike drones in its arsenal. The TB2 costs around $2 million or so. Moonfish claims they were “very useful and important” in the early days of the conflict, but are “almost useless” now that the Russian troops have beefed up their air defenses. The pilots told Foreign Policy that Ukraine was now limiting the use of Bayraktars to “rare special operations and attack missions.” Russian war correspondents, meanwhile, suggest that it’s because most of the drones have been shot down already. “We have a lot more pilots than jets right now,” Moonfish said, suggesting he and his colleagues should be trained on “advanced” US fighter jets such as the F-15 and F-16, which would be more survivable against the Russian S-400s. Both types first appeared in the 1970s. They have been repeatedly upgraded since then, and the latest versions are considered by Western experts to be on par with the Russian Su-35 and MiG-35 jets, and slightly ahead of the Su-27 and Mig-29 fighters Ukraine operated at the start of the conflict. However, there are no indications the US has any to spare, or that there is political will in Washington to send them to Ukraine."
2022-06-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/557713-traffic-restrictions-to-be-reviewed/,EU to review Kaliningrad blockade,"The EU is not seeking to impose a “blockade” on Russia’s Kaliningrad Region and will review its sanctions guidelines to avoid “blocking” traffic into and out of the exclave, the bloc’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said Thursday. Lithuania’s actions to restrict transit to and from Kaliningrad, implemented under EU Commission guidelines, are aimed foremost at preventing the circumvention of anti-Russia sanctions imposed over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, Borrell explained. “We want to make controls that could prevent any kind of sanctions avoidance, and not preventing the traffic. And the [European] Commission and the European External Action Service are going to review the guidelines in order to clarify that we do not want to block or prevent the traffic between Russia and Kaliningrad,” the diplomat told a news conference. There are some goods which are under control and this control has to be implemented in a clever and smart way in order to control the sanctions, but not obstructing the traffic between Kaliningrad and Russia. Over the weekend, Lithuania’s national railway operator banned the flow of sanctioned goods between the region and mainland Russia, citing sanctions guidelines from the European Commission. The restrictions, expected to affect roughly 50% of cargo flow between the exclave and the rest of Russia, have already hit road traffic as well, according to Kaliningrad officials. While Moscow has branded the move an “economic blockade” of the region, both the EU and Vilnius insist the restrictions should not be perceived like that. Top Russian officials vowed a response to the “hostile” actions, the head of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolay Patrushev, promising retaliatory steps that would “have a serious negative impact on the people of Lithuania.” “Of course, Russia will respond to hostile actions. Appropriate measures are in the works, and will be adopted in the near future,” Patrushev told media during his visit to Kaliningrad on Tuesday."
2022-06-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/557694-french-guns-allegedly-captured/,Russian arms maker mocks France's Macron,"A leading Russian arms manufacturer has claimed it had studied French guns captured in Ukraine and found them lacking. The mocking comment suggested French President Emmanuel Macron should send more CAESAR howitzers to Kiev, so that more could find their way to Russia, armor maker Uralvagonzavod wrote on social media on Thursday. France has sent a handful of its CAESAR truck-mounted 155mm artillery guns to bolster Ukrainian forces against Russia. A French political commentator claimed this week that two of them were captured intact and sent to Russia, possibly to be reverse engineered. “Thank you, Macron,” Regis de Castelnau said in a tweet on Monday. In its Thursday response, the Russian arms manufacturer appeared to confirm the claim – or at least clap back at its French competition. It responded to a copy of the tweet that de Castelnau had posted on his Telegram account. “Please, send our thanks to President Macron for the gifted self-propelled guns,” the Uralvagonzavod account said in Russian. It jokingly added that the French weapons were “so-so,” unlike the Russian plant’s products, but said it could find a way to use the foreign hardware nevertheless: “Bring us more, we’ll dismantle [them].” The remark, which referred to French President Emmanuel Macron, didn’t offer any evidence for the claim. There was no official confirmation that any CAESAR guns actually fell into Russia’s hands or evidence that this was the case. Western powers arming Ukraine have been reluctant to ship their more advanced weapon systems due to concerns that Russia could capture and reverse engineer them."

The soldier, who apparently had returned from the frontlines of the ongoing conflict with Russia, is seen being reunited with her daughter and giving her toy unicorns. Amid the emotional encounter, a swastika-style patch – a rounded solar cross with additional elements – can be clearly seen on the woman’s backpack. Similar emblems were used by several Waffen-SS units in Nazi Germany during WW2. “This is what we are fighting for,” Gerashchenko captioned the video. This is what we are fighting for.#UkraineRussiaWar#StandWithUkrainepic.twitter.com/bMJkk38Pjx While Moscow has repeatedly outlined the need to “denazify” Ukraine, Kiev has consistently denied having any neo-Nazi elements in the country’s society and military. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-23,https://www.rt.com/news/557686-ukraine-grain-lavrov-truss/,Moscow claims it sees ‘true’ plans behind grain coalition,"The proposal to put together an international naval coalition to escort ships with Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea is, in reality, one that pursues a completely different goal, Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has claimed. “The attempts to organize some kind of international coalition for the implementation of these procedures are aimed solely at interfering in the Black Sea region under the auspices of the UN. And we see this quite clearly,” Lavrov pointed out, following talks with Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in Tehran on Thursday. The idea of sending into the Black Sea the warships of the countries allegedly affected by grain shortages caused by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, was floated by Lithuanian FM Gabrielius Landsbergis during his trip to London in late May. According to the media, the British authorities had voiced support, in principle, for such a mission. “There’s no problem with exporting grain without putting together any such schemes,” the Russian foreign minister assured his audience. He reiterated that Moscow guarantees the security of vessels with grain in international waters all the way to the Bosphorus strait, a key access channel controlled by Ankara. “We have understanding on this issue with Turkey,” Lavrov said. Ukraine is a major exporter of grain but its ships have been unable to put to sea since the launch of the Russian military operation in the country in late February. Kiev and the West are blaming Moscow for blocking their passage, while Russia insists that logistical problems have been created by naval mines placed by Ukraine itself. “The efforts that are now being undertaken by both Turkey and the UN Secretary General [Antonio Guterres] would’ve been a success a long time ago if Ukraine and its Western masters had solved the problem of demining ports in the Black Sea,” Russia’s top diplomat pointed out. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on Thursday also addressed the issue of helping Ukrainian grain leave the ports, saying that it would require “an international effort.” The UK Foreign Secretary, who was speaking after talks with Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu, has claimed that a failure to swiftly resolve the grain-transport deadlock “will cause great famine.” “[Russian President Vladimir] Putin is weaponizing hunger, he’s using food security as a callous tool of war. He’s blocked Ukrainian ports, and is stopping 20 million tonnes of grain being exported across the globe, holding the world to ransom,” Truss said. Lavrov had previously blamed the West for exaggerating the issues surrounding Ukrainian grain, pointing out that the blocked supplies accounted for “less than 1% of the global production of wheat and other cereals.” “Therefore, the current situation with Ukrainian grain has nothing to do with the food crisis,” he said, speaking a few weeks ago."
2022-06-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/557640-ukraine-european-union-membership/,"The granting of EU candidacy to Ukraine is merely a PR stunt, just ask the Turkish who signed the same deal in 1999","For the European Union's leadership to recommend that the 27-member bloc votes to designate Ukraine as a candidate for eventual membership is like introducing your dodgy new fiancé to your parents, who fake-smile, knowing that the odds are low of you ever making it down the aisle as a couple. Worse, it would be like you explaining to them: “I can change/fix him!” Meanwhile, you know that he’s a much less attractive partner than your previous ones with whom you failed to seal the deal. On the one hand, EU Commissioner President Ursula von der Leyen has praised the country’s potential, based primarily on projection and wishful thinking: “Ukraine has clearly demonstrated its aspiration and determination to live up to European values and standards.” She made this proclamation on the same week that the Volodymyr Zelensky regime banned the country's largest opposition party. But at least she acknowledged that the country would have to “carry out a number of important reforms.” You don’t say! Perhaps not turning a blind eye to Neo-Nazis, or not folding them into the country’s military, would be a start. Even the US government-funded Freedom House considers “far-right extremism” to be “a threat to Ukrainian democracy,” citing shows of force prior to the current conflict which have gone “fully unpunished by the authorities.” According to the report, “Their activities challenge the legitimacy of the state, undermine its democratic institutions, and discredit the country’s law enforcement agencies.” The West’s own role in arming and training Neo-Nazi fighters now serving in the Ukrainian army, should also be a hindrance to entering the bloc. So should rampant systemic graft. “Corruption could mean Ukraine loses a future peace,” wrote an Atlantic Council European specialist recently in Foreign Policy magazine. Other Western experts, including those at Washington’s CATO Institute, have highlighted the “whitewashing” of Ukraine’s corruption by the West. French President Emmanuel Macron, before visiting Zelensky in Kiev with his German and Italian counterparts last week, acknowledged that actual membership would take “several decades.” As a consolation prize, Macron has suggested creating a sort of “kiddie table” for Ukraine and other potential EU candidate nations, which he calls the “EU political community.” Will there be balloon animals, face painting, and cartoons on the napkins at the club meetings? So, Ukraine is definitely what you might call a “fixer upper,” but Zelensky would like for everyone to know that they’re already good to go. “We are proving daily that we are already a part of the European Union,"" Zelensky said on Monday. Forget those poorly tracked Western weapons floating around Ukraine alongside the foreign mercenary fighters. Ukraine is clearly ready right now for full EU integration! Zelensky is ready to elope in Las Vegas with an Elvis wedding! Just because Zelensky is being courted a lot right now doesn’t mean that he’s ultimately going to be allowed to cut to the front of the velvet rope at the Club EU. Turkey, a NATO ally, applied to the EU’s predecessor, the European Economic Community in 1987, and was recognized as a candidate in 1999, and still isn’t a member. Turkey has also allowed NATO and EU countries to establish military bases inside its territory for Western wars in the Middle East and Africa. It has also saved the EU from being overwhelmed by migrants displaced by Western military interventions in Africa, by holding them in camps on the EU-Turkey border. Apparently that’s still not enough for Brussels. When asked this week about Ankara’s prospects of joining the bloc, von der Leyen replied that “there is no progress.” The EU has cited Turkey’s “human rights record” to justify its foot-dragging, and Ukraine could feasibly face the same fate. “Impunity for torture remained endemic. Gender-based violence remained widespread,” noted Amnesty International, in its 2021 report on Ukraine. There’s also the issue of Kiev having spent the past eight years harassing and attacking its own Russophone people in Donbass. Of course, there’s always the possibility that the EU could rush through Ukraine’s membership approval, spitting in the faces of both its own declared values and standards, and in Turkey’s face, too. But then why even bother pretending that there are any requirements at all beyond simply having a purely political or PR agenda? The cost of EU enlargement has also previously been cited as a reason for the bloc not expanding faster. In other words, Germany, France, Italy and the few other net donors to the bloc simply can’t afford to pay for all of the net recipients. And Ukraine would be one heck of a major cost to taxpayers in countries footing the bill. West Europeans are already paying a high price as the result of their leader's meddling in Ukraine, which has culminated in the current conflict with Russia and caused the cost of living to explode. The EU really can’t afford to make it official with Ukraine. So, will Brussels just keep stringing Kiev along, or take the plunge and worry about the consequences later?"
2022-06-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/557675-medvedev-criticizes-european-politicians/,Former Russian president laments low quality of current Western leaders,"The current generation of European politicians are vastly inferior to those who governed the continent a few decades ago, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday. Modern “technocrats” don’t have the backbone needed to take bold decisions and stand up to the US, unlike the statesmen of old, he claimed. “I don’t mean to offend anyone, but it’s obvious to everyone that Mario Draghi is no Silvio Berlusconi and Olaf Scholz is no Angela Merkel,” Medvedev wrote on social media, comparing the current and former leaders of Italy and Germany. “The political class of people, who embodied powerful political movements and in some cases entire eras, was replaced with puny individuals who call themselves technocrats,” he said. The Russian official, who now serves as deputy chair of the National Security Council, said he had witnessed the replacement of the old guard personally during his career. Previously, Western Europeans had the guts to take action and face the music, if they turned out to be wrong but while the modern generation may be largely competent at governing, they don’t have the personality to take personal responsibility, he said. “They will hide, weasel out, cite instructions, the state of markets or even climate change, but won’t make decisions. Or when they do, they come disastrously late,” he said. Medvedev said such politicians cannot command respect because of these personal qualities, as evidenced by the treatment they get from Ukrainian officials. “Could the Ukrainian ambassador call Chancellor [Helmut] Kohl ‘liverwurst’? Would the current president of Ukraine wear a green T-shirt to a meeting with President [Jacques] Chirac? Of course not,” Medvedev said, referring to the former leaders of Germany and France. The first incident he referred to was the name-calling of Chancellor Scholz by Kiev’s envoy in Berlin. Weeks later, Andrey Melnik said he “regretted” calling Scholz an “offended liverwurst.” Medvedev’s second remark apparently referred to the way Volodymyr Zelensky was dressed when he hosted the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania in Kiev earlier this month, who all wore business attire. The Russian official blamed what he described as the “degradation” of European politicians on the increasing subversion of the policies of European nations to the interest of the US. “[Former French president] Charles de Gaulle could object to any American president. Who among the Europeans now could do so without their hands trembling? They don’t think about the future. They are limited by their flaccid electoral goals,” Medvedev said. He noted that he was making this criticism public even though it would have been considered a major faux pas in the past. He said such remarks were now deemed permissible “for obvious reasons” in the West and in Russia. There was little hope for positive change in terms of the scope of politicians, Medvedev said. He added that President Vladimir Putin’s old joke that “since Mahatma Gandhi died, there is no one to talk to” has proven to be spot-on."
2022-06-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/557663-us-refuses-entry-flight-russian-diplomats/,Russia slams ‘hostile’ US move,"Russia’s foreign ministry has described as “hostile” and “provocative” a US decision not to let a “humanitarian” flight pick up Russian diplomats who had been ordered to leave the Washington. In a statement published on the ministry’s website on Wednesday, Moscow warned that the US government’s latest move was yet another blow to Russian-American bilateral relations, “which are already in a sorry state.” According to spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, Washington refused to issue an entry permit for a special flight which was supposed to bring Russian diplomats and their families home – a move Zakharova branded “hostile.” “The Biden administration chose to completely ignore the fact that we are essentially talking about a humanitarian action,” the diplomat claimed. She explained that the “plane was supposed to come and pick up those of our colleagues who the Department of State had earlier ordered to leave the US by the end of the month.” Zakharova stressed that the American government’s “provocative behavior” will not go unanswered. The official added that Moscow had warned Washington in advance that, should it not allow the flight to arrive, Russia would respond, including in an asymmetrical manner. Since the start of Russia’s offensive against Ukraine in late February, a whole host of countries, mainly in the West, have expelled a total of several hundred Russian diplomats. The Kremlin has responded in kind, showing the representatives of those countries the door. In fact, souring relations between Washington and Moscow had seen the two nations engage in tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomatic staff for several years before the armed conflict broke out. On multiple occasions, the US authorities have claimed that Russian diplomats had been doubling as spies – an allegation Moscow has consistently denied. This latest episode stems from a decision made by the US Department of State in August 2021, according to which Russian diplomats, who had stayed in the country for more than three years, had to leave. Washington insisted that it was not an expulsion, but rather a tightening of rules aimed at making Russia rotate its diplomats with similar frequency to that of the US embassy in Moscow. Russia argued that this was a mere pretext, and mirrored the newly introduced US three-year limit, ordering a number of American diplomatic staff to leave. The first 24 Russian representatives vacated America in early September 2021. Another 27 Russian diplomats and their families flew home on January 30, 2022. Some 28 more embassy staff are expected to leave the US on June 30."
2022-06-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/557653-ukraine-nato-eu-trimarium-arestovich/,Ukraine ‘de facto in NATO’ already – Zelensky adviser,"Ukraine’s eventual membership in NATO and the EU is a mere formality, Alexey Arestovich, a prominent adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said on Wednesday. Kiev is already a “de facto” member of the US-led military bloc, which has promised to help it “win” the conflict with Russia – and has just joined the Three Seas Initiative as a back-door to the EU, Arestovich claimed in an interview. Speaking with YouTuber and activist Mark Feygin on Wednesday, Arestovich admitted he had doubts about whether NATO or the EU were ready to accept Ukraine, but that it didn’t matter. Just becoming a candidate gives Ukraine access to EU development funds, with which Poland had built up its infrastructure, he told Feygin. Moreover, Kiev has just made another cunning move by joining the Trimarium, Arestovich said. “We became the 13th country of the Trimarium. This is access to money, to transport, to security at sea, to infrastructure. And 12 Trimarium countries are EU members. That is, almost half of the EU countries. This means that our integration with the EU has gone much further than everyone is currently assessing,” Arestovich said. This was a reference to Polish President Andrzej Duda’s announcement on Tuesday that the group had created a special “participatory partnership” status for Ukraine. Created by Poland and Croatia in 2016 to span the area between the Baltic, Black and Adriatic seas, Trimarium has since expanded to Austria, Hungary, Czechia, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Slovenia. Its membership does not quite number half that of the EU, which has 27 member states. Arestovich plowed on, however, telling Feygin that Ukraine is a “de facto member” of NATO. It may not have the mutual defense pledge of Article 5 in writing, but more than 50 countries in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, led by the US, have promised Ukraine’s Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov they would “never, ever” let Kiev lose the war, Arestovich insisted. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin “put the cherry on top of the cake,” Arestovich added, by saying there should be “no doubt that we will lead Ukraine to victory.” Zelensky’s chief public relations adviser has been a frequent presence on Ukrainian TV and livestreams, sometimes revealing sensitive information before it could be officially confirmed – such as the loss of the Donbass town of Liman last month – while on other occasions going off on profanity-laced tirades against Henry Kissinger and others in the West who urged Ukraine to make peace with Moscow. Earlier this week, Arestovich told another interviewer that he regarded LGBTQ individuals as “people with deviations,” prompting the Western-backed NGO KyivPride to demand his resignation from Zelensky."
2022-06-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/557589-azov-battalion-documented-crimes/,Not worth your sympathy: The story of Ukraine's neo-Nazi Azov battalion,"Ukrainian propaganda has elevated the Azov Battalion’s protracted but ultimately doomed final stand, in Mariupol, to heroic proportions. Adding further pathos to this sentimental story were the desperate calls for help from the commanders of the units entrapped in the bowels of the Azovstal factory and the photogenic young wives of the besieged fighters pleading with Pope Francis at the Vatican. Yet, an observant eye could also wonder about the abundance of Nazi tattoos adorning the battalion’s POWs. The fighters of the Donetsk militia even came up with a joke about capturing “large numbers of pirates and electricians” in reference to the numerous individuals with the skull and crossbones and SS bolts – the widely recognizable Totenkopf and Schutzstaffel symbols – emblazoned on their skin. Western media has been bending over backwards trying to explain how people covered in Nazi tattoos are not neo-Nazis. However, it turns out that sporting symbols related to Adolf Hitler's odious Third Reich is not even close to being the worst of the crimes committed by the Azov. The battalion’s history pre-dates the current conflict in Ukraine. Between 2005 and 2010, the governor of the Kharkov Region, the major industrial hub of northeastern Ukraine, was Arsen Avakov. During Avakov’s tenure in office, nationalist Andrey Biletsky, known as the White Ruler, became very active in the area. The two were close acquaintances during Biletsky’s university years. In 2005, he founded an ultranationalist organization, The Patriot of Ukraine, which mostly consisted of aggressive football fans and low-level criminals of the street fighter variety. According to media reports, the movement didn’t bother doing much that was patriotic but preferred involving itself in various semi-legal and shadowy activities. Biletsky ended up doing some jail time, though not for political reasons, but rather for plain and simple hooliganism. After the 2014 Western-backed Maidan coup in Kiev, Biletsky was set free as a ‘political’ prisoner of the fallen Viktor Yanukovich government. He used his connection to Avakov, who by then had become Ukraine’s new minister of the interior, to set up a territorial defense battalion to fight in the east of the country. This became known as the Azov. In Eastern Ukraine, the protests of locals in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions against the Maidan movement escalated to an armed rebellion, and Biletsky’s newly formed battalion was tasked with suppressing it. Unlike many other territorial defense volunteer units, the Azov had a very distinct ideological flavor from the very start. It was a far-right organization that welcomed all sorts of neo-Nazis ranging from mild to radical ones. The Azov fighters were known for their obsession with pagan rituals and were considered freaks by regular military units. That, however, was what made the battalion a good fit for the task. Being fanatics, these people did not shy away from killing. Before the Donbass militia was established, the Azov carried out killings of a number of pro-Russian activists. These acts of individual terror had a philosophy behind them. “It will suffice to kill about fifty ‘vatniks’ {a pejorative term used for those with pro-Russian sympathies} in every town to put a stop to all this,” as one of the fighters with the battalion put it. On June 13, 2014, Azov put this motto into practice by defeating, as part of a larger combat group, a small unit of the Donbass people’s militia in Mariupol. The Azov Battalion was able to put forward quite a few combat-ready soldiers and several gun trucks, while the militia in Mariupol was weak and poorly armed. Five insurgents were killed. The Azov and Ukrainian security services did not hesitate to open fire on local civilians in the Mariupol standoff. There is a video showing the Ukrainians wounding and killing several unarmed people by gunfire. One of the victims is ‘armed’ with a plastic chair. However, because it was not part of the army – at least formally – the Azov Battalion rarely engaged in actual combat operations. In the summer of 2014, a small group of its fighters attacked the town of Ilovaisk, and in the winter of 2015 they launched an assault on Shirokino, a village located on the Azov Sea coast, where they interacted with officers from the Ukrainian Army who later recounted that the battalion had left the impression of an undisciplined unit, one that was hard to deal with. So, until 2022, Azov had no serious combat record of which it could boast. However, being stalwart followers of Ukrainian nationalist ideology, fighters of the Azov – which was by then transformed into a regiment – later played a significant role in the conflict with Russia. Meanwhile, a full-fledged nationalist movement featuring an array of diverse groups of nationalists had sprung up around Azov. Biletsky ended up eventually stepping down as commander and worked to integrate the regiment into Ukraine’s National Guard, while keeping the ideological slant of the unit. This ended up being confirmed by the large number of Nazi symbols and paraphernalia found on the captured fighters and in the regiment’s barracks seized during combat. The evidence of the Azov's true nature, however, is much more visible in the reports by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, not to mention the crime news. Right from the start, Azov was often found in the midst of some of the darkest and grimmest events and news stories in Ukraine, because of its unofficial special status and the status of ‘vatniks’ who were de facto outlawed in Ukraine. Initially, the unit attracted people of vague and dubious backgrounds. For example, it was in this battalion that the killers of pro-Russian activists Aleksey Sharov and Artyom Zhudov served. The two men were shot dead in street clashes in Kharkov on March 14, 2014 – even before the armed conflict broke out in the Donbass. Their killers were never identified – we don’t know their names, but we know that the activists were shot from the office of The Patriot of Ukraine, while they were standing right in front of it. The UN reports said that in May 2014, after a short skirmish, a civilian named Vladimir Lobach was murdered near the city of Poltava by Azov Battalion fighters. His killers threatened the police officers who arrived at the crime scene and then simply fled. In June of that year, Azov soldiers in Mariupol abducted a local newspaper editor and journalist named Sergey Dolgov, who sympathized with the idea of federalizing Ukraine. Nothing is known about this man’s whereabouts up to this day. Arguably Azov's most twisted crime, as reported by the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, was the gang rape of a mentally ill man by about 10 members of the battalion in 2014. The victim was hospitalized with severe physical and psychological trauma. The incident wasn't investigated, and the perpetrators were never brought to justice. The Azov Battalion has a long record of crimes and offenses of all kinds, from harassment of homosexuals and cases of looting in a war zone, to torture and murder. According to the testimonies of victims, the most common scenario usually involved a random person being kidnapped and taken to a location belonging to the regiment. There, the victim would be tortured and forced to confess to being a member of an insurgent group. After that, the person would be handed over to the SBU, Ukraine’s security service. Moreover, according to victims' reports, SBU officers were often present at the torture sessions. For example, in May 2017 in Mariupol, Azov fighters used torture and threats to force a woman to sign an interrogation protocol they had written about her alleged involvement in an insurgent cell. The confession was filmed on camera, and the woman was forcibly stripped naked. Later, she was handed over to the SBU. In another case, a man reported having been subjected to electric shock torture, with wires attached to his genitals. In the Zaporozhye Region, Azov fighters abducted a woman, had her hands and feet bound with cable ties, kicked her, hit her with rifle stocks, shoved needles under her fingernails and threatened to rape her. A man detained in late January 2015 reported being tortured by oxygen deprivation and electric shocks. After an entire week of this ordeal, he was handed over to the SBU and 'formally' arrested. The UN has published records of numerous similar incidents, but it's safe to say these records amount to only a portion of what actually took place. This peculiar connection between the neo-Nazis and the SBU is far from a coincidence. Thanks to the Azov Battalion, the Ukrainian security services found the perfect way of proving to their government that they had been successful in dealing with the pro-Russian 'insurgent cells' in Mariupol and Eastern Ukraine – even if such organizations were not actually there. Most of the real insurgents and their sympathizers had fled to the territories held by the rebels, or at least kept their mouths shut about their allegiances. Yet, somehow, the nationalist regiment was always able to capture the proper number of 'traitors', so that their performance, on paper, looked good. Even as the bulk of the Azov Battalion’s forces have been defeated and have surrendered in Mariupol, a significant group of nationalists remains at large. For example, the Kraken unit, which was formed in Kharkov, serves as a special forces unit under the Azov Battalion. In recent months, the fighters of this newly formed regiment have already gained infamy for shooting Russian prisoners of war in their legs and filming it on camera. In short, the Azov Battalion is, despite all the Western and Ukrainian efforts to portray them as heroic defenders of freedom, the most odious group to have operated in the country since 2014."
2022-06-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/557636-anthrax-patient-stavropol-vaccination/,Anthrax in southern Russia: What we know so far,"A woman in the Stavropol region of southern Russia has been diagnosed with the dangerous bacterial infection anthrax, local authorities said on Tuesday. Local governor Vladimir Vladimirov took to Telegram to announce that he had received “information that required utmost attention” about a resident of the village of Rozhdestvenskaya having contracted anthrax. The female patient was in a satisfactory condition, with medics looking after her. The woman’s life was not in danger, he added. Anthrax is a serious infectious disease, caused by the Bacillus anthracis bacteria, which is sometimes found in rural areas and most commonly affects livestock. Humans may catch it from animals, typically from infected carcasses, as well as from wool, hair, and hides. The disease can occur in the skin, lungs, and intestines. Respiratory anthrax is the most dangerous and has a mortality rate of from 50% to 80% even with treatment, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the most common is the skin form of the disease, which is lethal in less than 24% of cases without treatment. The illness often begins with flu-like symptoms, which can then develop into serious respiratory problems. Hundreds of thousands of people died of anthrax before the 20th century, but the number of cases has been reduced greatly due to the use of antibiotics to treat patients and the vaccination of animals. Some countries have developed anthrax as a biological weapon. According to Russian officials, the disease was among the pathogens studied at secret US-funded biolabs in Ukraine, which were uncovered during Moscow’s military operation. The Russian media tracked down the anthrax patient, identifying her only as Siyadat, aged 50. She reportedly became infected while butchering a bull calf. The woman initially didn’t pay attention to a small lesion that appeared on her finger, but it kept growing and became painful. Siyadat sought medical attention and was diagnosed with anthrax. She has been placed in an infectious disease hospital and is now being treated with antibiotics, according to reports. “I had an abscess. Blood collected under the skin, and then my finger became dark. Doctors diagnosed [me with anthrax]. I have no rash or anything else. It’s all fine. I’m a healthy 105-kilogram woman,” the patient told Life website. Siyadat has also revealed that she a had a similar problem some eight years ago but recovered on her own without medical help. The Stavropol Anti-Plague Research Institute, which is overseen by Russia’s consumer watchdog Rospotrbnadzor, assured the public, on Wednesday, that “there were no grounds for the disease to spread.” The measures aimed at localizing and eradicating the anthrax hotspot have been carried out in full, it said. The large-scale vaccination of livestock is underway in Rozhdestvenskaya, according to the media. Siyadat’s relatives were placed under medical supervision despite none of them becoming infected. Cases of human-to-human transition of anthrax are generally very rare. The residents of the village have been told to pay extra attention to hygiene and wash their hands often. The local health ministry’s chief infectious diseases consultant Larisa Tkachenko reminded that cases of anthrax were last registered in Stavropol in 2019. But there were no fatalities caused by the disease in the region for at least a decade, she added."
2022-06-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/557638-moscow-renames-us-embassy-square/,US embassy in Moscow gets a new address,"The US embassy’s address in Moscow has been altered, with the plaza outside the diplomatic mission now bearing the name “Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) Square,” Moscow authorities have announced. The DPR is officially recognized as independent by Russia, but still considered to be part of Ukraine by the US and most other nations. A statement informing Muscovites of the change was published on Mayor Sergey Sobyanin’s official website Mos.ru on Wednesday. In it, Moscow authorities also clarified that the embassy’s previous address had been “nullified.” According to the document, the new name of the square along with several alternatives had been put to a vote via the online platform, Active Citizen. A total of 278,684 Moscow residents took part, the statement said. The Donetsk People’s Republic Square option garnered the support of 45% of the voters. The proposal calling for the square to be renamed had originally been floated by members of Moscow’s parliament, soon after Russia launched its offensive against Ukraine, the city authorities revealed. The possible names had been suggested by the public. Deputy chair of the Russian parliament’s lower house, Petr Tolstoy, was present at the site while workers replaced the street sign. “This is a symbolic gesture celebrating the DPR residents’ struggle,” the politician told journalists. In the near future, another square or street in Moscow will also be renamed in honor of the Lugansk People’s Republic. Both Donbass republics declared independence back in 2014 following the Maidan coup in Kiev. These two predominantly Russian-speaking regions expressed concern that the new Ukrainian government, which included known nationalists, would trample on linguistic minorities and force them to speak Ukrainian. Both Lugansk and Donetsk refused to recognize the legitimacy of the new authorities. To quell the separatist movement, Kiev deployed heavily armed police, security forces and eventually the country’s military to Donbass. The separatists, in turn, seized weapons from local military and law enforcement stockpiles. The Ukrainian government launched what it called an “anti-terrorist operation,” using artillery and fighter jets. This resulted in a bloody conflict spanning eight years, which the German- and French-brokered Minks agreements sought to resolve without success. The two republics became de facto independent. During the first two months of 2022, authorities in both the DPR and LPR reported increased Ukrainian shelling. Eventually, both republics declared a mass evacuation of civilian residents to Russia, claiming that Ukraine was poised to retake the regions by force. Days later, the leader of the DPR and LPR asked Russia to officially recognize them. Both chambers of the Russian parliament adopted a bill calling on President Vladimir Putin to do so. On February 21, the Russian head of state signed off on the recognition documents. Moscow is not the first city to name or rename a square or street outside a foreign power’s embassy in a symbolic manner. Back in February 2018, Washington authorities named the square outside the Russian embassy after slain Russian opposition politician, Boris Nemtsov. The ceremony was attended by several members of US Congress, State Department staffers, as well as city authorities. It was the Washington City Council that had made the decision, which it said symbolized the city’s dedication to democracy. A prominent critic of the Russian government and President Putin personally, Nemtsov was fatally shot just outside the Kremlin on February 27, 2015. Russian law enforcement later apprehended the hitmen involved in the crime, who were sentenced to lengthy prison terms. However, the people who had placed the hit on Nemtsov have not been identified to date."
2022-06-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/557626-lithuania-president-kaliningrad-blockade/,Lithuania ready to expand Kaliningrad blockade – president,"Vilnius is ready to expand the list of goods banned from transit to Russia’s exclave of Kaliningrad should the European Union introduce new sanctions against Moscow, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said on Wednesday. The country is also ready to face any potential retaliatory measures Russia might introduce, he told Reuters in an interview. “We are ready and we are prepared for unfriendly actions from Russia, such as disconnection from the BRELL [power grid] system, or others,” Nauseda said. The president stressed that the transit restrictions were not a sovereign move by Lithuania, but merely the implementation of the EU sanctions against Moscow introduced over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. “We feel the support of the European Union, because this is a decision made by the European Union,” he said, adding that the country was ready to expand the list of banned goods should the bloc introduce new restrictions against Russia. “We are looking forward to implementing the next stages of the sanctions, and it would be very good if the European Commission explains their content to the Russian authorities. It could remove some of the current tensions, which are not in the interest of either the European Union or Russia,” Nauseda stated. Over the weekend, Lithuania’s national railway operator banned the flow of sanctioned goods between the region and the rest of Russia, citing guidelines from the European Commission. The restrictions have also affected road traffic into the exclave, according to Kaliningrad officials. Both Vilnius and the EU insist that the restrictions do not amount to a “blockade” of the exclave. Moscow, however, has unequivocally branded Vilnius’ move as an “economic blockade” of Kaliningrad Region, stating that it violated the country’s international obligations to ensure the uninterrupted transit of goods to the exclave. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Vilnius’ decision was “unprecedented” and in “violation of anything and everything.” The head of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolay Patrushev, warned that the “blockade” might invoke a response from Moscow that would “have a serious negative impact on the people of Lithuania.” “Of course, Russia will respond to hostile actions. Appropriate measures are in the works, and will be adopted in the near future,” Patrushev told reporters during a visit to Kaliningrad on Tuesday."

One person suffered moderate injuries as a result of the incident, local health officials said. Officials in the area, which lies to the northeast of Moscow, have assured that the deadly incident was isolated and did not pose a threat to local communities, so they are not planning on evacuating any villages. The military said the deaths were caused by the accidental detonation of munition during the loading process, without offering further details. The village of Barsovo is located some six kilometers southwest from the city of Kirzhach. The military base, the main purpose of which is the storage of artillery shells and rockets, is right next to the small community."
2022-06-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/557629-ukraine-victory-propaganda-west-split/,"Glenn Diesen: As propaganda about a Ukrainian ‘victory’ retreats, is a split emerging in the West?","During the Russian Civil War, the journalist Walter Lippman observed the dilemma of propaganda – it had the positive effect of mobilizing the public for conflict, but the negative outcome of obstructing a workable peace agreement. The British had drummed up public support for intervention in the conflict by reporting on Polish victories, fleeing communists, and the pending collapse of the Bolsheviks. In reality, the opposite was happening. Lippman argued that because the UK public had been promised victory, there was no political appetite for a reaching a diplomatic settlement. A century later, little has changed. Public support for supplying billions of dollars’ worth of weaponry and draconian sanctions was premised on the constructed narrative of a pending Russian defeat in Ukraine. Support for Kiev has been expressed by pushing stories of victories, while any admission of weakness could be ostracized as a hostile denigration of Ukraine’s sacrifices. However, two things can be true at the same time: On one hand, Kiev’s forces were well-trained, well-equipped and fought better than anyone had expected. On the other hand, the power of the Russian military is overwhelming and superior to the extent it hasn’t even had to mobilize its army. Reality is now catching up with the narrative. Russia has been making steady advancements and the sanctions have backfired terribly. With the situation becoming increasingly unfavorable to Ukraine and NATO, there are growing incentives for seeking a settlement with Russia. However, how can the narrative of a forthcoming victory be changed, and can the US-led bloc maintain its solidarity under a new narrative of defeat? NATO and Russia have been fighting proxy conflicts since the abandonment of agreements on a pan-European security architecture based on “indivisible security” in a Europe “without dividing lines.” Ukraine has become the latest victim in the subsequent struggle about where to draw the new boundaries. NATO has presented its own role in the conflict as merely being support for Ukraine. The consensus was that the Ukrainian sacrifices and Western economic pain would be the necessary cost for victory. However, what happens when it is accepted that Russia is winning? Is it “support” for Ukraine if extending the conflict will only result in more Ukrainian casualities, loss of more territory, and the possible destruction of the Ukrainian state? Backing for Ukraine could be expressed as NATO offering something at the negotiation table to reduce the costs for Kiev. It is conceivable that NATO could extract significant concessions from Moscow if Russia were offered what it has sought for the past three decades – security guarantees that include the end of NATO expansionism and withdrawal of American weapon systems from its borders. However, supporting Ukraine in such a manner would dent the narrative of NATO’s infallibility and being solely a “force for good.” The sudden shift from a victory to a defeat narrative demands that someone takes the blame for losing the war. Reminiscent of Biden blaming Afghanistan’s political leaders and its military for the situation in that country, the American leader has now begun blaming Ukraine for not heeding American warnings about the pending Russian attack. In return, Kiev is using increasingly strong language to condemn its Western partners for failing to supply enough weapons. A case in point is how the Ukrainian ambassador to Berlin even called German Chancellor Olaf Scholz a “sulky liver sausage.” In the US there has been criticism of France for its diplomacy with Russia and accusations that Germany did not supply enough weapons, while in Europe there is now more questions about the uncompromising and confrontational stance of the US prior to Russia’s intervention. A new narrative also needs to reflect new objectives. Victory over Russia was a unifying objective within NATO. It was always unclear what a victory meant. For example, did it include the conquest of Crimea? Would it entail more American weapon systems even closer to a nervous and humiliated Russia, armed with nuclear weapons? Would it be in the interest of the West to have a weakened Russia with excessive reliance on China? However, strategic ambiguity about what “victory” entailed has prevented splits within the military bloc. In defeat, the competing national interests are more difficult to contain and unity subsequently fragments. The US has certain interests in a protracted war, which could turn Ukraine into an Afghanistan for the Russians. The war has already delivered certain benefits for the US such as an energy and economic split between the EU and Russia, ensuring bloc discipline from the Western Europeans, cementing Ukraine’s position as a bulwark against Russia, and weakening Moscow. Some are therefore arguing in favor of supplying more weapons and rejecting diplomacy. For example, US Representative Dan Crenshaw supported the opportunity of fighting Russia with Ukrainian lives: “Investing in the destruction of our adversary’s military without losing a single American troop strikes me as a good idea.” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken framed the proxy war in more benevolent terms by suggesting that the US was arming Ukraine to ensure Kiev would be in “the strongest possible position at any negotiating table that may emerge.” Chas Freeman, a former US ambassador and assistant secretary of defense, criticized this US position as a cynical “fight to the last Ukrainian.” In contrast, the Western Europeans have more security risks from making Ukraine an Afghanistan on their continent. Furthermore, the sanctions are turning out to be more devastating to EU members than the Russians. Inflation and economic decline are ravaging Western European economies, and Russia redirecting its cheap energy and metals to Asia is a death sentence to the competitiveness of their industries. Washington’s attempts to extend this ideological conflict to China as a “supporter of Russia” will also make the Western Europeans more reliant on the US and cancel any hopes for “EU sovereignty.” The leaders of Germany, France and Italy therefore visited Kiev to push for the start of peace negotiations with Russia. Yet, the EU leaders have rhetorically committed themselves to supporting Ukraine by supplying more weapons. While, on one hand, the promise of future EU membership is used as an incentive for a settlement, on the other hand the bloc continues to supply the weapons that enables the war to be extended. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson then made a surprise visit to Kiev, the following day, to counteract the peace initiative with the promise of continued fighting as the UK “will be with you until you ultimately prevail.” Are new narratives emerging that reflect a split between German, French and Italian “surrender monkeys” on one side, versus the American, British and Polish “war hawks” on the other?"
2022-06-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/557614-nikolaev-plant-russian-strike/,Russia claims strike killed hundreds of Ukrainian troops,"Russian strikes on a shipbuilding plant in the Ukrainian port of Nikolaev have killed as many as 500 troops, Moscow's defense ministry claimed during a daily press briefing on Wednesday. The soldiers – who belonged to the Ukrainian Army’s 59th Mechanized Brigade – are believed to have been taking cover at the Okean Shipyard. The facility is located in the southern part of the Ukrainian city which stands on a major river some 60 kilometers inland from the Black Sea. The ministry said the Russian Air Force had used precision weapons to strike the plant’s workshops, in Tuesday's attack, killing Ukrainian service members and destroying weapons and military vehicles. Ukrainian sources reported several Russian cruise-missile strikes targeting Nikolaev on Tuesday. These caused damage to port infrastructure, to industrial buildings and to the power grid, and destroyed some trucks, the Ukrainian military said. In the briefing, Russia also claimed to have routed the 57th Motorized Infantry Brigade. The report claimed that the Ukrainian unit lost over 60% of its strength during fighting for territory claimed by the Moscow-allied Lugansk People’s Republic. The brigade fled from its positions in violation of the order from its command to stand its ground, the Russian military said. Last week, the Russian military claimed to have killed scores of Ukrainian officers after striking a compound where a meeting of commanders of several Ukrainian units was taking place. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/557608-us-comments-kaliningrad-blockade/,US comments on blockade of Russian exclave,"The US says that it “appreciates” anti-Russian sanctions imposed by EU nations and that its military is committed to the defense of Lithuania, after the country banned some Russian goods from passing through its territory to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Ned Price, the spokesman for the US state department, dismissed Moscow’s displeasure with the Lithuanian blockade of its territory as “saber-rattling” and “bluster.” Speaking at a daily briefing, he said he didn’t want to “give it additional time.” “We, of course, appreciate the unprecedented economic measures that many countries around the world… including in this case Lithuania, have joined us in taking against Russia for its unprovoked war in Ukraine,” he said. Price said that the US would protect Lithuania from any military attack, as is due under its NATO obligations. “Lithuania has been a stalwart partner in this. We stand by NATO. We stand by our NATO Allies, and we stand by Lithuania,” he said. The row between Russia and its Baltic neighbor erupted last week after Lithuania started blocking the transit of goods between mainland Russia and Kaliningrad region. The partial restrictions came into force last Saturday, with Vilnius claiming it was a natural part of enforcing EU sanctions against Russian trade. Roughly half of the traffic is estimated to be affected. The banned items include coal, metals, and construction materials. Moscow said the restrictions were crossing every line and warned that there would be serious consequences for what it described as a Lithuanian blockade of its exclave. The decision clearly violated international law, the Russian government noted. Some experts suggested that it could even amount to a casus belli – a cause to start a war over. Kaliningrad region is sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania and has access to the Baltic Sea, which technically allows Russia to ferry goods to it. The relatively small exclave also hosts a significant number of Russian troops and weapon systems, making it a key component in the country’s national security."
2022-06-22,https://www.rt.com/news/557598-drone-oil-refinery-rostov/,Fire at Russian oil refinery after Ukrainian attack (VIDEO),"A fire broke out at an oil refinery in southern Russia’s Rostov Region on Wednesday after it was hit by a Ukrainian drone. The blaze occurred at the Novoshakhtinsky oil refinery, affecting an area of around 50 square meters, and was quickly put out, the emergency services said. There were no injuries or fatalities, they added. The Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery has issued a statement, saying it had been the subject of “terrorist activities from the western side of the border of Rostov Region” where Ukraine is located. “A strike by two unmanned aerial vehicles has been carried out against the technological installations” of the oil refinery, the company said. The first drone attack took place at 8:40am local time, with the aircraft striking the technological equipment of an oil refining unit. It caused the release of hydrocarbon gas, with a subsequent explosion and fire. The second strike followed around 40 minutes later. However, the drone missed the oil tanks that had been targeted. There was no explosion as it hit the ground, but some equipment was still damaged by debris from the UAV, according to the company. Unconfirmed footage uploaded on social media captured a UAV approaching the oil facility and smashing into it at full speed. The impact led to a large explosion, with the blaze starting immediately. The quality of footage is low, making it difficult to confirm the type of aircraft. The refinery is located some 10km from the border with the People’s Republic of Lugansk. Ukraine’s military has carried out numerous attacks within southern Russia, mainly in the Belgorod and Bryansk Regions, since Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February. The strikes, targeting infrastructure including oil facilities and also residential areas, have resulted in destruction, injuries, and several civilian deaths."
2022-06-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/557581-lithuania-kaliningrad-traffic-blockade/,Lithuania expands Kaliningrad blockade,"The restrictions imposed on the transit of freight to the Kaliningrad Region by Lithuania have already affected road traffic, officials of the Russian exclave said on Tuesday. “The partial restriction of freight transit also applies to road vehicles passing through Lithuania. Like [goods transported by] rail, these goods can now only be transported by sea,” the press service of the regional government has said. Vilnius began implementing the restrictions on Saturday, when Lithuania’s national railway operator banned the flow of sanctioned materials between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia, citing guidelines from the European Commission. Both Vilnius and the EU have insisted that the restrictions, expected to affect roughly 50% of cargo flow between the exclave and the rest of Russia, do not amount to a “blockade” but merely come as an implementation of anti-Russian sanctions imposed by the bloc over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. “We’re not talking about the Commission giving a recommendation to a country. This is a member state implementing decisions that they have taken when it comes to the sanctions against Russia. And Lithuania is basically doing what it is supposed to do under the sanctions regime,” European Commission chief spokesman Eric Mamer said earlier in the day. The Russian government has blasted Vilnius’ move as an “economic blockade,” with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov calling the decision unprecedented, and in “violation of anything and everything.” The head of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolay Patrushev, vowed there would be a response to the ongoing “blockade,” stating that unspecified actions to be taken by Moscow would “have a serious negative impact on the people of Lithuania.” “Of course, Russia will respond to hostile actions. Appropriate measures are in the works, and will be adopted in the near future,” Patrushev told reporters amid a visit to Kaliningrad on Tuesday."
2022-06-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/557583-uk-nationals-death-ukraine-ambassador/,Russia condemns ‘arrogant’ note from London,"Russian ambassador to the UK Andrey Kelin has condemned a note sent by London to the Kremlin regarding two British nationals recently sentenced to death by a Donetsk People’s Republic court. The “arrogant” message makes Moscow’s cooperation unlikely, Kelin added. Sean Pinner and Aiden Aslin, as well as Moroccan Saaudun Brahim, were sentenced to death by authorities in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) earlier this month. The three had been captured while fighting for Ukraine and were convicted of terror offences and of attempting to overthrow the government of the republic. Both Russia and the DPR insist that the men were fighting as mercenaries and are therefore not lawful combatants. Pinner and Aslin claim they were active members of the Ukrainian military. Speaking to the Rossiya 24 TV channel on Tuesday, Kelin confirmed that UK officials have been in touch with the Kremlin about the two British combatants. ""They sent a note written in extremely arrogant, instructive terms. It does not make us want to cooperate on these issues,"" Kelin stated. Britain does not recognize the independence of the DPR, hence the note being sent to Moscow. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has called Pinner and Aslin’s conviction a “sham judgment with absolutely no legitimacy,” and in her official response to the sentence referred to the DPR authorities as “Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine.” Moscow has previously told London to communicate directly with the DPR, instead of “trying to solve problems with loud statements,” according to Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. Along with the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR), the DPR declared independence from Ukraine in 2014. Russia recognized the two republics’ independence in February, days before launching its military operation in Ukraine, which the Kremlin insists was necessary to put an end to Kiev’s eight-year legal, cultural and military persecution of the two breakaway states. Under DPR law, Aslin and Pinner may appeal their death sentence or plead for clemency. Should they fail in either endeavor, they will be executed by firing squad."
2022-06-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/557578-g20-health-ukraine-indonesia/,Russia tells West to stop mixing politics and health,"Russia has asked other members of the G20 to keep politics out of a global meeting on health issues, after envoys from the US and several of its allies brought up the conflict in Ukraine at the session in Indonesia on Monday. American, British, Australian and Canadian officials had used the meeting of G20 health officials in Yogyakarta to accuse Russia of bombing hospitals in Ukraine. “Far from promoting global health, Russia has disrupted health services, destroyed health facilities, and continues to strike buildings where innocent civilians including children are sheltering,” claimed Andrea Palm, US deputy secretary of Health and Human Services, accusing Moscow of being “directly at odds with the goals of G20 healthcare and our goal of promoting global health.” “We are asking our colleagues not to politicize [the] G20 health platform and stay within our mandate and discuss healthcare,” Russian health ministry spokesman Oleg Salagay responded. Moscow has repeatedly denied Ukrainian and Western accusations that it has targeted hospitals, providing evidence that Kiev’s armed forces have been using civilians as human shields and deliberately shelling hospitals and civilian objects in Donbass. Salagay also criticized the plan to set up a slush fund for pandemic preparedness, saying it amounted to duplicating and weakening the role of the World Health Organization (WHO). “The creation of the so-called Financial Intermediary Fund carries certain risks,” the official said. “It is important to prevent duplication of existing international institutions and fragmentation of financial resources, as well as the weakening of the coordinating role of the WHO.” On Tuesday, Indonesian Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin announced the establishment of the $1.2 billion fund, drawn primarily from the US, EU, Germany, Singapore, Indonesia and private companies. The funds are intended to go to poor countries so they can buy vaccines, tests, medications and other materials necessary to deal with Covid-19 and future pandemics. The health meeting was held in advance of the G20 summit, scheduled for October 2022. The group is made up of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, France, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the UK, the US, as well as the EU."
2022-06-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/557572-kremlin-researcher-fake-news/,US lobby-group's ‘Kremlin researcher’ falls victim to satire,"A top lobbyist with the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) pressure group has fallen for a piece by the Russian satirical website Panorama. Olga Lautman, who describes herself as a “Kremlin-focused” analyst and researcher, has a large following on social media, whom she regales with tales of allegedly nefarious Russian activity. CEPA's purpose is to promote greater American influence in eastern Europe. To that end, it's bankrolled by NATO, Western arms manufacturers and the US government. Panorama published a short piece on its social media on Monday, claiming that Russia’s leading TV Channel One aired a large feature on supposed “rampaging fascist gangs in Kazakhstan.” “The militants profess the ideas of neo-Nazism and the genocide of the non-indigenous population, support the ban on the Russian language, the Bologna process and the satanist group BTS,” the original message read. This piece of ‘news’ was illustrated by an old photo, taken in the early 2010s and featuring members of the Mongolian neo-Nazi group Tsagaan Khas (meaning White Swastika). Panorama’s message spread on social media, with some users picking it up as a legit piece of news. The satirical shortie ultimately made it to Lautman – who boasts a vast army of over 260,000 subscribers – when she re-tweeted a message based on Panorama’s piece of ‘news’ and provided some in-depth ‘analysis’ of her own to the news that never happened. “Russia’s Channel One aired a 30-minute special on fascist gangs in Kazakhstan. This after [Kazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart] Tokayev insulted [Russian President Vladimir] Putin by not agreeing with his propaganda. Russia should really focus on their domestic Nazi groups and the Russian Nazi paramilitaries fighting in Ukraine,” Lautman asserted. – А вы точно Eastern Europe analyst, Kremlin researcher и вот это всё?– Ask! pic.twitter.com/mOH0ysM5LC While Lautman apparently promptly realized her mistake, quietly deleting the offending tweet, the expert’s failure did not escape Panorama. The satirical outlet did not miss the opportunity to mock her, questioning her level of expertise in the Kremlin and Eastern European affairs."
2022-06-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/557570-russia-never-trust-west/,Russia will never trust the West again – Kremlin,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told NBC News on Monday that Russia would “never trust [the] West again.” Amid a historic low-point in relations, Peskov is not the only top Russian official who has ruled out a swift return to normal. Telling NBC that the fallout over the Ukraine conflict would “be a long crisis,” Peskov predicted that the situation would remain icy going forward. During the hour-long interview, of which NBC has only released short excerpts, Peskov also stated that two American citizens captured, while fighting for Ukraine, in the Donbass are considered by Moscow to be “soldiers of fortune,” and will have their fates decided by “a court decision.” Earlier this month, a court in Donetsk found three foreign fighters – two British nationals and a Moroccan – guilty of attempting to seize power by force, and sentenced them to death. They have appealed the verdict. Peskov is not the first Russian official to dismiss a return to normal diplomacy with the West. Dmitry Medvedev, a former president and current deputy chair of the National Security Council, declared on Monday that Moscow should not push for the extension of a nuclear arms reduction treaty with Washington, saying that American officials “toss only sleaze our way.” “We don’t have any relationship with the US at the moment. They are at zero degrees Kelvin. And we should not unfreeze them for now,” Medvedev wrote on social media. “Let them come or crawl and beg for it. And they should value it as an act of utmost generosity.” Following the launch of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine in late February, Western countries have funneled tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Kiev, while targeting Russia with unprecedented economic sanctions, at considerable cost to their own economies. Amid the mutual expulsion of diplomats and suspension of travel links between Russia and the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared last week that the world order has been fundamentally changed, with the old, US-dominated system never to return. “It is a mistake to suggest that the times of turbulent changes can be waited out and that things will return to normal; that everything will be as it was. It won’t,” he said during a speech at the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum."
2022-06-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/557560-russian-rigs-defense-ministry/,Moscow reacts to Ukrainian attacks on gas rigs,"Ukraine used a Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 strike drone and anti-ship missiles to attack Russian offshore gas rigs in the Black Sea on Monday, Moscow has claimed. The attacks against non-military infrastructure, which left three people injured and seven missing, were done out of spite over a failed assault on Snake Island earlier in the day, the defense ministry insisted. According to the Russian report, Ukrainian forces launched a “new crazy attempt” to recapture the island from Russia early on Monday morning. Kiev deployed over 15 UAVs, Tochka-U tactical ballistic missiles, Uragan rocket artillery, and US-provided M777 howitzers to set the stage for an amphibious assault, the report said. Ukrainian S-300 anti-aircraft systems provided additional support for the operation, Moscow said. Russian air defenses protecting Snake Island thwarted Ukrainian plans by destroying 13 drones, four missiles, and 21 rocket artillery projectiles, the defense ministry said. Ukraine canceled the amphibious assault as a result, it claimed. “After confirming that the attempt to capture the island failed, the Kiev regime launched another gamble by targeting the objects of the Russian gas extraction infrastructure in the northwestern part of the Black Sea,” the military said. Two offshore gas rigs were attacked by anti ship missiles and a Bayraktar TB-2 drone. A fire broke out on one of them. On Monday, Russian officials reported evacuating dozens of civilian workers from offshore rigs operated by Crimea-based state-owned firm Chernomorneftegaz. It was done in response to what they called a Ukrainian attack, which left three people injured and seven missing. The Russian military said on Tuesday that it had retaliated against Ukrainian forces involved in Monday’s operation. The reported targets included “hangars with Ukrainian Bayraktar TB-2 UAVs” and M777 guns stationed on Kubansky Island, which constitutes part of a natural resort in the delta of the Danube River on the border with Romania. Snake Island, located on the border between Ukrainian and Romanian territorial waters, was captured by Russia in the first days of its attack against Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that all of the defenders of the island were killed in action, but the statement proved to be false after Russia confirmed that the Ukrainian troops laid down arms and were taken prisoner. Moscow reported another failed attempt by Kiev to assault the island in May. The Russian military described it as a “senseless PR action” and reported that Ukraine lost some 50 troops in the operation. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-21,https://www.rt.com/news/557548-russian-journalist-sells-nobel-prize/,Russian journalist sells Nobel medal for $103.5 million,"Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov auctioned off his Nobel Peace Prize gold medal for a record-shattering $103.5 million on Monday. The editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta has said he will donate all of the money to UNICEF to help Ukrainian children and families who have been displaced by the ongoing military conflict in the country. Muratov, who is the editor-in-chief and co-founder of Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, received the Nobel Peace Prize in October 2021 alongside Filipino journalist Maria Ressa for their “efforts to safeguard freedom of expression.” The journalist initially announced that he would be selling off his prize back on March 22 and finally put it up for auction through Heritage Auctions in New York City on June 20, coinciding with the international World Refugee Day. The first bid came in at $700,000 and quickly grew to $16.6 million. Sometime later an anonymous bidder put up $103.5 million for the 23-carat gold medal, and no other participant managed to match that offer. Previously, the most anybody paid for a Nobel prize medal was in 2014, when James Watson, who won a Nobel prize for discovering the structure of DNA in 1962, sold his for $4.76 million. “I was hoping that there was going to be an enormous amount of solidarity,” Muratov said after the sale. “But I was not expecting this to be such a huge amount.” When he first announced that he would be selling off his medal in order to help Ukrainian children, Muratov stated that “we thought about this for a long time with the editing team of Novaya Gazeta and we realized that there are people who have it much worse than we do. Refugees. Sick Ukrainian children. It’s much worse for them than it is for us.” He added that the decision to auction off the prize was supported by “100%” of the newspaper’s staff. Muratov has previously stated on Telegram that the sale was “an act of solidarity” with the “over 10 million Ukrainian refugees” displaced by the Russian attack, which he called “a tragedy”. Speaking on why he chose UNICEF as the recipient of the money, Muratov claimed that it was important to the Novaya Gazeta staff that the organization they chose did not belong to any one government, allowing it to work without borders. He added that he was particularly concerned about children orphaned by the conflict in Ukraine and wanted “to return their future.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov commented on Muratov's decision to contribute the money to UNICEF, which assists Ukrainian refugees across the world, including in Russia, by stating that ""any contribution to this cause, especially with regard to children, can only be welcomed."" Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, Peskov added that the number of refugees from Ukraine, particularly those who arrive on the territory of Russia, has only continued to grow and noted that many people are providing all possible assistance “with an open heart.” “It has to become a beginning of a flashmob or example to follow so people auction their valuable possessions to help Ukrainian refugees,” said Muratov in a video released by Heritage Auctions ahead of the auction. Novaya Gazeta decided to suspend its operations both online and in print on March 28 after receiving two warnings from Russian media regulators for failing to identify “foreign agent” entities as such in its articles. Under Russian law, if a publication receives two warnings from regulators it can have its license revoked. Muratov, who has openly opposed Moscow’s military offensive against Kiev, stated that the newspaper would not resume operations until “the end of the special operation on the territory of Ukraine.”"
2022-06-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/557547-putin-nuclear-missile-sarmat-deployment/,Putin gives update on newest Sarmat ICBM deployment,"Russia’s newest Sarmat nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) will be deployed in 2022, President Vladimir Putin has said. “We have successfully tested the Sarmat heavy intercontinental ballistic missile. According to the plan, the first such system will enter combat duty at the end of the year,” Putin said in an address to graduating cadets on Tuesday. The Sarmat was test-fired in April. The missile will replace the older Voyevoda systems, also known by the NATO reporting name, SS-18 Satan. Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, said in April that the Sarmat, dubbed ‘Satan 2’, is the most powerful missile of its class in terms of range and warheads. It was designed to be “invincible” to all existing air defenses, he said. Rogozin added that Sarmats are much faster than Voyevodas and “can strike targets at virtually unlimited range.” Colonel General Sergey Karakayev, the commander of Russia’s Strategic Rocket Forces, announced this month that modernization with top-notch combat-ready missiles, including the Sarmat and the Avangard hypersonic glide weapon, will reach 86% by the end of 2022."
2022-06-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/557539-putin-deployment-s-500-defense-systems/,Putin announces deployment of S-500 air defense systems,"The Russian military is in the process of deploying the S-500, the new and most potent version of the powerful air-defense system, President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday. The Russian leader made the announcement during an address to the graduates of military colleges in Moscow as he described Russia’s plans for fielding advanced weapon systems, which he said “will determine the combat capabilities of the army and the navy for years and decades to come”. Putin stated that the S-500 long-range missile system, which is designed to intercept aircraft and missiles and may have some anti-satellite capabilities, had no equal in the world. The S-500 Prometey was designed by arms manufacturer Almaz-Antey as a continuation of its family of long-range surface-to-air missiles. It is believed to have a range of 600km and is capable of intercepting targets traveling at hypersonic speeds, including the warheads of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Prometey is said to be closely integrated with other Almaz-Antey systems, such as the S-400 and the S-350, which will allow deployed batteries to have synergy with other elements of Russia’s layered air defense. Almaz-Antey head Yan Novikov said the company expected the S-500 to become the backbone of Russia's anti-air capabilities. He confirmed back in April that the system had gone into serial production."
2022-06-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/557536-russia-threatens-lithuania-serious-consequences/,Russia threatens Lithuania with ‘serious’ consequences,"Moscow’s retaliation to Lithuania’s transport “blockade” of Russia’s Kaliningrad Region will seriously affect Lithuanian citizens, Nikolay Patrushev, the head of Russia’s Security Council, has said. “Of course, Russia will respond to hostile actions. Appropriate measures are in the works, and will be adopted in the near future,” Patrushev told reporters during a trip to Kaliningrad on Tuesday. He added that the consequences of Moscow’s response will “have a serious negative impact on the people of Lithuania.” The Kaliningrad region is a small Russian exclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. On Saturday, Vilnius’ national railway operator banned the flow of sanctioned goods between the region and the rest of Russia, citing instructions from the European Commission. Moscow slammed the move as illegal under international law and summoned the Lithuanian ambassador. On Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry summoned the EU’s envoy to Russia, Markus Ederer. “We demanded that the normal functioning of the Kaliningrad transit is restored immediately,” the ministry said in a statement. Many countries, including EU members, imposed sweeping sanctions on Moscow in response to Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, which was launched in late February. Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, defended Vilnius on Monday, saying it was acting in accordance with the bloc’s sanctions mechanism. “Lithuania is not guilty, it is not implementing national sanctions,” he told reporters."
2022-06-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/557518-peskov-captured-americans-ukraine/,Kremlin comments on captured US mercenaries,"The two American citizens captured in the Donbass are “soldiers of fortune” and their fate will be decided by the courts, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told NBC News in an interview on Monday. Peskov also said that jailed WNBA star Brittney Griner cannot be considered a “hostage.” The conflict over Ukraine will affect relations between Russia and the West for a long time, Peskov explained, adding, “We will never trust [the] West anymore.” US military veterans Alexander Drueke (39) and Andy Huynh (27) went missing last week. RT confirmed on Friday that they had been captured in Donbass and were being held in a detention center somewhere in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). They are the first Americans to be captured in the course of the conflict in Ukraine, not long after a Donetsk court sentenced three foreign fighters to death for their role in the fighting. Asked about Drueke and Huynh, Peskov said their fate would “depend on the investigation.” He called them “soldiers of fortune” who were involved in “illegal activities” and fired on Russian troops, for which they should be punished. “There will be a court, and there will be a court decision,” Peskov told NBC News’ Keir Simmons. On June 9, a court in Donetsk found three foreign fighters guilty of acting as mercenaries and attempting to seize power by force. British citizens Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, as well as Moroccan national Saadun Ibrahim, were sentenced to death. The trio denied being mercenaries and are appealing the verdict. While Aslin, Pinner, and Ibrahim had been captured by DPR troops near Mariupol, Drueke and Huynh told RT they had surrendered to a Russian patrol. Both the Donbass republics and Russia have maintained that foreign fighters who came to fight for Kiev are mercenaries and therefore unlawful combatants who are not protected under the Geneva Conventions. Peskov said he had no information about Grady Kurpasi, the third American fighter recently reported missing in Ukraine. The Kremlin spokesman was also asked about Brittney Griner, the WNBA player who was arrested in Moscow on February 17 and remains in jail. Griner is not a “hostage,” he said, but is being investigated for breaking the law. Police said they found vape cartridges with hash oil in Griner’s luggage at Sheremetyevo Airport. If convicted of possession of an illegal substance, she could face up to 10 years behind bars."
2022-06-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/557513-german-leader-spheres-influence/,German leader shares his thoughts on what Putin wants,"Russian President Vladimir Putin desires a return to a 'spheres of influence' situation, but he will not succeed, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has claimed in an interview with the newspaper Munchner Merkur. Among other topics, Scholz was asked to comment on Russia’s claims that Western sanctions were preventing deliveries of Russian gas to Germany via the Nord Stream pipeline. Earlier on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the pipeline’s turbines have to undergo maintenance, but because of the sanctions “the Europeans are not returning them.” “This justification is not plausible,” Scholz responded. In another part of the interview, while insisting that neither NATO nor the European Union has represented a threat to Russia, Scholz stressed that the Russian leader “has to accept that a community of democracies and constitutional states is growing ever closer together in his neighborhood.” He wants a divided Europe and a return to a policy of spheres of influence. He won't be able to do that. The term ‘spheres of influence’ is often being used in relation to the Cold War era when the two major superpowers, the United States and Soviet Union, exerted influence over different parts of the world. Moscow has for many years been warning NATO against eastward expansion, viewing it as a direct threat to its security. The potential accession of Ukraine to the alliance was named by Russia as one of the reasons behind the launch of the special military operation in Ukraine. Moscow recently revealed that it now considers the EU “an aggressive militant player,” which is merging with NATO and “has ambitions stretching far beyond the European continent.” Scholz made it clear that Germany and its allies would continue to “hold out for as long as it takes” when it comes to supporting Ukraine and maintaining economic pressure on Russia, but without getting into direct military confrontation with Moscow. In the chancellor’s opinion, Putin “seems afraid that the spark of democracy could spread to his country” and thus has been “pursuing a policy aimed at dissolving NATO and the EU.” Responding to Scholz’s claim, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: “A couple of times German sparks spread to us. We will not allow any more fires.”"
2022-06-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/557499-kiev-explains-russian-literature-ban/,Russian literature 'too difficult' for Ukrainians – Kiev,"Kiev is set to flush Russian literature out of education programs, as it has been deemed “too difficult” and overall unfit for Ukrainian students. Ukrainian Deputy Education and Science Minister Andrey Vitrenko provided the rationale behind the move on Monday as he spoke to the Ukraine 24 TV channel. “Personally, I think that everything that somehow connects us with the Russian Empire should be thrown out. All works in which there is a mystical, some mythical power of Russian weaponry, all this should be thrown out. Everything related to, as they say, the suffering of the Russian soul should be thrown out, such difficult works for Ukrainians, in general, we don’t need them,” Vitrenko stated. Last week, a ministerial workgroup held a meeting to debate changes to the country’s school programs, the official confirmed. The changes will affect not only foreign literature, but also history and the so-called “patriotic education” as well. The workgroup has provided the ministry with its proposals and now the body is considering them, Vitrenko said, adding that a new foreign literature program was expected to be adopted ahead of the new academic year. While the exact changes to school programs have not been officially announced yet, local media outlets reported that the education ministry is set to purge a vast number of Russian authors. Alexander Pushkin, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Bulgakov and other iconic Russian authors are expected to get banned. Only Russian authors that Kiev deems to be Ukrainian are reportedly expected to be kept in the curriculum. So far, Ukrainian officials have only confirmed that the world-famous novel ‘War and Peace’ by Tolstoy, which chronicles Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812, will be dropped. Speaking to the country’s media earlier this month, Vitrenko explained that the novel glorified the Russian military, which was deemed unacceptable. “Such things will not be studied in Ukraine. Everything that glorifies the orc troops will disappear from the program of foreign literature,” Vitrenko explained, referring to Russians as “orcs,” a derogatory, dehumanizing term that originated as the name for the villain race in J.R.R. Tolkien’s fantasy novel ‘The Lord of the Rings’."
2022-06-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/557508-mercenaries-austria-ukraine-fighters/,Austria confirms citizens are fighting in Ukraine,"Austria has confirmed that a “low single-digit” number of its citizens have travelled to fight in Ukraine. Monday's revelation comes three days after the Russian military published a list of foreign mercenaries fighting on Kiev’s side. The list, which features almost 7,000 fighters, mentions five Austrian citizens. Two of them are said to have been killed, one has returned home, and two remain in Ukraine. The Austrian Interior Ministry, responding to a request from the APA news agency, confirmed that the country’s government was aware of a “low single-digit number of people who have traveled to the war zone and who are likely to actively participate in the war.” According to the ministry spokesman’s statement, officials are “monitoring the situation very closely since the outbreak of the Russian war of aggression” but cannot confirm any details about the citizens in question, “especially since disinformation is often deliberately spread in the context of armed conflicts in order to weaken or question the competence of state institutions.” According to the Russian Defense Ministry’s data, a total of 6,956 foreign citizens from 64 countries arrived in Ukraine to become pro-Kiev combatants between February 24 and June 17. Some 1,956 of those have been killed, while 1,779 have left the country, the ministry said. According to Russian figures, the largest number of fighters came from Poland, with 1,831 of its citizens joining the Ukrainian ranks. Earlier this month, Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said that hundreds of foreign mercenaries in Ukraine had been destroyed by Russian long-range precision weapons “shortly after their arrival at the places where they were undergoing additional training and where the tactical units were coordinated.” However, most of the mercenaries, according to the spokesman, were killed “due to the low level of training and the lack of real combat experience.” Konashenkov also claimed that attempts by Ukrainian officials to provide the foreign fighters with legal protection by adding them to the lists of the Armed Forces or giving them Ukrainian passports would not save them from liability. Indeed, on June 9, two British citizens, Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin, as well as Moroccan citizen Saadun Ibrahim, were sentenced to death by a court in Donetsk after they were found guilty of acting as mercenaries and attempting to seize power by force in the Donetsk People’s Republic. Kiev denies hiring mercenaries and says its foreign fighters are volunteers who want to defend Ukraine from Russian ‘aggression’. Ukrainian officials claimed they received 20,000 applications to join its so-called “foreign legion” in the first weeks of recruitment. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-06-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/557505-platform-attack-injured-missing/,Russia reveals number of victims from drilling rig strikes,"Three people were injured and seven are missing following a suspected Ukrainian attack on drilling rigs off the coast of Crimea, the head of the Russian region, Sergey Aksyonov, revealed on Monday. Earlier, he said that three missile strikes hit three separate rigs owned by Chernomorneftegaz, a company that develops offshore oil and gas fields. “So far, 94 people have been evacuated. 15 servicemen remain guarding the operating drilling platforms. Unfortunately, information on 3 wounded and 7 missing has been confirmed,” Aksyonov said in a statement. He stressed that the search operation will continue and the regional government will contact the families and friends of the missing and injured. Meanwhile, the Russian Investigative Committee has opened a criminal case in relation to the shelling. According to the committee’s statement, “the military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine targeted the platform of the gas production tower <...> using weapons with high damaging properties.” Last Friday, the Ukrainian presidential representative for Crimea, Tamila Tasheva, said that Ukraine is now relying on military means when it comes to what she called “returning” Crimea. She explained that the Russian military offensive had prompted Kiev to largely leave behind its diplomatic strategy for the peninsula’s “deoccupation.” Tasheva’s remarks came a day after Ukraine’s Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov said that Kiev, using US-supplied weapons, is going to “liberate” all land lost to Russia, including Crimea. Prior to that, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed to “liberate” Crimea and the Donetsk (DPR) and Lugansk (LPR) People’s Republics, which are recognized by Russia as independent states. Ukrainian troops have been losing territory to Russia and allied forces in Donbass, even as Western nations supply more sophisticated weapons to Kiev. Several Ukrainian officials have stated that the pledge to not use foreign weapons to attack targets in Russia does not apply to Crimea, which Kiev considers part of its territory. Major General Dmitry Marchenko said last week that the bridge connecting the peninsula with mainland Russia is “absolutely our number one target.” Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-20,https://www.rt.com/news/557500-ukraine-bans-opposition-platform-for-life-party/,Ukraine’s top opposition party banned,"Ukraine’s Opposition Platform – For Life (OPPL) party was officially banned by a Ukrainian court on Monday. The Ministry of Justice announced on Facebook that all of its assets, property, and funds are to be transferred to the state. The ruling to ban the party was carried out by the Eighth Administrative Court of Appeals in the western city of Lviv, following a request from the Ministry of Justice. The OPPL had all of its operations suspended by the authorities in Kiev in March after the launch of Moscow’s military operation, and the party and its leaders were accused of having ties to Russia and being “anti-Ukrainian.” In its Facebook post, the ministry noted that Ukrainian courts have so far banned 11 so-called “pro-Russian” parties suspected of acting to “undermine the sovereignty” of the country. Before its operations were suspended, the OPPL was Ukraine’s largest opposition group and second-largest party in the country. In 2019, it won 13% of the vote in a parliamentary election, and in 2021, polls showed that it surpassed President Volodymyr Zelensky’s ‘Servant of the People’ as the most popular party. Since 2018, it was led by Viktor Medvedchuk, a businessman who called for better relations with Russia and saw Kiev’s western turn as detrimental to national interests. In May 2021, Medvedchuk was placed under house arrest after being accused of treason amid Zelensky’s crackdown on dissent. Medvedchuk had repeatedly denied accusations against him as “politically motivated,” and insisted he was never “pro-Russian,” but merely wanted what was best for the Ukrainian people. On April 12, the OPPL leader was captured by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) as he allegedly tried to flee the country. The arrest was made public after Zelensky published a photo of the man in handcuffs. The politician has since been held in custody by the SBU at an unknown location. Medvedchuk’s wife, Oksana Marchenko, has been pleading with world leaders to organize her husband’s release or exchange and has accused the SBU of beating and torturing him. Last week, Ukrainian courts banned two more political movements – the Left Opposition and the Party of Shariy – both of which were previously featured on the list of 11 political factions suspended by Ukraine’s Security Council. On May 14, President Zelensky signed into law a bill that simplifies the process of banning political parties deemed to be ‘anti-Ukrainian’. Under the law, any party that opposes or challenges the official position of the government, especially when it comes to the ongoing conflict with Moscow, can have its operations banned and assets seized by a court ruling that cannot be appealed. The bill outlaws denial of the ‘aggression against Ukraine’, or referring to the conflict as ‘internal’ or a ‘civil war’. It also prohibits positive statements regarding the ‘aggressors’, and makes it illegal to refer to the forces of the Donetsk and Lugansk republics as ‘insurgents’, insisting that they should be called ‘terrorists’. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-06-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/557494-general-nato-ukraine-strike/,NATO should give ultimatum to Russia – Polish general,"The former head of the Polish National Security Bureau, General Stanislaw Koziej, has called on NATO to deliver an ultimatum to Russia: either Moscow stops missile strikes in the western parts of Ukraine near NATO borders or the bloc imposes “anti-missile protection” over Ukraine. In an interview with the web portal Onet last week, Koziej, who was Poland’s national security chief between 2010 and 2015, said that NATO should protect the military equipment that Western countries are sending to Ukraine. At the moment, the general said, Russian forces are trying to destroy the weapons by long-range missiles launched from the Black Sea, or with the help of strategic aviation. This is “not acceptable,” Koziej claims. According to him, the fact that Russia is apparently using dual-purpose missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads gives NATO every reason to take steps to mitigate the risks. “We have all arguments to take preventative measures and to inform Russia that if it does not stop attacking our border with long-range missiles, then from some day we will introduce anti-missile protection over Western Ukraine,” Koziej said. Russia has long called on the West to stop “pumping up” Ukraine with weapons, warning that it would only prolong the conflict and lead to further problems. Moscow also made it clear that it would consider any foreign military equipment on Ukrainian territory a legitimate target. In Koziej’s opinion, until now Russia has successfully “blackmailed” the West by threatening the potential use of nuclear weapons. Therefore, he argued, NATO should be prepared to shoot down Russian missiles “at an appropriate distance” from its border. “In my opinion, this situation must be finally reversed or at least balanced. It cannot be that in the confrontation of two sides, only one scares, puts up barriers, conditions and red lines,” the former head of the National Security Bureau said. On June 17, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia was not threatening anyone with nuclear weapons but that “everyone should know what we have and what we will use if necessary to protect our sovereignty.” Commenting on the current situation in Ukraine from the military perspective, Koziej said that “nothing is decided yet.” While Russia is “slowly pushing forward,” the Western support remains a hope for Ukraine. “Ukrainians have more and more modern military equipment from the West, and the Russians have the opposite, because they must also reach for obsolete, post-Soviet equipment,” he claimed. Koziej hasn’t ruled out that Ukraine might suffer territorial losses. “But in the sense of state unity, the strength of the Ukrainian nation, Ukraine’s position in the world or its chances of joining the West, Ukraine has won this conflict…,” he said. Meanwhile, Russia, according to the general, “is losing the war” because its strategic possibilities will decrease, its position on the international stage will deteriorate and Russians’ standard of living “will drop significantly.” Since the launch of Russia’s special military operation, Kiev has been asking NATO and Western countries to impose a no-fly zone over or provide Ukraine with the means to do so itself, such as anti-air defense systems and warplanes. These requests, however, remain unfulfilled as the West claims that such a move would put it in direct confrontation with Russia. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-06-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/557475-kremlin-comments-lithuania-rail-transit-ban/,EU member violated ‘anything and everything’ – Kremlin,"Lithuania’s decision to block the transit of sanctioned goods to Russia’s exclave of Kaliningrad is unparalleled, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists on Monday. Speaking to the media, Peskov described Vilnius’ move as “truly unprecedented” and a “violation of anything and everything.” He said that Moscow understands that Lithuania’s decision is connected with the EU’s move to also impose sanctions on goods in transit. However, according to Peskov, Russia sees this extension of the punitive measures as illegal. “The situation is more than serious and calls for deep analysis before any measures and decisions are formulated,” President Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson noted. He added that “this deep analysis” would be conducted in the coming days. When asked if Lithuania’s actions were a blockade of the Russian exclave, Peskov replied by saying “this is an element of a blockade, of course.” Meanwhile, Russia’s Foreign Ministry has issued a statement demanding that Lithuania “immediately” lift the ban imposed on the transit of certain goods to Kaliningrad Region. On Saturday, Lithuanian authorities announced that goods subject to EU sanctions would no longer be allowed to pass through its territory to enter Kaliningrad Region. Among the goods the transit of which is now being blocked are coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology. The region’s governor, Anton Alikhanov, said the ban means that as much as 50% of all the goods destined for Kaliningrad Region would be affected. Lithuania’s state railway service, LTG Cargo, confirmed the same day that, according to clarifications from the European Commission, even if sanctioned goods and cargoes travel from one part of Russia to another, but through the territory of the EU, their transit should still be prohibited."
2022-06-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/557469-nuclear-reduction-talks-frozen/,Russia should wait for US to ‘come crawling back’ – Medvedev,"The US would perceive Russian attempts to negotiate a prolongation of the New START nuclear treaty as a sign of weakness, so no talks should take place unless Washington changes its behavior, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev argued on Monday. “We don’t have any relationship with the US at the moment. They are at zero degrees Kelvin. And we should not unfreeze them for now,” the official wrote on social media. “Let them come or crawl and beg for it. And they should value it as an act of utmost generosity,” he added. “Otherwise, this is how it looks: they toss only sleaze our way, and we go, there, have this nuclear deal, please.” New START is the last remaining bilateral nuclear arms reduction treaty between the US and Russia. It limits the two nations’ stockpiles of nuclear warheads and delivery vehicles for them. While president, Medvedev signed the deal with US President Barack Obama in April 2010. The agreement was extended for five more years in 2021, with President Joe Biden saving it at the last minute from expiring, which had been the intention of his predecessor, Donald Trump. The Russian ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, lamented a lack of Russian-American contacts on strategic stability and suggested that a replacement treaty should be negotiated now, despite the countries’ mutual hostility. Medvedev, who serves as deputy chair of the Russian National Security Council, argued that the US-Russian conflict had reached a “dead zone” point where talking even about arrangements that both parties find beneficial would be counterproductive."
2022-06-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/557470-injuries-reported-strike-russian-drilling-crimea/,Injuries reported after attack on Russian offshore rigs,"Suspected Ukrainian attacks targeted drilling rigs off the coast of Crimea in the Black Sea on Monday morning, the head of the Russian region, Sergey Aksyonov, said in a statement. He added that the rigs were manned by 12 workers, five of whom have been rescued so far, including three with injuries. Aksyonov did not disclose the exact locations of the facilities, but said they were owned by Chernomorneftegaz, a company that develops offshore gas and oil fields. Its ownership has been disputed by Ukrainian energy giant Naftogaz since 2014, when it was nationalized after Crimea voted to re-join Russia. The head of Crimea later said that three missile strikes hit three separate rigs. Aksyonov said a total of 109 people were in the area at the time of the attacks and that the evacuation of the workers was underway. The attack targeted offshore rigs located about 71km from the Ukrainian port of Odessa, Olga Kovitidi, who represents Crimea in the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, told RIA Novosti. Some Ukrainian media reported that earlier in the day, dozens of missiles hit Snake Island, a small islet off the Ukrainian coast, which has been controlled by Russia for months. Ukrainian MP Aleksey Goncharenko claimed that some of the missiles hit the gas rigs instead of the island. Ukrainian troops have been slowly losing territory to Russia and allied forces in Donbass, even as Western nations supply more sophisticated weapons to Kiev. Several Ukrainian officials have stated that the pledge to not use foreign weapons to attack targets in Russia does not apply to Crimea, which Kiev considers part of its territory. Major General Dmitry Marchenko said last week that the bridge connecting the peninsula with mainland Russia is “absolutely our number one target.” This month, Kiev reported deploying US-made Harpoon anti-ship missiles as part of its coastal defense systems. Last week, Kiev claimed it had attacked a Russian military tugboat with two of these missiles. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

2022-06-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/557466-nato-engaged-direct-aggression-russia/,"NATO engaged in ‘direct aggression’ against Russia, Moscow must defend itself – senator","NATO member state Lithuania is now effectively engaged in “direct aggression” against Russia, senator Andrey Klimov argued in a Telegram post on Monday, citing Vilnius’ decision to stop the transit of sanctioned goods to Russia’s exclave of Kaliningrad. According to the Russian politician, who heads a commission for the defense of state sovereignty, by refusing to let certain goods pass through its territory to the Russian region, Lithuania has violated a treaty signed between Moscow and Brussels 20 years ago. Unless the EU brings its member state to heel and forces it to respect the accord, a huge question mark would be hanging over the legal basis for Lithuania’s membership in the bloc, Klimov argued. The senator stressed that in this case, Moscow would have a free hand to “solve the problem of the Kaliningrad transit created by Lithuania by ANY means chosen by us.” Klimov went on to quote from the ‘Joint statement on transit between Kaliningrad Region and the rest of the Russian Federation’ dated November 11, 2002. The document, among other things, stated that the “parties acknowledge the unique position of Kaliningrad region as part of Russia separated from the rest of the Federation’s territory by other states.” Bearing this in mind, the signatories agreed to “make special efforts to allay both sides’ concerns with respect to the future transit of people and goods,” the senator pointed out. The Russian lawmaker added that the uninterrupted transit from mainland Russia to Kaliningrad Region was guaranteed when Lithuania joined NATO back in 2004. Klimov warned that the military alliance is “de jure starting with the hands of one of its member states an unacceptable blockade” of a Russian region. This could be construed as direct aggression against Russia, which is literally forcing us to immediately resort to adequate self-defense. Klimov’s sentiment was echoed by fellow senator Andrey Klishas, head of the Committee of Constitutional Legislation. “The attempt to effectively impose a blockade on Kaliningrad Region on the part of Lithuania is a violation of Russia’s sovereignty over that region, and could be the grounds for very tough and absolutely legal actions on the part of Russia,” the senator wrote in Telegram on Monday. On Saturday, Lithuanian authorities announced that goods subject to EU sanctions would no longer be allowed to pass through its territory to enter Kaliningrad Region. Among the items the transit of which is now being blocked are coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology.

2022-06-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/557459-ukraine-fight-shovels-kuleba/,Ukraine explains why it could ‘fight with shovels’,"Ukraine will continue fighting against Russia even if it has no weapons whatsoever, so the West should speed up its shipments of arms to Ukraine or be responsible for the deaths of its troops, Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said to German media on Sunday. “If we don’t get weapons, fine. Then we will fight with shovels. But we will keep defending ourselves because this is a war for our existence,” Kuleba was quoted as saying in an interview with the public broadcaster ARD. “The sooner we get the weapons, the sooner they are sent, the more good they will do us. If they come late, we will still thank you, but then there will be a lot of waste, and many people will have died by then,” he added. He made the remarks during a panel discussion with political talk show host Anne Will. The list of guests on the show also included the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and several German politicians and political experts. Kuleba said that Russian artillery outgunned Ukraine’s in Donbass 15 to 1, echoing statements that several senior Ukrainian officials have made lately. Kiev cannot win with such an imbalance of power, the foreign minister said. Western politicians, who believe Kiev should make concessions to Russia and agree to settle the conflict with a peace agreement due to the dire situation on the battlefield, are wrong, Kuleba claimed. Ukraine was left with some of the largest military stockpiles among former Soviet republics when the USSR dissolved. Now it says it’s lost up to half of its heavy weapons fighting against Russia and allied forces in the east. Kiev has been pleading for the West to deliver artillery guns, tanks and fighter jets, but have received just a fraction of what they asked for. Ukraine’s allies say they are concerned that Moscow could perceive delivery of weapons as a serious escalation, and Moscow might consider the suppliers as part of the hostilities, Western officials claim. Moscow says that any military aid given to Ukraine escalates and prolongs the conflict and accused its opponents of waging “a war to the last Ukrainian” against Russia. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

2022-06-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/557453-ukrainian-mayor-worried-russophobia/,Ukrainian mayor worried by growing anti-Russian hatred,"Gennady Trukhanov, the mayor of Odessa, Ukraine's third most populous city, has revealed that he is concerned by rising levels of anti-Russian sentiment. In an interview with the New York Times, published on Saturday, Trukhanov said that he was against renaming the city’s central Pushkin Street, named after the famous 19th century Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. “I would not support that. [Odessa] is the intercultural capital of Ukraine. I am worried by the growth of hatred of all things Russian,” the mayor claimed. His remarks were published the day before Ukraine’s parliament outlawed Russian music from media and public spaces and a day after the City Council Executive Committee of Nikolaev, a city in southern Ukraine, decided to ban the use of Russian language in schools. However, the Kiev conservatory, officially called the Pyotr Tchaikovsky National Music Academy of Ukraine (UNTAM), refused earlier this week to remove the name of the iconic Russian composer from its title. While expressing concern over Russophobia, Trukhanov, who, as The New York Times noted, had been previously viewed “as having pro-Russian sympathies,” was open in his condemnation of the Russian attack in his country. “It is important to show that [Odessa] is alive, that Ukraine is alive, that we want to live and create, while the way of the Russian occupiers is killing and death,” he said. He did not rule out that Russian forces could strike central Odessa, as, in his opinion, “anyone capable of Bucha, of Mariupol, of what is happening down the road in [Nikolaev], is capable of anything.” He was apparently referring to the allegations of war crimes raised by Ukrainian politicians and Western media, which Moscow has categorically denied. The removal of references to Russia from street names and other entities has been a trend in Ukraine since the 2014 Maidan coup but intensified after the launch of Moscow’s military operation. Earlier this week, a decision was made to rename several stations of the Kiev subway. For example, Leo Tolstoy Square has been renamed in honor of Vasily Stus, a local poet. There is also a proposal to change all Pushkin Streets across Ukraine to bear the name of the American writer Stephen King, who has condemned the Russian offensive. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

2022-06-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/557228-zelensky-clueless-taiwan-china-war/,"Fresh from banning more opposition parties, Ukraine's Zelensky takes it upon himself to shill for war with China over Taiwan","If Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky isn’t getting paid to foment war between the West and China, he should be. The ubiquitous media darling declared on Saturday that the “international community” must help Taiwan resist Chinese “aggression” now, before Beijing attacks the poor little heavily-armed island. Coming from the leader of any other eastern European kleptocracy, such a suggestion might have been shrugged off as the egotistical bloviation of a spoiled child. But Zelensky has the ears of the ""free world,"" and what he says is lapped up by the narrative managers of the Western media as gospel. All this in a week when his regime banned another pair of opposition parties, bringing the total to nine. A fact the US/UK press certainly hasn't reported loudly. His apparent call for preemptive action against China was picked up by no less than the Washington Post, with acknowledgement that the comments risked “upsetting Ukraine’s delicate balancing act with China.” Still, Zelensky, perceived as a hero in the West, insisted that “aggressors must be confronted wherever they emerge.” Never mind that the US, the chief backer of the Ukrainian military effort, has long been the biggest and boldest aggressor on the planet – Zelensky’s supporters know not to take such rhetoric personally. The last four months have been a whirlwind of fawning media appearances, baffling awards-show cameos, and relentless ego-fluffing. His opinions have been hailed as transcendent on issues he clearly knows nothing about – Taiwan is just one of them. Not that this ignorance matters to the ranks of World Economic Forum drones who dutifully nod before the big screens as their doughy darling talks tough to Putin and demands they cough up ever-larger sums of cash to feed the proxy war Kiev is so selflessly leading for them. It would be bad form to point out that the man hasn’t got a clue where geopolitical issues are concerned, and hypocritical to boot, given how many of their number – US President Joe Biden chief among them – are best understood as puppets who’d be rendered inert without the animating force of the scores of think tank lobbyists, bankers, and military-industrial lobbyists who make policy behind the scenes. Zelensky’s acting chops have served him well these last few months. Clad in man-of-the-people olive drab, he has convinced EU states, for instance, to open their hearts and wallets for the war effort to the point of adopting ruinous, self-sabotaging sanctions they can ill afford. But there’s a difference between duping other European states into starving themselves of wheat and fuel for the coming winter and threatening China’s territorial ambitions. Beijing has repeatedly made it clear that it will not tolerate interference in the Taiwan question by the US, much less by the likes of Zelensky. His incompetence as a leader was so well-known prior to the war that even the rabidly anti-Russian Atlantic Council wrote about it, describing how he owed his election to the shamelessly corrupt oligarch Igor Kolomoisky and relied completely on his chief of staff to get things done, a strategy that predictably failed when he the fired the same chief of staff. While that think tank may have gone silent on Zelensky’s shortcomings now that it needs him to make money for its military-industrial complex donors, his weaknesses remain well-known. Zelensky is not too popular with the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion these days either, having all but left them for dead in Mariupol after promising for weeks that they’d fight on indefinitely. Zelensky is left singing not just for his supper but for his life. “No one benefits from [war], apart from certain political leaders who are not content with the present level of their ambitions,” he told the Post, apparently not talking about himself. While paying brief lip service to the need for a “diplomatic solution,” he demanded the “international community” get involved preemptively in the Taiwan situation, insisting China was on the brink of invading the island it considers its rightful territory. There are plenty of parallels to be drawn between Ukraine and Taiwan, though probably not the ones Zelensky wants the ‘international community’ to notice. As Moscow has repeatedly pointed out, Western countries flooding Ukraine with weapons are not inspiring peaceful thoughts among that nation’s decision-makers. And while Beijing is said to be “studying” the conflict in Ukraine, the lessons it is drawing – such as “the US has emptied its weapons stockpiles into Kiev and now has nothing left to arm Taipei” – are probably not lessons he wants America’s rivals picking up on. It’s no coincidence that the Ukrainian leader is sounding more and more like his American counterpart Joe Biden every day; neither man can be said to have any real role in his country’s governance, or understand how to function in such a role should he somehow be thrust into one. So it’s only natural both would be trying to pick a fight between the West and China, angling to trigger the sort of avalanche that would hide their rank incompetence beneath a greater catastrophe. After all, no matter who wins, the victor will be expected to serve up both sides on a silver platter for foreign investors to gorge themselves. A recently-published paper by the think tank RAND Corporation titled ‘Rebuilding Ukraine’ describes how “state enterprises … are a chokehold on the economy,” reducing “public confidence in government and deter[ring] private investors.” The document is a love-letter to rampant privatization of the same strain that nearly sank the Russian economy post-USSR and which international financial cartels are eager to unleash everywhere, especially in China."
2022-06-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/557445-medvedev-german-clown-named/,Security conference chair insults former Russian president,"Munich Security Conference Chairman Christoph Heusgen has called former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev “a clown,” according to a report in Bild on Saturday. Heusgen, who previously served as German ambassador to the UN and a foreign policy and security adviser to ex-Chancellor Angela Merkel, made the remark during the Kiel International Seapower Symposium. “Medvedev is a clown today, I’m sorry to have to say that,” Heusgen said, as quoted by the newspaper. Though Bild did not provide the context of Heusgen’s remarks, the statement was welcomed by a member of the Ukrainian Delegation in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Ukrainian MP Aleksey Goncharenko. “I am not surprised by such words of the German diplomat. My impressions of the last meeting with Mr. Heusgen are purely positive… Deep respect from me and all Ukrainian people!” Goncharenko tweeted. Since the beginning of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, Medvedev, who is now the deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, has been very active on social media, harshly criticizing Ukrainian and Western politicians. In May, Medvedev blamed the looming global food crisis on the “cosmic cretinism” of the West. In April, he warned the “Brussels masochists” that they will have to change their rhetoric if the ‘Russian debt default’ they predict ends up becoming the bankruptcy (both moral and material) of the EU. In June, he explained why he resorts to this type of language when it comes to Western politicians. “I am often asked why my Telegram posts are so harsh. The answer is I hate them. They are bastards and geeks. They want death for us, Russia. And while I’m alive, I will do everything to make them disappear.” A few days prior to this post, Medvedev said he writes to provide people with information “in understandable simple language,” without any ambiguity."

Washington wants Moscow to have no say on global issues, but it will not succeed, he added. The conflict in Ukraine is being used by the US and its allies as just another way to weaken Russia, Lavrov said when asked what America’s real goals in Ukraine are. “They [the US] are pursuing a goal they have long made public: Russia must know its place; Russia [must] have no voice in international affairs; Russia must abide by the rules set by the US,” the minister stated, adding that Washington is apparently “well aware” of the fact that it would not succeed. His words came as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told German tabloid Bild that Western weapons supplied by the military bloc make it more likely that Ukraine will drive Russian forces out of Donbass. The NATO chief has also openly stated that the bloc plans to no longer designate Moscow as a partner but as a security threat in the next update of its strategy concept."

It was posted on Sunday. According to Rada member Yaroslav Zheleznyak, 303 deputies supported the measure. “Parliament also banned the import and distribution of books and other publishing products from the Russian Federation, the territories temporarily occupied by it, and from Belarus,” Zheleznyak wrote, adding that this move was supported by 306 out of the 450 members of the parliament. The approved legislation amends several existing laws, including ‘On Culture,’ ‘On Cinematography,’ ‘On Television and Radio Broadcasting,’ ‘On Touring Events in Ukraine’ and several others. According to the explanatory note to the bill, the law completely and indefinitely bans “public performance, public display, public demonstration, public use of phonograms, videos and music videos of singers who after 1991 were citizens of the aggressor state.” The restrictions will not be applied to those Russian musicians who publicly renounced Moscow’s military offensive in Ukraine and thus could be added to a so-called ‘white list’ of performers. This list will be compiled and regularly updated by Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council. “An application for inclusion in the List shall be submitted to the Security Service of Ukraine by such person, or the person’s legal representative, tour organizer or right holder…” the bill reads. The Rada’s vote came two days after the City Council Executive Committee of Nikolaev, a city in southern Ukraine, decided to ban the use of the Russian language in schools.Earlier, street musicians in the western Ukrainian city of Ternopol were banned from singing in Russian. Although restrictions on the Russian language have recently been picking up pace, the process far predates the launch of Moscow’s offensive. In March 2019, the Ukrainian government prohibited some 40 works of art due to their mention of Russian businesses, artists, social networks, internet portals, the USSR or Soviet political figures. In 2019, a wide-ranging piece of legislation called “On ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language,” championed by then-President Petro Poroshenko, was passed. It officially made Ukrainian the only state language and decreed that it must be the primary language in many fields, including public administration, media, and education. Despite Russian being a common mother tongue in much of Ukraine and predominant in many cities in both the east and south of the country, it was not granted an exception in the law, although many of the provisions have been implemented gradually. Moscow has been voicing concern for many years over the clampdown on the Russian language in Ukraine."
2022-06-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/557436-medvedev-eu-demise-prediction/,Russia’s former president makes grim EU prediction,"The European Union could suffer the same fate as the Soviet Union and disappear from the map before Ukraine becomes a member, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev suggested on Sunday. Medvedev, who served as Russian president between 2008 and 2012 and is currently the deputy head of the country’s Security Council, compared the “promises” Brussels has made to Ukraine to the plans of Soviet leaders to build communism. “Perhaps we would have Communism, if the [Soviet] Union had been preserved. But, unfortunately, the union died. Understand what I’m getting at?” Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel. So what if (knock on wood) the EU disappears by then? It’s scary to imagine the scandal that would arise. In this case, it would be a betrayal of promises made to Ukrainians, he added. On Friday, the European Commission recommended that Ukraine be granted candidacy status, the first step on the lengthy path to membership. However, the Commission noted that Ukraine must still conduct several reforms and “further strengthen the fight against corruption.” Ukraine formally applied for membership just days after Russia launched its military campaign against the country in late February. The final decision on Ukraine’s candidacy will be made at an EU summit next week. However, it was reported earlier that there was no unanimity among the EU states about Ukraine’s chances of swiftly joining the bloc. EU members also had disagreements over the sanctions on Russia. While introducing a partial ban on Russian oil, Brussels made concessions to Hungary and several other nations."

The strike took place near the village of Shirokaya Dacha in Dnepropetrovsk Region. It hit a compound where commanders of several Ukrainian units had gathered for a meeting, according to Moscow. The ministry added that Kalibr missiles were also used to destroy 10 M777 howitzers and up to 20 armored vehicles that were recently delivered from the West, and had been stored inside a factory building in the southern city of Nikolayev. Meanwhile, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reported on Sunday that the country's artillery destroyed several Russian multiple rocket launchers. Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, following Kiev's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

The jets have been “repeatedly” tasked with missions, both individually and as part of squads, Borisov told reporters on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum on Saturday. He added that the plane’s weapons were “very effective.” The first Su-57s joined the Air Force in 2020 and flew bombing missions in Syria. Russian media first reported the use of the Su-57s in Ukraine in May. In June, the news agency RIA Novosti quoted a source as saying that four planes had been deployed to spot and destroy air defenses. The source said that stealth technology helped the jets avoid radars. Borisov said that Russia has also used a laser weapon in Ukraine, which is capable of destroying drones. The West, meanwhile, continues to send heavy weapons to Ukraine, including HIMARS multiple rocket launchers and M777 howitzers.

2022-06-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/557418-lithuania-trade-blockade-kaliningrad/,Blockade of Russian region a breach of international law – Moscow,"Lithuania has broken international law by implementing an economic “blockade” of Russia’s Kaliningrad Region, according to leading Moscow Senator Konstantin Kosachev. The EU country’s state-owned rail operator previously said it had stopped the transit of sanctioned goods between the region and the rest of Russia. “Lithuania is a flagship of the destruction of international law,” Kosachev wrote on his Telegram channel on Saturday. Kosachev, who is the deputy speaker of the upper house of Russia’s parliament, said that Lithuania’s actions violate various international norms, including the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Kaliningrad is a small Russian exclave that borders Lithuania from the north and east, and Poland from the south. Lithuanian Railways spokesman Mantas Dubauskas claimed on Saturday that the operator partially stopped the transit of Russian goods through Lithuania in order to enforce EU sanctions. Kaliningrad Governor Anton Alikhanov said on Friday that the decision will affect up to 50% of all cargo flow between the region and the rest of Russia. He said the move was made in “flagrant violation” of international law and is tantamount to “an attempt to place the region in an economic chokehold.” Alikhanov later added that the authorities are working to deliver goods by ship through the Baltic Sea. Many countries, including EU member states, imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in response to the military campaign in Ukraine launched by Moscow in late February. The European bloc closed its airspace for Russian aircraft on February 27, and Moscow responded in kind, banning many European airlines."
2022-06-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/557415-rogozin-war-space-companies/,West moving towards war in space – Roscosmos chief,"Western astronautics is “heading for war,” Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos) Director Dmitry Rogozin said on Saturday, claiming that the alleged collection of data for Ukraine by private Western companies proves this. In an interview with Russia 24, Rogozin claimed that private American companies such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, SpaceX, and others are now tasked with “one specific goal: To ensure the collection of information in real time, both visual – through infrared radar devices – and through conventional surveillance.” This data is collected for the Ukrainian forces to use “for ballistic missile guidance or multiple launch rocket system operation,” he said. We can see where actually the Western space world is heading. It is heading for war. This also applies to satellite communication companies such as Starlink, the Roscosmos director added. Asked if Russian satellites are able to monitor Ukrainian territory, Rogozin said, “Of course.” Earlier this month, he claimed that private American space companies are “at best, trusted contractors of the Pentagon, at worst, agents of the Pentagon or the CIA under the guise of ‘private independent companies.’” Rogozin’s remarks came soon after the head of US Cyber Command, General Paul Nakasone, admitted for the first time that the US was supporting Ukraine by conducting offensive hacking operations. “We've conducted a series of operations across the full spectrum; offensive, defensive, [and] information operations,” he told Sky News. Nakasone did not provide any details of these operations, but claimed they are completely lawful."
2022-06-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/557413-ukraine-schools-russian-banned/,Ukrainian city bans Russian language,"The Russian language will be restricted in the schools of the southern Ukrainian city of Nikolaev, City Council Executive Committee member Ekaterina Stokolias said on Saturday. In a Facebook post, she stated that the decision was made by the committee on Friday. “From September 1, no clubs, courses, junior classes or educational designs with the Russian language. Finally! Thank you to all my colleagues!” Stokolias wrote. She added a drawing depicting a cat holding a heart in the colors of the Ukrainian flag. The captions to the picture are “Language matters” and “Everything matters.” The announcement in Nikolaev came as Ukrainian Deputy Education and Science Minister Andrey Vitrenko revealed earlier this month that the authorities plan to change the school curriculum in several subjects, including foreign literature, world history and the history of Ukraine. In particular, the world-famous novel ‘War and Peace’ by the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, which chronicles Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812, will be dropped. “Such things will not be studied in Ukraine. Everything that glorifies the orc troops will disappear from the program of foreign literature,” Vitrenko explained. He also said that discussions are underway about whether any Russian writers should remain in the curriculum. In April, Ukrainian Commissioner for the Protection of the State Language Taras Kremen called for the replacement of the Russian language in those schools where it was still being taught by other subjects, such as, for example, the history of Ukraine, the Ukrainian language, English or math. Although since the start of Moscow’s military operation the Ukrainian authorities have been stepping up the restrictions on the Russian language, Kiev had banned Russian works of art – and teaching of the language – long before the current conflict. In March 2019, the Ukrainian government prohibited some 40 works of art due to their mention of Russian businesses, artists, social networks, internet portals, the USSR or Soviet political figures. In 2019, a wide-ranging piece of legislation called “On ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language,” championed by then-President Petro Poroshenko, was passed.

2022-06-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/557210-clinton-criticized-macrons-diplomacy/,Hillary Clinton has criticized Emmanuel Macron’s policy towards Russia – the French leader should take it as a compliment,"Former US Secretary of State, First Lady, Senator, and failed presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, passed through Paris last week, and seized an opportunity to chastise French President Emmanuel Macron on his own turf. Clinton was interviewed on state broadcaster Radio France by Christine Ockrent – the journalist wife of former French foreign affairs minister, Bernard Kouchner – who asked about Clinton’s view of Macron’s recent controversial remarks. “We must not humiliate Russia so that the day the fighting stops, we can build a way out through diplomatic channels,” Macron had told the French regional press. “I am convinced that it is the role of France, to be a mediating power.” Clinton replied: “When we say that we don’t want to humiliate Russia, quite frankly, that seems a bit outdated to me. Putin crossed the red line a long time ago.” Clinton added: “I think the ultimate success would be defeating Putin. And in this, I can only agree with what President Zelensky and his government are asking for, that is, a total withdrawal from the occupied territories in Ukraine.” Clinton perfectly captures the ideological mindset that plagues the Washington foreign policy establishment. We’re a far cry from the statesmanship and realpolitik foreign policy realism of her predecessor, former diplomat Henry Kissinger. He recently told the Davos World Economic Forum that peace in Ukraine should be negotiated within two months and should involve leaving the newly-seceded territories in the East, whose Russophone populations have suffered years of Kiev-led attacks and harassment, under the control of their pro-Russian authorities. Clinton embodies the prevailing “us versus them” thinking on foreign policy matters. Everything is viewed through the narrow lens of the interests of a precious few American elites, with little care for what might be best for the average American citizen, let alone those of other nations, including Washington’s allies. Clinton is also part of the Democratic Party old guard that blame Russian President Vladimir Putin when they stub their toe. In just the latest example, President Joe Biden said last week: “We've never seen anything like Putin’s tax on both food and gas,” in addressing the inflation that has spiked under Biden’s watch and policies. Putin isn’t taxing anyone in America, just like he didn’t “steal” the 2016 presidential election from Hillary Clinton. But Clinton has publicly blamed “Russian WikiLeaks” for her loss to Donald Trump, referring to WikiLeaks’ release of her campaign manager’s emails (and also “misogyny”), which revealed a cozy, arguably collusive, relationship between the Clinton campaign and the press to Trump’s detriment. Instead of soul searching about why that might have turned off voters who don’t appreciate being manipulated, or acknowledging the complexities and challenges of technical attribution for any such breaches, it’s no doubt easier to just blame Putin. Clinton really doesn’t risk much in doing so. Hollywood loves a good villain and Washington can always capitalize on a dramatic narrative that simplifies complex diplomacy into good versus evil. As Secretary of State, Clinton oversaw the NATO bombing of Libya, the migration blowback from which Europe is still feeling. “We came, we saw, he died,” Clinton jubilated on the set of an interview when she found out that Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi had been liquidated in what was essentially a NATO-backed coup. Clinton reacted to Gaddafi’s death like her team had just won the Super Bowl, rather than treating it like a major geopolitical event with serious and lasting repercussions for regional stability. Clinton was equally reckless towards Syria in her role as top diplomat, as she cheered the failed US-backed regime-change war against President Bashar Assad through the use of Pentagon and CIA-backed “Syrian rebels.” “We think Assad must go,” Clinton told ABC News. “The sooner the better for everyone concerned.” Russia was ultimately left to clean up the mess that she helped cause, lest a “Big Bang” of jihadists disperse and find their way to Eurasia. But Clinton clearly couldn’t see past the end of her nose in assessing a potential fallout. So it’s not exactly shocking that Clinton is now advocating in favor of Putin’s removal from office and the prolongation of the Ukraine conflict. It’s certainly not Clinton who’s going to be paying any kind of price in the event that her misguided advice is pursued, but rather the average Ukrainian, European, and Russian whose interests she’s treating like pawns. And if Emmanuel Macron needed any convincing that his recent stance in favor of peace sooner rather than later in Ukraine – along with the normalization of relations with Russia – is indeed the right path, the fact that Clinton is against it should be reassuring."
2022-06-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/557284-nuclear-posturing-ukraine-disaster/,Nuclear Ukraine: Arming Kiev with the world's most dangerous weapons would be a disaster,"Former Polish foreign minister and current European Parliament member Radoslaw Sikorski has suggested that the West should provide Ukraine with nuclear weapons in order to “defend its independence.” Sikorski’s reasoning was grounded in a fundamentally flawed understanding of the 1994 Budapest memorandum (which sealed Ukraine’s accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons) – Ukraine did not lose security when it gave up its Soviet-era stockpile of nuclear weapons. Had Kiev opted to retain these weapons, it would have been treated by the international community as a pariah state whose viability would have been fatally undercut through missing out on the economic opportunity afforded by its agreeing to be rid of its inherited nuclear arsenal. Ukraine’s security was enhanced by surrendering these nuclear weapons, since in doing so the door was opened for better relations with the West. Of course, Ukraine’s unfortunate history shows that this opportunity was squandered, given that Russia’s ongoing military operation which triggered Sikorski’s words was prompted not by some perceived Ukrainian weakness derived from its nuclear-free status, but rather the irresponsible policies of successive governments since the 2014 Maidan coup – that toppled former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych – which pursued the violent oppression of ethnic Russians in Donbass for eight years. Incidentally, Sikorski himself was one of the prime movers in destabilising Ukraine. Along with the equally US friendly former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt, he helped formulate the EU's Eastern partnership programme. This disastrous plan forced Kiev to choose between Brussels and Moscow. A situation which was clearly going to ignite the country's delicate ethnic divides. Sikorski’s fact-challenged narrative was matched by Vyacheslav Volodin, the Chairman of the State Duma of the Russian Federation. While justifiably angered by Sikorski’s dangerous remarks, Volodin said they amounted to “instigating a nuclear conflict in the center of Europe,” declaring that “[Sikorski] does not think about the future of either Ukraine or Poland. If his proposals materialize, these countries will disappear, together with the whole of Europe.” Left unsaid (and likely unconsidered) by Volodin is the fact that Russia and the rest of the world would likely cease to exist as well, given the harsh truth that there is no such thing as a limited nuclear conflict and, once the nuclear Genie has been released from its bottle, it won’t rest until all of humanity is destroyed. There was a reason, in January 2022, Russia pushed the five nuclear-armed permanent members of the United Nations Security Council to jointly publish a statementwhich, among other things, declared that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.” That remains the truth, whatever Volodin says. Russian President Vladmir Putin understands that, having famously quipped during an October 2018 session of the Valdai Club that “Any [nuclear] aggressor should know that retribution will be inevitable, and he will be destroyed. And since we will be the victims of his aggression, we will be going to heaven as martyrs. They will simply drop dead, won’t even have time to repent.” Which is why such an outcome should not be postulated, even if issuing what amounts to little more than an idle threat. The Sikorski-Volodin exchange isn’t the first time officials from opposite ends of the spectrum raised the specter of nuclear weapons in the context of Russia’s ongoing military operation in Ukraine. Following a visit to Ukraine in April 2022, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin declared that “Nations from around the world stand united in our resolve to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s imperial aggression,” adding “Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here.” Austin went on to articulate as official US policy a hope that the Ukraine conflict would produce a “weakened” Russia incapable of carrying out similar attacks on in the future. The policy of the US and NATO, to arm Ukraine with advanced heavy weapons whose sole purpose is to help kill Russian soldiers, elicited a warning from Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about the threat of nuclear conflict amid the war in Ukraine. “The danger,” Lavrov told Russian media, “is serious. It is real. It should not be underestimated.” Lavrov’s comments prompted a rejoinder from Austin, who labeled the Russian diplomat’s words “very dangerous and unhelpful. Nobody,” Austin declared, “wants to see a nuclear war–nobody can win it.” Austin’s announcement must have come as a surprise to those in the US defense establishment whose job it is to prepare for a nuclear conflict. In early 2020 the US deployed a new nuclear weapon, the W76-2 “low yield” nuclear warhead, which was by design intended to demonstrate to potential adversaries that the United States was prepared to respond to the kind of “limited nuclear engagement” envisioned by Sikorski and Volodin. Estimated to have a yield of five kilotons–one third that of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima at the end of the Second World War, the W76-2 was, according to Mark Esper, Lloyd Austin’s predecessor as Secretary of Defense, intended to give the president “options [that will] allow us to deter conflict” and “if necessary…fight and win.” Fight and win a nuclear war. There is only one nation in the world that not only maintains a nuclear posture which postulates the possibility of fighting and winning a nuclear war but has developed and deployed nuclear weapons designed to accomplish just that. That nation is the United States. December 8, 2022 will mark the 35th anniversary of the signing of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty between the United States and the former Soviet Union. Prior to the INF Treaty coming into force, the US and the USSR had deployed thousands of intermediate-range nuclear-armed missiles which faced off against each other in Europe. One mistake, one miscalculation, one piece of false information, and these missiles would be launched, virtually guaranteeing a cycle of escalation which would result in the nuclear annihilation of humanity on earth. Despite the harsh rhetoric of the Cold War, where President Ronald Reagan spoke of an “Evil Empire” in the Soviet Union and the United States was known as “Enemy Number One” in Moscow, the political and military leaders of both nations were able to demonstrate the necessary courage and vision to craft an arms control agreement which helped pull their respective nations back from the nuclear abyss. In 2019 then-President Donald Trump precipitously withdrew from the INF Treaty, setting in motion a new arms race which threatens in short order to see Europe once again playing host to a new generation of even more lethal missiles. Today, with relations between the US and Russia at an all-time low, it is high time for the political and military leaders of these two nations to once again push past the trivial and focus on that which is essential for the sustainment of life as we know it: A new INF Treaty which, if implemented, will buy Europe and the rest of the world some breathing space so that the threat of a nuclear conflict recedes. The US and Russia claim to have a shared belief that a nuclear war can never be won, and as such should never be fought. Through action and word, however, it appears that neither side has fully embraced the pledge they made, together with France, Great Britain, and China, earlier this year. The world once again finds itself on the cusp of the unthinkable–a nuclear war in Europe that would end up enveloping the entire planet. Our respective leadership must respect the intent of that pledge, and begin the long, hard process of disarmament needed to turn theory into reality. We did it once before, and I have faith and trust that we can do it again."
2022-06-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/557409-ukrainian-shelling-kills-five/,Ukrainian shelling kills five – DPR,"Five people have been killed by Ukrainian shelling of areas in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), the latter's territorial defense claimed on Saturday, adding that 12 more have been injured. Among the victims were emergency workers who came to put out the fires caused by the initial strikes but then came under new fire themselves, resulting in two dead and three injured, a statement outlined. “Ukrainian armed formations continue to shell the Voroshilovsky district of Donetsk. Throughout the day, about 50 shells of 155-mm caliber targeting the city center were fired from the positions of Ukrainian militants in Avdeevka,” the DPR insisted. The local capital, Donetsk, has seen intense heavy shelling recently. According to its mayor, Alexey Kulemzin, a university building and nearby residential buildings were damaged in the strikes. Also on Saturday, the territorial defense stated that five people were injured in the town of Komsomolskoye in the southeast of the DPR after a Ukrainian Tochka-U ballistic missile apparently targeting the town was intercepted by the local militias. The strike came a day after Ukrainian forces reportedly shelled a hospital in the city of Donetsk, damaging a gas pipeline that goes through the grounds of the hospital. Also, 77 miners were stuck underground after shelling left a local mine without power, the territorial defense announced earlier on Saturday. They were all subsequently rescued. On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin described the strikes on residential areas of Donetsk “a crime against humanity.” Earlier this week, several Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, vowed to “liberate” all of the country’s former territories, including Crimea, which rejoined Russia in 2014, and the DPR plus the neighboring Lugansk People’s Republic, which Russia has also recognized as an independent states. When launching its special military operation, in February, Moscow pledged to “denazify” Ukraine. Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, following Kiev's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/557405-ukraine-lashes-military-zelensky/,Top Ukrainian official lashes out at Zelensky adviser,"The head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council (NSDC), Alexey Danilov, has called out presidential adviser Mikhail Podoliak for making statements on behalf of the military. Earlier this week, Podoliak unveiled an arms wish list for the West, saying Kiev needs 300 multiple-launch rocket systems, 500 tanks, and 1,000 howitzers to achieve heavy weapons parity with Russia. On Saturday, in an interview with news outlet Liga, Danilov stressed that only senior military officials can make statements like this, questioning why Podoliak “is now the voice of the army.” “I don’t understand why Podoliak makes such statements. Is he a representative of the General Staff? I only saw him on the stumps of Yanukovich,” Danilov said. By ‘stumps’, he was apparently referring to a path at former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich’s country residence. In 2011, Yanukovich showed off the residence to a group of journalists, telling them that every morning for half an hour, he would run up and down the stumps – comments which inspired numerous internet memes. Asked about the duration of the military conflict with Russia amid Kiev’s shortage of weapons, Danilov said it’s important for Ukraine “to end this war with a victory as soon as possible.” “The longer it lasts, the more the degree of perception in the West will fall. Domestic problems, domestic politics, elections... They will switch to the domestic agenda and pay less and less attention [to Ukraine]. There will be a certain weariness from the war,” he said. He echoed the remarks of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who warned on Saturday of “Ukraine fatigue,” which he said is growing around the world, while stressing that this should not prevent the West from conveying its support for Ukraine at this “particularly critical time.” The Ukrainian military earlier revealed that Ukraine has lost up to half of its heavy weapons, including 400 tanks, and Western supplies are unable to fill the gap as they cover only 10-15% of the country’s needs. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-06-18,https://www.rt.com/news/557397-macron-name-conditions-russia-visit/,Macron names conditions for Russia visit,"The president of France, Emmanuel Macron, has said he would not rule out traveling to Russia and meeting with President Vladimir Putin, but only if certain preconditions are met. Paris supports Ukraine but will take measures to avoid any escalation of the conflict, the French leader told TF1 TV on Friday while visiting Kiev. Macron believes his continued contact with Putin does not affect France’s relations with Ukraine. He also said he plans to continue engaging with the Russian president on humanitarian issues such as food security. The French leader said some people do not understand his policy of maintaining contact with Russia, but he “thinks it is France’s role” to continue to do so. Asked whether he would visit Russia, Macron said it would require certain preconditions and “gestures” on the part of the Russian president. He did not specify what exactly he wants Russia to do, but added that he would engage with Putin in a “transparent way” and only when it is “useful.” The French president also defended his earlier statement that it is vital that Russia is not humiliated over its actions in Ukraine. France made this mistake with Germany after WWI, and it led to a situation in which the peace was lost when WWII broke out, he noted. Earlier this week, Macron called on Kiev to return to the negotiating table and resume talks with Moscow. The president suggested that France could serve as a mediator, adding that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “is going to have to negotiate with Russia.” At the time, Macron warned that prolonged hostility with Russia is not a viable long-term solution for European security. On Friday, he said that gasoline and food prices in France continue to rise due to the conflict, and “we have to take exceptional decisions in exceptional times.” Macron arrived in Kiev on Thursday together with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis. During the visit, he voiced support for Ukraine’s EU candidacy status. Moscow expressed hope that the four leaders will help Kiev adopt a more “realistic” stance on the conflict, saying that supplying more arms to Ukraine will only prolong the suffering of its people and bring more devastation. Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, following Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

2022-06-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/557398-ukraine-peace-talks-august/,Ukraine’s top negotiator predicts when peace talks could resume,"Ukraine could restart peace talks with Russia – from a favorable position – in late August, the country’s lead negotiator, David Arakhamia, has said. “We don’t want to share our plans with the Russians because they could see them in open sources. But I think we will conduct counteroffensive operations in certain areas,” Arakhamia, an MP, told US state-run Voice of America on Friday. He added that “a minimally viable agreement” would see Russian troops leaving the territories they seized after February 24, when Moscow launched its large-scale offensive in Ukraine. “We will never accept the loss of territory. It’s legally impossible. But we could consider a political agreement, similar to the one we tabled in Istanbul.” During the talks in Turkey in late March, the Ukrainians proposed that Kiev and Moscow hold negotiations on the status of Crimea within the next 15 years, while Ukraine promises not to seize the peninsula by force. Crimea voted to leave Ukraine and join Russia shortly after the 2014 coup in Kiev. The talks have since stalled. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in May that his country will begin negotiating again only after it recovers land lost after February 24. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko said that statements such as this make Moscow question whether Ukraine wants a peace settlement at all. In an op-ed published by Foreign Affairs magazine on Friday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba argued that, with enough heavy weapons from the West, Ukraine could defeat Russia and take back its land. He also urged the West not to suggest “unacceptable” peace terms for Ukraine. Russia attacked Ukraine following Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

2022-06-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/557396-britain-warns-fatigue-ukraine/,British PM warns of ‘Ukraine fatigue’,"As “Ukraine fatigue” builds up around the world it is crucially important to convey messages of support to Kiev, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Saturday amid the ongoing Russian military offensive. Speaking to Sky News the day after his trip to the Ukrainian capital, Johnson expressed concern that at this “particularly critical time... a bit of Ukraine fatigue is starting to set in around the world.” “Ukrainians are suffering terribly in the east of the country. Putin [Russian President Vladimir Putin] is continuing to commit appalling atrocities. The Russians are grinding forward, inch by inch. And it’s vital for us to show what we know to be true, which is that Ukraine can and will win,” Johnson said, explaining the importance of his visit to Kiev, the second one since the Russian offensive began at the end of February. Thank you my friend President @ZelenskyyUa for hosting me in Ukraine yesterday.It was incredibly moving to walk the streets of Kyiv with you once more, to pay tribute to your fallen soldiers whose sacrifice, unconquerable courage and bravery we will never forget. pic.twitter.com/9tC8WFEwcx The prime minister claimed that the Russian forces “are still sustaining huge casualties, they are running out of a lot of the most sophisticated weaponry, their precision weapons are starting to be run down very severely.” “We’ve got to get the message to the Ukrainians and the world about how strongly we’re backing them and how important it is that they succeed,” Johnson stressed. During his surprise visit to Kiev, Johnson offered President Volodymyr Zelensky a major training program for Ukrainian forces with the potential to train up to 10,000 soldiers every 120 days. The UK has been one of the key European supporters of Kiev in its fight against Russia. Britain has already pledged more than £1.3 billion ($1.6 billion) in economic and humanitarian support to Ukraine, providing Kiev with, among other things, more than 5,000 NLAW anti-tank missiles and long-range multiple launch rocket systems. Russia has consistently warned the West against sending weapons to Ukraine, saying that it would only prolong the conflict and create further problems. It also made it clear that it considers any foreign weapons on the Ukrainian territory as a legitimate target. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/557389-ukraine-bad-peace-deals/,Ukraine wants West to stop pushing for ‘unacceptable’ peace terms,"Ukraine can defeat Russia on the battlefield if the West supplies enough artillery and other heavy weapons instead of pushing Kiev towards a bad peace deal, Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba has written in an op-ed published by Foreign Affairs magazine on Friday. “The West must therefore not suggest peace initiatives with unacceptable terms and instead help Ukraine win,” Kuleba wrote, calling for additional weapons for Kiev and more sanctions on Moscow. The foreign minister criticized French President Emmanuel Macron for saying the West should not “humiliate” Russia, and former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for suggesting that Ukraine should cede some territory for the sake of peace with Moscow. “These declarations are premised on the idea that Ukrainians, no matter how well they fight, cannot defeat Moscow’s forces. But that notion is wrong,” Kuleba said. He insisted that “with sufficient support,” Ukraine can stop the advance of Russian troops and take back some of its land. “[Russian President Vladimir] Putin is not suicidal; a Ukrainian victory will not lead to nuclear warfare,” Kuleba said. “Instead of focusing on Putin’s feelings, the United States and Europe should focus on practical steps to help Ukraine prevail.” The op-ed comes at a time when Ukrainian officials are growing frustrated with the speed and quantity of Western arms deliveries. “Either the world doesn’t quite understand what is happening, or it does understand, is tired, and is content with a few Ukrainians dying,” Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov told The Economist on Sunday. Mikhail Podoliak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, suggested this week that countries such as France and Germany are “hiding from the war.” “If you think we should lose, just tell us directly: ‘We want you to lose.’ Then we will understand why you give us weapons at this level,” Podoliak told the New York Times. Several European leaders, including Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, met with Zelensky in Kiev this week, pledging more support. Sergey Nikiforov, Zelensky’s spokesman, denied that the Ukrainian leader was pressured into holding talks with Russia."
2022-06-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/557386-donetsk-ukrainian-forces-strike-shelling/,Five injured in Ukrainian strike on Donetsk – DPR,"Five people have been injured in the town of Komsomolskoye in the southeast of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in the wake of a Ukrainian missile strike that was intercepted by the local militias, the DPR territorial defense said on Saturday. Ukrainian troops fired a ballistic Tochka-U missile apparently targeting the town, the DPR authorities said in a statement. According to their information, the projectile was intercepted by the local air-defense system, but debris still fell on a street in the town, injuring five people. Several residential buildings were damaged in the strike as well, the statement added. Photos published by the DPR territorial defense on social media show parts of the missile lying on the ground and at least one heavily hit building that had part of a wall collapse. The city of Donetsk has seen heavy shelling on Saturday, local authorities have said. According to the mayor, Aleksey Kulemzin, the Donetsk National University campus was hit during the shelling and one of the buildings was damaged. The local emergency service has reported that a member of an emergency team was killed when a shell fired by the Ukrainian forces landed near a fire-fighting vehicle, while another member was wounded and later succumbed in a hospital, they said. The strike came a day after Ukrainian forces shelled a hospital in the city of Donetsk, damaging a gas pipeline that goes through the grounds of the hospital, according to the DPR authorities. Russia has repeatedly condemned what it called “indiscriminate strikes” by the Ukrainian forces targeting civilian infrastructure, including in Donetsk."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557366-angela-merkel-reveals-her-role/,Merkel explains her role in the Ukraine conflict,"Angela Merkel has said that decisions she made while in office, as well as the timing of her departure last year, may have influenced Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch Russia’s military operation in Ukraine in February. While ultimately blaming him for the decision to attack, she cautioned that the West “must take Putin seriously.” In one of her first major interviews since leaving office in December, excerpts of which were published by Germany’s RND news network on Friday, Merkel revealed that she had attempted to talk to Putin last year about a European security order, but the Russian leader was not interested. “On the one hand, Putin was no longer ready for a Normandy-style summit,” she said, referring to the four-way meetings between Germany, France, Russia, and Ukraine that resulted in the 2014 and 2015 Minsk agreements. These protocols failed to end the war in Donbass, with Russia accusing Kiev of breaching their calls for a ceasefire and ignoring their recommendations that Ukraine grant some autonomy to the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics. “On the other hand, I did not succeed in creating an additional European-Russian discussion format about a European security order alongside the Normandy format,"" Merkel reflected. Merkel served as Germany’s chancellor for 16 years. Germany’s economy dominated the Eurozone during this time, fueled by Russian gas imports. Merkel has defended her working relationship with Putin, telling reporters earlier this month that it would be politically impossible not to trade with Russia. Merkel has also stood by her decision to block Ukraine’s petition to join NATO in 2008, arguing such a move would have triggered a war with Russia. Merkel’s domestic critics have long accused her of being soft on Moscow, despite her support for sanctions after Crimea rejoined Russia in 2014. Likewise, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has claimed that Merkel’s “concessions to Russia” emboldened Putin to launch his Ukrainian operation in February. The former chancellor said that her departure from office “may have been a contribution” toward the current conflict, although she did not elaborate on whether Putin may have felt less inclined toward diplomacy with her successor, Olaf Scholz. Instead she said that a confluence of upheavals in the world may have influenced the timing of Russia’s operation, namely “the elections in France, the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and the stagnation of the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.” Referring to the conflict in Ukraine as a turning point in European history, Merkel cautioned that “you have to take Putin seriously.” The former chancellor did not rule out possibly mediating a settlement to the conflict at a later date, but said that she was “not currently being asked” to get involved. While Scholz has expressed hesitance to sanction Russian fossil fuels, his government nevertheless shut down the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline days before Russian troops entered Ukraine. Since then, Berlin has sent weapons and ammunition to Kiev’s forces, vowed to spend $113 billion acquiring new American and Israeli weaponry, and promised to boost defense spending to above 2% of GDP."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557365-weapons-kiev-losses-russia/,Ukraine reveals huge weapons losses,"Ukraine has lost up to 50% of its heavy-weapons stock, including 400 tanks, a top commander, Volodymyr Karpenko, revealed earlier this week amid the ongoing Russian military offensive in his country. In an interview with National Defense Magazine, Karpenko said that “as a result of active combat,” equipment losses have amounted to 30-40%, sometimes up to 50%, compared to pre-conflict levels. So, we have lost approximately 50 percent. … Approximately 1,300 infantry fighting vehicles have been lost, 400 tanks, 700 artillery systems. Ukraine’s Deputy Minister of Defense Denis Sharapov, in the same interview, revealed that Western supplies do not cover Kiev’s needs. “We have received a large number of weapon systems, but unfortunately with such a massively expendable resource, it only covers 10 to 15 percent of our needs,” Sharapov said. He did not disclose the exact number of pieces Kiev requires but stressed that the “need for heavy artillery systems is measured by hundreds.” “We need artillery, we need artillery rounds, infantry fighting vehicles, combat vehicles, tanks. We really need air-defense systems and the multiple-launch rocket system,” he said. The supply of high-precision weapon systems is also important, Sharapov added, as the Ukrainian military believes that such systems would give it “an edge over the enemy, the upper hand in this war.” The deputy minister acknowledged the issues Western countries have to deal with while arranging weapons transfers to Ukraine, including obtaining permission for technology transfers from all the subsystems’ owners. However, Sharapov stressed “not all politicians understand the gravity of what is going on in Ukraine.” “That is why we would like to take this opportunity … to draw the attention of the entire world once again that this is a war not only back in Ukraine, this is the war that impacts the entire world,” he said. Karpenko was a bit more specific and gave an estimate of Ukraine’s needs. “Think about this: one brigade occupies around 40 kilometers of the fence line. That means that to cover the active combat conflict we need 40 brigades. Every brigade is 100 infantry fighting vehicles, 30 tanks, 54 artillery systems – just for one brigade, and we have 40 of them,” he explained. Meanwhile, Russia has been constantly warning the West against “pumping up” Ukraine with weapons, claiming that it will result in the prolongation of the conflict and to a variety of long-term problems. Moscow has also made it clear that its forces would consider any foreign weapons in Ukraine as a legitimate target. The disclosure of numbers of equipment losses came less than a week after Ukrainian presidential aide Alexey Arestovich revealed that the country's armed forces had lost around 10,000 personnel since the beginning of the Russian offensive in late February. Arestovich claimed, however, that Moscow’s losses are several times bigger. He offered no evidence to support his assertion. The figures released by the Russian Ministry of Defense on the Ukrainian Army’s losses are significantly higher than those cited by Arestovich – 23,367, as of April 18. Russia has not revealed its more recent losses – neither of equipment, nor of personnel. Earlier this month, the head of the Russian Duma’s defense committee, Andrey Kartapolov, claimed that, due to changes in military strategy, the Russian Army has “practically ceased to lose people.” That is why, he said, the Defense Ministry has not updated information on the losses since March, when it reported 1,351 military personnel had been killed. In April, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia had suffered “significant losses of troops” and it was “a huge tragedy.” Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557353-nuclear-putin-warning-west/,Putin issues a warning to ‘irresponsible’ Western politicians,"Russia is not threatening anyone with nuclear weapons but everyone should know what it has and what it could use if the need arose, Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a plenary session of the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) on Friday. Putin said he was aware that some “irresponsible” Western politicians, despite their seniority, have been “ranting” about Russia allegedly upping the nuclear ante. “What are we supposed to do? We respond accordingly. As soon as we answered, they cling to us and say: Here is Russia threatening. We do not threaten anything, but everyone should know what we have and what we will use if necessary to protect our sovereignty,” the Russian leader said. Two weeks ago, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said that “nobody should forget” about circumstances that could force Russia to use nuclear weapons, but also stressed that “no one wants nuclear war.” In an interview with Al Jazeera, Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chair of the Russian Security Council, said that while he doesn’t want to scare anyone, “when people say that something is impossible, because it is never possible, they are always wrong.” Prior to Medvedev, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the risk of atomic war was “serious, real, and we must not underestimate it.” His remarks were widely criticized in the West, with both US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair General Mark Milley accusing Russia of “nuclear saber-rattling.” Putin himself faced similar allegations from the West after escalating the alert status of Moscow’s nuclear forces soon after launching a military offensive in Ukraine in late February. Moscow has consistently denied accusations of ‘playing the nuclear card’, saying that such claims are part of an anti-Russia “propaganda campaign” launched by the West."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557346-putin-spief-speech-takeaways/,The old world is over: Key takeaways from Putin's first major speech since Russia's military offensive in Ukraine,"New centers of power have emerged, the unipolar world order isn’t coming back, and the “colonial” way of thinking has failed, Russian President Vladimir Putin told the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) on Friday, in what the Kremlin described as an “extremely important” speech. The old world order is gone with the windWhen the US declared victory in the Cold War, Americans designated themselves the “messengers of God on earth,” with interests that should be considered sacred and no obligations, Putin told the audience at SPIEF. New centers of power have since emerged, and have the right to protect their own systems, economic models, and sovereignty.These “truly revolutionary, tectonic changes in geopolitics, the global economy, in the technological sphere, in the entire system of international relations,” are “fundamental, pivotal and inexorable,” Putin said. “And it is a mistake to suggest that one can wait out the times of turbulent change and that things will return to normal; that everything will be as it was. It will not.” Anti-Russian sanctions backfired on the WestWhen the US and its allies launched the campaign to “cancel” Russia over the conflict in Ukraine, they hoped to crash and undermine the Russian economy and society. The sanctions have instead boomeranged on their creators, aggravating social and economic problems, driving up the cost of food, electricity and fuel, and hurting the quality of life across the West, but especially in Europe.“The European Union has completely lost its political sovereignty, and its bureaucratic elites are dancing to someone else’s tune, accepting whatever they are told from above, causing harm to their own population and their own economy,” Putin said.EU citizens will pay the price for “decisions divorced from reality and taken contrary to common sense,” he added, as direct losses from the sanctions alone could exceed $400 billion in one year. Energy prices and inflation are self-inflictedBlaming the high energy prices and inflation in the West on Russia – “Putin’s price hike,” as the White House put it – is “stupidity” and “designed for people who can’t read or write,” the Russian president said.“Don’t blame us, blame yourselves,” Putin said.The EU “blindly believing in renewable sources” and abandoning long-term natural gas contracts with Russia led to the spike in energy prices last year, according to the Russian leader. Meanwhile, both the US and the EU addressed the Covid-19 pandemic by printing trillions of dollars and euros. ‘Elite change’ awaits the WestPolicies undertaken by EU and US leaders are exacerbating inequalities and divisions in their societies, not just in terms of welfare but in terms of values and orientations of various groups, Putin said.“Such a detachment from reality, from the demands of society, will inevitably lead to a surge of populism and the growth of radical movements, to serious social and economic changes, to degradation and, in the near future, to a change of elites,” the Russian leader said. If there’s a famine, it won’t be Russia’s fault US and EU sanctions on Russia – in particular fertilizer and grain exports – are one of the reasons for growing global food insecurity, Putin pointed out. If there is famine in the world’s poorest countries, “this will be entirely on the conscience of the US administration and the European bureaucracy.” Troubles with food supply have arisen over the past several years – not months – due to the “short-sighted actions of those who are accustomed to solving their problems at someone else's expense,” distorting the trade flows by printing money in a sort of “predatory colonial policy,” Putin said. Russia is ready to send food to Africa and the Middle East, where the threat of famine is most acute, but faces “logistical, financial, transport” obstacles imposed by the West, he said. Reasons for the Ukraine conflictRussia sent troops into Ukraine in February because the West refused to abide by its obligations, and it was “simply impossible to reach any new agreements with them,” Putin said. The decision was “forced, but necessary,” as Russia had every right as a sovereign country to defend its security and protect its citizens and residents of Donbass from “genocide by the Kiev regime and neo-Nazis who received the full protection of the West.""The West spent years turning Ukraine into an “anti-Russia” state and pumping it with weapons and military advisers, Putin said, pointing out they “did not give a damn” about Ukraine’s economy or the lives of its people, but “spared no expense to create a NATO foothold in the east, directed against Russia, to cultivate aggression, hatred and Russophobia.""“All the objectives of the special military operation will be unconditionally achieved,” Putin said. Economic development is an expression of sovereigntyIn the 21st century, sovereignty can’t be partial, Putin argued. All of its elements are equally important and complement each other, and the economy is one of them. There are five key principles Russia will follow in economic development: Openness, freedom, social justice, infrastructure, and technological sovereignty.Russia will “never follow the path of self-isolation and autarky,” but will expand interactions with anyone who wishes to trade, Putin said, adding there are “many such countries.” Moscow will also support private enterprise, build and repair its transportation infrastructure, seek to reduce social inequality, and ensure its key technologies are not dependent on foreign imports.“Truly sovereign states are always committed to equal partnerships,” while “those who are weak and dependent, as a rule, are busy looking for enemies, planting xenophobia, or finally losing their originality, independence, blindly following the overlord,” he said."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557363-uk-major-military-training/,UK offers Ukraine major military training program,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has offered President Volodymyr Zelensky a major training program for Ukrainian forces, during his surprise trip to Kiev on Friday. During the visit, Johnson revealed his whereabouts by posting a photo of himself and Zelensky with a caption “Mr President, Volodymyr, It is good to be in Kyiv again.” The prime minister did not come to the capital of Ukraine empty-handed: he brought Zelensky a gift, Robert Hardman’s book ‘Queen Of Our Times.’ To the Ukrainian people: the UK is with you and we will be with you until you ultimately prevail. pic.twitter.com/5CU7Chl79L The book, however, was not the only thing the British prime minister came to Ukraine with. “The Prime Minister has offered to launch a major training operation for Ukrainian forces, with the potential to train up to 10,000 soldiers every 120 days,” Downing Street announced in a statement. According to the prime minister’s office, “the UK-led programme would train and drill the Armed Forces of Ukraine using battle-proven British Army expertise, allowing them to accelerate their deployment, rebuild their forces, and scale-up their resistance as they continue to defend their nation’s sovereignty against Russian invaders.” Over the program’s duration, each soldier would spend three weeks on the training course, learning battle-winning skills for the front line, as well as basic medical training, cyber-security and counter explosive tactics, Downing Street specified. If the offer is accepted by Kiev, the UK will invite international partners to host the program. Downing Street has stressed that during its previous training project called Operation Orbital which lasted from 2015 till February this year, the UK instructors trained more than 22,000 Ukrainian personnel. “The battle-winning skills taught during the seven-year programme enabled Ukrainian forces to launch a ferocious defence against Russia’s illegal and unprovoked invasion,” the statement reads. Zelensky, who described Johnson as a “great friend” of Ukraine, said that his negotiations with the British prime minister “were as sincere and substantive as possible.” “We talked about the need to increase the supply of heavy weapons and air defense systems, economic assistance, sanctions pressure on the aggressor, security guarantees for our state. We are preparing for the reconstruction of Ukraine after our victory. We have no doubt that we will win,” he said. Johnson was the first foreign leader to visit the capital of Ukraine after Russia launched its offensive on the neighboring country. This time the UK prime minister came to Kiev the next day after leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania. The UK has been one of the key supporters of Kiev in its fight against Russian forces. Britain has already pledged more than £1.3 billion in economic and humanitarian support to Ukraine, providing Kiev, among other things, with more than 5,000 NLAW anti-tank missiles, long-range multiple launch rocket systems, and artillery systems. Russia has consistently warned the West against “pumping up” Ukraine with weapons, saying that it would only prolong the conflict and create more longstanding problems. It also made it clear that it would consider any foreign weapons on the Ukrainian territory as a legitimate target.

2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557362-lavrov-bbc-eyes-west-mercenaries/,Russia doesn’t care what the West thinks – Lavrov,"The fate of British fighters captured in Ukraine and sentenced to death as mercenaries is for the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) to decide under international law, and Russia doesn’t care how that looks to the West, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told UK state broadcaster BBC in an interview on Thursday, on the sidelines of the annual Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF). Two British nationals – Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin – were among a trio of foreign fighters found guilty of being mercenaries by the Supreme Court in Donetsk last week. They were sentenced to death, alongside Moroccan citizen Saadun Ibrahim. When the BBC reporter asked Lavrov about them on Thursday, the Russian foreign minister said this was a matter for the DPR, which Moscow recognizes as an independent state and an ally. “In the eyes of the West, Russia is responsible for the fate of these people,” Rosenberg began, but Lavrov cut him off. I am not at all interested in the ‘eyes of the West.’ I am only interested in international law, according to which mercenaries are not combatants. So what’s in your eyes doesn’t matter. When Rosenberg protested that the two men were not mercenaries but had served in the Ukrainian military, Lavrov said that was a matter for the court – one as legitimate and as independent as the British courts. Asked if the British government had reached out to Moscow about the fate of Aslin and Pinner, Lavrov said he hadn’t heard of such a request. “They are used to doing everything in public. They began to declare that they were concerned about the fate of their subjects. I don’t know if they contacted us or not. They should talk to the DPR,” the foreign minister said. Lavrov also told BBC that relations between Moscow and London were dismal and described Britain as “a country that once again tries to sacrifice the interests of its people for the ambitions of politicians, who only think about the next election and nothing else.” British PM Boris Johnson, who just survived a no-confidence vote within his own party, arrived in Kiev on Friday to support Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557314-ukrainian-soldiers-frontline-donbass/,'Sent to certain death': Why growing numbers of Ukrainian servicemen are refusing to fight on the Donbass frontlines,"Ukrainian solders are increasingly abandoning their positions and posting videos with complaints about their command. Why is the number of desertions increasing in the war-torn country? The total assistance of Western countries to Ukraine has already exceeded the country’s military budget for 2022, which was to amount to $12 billion. And this is without taking into account humanitarian donations from ordinary citizens all over the world. Very soon, Ukraine will receive another $20 billion for its military needs from the United States. It would seem that this huge infusion of funds and incessant supply of weapons from abroad should solve all the problems of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. However, its soldiers are increasingly abandoning their positions without authorization, refusing to go to the frontline in Donbass, and publishing video messages online in which they criticize their commanders. In this article, RT looks into why, despite foreign aid to Ukraine, the number of problems involving the deployment of military personnel is growing, and why Ukrainian soldiers are deserting more and more frequently. A scandalous bill submitted by [Ukraine’s parliament] Verkhovna Rada deputy Mariana Bezugla, giving officers the right to execute servicemen for desertion, was withdrawn on May 24. However, the very appearance of such an initiative clearly indicates that the problem is real, and the authorities are sounding the alarm. Indeed, the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Donbass are increasingly facing situations where logistical support is simply non-existent: there is no ammunition, food, or artillery support. A lot of videos have recently appeared on the web that have been posted by the soldiers themselves. As a rule, they confirm their unauthorized departure from the frontline, while explaining their reasons. Many of these come from military personnel in the area of Severodonetsk and Lisichansk, where the most brutal battles are currently raging in the Donbass. Perhaps one of the most sensational videos, published on April 28, contained a message from members of the 79th Airborne Assault Brigade describing the brutality of their commanders. According to the commandos, the unit was taken to a forest near the village of Yampol in Donetsk region and left there to die. “We sat there for five or six days, and the commanders abandoned us... And now we are being made deserters for the fact that we survived... There are a lot of corpses still lying there in those pits.” They stressed that they had asked for help, but the commander gave the order to “go hand-to-hand against the tanks.” Now, the surviving paratroopers face trials for desertion. Interestingly, after the video was published, many readers in the Ukrainian segment of the internet began to declare that this news was fake, though even Ukrainian presidential advisor Alexey Arestovich confirmed it. However, a second video soon appeared, recorded by some paratroopers who confirmed the authenticity of the story in the first video and tried to explain why they had appealed to the Ukrainian people. “I will no longer wear the uniform of this brigade, and half of us guys here feel the same,” said paratrooper Andrey Berezinsky. Criticism of the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by servicemen has not been uncommon in recent months. The 115th Territorial Defense Brigade reported that the soldiers had not undergone any training on how to dig in under artillery and mortar fire. Soldiers in Severodonetsk recorded a video in which they complained to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valery Zaluzhny, about a lack of heavy weapons and reinforcements. The soldiers decried the incompetence of their commanders, who they said had remained in the rear. “We are simply being sent to certain death. There is no combat leadership, no combat commander, no respect for people.” Nevertheless, the military command did not appreciate that demarche and accused all the soldiers of ‘desertion.’ Consequently, a scandal broke out with the participation of the servicemen’s relatives, who appealed to the Office of the President of Ukraine for help. “My husband went to war as a volunteer, and now he’s sitting under shelling in Severodonetsk. There’s no command, they are their own commanders. And the people who left the brigade have been put in jail as deserters. How?! How can they fight without anything? With shovels perhaps, or with what?” said one of the military wives. “The 115th Brigade are not deserters! They just throw them in like cannon fodder. They are taking on tanks with machine guns from the 80s. Why are they dying? So that those sitting in HQ can receive stars?” another woman expressed with indignation. In early June, Radio France Internationale reported from a location near Severodonetsk that “decline is brewing” in the Armed Forces of Ukraine as the fighting in Donbass intensifies. “A movement of discontent is emerging among the soldiers: they are increasingly complaining about a lack of supplies and support from their command,” it noted, adding that the soldiers near Lisichansk describe what is happening at the front as “hell on Earth.” One of the main problems that greatly demoralizes soldiers remains supply. Sergeant Roman Ilchenko directly stated to French journalists that “the Russians have artillery, armored vehicles, and their forces are five to six times greater than ours… We only had machine guns and RPGs from 1986. A Degtyarov machine gun from 1943. And the Maxim machine gun from 1933. We also have a Swedish portable NLAW anti-tank missile system, but the battery did not work. This is all we had,” Vladimir Kharchuk, a member of the 20th Battalion, said, describing his last operation. Serviceman Andrey Shevchenko believes that if the Armed Forces of Ukraine does not strengthen its artillery, it won’t be able to do anything. Earlier, another major foreign media outlet had reported on the Ukrainian Army’s supply problems. At the end of May, The Washington Post reported on the arrest of Ukrainian company commander Sergei Lapko, who had recently given an interview to the newspaper. The officer told WaPo about the extremely difficult situation at the front, particularly in the area of Severodonetsk and Lisichansk. The Ukrainian General Staff, as well as the chairman of the Lugansk regional Military Administration, Sergey Gaidai, had also reported on the difficult situation of the Ukrainian military in the Lugansk Region. Indeed, there is a constant flow of such messages coming from Ukrainian soldiers right now, but Lapko’s story added a lot of details to the picture of what is actually happening. “Before being sent to the front, we were handed AK-47 assault rifles and had a training session that lasted less than half an hour. When we had fired 30 bullets, we were told we would not get more because ammunition is too expensive,” he said. When his company was sent to Donbass, twenty people refused immediately and were arrested for desertion. “When we were coming here, we were told that we would be in the third line of defense. Instead, we went to the zero line, the frontline. We didn’t know where we were going.” Of his company of 120 men, only 54 remained in the ranks – the rest either died, were wounded, or deserted. “We see on Ukrainian television that there are no losses. It’s not true,” the commander said. He believes the losses are kept secret in order to preserve the morale of soldiers and the general public. The soldier noted that, despite all the difficulties, their troops fought bravely, but the combat had dealt heavy damage to his company, as well as to other units in the area. The Washington Post writes that most of the deaths had occurred because wounded soldiers were not evacuated quickly enough, often waiting 12 hours for transport to the Lisichansk military hospital. The soldier touched on relations with the command separately. “Our command does not assume any responsibility. They take credit only for our achievements. They don’t give us any support,” he said. He also complained about problems with water and poor nutrition – the servicemen had to be content with one potato a day. A few hours after the interview was published, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) detained several people from Lapko’s company on charges of desertion. The company commander himself was suspended from duty and placed in a pre-trial detention center in Lisichansk, and his further fate has not been reported. However, after his resonant interview, the Ukrainian media began to pay closer attention to video messages of soldiers describing problems at the front. As with other countries’ armed forces, there are legislative provisions in Ukraine that hold military personnel legally responsible for desertion – article 408 of the Criminal Code. Moreover, desertion under martial law or in a combat situation provides for fairly harsh punishment – from five to twelve years in prison. However, these measures have not stopped the soldiers in some units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from leaving their positions. Even in the initial period of the conflict, individual soldiers voluntarily left their units. Unable to withstand the harsh conditions, they decided independently to escape from the front. The first cases of group desertion began at the end of April and were associated with the deterioration of the situation for the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Donbass. At that time, the Russian Ministry of Defense stated that more than 860 soldiers had deserted from the units of the National Guard of Ukraine. We have already written about a case when a whole platoon of the 115th Territorial Defense Brigade appealed to Zelensky and Zaluzhny with a refusal to carry out a combat mission near Severodonetsk. Later, a similar statement was recorded by units of the 58th Brigade and the 46th separate rifle battalion. The soldiers accused the command of throwing them into a hopeless situation as cannon fodder in order to plug the most problematic areas of the front. They had been on their way to Zaporozhye, but eventually ended up at the front near Popasna – one of the hottest spots in Donbass. They did not have heavy weapons, no supplies arrived, and the command turned out to be incompetent. As a result, they suffered heavy losses and had to retreat from their positions. Literally at the same time, another recording appeared from Donbass, where the servicemen of the 71st Jaeger Brigade directly refused to carry out an order from their officers to enter the battlefield unarmed against guns and howitzers and to shoot it on video. The soldiers considered the order “criminal” and left the positions. “We stand with machine guns against cannons, Grads, and mortars. No one helps us. We don’t have any sensible weapons, there is nothing. How can we fight for a country that doesn’t care about us?” complains one of the soldiers. “We don’t want to go into the meat grinder and come out ground beef. We don’t have tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, guns…,” a second echoes. At the end of the appeal, the fighters added that they only have a couple dozen mortars and these “only work when they want to.” Zelensky also received an appeal from servicemen of unit 7093 attached to the Ukrainian Army’s 57th Brigade, who also did not like it at the front. They complained about a lack of heavy weapons and the absence of officers, most of whom had died during the fighting around Lugansk. These resonant cases indicate that, in addition to members of territorial defense units, members of regular Ukrainian Army units are also withdrawing from their positions. In other words, even if the Ukrainian Army has enough personnel to form new brigades, it doesn’t have the minimum number of armored vehicles to supply them, so it’s impossible to create combat-ready formations from the conscripts. At the same time, scandals are jarring the deep rear as well. Far from the combat in Stry in the Lviv Region, the relatives of fighters in the 65th battalion of the Territorial Defense’s 103rd Brigade staged a protest when they caught the unit’s commander in the town while their men were fighting on the frontline. They stated that they had been sent straight to Donbass, unprepared and without weapons, instead of protecting the Lviv Region. At a meeting with representatives of the Territorial Defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the soldiers’ relatives demanded that the men be returned home because, according to them, they are not ready to conduct combat. “The unprepared fighters were given a machine gun and two grenades and sent to stop an army that far exceeded our soldiers,” Valentina Mamon from Stry complained. “They went to the front in their cars, which they also had to refuel themselves. They spent several hours in pits with machine guns. And, most importantly, they shot at their own retreaters. It’s good that there were no casualties. When the volunteers brought in walkie-talkies, the battalion headquarters took them away,” added Galina Sidor. Many of the women also say that unprepared fighters were thrown in to stop the enemy “with their bare hands.” Protests have also spread to another region in western Ukraine –Transcarpathia. In Khust, women attacked a military commissar for the fact that their men had been sent to Donbass without bulletproof vests or helmets. They accused the military enlistment office of violations and bribery. According to their information, you can get out of being sent to Donbass for $3,000. There have also been claims that people with chronic heart disease or asthma are being sent to the front. “On what basis were these unprepared people, who did not pass the medical examination, being conscripted and sent to the front? Specifically my husband, who’s had a heart attack and needs a heart transplant,” said Inna Salautina, the wife of one of the servicemen in the 101st Territorial Defense Brigade. Nevertheless, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense is in no hurry to admit its mistakes, although earlier the ministry said it would not send people to the front without prior training. At the same time, the command notes that sending territorial defense troops to Donbass from the country’s western regions is legal. “There is an existing law, amended on January 27, according to which, by order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Territorial Defense battalions can be involved in performing tasks outside their regions on certain grounds” said Vitaly Kupri, adviser to the Commander of the Territorial Defense Forces. *** Numerous cases of desertion and complaints about supplies, along with losses and voluntary surrenders, indicate that the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the defense in Donbass are experiencing great problems. Videos are increasingly appearing from the frontline in which soldiers confirm that they are deserting. Obviously, the situation for the Armed Forces of Ukraine in this region suffers when positions are abandoned without authorization. Despite foreign aid, with the prolongation of hostilities, such cases are likely to become more and more common, as fatigue, economic problems, as well as corruption, make themselves felt."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557355-ukraine-visa-regime-russian-citizens/,Ukraine to impose visa requirements on Russians,"Kiev is about to impose visa requirements for all Russian citizens entering Ukrainian territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced in his Telegram channel on Friday. The government has said it has already approved the presidential proposal. Zelensky has cited ""unprecedented threats to the national security, sovereignty and territorial integrity"" of Ukraine as he justified the need to terminate the 1997 agreement between Moscow and Kiev facilitating visa-free travel for the citizens of the two nations. ""Starting from July 1, 2022, Ukraine will impose a visa regime for … Russian citizens,"" the president announced. Prime Minister Denis Shmigal, who has confirmed later on Friday that the government is supporting the president's decision, has described the move a total break-up between the two neighbors. ""We are severing all ties with Russia,"" the prime minister told journalists. The move comes amid the ongoing Russian military operation in Ukraine. Moscow has not commented on Kiev's decision so far. Kiev has previously –and repeatedly– barred male Russian citizens from entering Ukrainian territory. Such actions were taken in 2014 when the conflict in Donbass had flared up. Then-President Petro Poroshenko did it again in 2018, citing a threat, that of ""private armies"" forming on Ukrainian territory. However, Ukraine has never gone so far as to terminate the 1997 agreement. Russia attacked its neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow's eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/news/557351-russia-sanctions-ivan-timofeev-spief/,Sanctions against Russia to remain no matter what – foreign policy expert,"The extensive sanctions placed on Moscow will most likely remain in place even if there is a ceasefire or a political resolution to the Ukrainian conflict, one of Russia’s leading foreign policy analysts, Ivan Timofeev, has told RT. The expert was speaking on the sidelines of the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum on Friday. Timofeev, who serves as the program director at the Kremlin-backed Valdai discussion forum, argued that the EU was a “huge vessel” that was very difficult to turn, and that because it had already “turned away from Russia,” it was difficult to imagine that things could ever go back to the way they were before February 2022, when Moscow launched its military offensive against Ukraine. According to Timofeev, the sanctions have also not yet taken their full effect. While Russia is still feeling “quite good” as oil prices have risen, Timofeev notes that it could still only be a matter of time before Moscow is faced with problems, unless it redirects its attention to markets in Asia, especially countries like India and China. Gas, meanwhile, is a “completely different” subject, says the expert, since Europe can’t easily get rid of Russian gas as it has little means of getting it elsewhere and lacks the technical capabilities of receiving liquefied gas from countries like the US. Nevertheless, Timofeev stressed that Moscow should still think about “strategic decisions of redirecting our gas supply on the international markets,” as “policy and politics will press the economy in the nearest future.” After noting that energy cooperation between Russia and the West will likely be complicated for quite some time, Timofeev also stressed that food security has become an issue as international businesses are afraid of engaging with Russia. “Food security is an interesting issue,” noted Timofeev. “In relation to Russia, sanctions are formally not covering the Russian exports of food. Formally – this is a keyword. The US Department of Treasury has even issued a general license which allows businesses to conduct financial transactions even with sanctioned Russian persons if these transactions are related to food security – to grain or any other kind of food. However, businesses are very scared. Businesses are convinced that it’s easier to completely abandon dealings with Russia as such, rather than face the enforcement of secondary sanctions from the US.” Timofeev highlighted two major problems with the export of Russian grain – the decline of financial transactions related to Russian grain exports, and the refusal of vessel owners to transport the grain to countries like Egypt over the perceived threat of American sanctions. The specialist noted that this has all resulted in a “paradoxical situation,” where the US Treasury is trying to encourage businesses to engage in the export of Russian grain, saying “It is legal, you can do this,” but the businesses, looking at past experiences with US sanctions, are choosing to abstain. Timofeev concluded by stating that the current economic crisis has shown that Russia is actually quite an important player in the international economy. “Before this crisis there had been numerous assessments that the Russian economy is almost nothing in the global landscape because the percentage of Russia in the global GDP is quite tiny, less than two percent,” he said. “But, at the same time, if you look at the reality, Russia is [the] number 11 economy. But what is more important is that Russia is critical in a number of spheres – in energy, agriculture, food, arms supplies, and a number of tech chains and supply chains.” In the end, the fallout from the West’s sanctions against a seemingly inconsequential country like Russia, according to Timofeev, turned out to be much bigger than “their linear logic had implied before.” However, while the international economy will eventually get through this crisis, Timofeev surmised, it’s important to understand that the current issues are the result of the “accidental combination” of a multitude of factors and not solely the result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557350-crimea-russia-ukraine-military/,Kiev is relying on military solution for Crimea – official,"Ukraine is now relying on a military means when it comes to “returning” Crimea, the Ukrainian presidential representative for the region, Tamila Tasheva said on Friday, explaining that the Russian military offensive has prompted Kiev to largely leave behind its diplomatic strategy for the peninsula’s “deoccupation.” In an interview with Ukraine 24 TV, Tasheva said that “in any case, with any plans, the military will be the first to enter the territory of Crimea.” “The question of Crimea, the approach to returning the territory changed after February 24. We understand that, in any case, we now rely primarily on the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” Tasheva said. She added that Kiev’s “unambiguous key position” is to ensure the return of the country’s territories, including Crimea, Donetsk and Lugansk regions, to the borders of 1991, “without any ultimatums for the Ukrainian side.” She admitted that some of Ukraine’s partners are encouraging Kiev to go for compromises - something that, according to Tasheva, the country’s government is not prepared for. When asked what would happen to the Russian citizens living in Crimea, Tasheva stressed that she “wouldn’t talk about ‘cleansing’ but would rather talk about people who are illegally staying on our territory.” She claimed that, in accordance with Ukrainian law and international norms, the Russians who arrived in Crimea after 2014, could be expelled from the peninsula. Tasheva’s remarks came a day after Ukraine’s Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov said that Kiev, using US-supplied weapons, is going to “liberate” all land lost to Russia, including Crimea. The region, which voted overwhelmingly in a 2014 referendum to reunite with Russia, “is a strategic objective for Ukraine because it’s Ukrainian territory,” Reznikov told CNN. “But we will move step by step,” he added. The first stage in Kiev’s plan is to stabilize the situation on the ground, according to Reznikov. During the second stage, Russian forces would be pushed back to the lines they occupied before the ongoing military operation. The minister stressed that only after that would Kiev be able to begin discussions with its foreign partners on “how to liberate territories.” Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also vowed to “liberate” Crimea and the Republics of Donetsk (DPR) and Lugansk (LPR), which are recognized by Russia as independent states. So far Russian forces, which have an overwhelming advantage in artillery and other arms, are steadily gaining land in Donbass. Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, following Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557322-prospect-ukraines-eu-accession/,"As the bloc faces a looming energy crisis, are EU leaders using potential membership to rein in Ukraine's Zelensky?","When the leaders of the three leading EU countries – Germany, France, and Italy – took a train to Kiev to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky, this week, the public show was one of solidarity and support. But there could be much more to the visit than meets the eye. The politicians, who were also joined in Ukraine by Romania’s president, represent the bloc’s economic engine, which right now is stalling under the its own anti-Russia sanctions. Themselves a knee-jerk ideological response to the conflict in Ukraine. Now, it’s their own political interests back home that are now increasingly in peril as this conflict drags on and drives up the cost of daily living for the average EU citizen through record high gas prices and inflation. And the situation just seems to be getting worse as the unforeseen consequences pile up. This week, Russia’s Gazprom announced an overall reduction of 40% in Russian gas deliveries to Europe via the Nord Stream pipeline, citing Siemens’ failure to return repaired gas pumps. The German company explained that Canadian anti-Russian sanctions prevented the return of the units from a factory in Montreal. So it’s hardly surprising that French President Emmanuel Macron, whose centrist parliamentary majority is in a tight election race this weekend against a left-leaning coalition, has pivoted his recent rhetoric towards more of an emphasis on negotiated peace over continued armed conflict. “At some point, when we will have done our maximum to help Ukraine resist – when, as is my wish, it will have won and the firing has ceased – we will have to negotiate,” Macron said this week. “The president of Ukraine and its leaders will have to negotiate with Russia.” Macron has come under fire from Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky himself, who accused France of pressuring him to cede disputed territory or to make other concessions to end the conflict. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has also been chastised by Ukrainian officials for dragging his feet in delivering promised weapons. But Scholz is sending a pretty strong message to Ukrainian officials as they wait around for their promised German weapons to arrive and end up feeling and acting like jilted boyfriends who were stood-up on a date. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, proposed a four-point peace plan last month which served, if nothing else, to at least project his government’s desire for peace rather than continued conflict. The EU has placed itself in a tough spot. It has promised total support to Ukraine and Zelensky, but seems to have come to the realization that peace can’t realistically be achieved by giving Zelensky everything that he asks for – and that a resolution to the conflict is going much more likely to come via negotiations than through prolonging the fighting in the hopes of a Ukrainian victory. In this sense, they view things differently than Washington, which stands to benefit from the rupture of economic and political relations between the EU and Russia. Then there's some of the Eastern European EU members, who are vociferous supporters of Kiev. However, they are net recipients of Brussels' largesse and therefore aren’t likely to be stuck footing the bill for the current mess. Macron said during a joint news conference in Kiev that the three leaders “are doing everything so that Ukraine alone can decide its fate.” Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi added that their main message in talks with Zelensky was that they want to see Ukraine as part of the bloc. France, Germany, Italy and Romania have all now called for an immediate grant to Ukraine of EU-member candidate status. Becoming a full member of the EU could take years, 15 to 20 years, as Macron’s Minister for European Affairs, Clement Beaune, has said. Macron himself has told the French parliament that it could take “several decades.” No one realistically thinks that this is going to be a quick process. No country that has foreign-trained Neo-Nazis folded into its army, or holding any kind of political influence, as they do in Ukraine, is going to be given the EU’s rubber stamp. Nor is a country whose leader demands deadly weapons every time he shows up on a Zoom call. But dangling the ‘carrot’ of EU membership in front of Zelensky, who frankly is a loose cannon, is one way to get him under control and get him to the negotiating table on the EU’s terms. The notion of EU candidacy – which Zelensky has made clear he desperately wants – gives the EU leverage, all while being able to maintain that “Ukraine alone is deciding its fate,” as Macron says, and gives Zelensky a face-saving reason to seek an end to the conflict."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557343-ukraine-nuclear-war-risk/,Ukraine not worth nuclear war – former Reagan adviser,"The US has nothing to gain from a nuclear-armed Ukraine, and should work to bring the conflict there to a “speedy close,” Doug Bandow, a former assistant to President Ronald Reagan, wrote on Thursday. His warning came after a Polish MEP suggested the West should give Kiev nuclear weapons. Radoslaw Sikorski, who served as Poland’s foreign minister between 2007 and 2014, told Ukrainian TV last week that “the West has the right to give Ukraine nuclear warheads.” Sikorski argued that as Moscow allegedly violated the 1994 Budapest Memorandum – in which Russia, the US and the UK promised to “respect the independence and sovereignty” of Ukraine in exchange for Kiev surrendering its nukes – Ukraine’s backers could now send these weapons of mass destruction to Ukraine. “The fact that a once-serious political figure would advocate turning the ongoing conflict into a nuclear confrontation demonstrates how dangerous that conflict has become,” Bandow wrote in the American Conservative. According to Bandow, Ukraine knew when it signed the Budapest Memorandum that its security guarantees depended on the UN Security Council, on which Russia has a permanent seat. “Ukraine’s opportunity passed long ago,” he continued, arguing that transferring nuclear weapons to Kiev at present “would risk turning an already terrible conflict into a true catastrophe.” “Moscow has more at stake, and therefore always will be willing to pay and risk more. The US has nothing at stake that warrants risking Kiev’s nuclear annihilation,” Bandow wrote. This position is similar to that of former President Barack Obama, who despite his State Department overseeing a violent coup against Ukraine’s democratically elected government in 2014, told an interviewer two years later that Ukraine “is a core Russian interest but not an American one, so Russia will always be able to maintain escalatory dominance there.” “Now, if there is somebody in this town that would claim that we would consider going to war with Russia over Crimea and eastern Ukraine, they should speak up and be very clear about it,” Obama said. While Sikorski’s nuclear idea has thus far been a non-starter, and has led to a sharp rebuke from the Kremlin, the US and its allies continue to underwrite Kiev’s military costs. After passing a mammoth $40 billion package of military and economic aid for Ukraine last month, US President Joe Biden announced an additional $1 billion in arms for Kiev’s beleaguered forces on Wednesday. Yet behind the apparent blank check for Ukraine, rumors are circulating that the US and its Western allies may soon push Ukraine to sue for peace. A recent CNN report claimed that officials in Washington, London and Brussels are meeting without their Ukrainian counterparts in an effort to plan a ceasefire and peace settlement, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also claimed that unnamed foreign parties have been trying to “push us a little” toward a deal with Moscow. Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has raised the prospect of Ukraine surrendering some territory in exchange for peace, an idea also floated by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger last month. According to Bandow, the Biden administration should put “a premium on attempting to bring the Russo-Ukrainian war to a speedy close. The longer it continues, the greater the harm to Ukraine, threat to Europe, and danger to America. And the more people might be tempted to try extreme ideas like Sikorski’s.”"
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557336-lukashenko-poland-western-ukraine/,Lukashenko warns Poland over western Ukraine,"Belarus believes that Poland is considering taking over the western part of Ukraine, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said on Friday. He warned Warsaw against such a move, warning his country would have to intervene if it did. “We cannot allow the Poles to encircle us,” he said. “As I once said, the Ukrainians and the Russians will ask us to preserve [Ukraine’s] integrity. So that [Poles] don’t take a bite out of it.” Belarus facilitated Russia’s military campaign against Ukraine by allowing its troops to use its territory, but declined to deploy its own troops to the battlefield. Speaking during a visit to a factory, Lukashenko claimed that Western powers, Poland in particular, would like to drag his nation into the conflict. Warsaw acts boldly because it is being armed and financed by the US, he said. “That is why I have to keep the armed forces on high alert in the west and in the south,” he said. “I have deployed 10 units along the border behind the border guard, so that nobody gets inside Belarus.” Lukashenko reiterated that he had no desire to get involved in Ukraine and would not do so unless his hand was forced. “We are not going anywhere as long as you don’t cross the red line. If you cross the border or target the Mozyr oil refinery, we will respond at once,” he said, claiming that some people in the West have suggested acting against the Belarusian plant. He expressed concern about the possible escalation of the conflict in Ukraine due to the West’s supply of heavy arms to Kiev. “The Ukrainians, [President Volodymyr] Zelensky are asking for longer-range weapons to strike Russian cities,” he alleged, contradicting assurances to the contrary made by Ukrainian officials. “This cannot be allowed. Because otherwise Russia would use weapons of the new level. Use them against Kiev, against those who take such decisions,” Lukashenko added, without clarifying which weapons he was referring to. Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557337-lavrov-uk-relations-room/,Britain wants to ‘bring Russia to its knees’ – Lavrov,"There is no way of improving Russian-British relations while London wants to bring Moscow “to its knees,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said. He was answering a question from the UK's state broadcaster BBC, on Thursday, about the dismal state of relations. “I don’t think there’s even room for maneuver left anymore,” Lavrov replied. “Because both [Prime Minister Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say publicly: ’We must defeat Russia, we must bring Russia to its knees. Go on, then, do it.” Asked about how Moscow currently sees Britain, Lavrov said: “A country that once again tries to sacrifice the interests of its people for the ambitions of politicians, who only think about the next election and nothing else.” The UK is among many countries that have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in response to its military campaign in Ukraine. London has supplied Kiev with weapons, including surface-to-air and anti-tank missiles. Truss argued last month that Russia’s actions in Ukraine “must be met with force.” “We must be adamant in ensuring the victory of Ukraine with military assistance and sanctions. Now we can no longer take our foot off the gas pedal,” she said. In February, the UK blacklisted Lavrov, as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin. In April, Russia sanctioned Johnson, Truss and other senior members of the British government for “unprecedented hostile actions.” They have been banned from entering the country."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557327-foreign-fighters-ukraine-statistics/,Russia reveals number of foreign combatants fighting in Ukraine,"Kiev’s claims that tens of thousands of foreign nationals have traveled to Ukraine to join its fight against Moscow are exaggerated, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Friday. It released what it claimed to be accurate numbers of “mercenaries” fighting on Kiev’s side, including those who have died on the battlefield. According to the statistics, a total of 6,956 foreign citizens from 64 nations arrived in Ukraine to become pro-Kiev combatants between February 24 and June 17. Some 1,956 of those have been killed, while 1,779 have left the country, the ministry said. According to the Russian figures, the largest number of fighters came from Poland, with 1,831 of its citizens joining the Ukrainian ranks. The Eastern European nation was followed by Canada, the US, Romania and the UK in terms of the number of citizens traveling to Ukraine to fight. Between 422 and 601 people came from each of those four nations, the Russian military claimed. More than 100 fighters joined Kiev’s forces from each of Georgia, Croatia, Syria, Belarus, France, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia, Albania, Lithuania and Portugal, the report stated. Partially recognized Kosovo was the source of 156 fighters. Nigeria was the biggest African source of combatants, with 85 of them arriving from the country to take part in combat. In general, soldiers from European nations had a higher retention rate than their counterparts from other parts of the world, the data suggests. Almost 65% of the Polish fighters remain in Ukraine, compared to 45% of Canadians, and less than 17% of Americans. However, that is not true of every European nation. According to the numbers, of the 36 Swedish nationals who went to Ukraine, 30 have left and just one is still fighting. Of the 33 people from the Czech Republic, 14 have died and 15 remain in Ukraine. The Russian ministry said its data proved that Ukrainian claims about a huge number of foreigners joining the conflict were exaggerated. The actual number of foreigners in the country is dwindling fast, it claimed. “Despite its effort to increase the compensation, Kiev’s leadership is unable to stop the process of departure of the mercenaries to the better world or to their nations of residence,” it said, commenting on the data dump. Kiev denies hiring mercenaries and says its foreign fighters are volunteers who want to defend Ukraine from Russian aggression. Ukrainian officials claimed they received 20,000 applications to join its “foreign legion” in the first weeks of recruitment. In an interview with the British press this week, the commander of Ukraine’s “Georgian legion” claimed that the same number of foreign combatants was still on the ground in the country, with as many as 3,000 Britons alone fighting for Kiev. The official status of foreign fighters in Ukraine becomes significant when they are captured by the opposite side. Two British nationals and a citizen of Morocco were sentenced to death last week by a court in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), which Moscow recognizes as a sovereign state. Both Moscow and Donetsk said they considered the defendants to be guns for hire, who are thus not protected as legitimate combatants under international law."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557334-putin-warns-of-elites-change/,Russian president predicts 'change of elites' in West,"Economic mistakes are creating the conditions in the EU for deepening inequality, a surge of radicalism, and, eventually, a “change of elites,” Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Friday. Speaking at the plenary session of the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), the Russian leader argued that all the current talk in the West about so-called ‘Putin's inflation’ was designed “for those who cannot read and write.” The term has been previously used by US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. “The European Union has completely lost its political sovereignty, and its bureaucratic elites are dancing to someone else’s tune, accepting whatever they are told from above, causing harm to their own population and their own economy,” Putin said. In the Russian leader’s opinion, the policy of EU authorities will deepen the split in the West not only on economic matters but also on its values system. “Such a detachment from reality, from the demands of society, will inevitably lead to a surge of populism and the growth of radical movements, to serious social and economic changes, to degradation, and in the near future, to a change of elites,” Putin said. The term ‘Putin’s inflation’ describes inflation resulting from difficulties with energy supply, logistics, and exchange rates allegedly caused by the Russian military offensive in Ukraine and sanctions imposed on Moscow by Western countries. The Russian president has previously accused EU leaders of committing economic “suicide” by attempting to give up Russian energy."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/news/557331-putin-changes-ukraine-spief/,Previous world order won't return – Putin,"Those who believe that things will go back to the way they were before the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine are wrong, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. “It is a mistake to suggest that the times of turbulent changes can be waited out and that things will return to normal; that everything will be as it was. It won’t,” Putin insisted during his speech at the the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) on Friday. The changes that the world is going through at the moment are fundamental, radical, and irreversible, he added. However, the ruling elites of some Western countries refuse to notice this obvious shift and choose to “cling to the shadows of the past,” he added. “For example, they believe that the dominance of the West in global politics and economy is a constant, eternal value,” Putin said. But “nothing is eternal,” he reminded everyone. Since claiming victory in the Cold War in the early 1990s, the US has “declared itself the messenger of God on Earth, who has no obligations, but only interests, and those interests are pronounced to be sacred,” the president said. However, the idea of a unipolar world is flawed at its core, according to the Russian leader, as the norms of international relations can’t always be interpreted in favor of a single nation, “even if it’s a strong one.” It seems as if Washington refuses to see the new centers of power that have emerged in recent decades and which have every right to “protect their interests and ensure their national sovereignty,” he said."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557328-moldova-eu-russia-lavrov/,Ukraine’s neighbor accused of ‘extortion’,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has accused Moldova of using its aspirations to join the EU as an “extortion” tactic in talks on Russian gas. “It’s essentially extortion: if you don’t do this, we’ll join the European [Union] quicker. And if you do, we’ll still join, but at a slower pace. Those are the signals I’m getting,” Lavrov told Russia’s NTV channel on Thursday. He added that Brussels and Washington “are clearly trying to turn Moldova into a second Ukraine” by “shaping the country in an anti-Russian way.” Moldovan President Maia Sandu denied using the prospects of joining the EU as leverage against Moscow. She said on Friday that Russia could use “gas and other tools” to pressure Moldova. Moldova, which relies heavily on Russian gas, has racked up an estimated $709 million in debts and overdue payments, according to Gazprom. On Friday, the European Commission recommended that Moldova be granted candidate status, a first step in the lengthy process of becoming an EU member. The decision could be finalized at an EU meeting next week. Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister Nicu Popescu reiterated this week that integration with the EU remains “a priority.” The official added that Moldova was studying whether it should leave the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a regional bloc made up of former Soviet countries, including Russia."

NATO is Washington’s tool, and it is ready to wage war in Eastern Europe, he told his counterparts from members of a regional security organization. “Turning Eurasia into a conflagration space of warring nations, which would be turned into puppet colonial states similar to Ukraine, is a long-term goal for the West,” the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolay Patrushev, said. The dire warning was addressed to his opposite numbers from member states of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), who’d gathered in Armenia. He said attempts to disrupt regional integration organizations like the CSTO, made by the US and its allies, served as proof of their intentions. Patrushev pointed to NATO as the main vehicle for the alleged Western plot to diminish Russia and its neighbors. The bloc “is used as a tool of foreign policy by a single nation,” he said. “This is done in an aggressive manner that further degrades an already difficult state of international security,” he assessed. NATO’s expansion in Eastern Europe has already placed its military infrastructure next door to Russia and Belarus, the official said. He expressed concern about the rapid military buildup in the region, arguing it had disturbing ramifications for the region’s security. “It’s obvious that NATO perceives Eastern Europe as the most likely theater of war,” he said. Western nations claim that NATO is a purely defensive organization and that its increased military activities in Europe were a reaction to Russia’s aggressive behavior. Moscow says the US and its European allies have repeatedly broken their promises not to expand NATO eastward, creating an ever-serious threat to Russian national security. Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, citing NATO’s creeping expansion into the neighboring country as one of the reasons. The relationship between Moscow and the West has plunged to a new low after that, with an unprecedented number of economic sanctions imposed against Russia in an attempt to hurt its economy. Washington has declared a “strategic defeat” of Moscow as its goal in Ukraine."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557271-european-politicians-ignore-context/,"Hendrik Weber: As a politician, I tried to be a voice of reason on Ukraine. For that, my party expelled me","Western countries have found themselves in a difficult situation since the beginning of the special military operation in Ukraine. Almost all of their governments condemn the “invasion of Ukraine” by Russian troops. I am convinced that the current situation in Western countries is very tense and aggressive. However, a fact-based analysis of the situation is hardly possible, as the debate is conducted extremely emotionally. This would be more understandable if we had not seen a coup d’etat in Ukraine in 2014 and a civil war that continued for almost eight years. The Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics proclaimed their independence from the Ukrainian central state in 2014, after in April of that year Kiev’s military launched its so-called “Anti-Terrorist Operation” against them. Then, this February, almost eight years after the start of the civil war, Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to recognize the two republics as independent states. While people in Donbass were asking why the recognition had taken so long, Western states and governments were outraged. Putin did not take his decision to recognize the two republics lightly, because he did not want to jeopardize the Minsk agreements of 2014. But when it became clear that the negotiations between Russia, the US and NATO, hinted at in December 2021, would be fruitless and all signs were pointing to a major offensive by Kiev against Donbass, Russia felt compelled to act. Since the beginning of the military operation, we have been hearing from our media that Ukraine can win the fight against Russia. This has little to do with sober military analysis, because the bare figures alone prove that Russia is a superior military power, against which the corrupt and underfunded Ukrainian Army stands no chance. Nevertheless, the media keep the Western consumer in a kind of suspense, waiting for the Russian advance to finally be halted. In the West, anyone who so much as tries to understand the Russian point-of-view will be mercilessly attacked and called a supporter of a “war of aggression.” I have been to Russia, to Crimea and to the Donetsk People’s Republic many times. In March of this year, the board of my party, Norway’s left-wing Rodt, for which I sat on a municipal council, initiated an exclusion procedure against me because of a Facebook post congratulating the Donbass republics on their recognition by Russia, which I had made before the military operation began. I was expelled, and other members of the party were informed about it by email even before I received the decision. In a total of eight newspaper articles published in Norway, I was accused of supporting “Putin’s war against Ukraine.” My fiancee then lost her job and her contract was not renewed on the grounds that, with my attitude, I would work against the Norwegian state policy. I’m not the only one. Professors and researchers who are trying to analyze and understand the Russian point of view are accused of being under the influence of the government in Moscow. Researchers who were considered neutral or critical of Russia yesterday are deemed too naive and friendly to Russia today. Anyone who has not clearly and vocally chosen the side of Ukraine will be mercilessly attacked and called a supporter of Russian “aggression.” The notion of diplomacy seems to have been cast aside, because neither the European Union nor the United States see the need to bring Kiev or Moscow to the negotiating table, quite the contrary. During my last visit to Crimea in the beginning of June this year, it became very clear to me that we – the West and Russia – live in two different worlds. Neither the people nor the government in Crimea have the slightest doubt that the Russian military will decide the situation in Ukraine in their favor. In this context, most people are already talking about the “former Ukraine” and assume that individual referendums in the various regions will lead to parts of Ukraine declaring themselves independent and then integration into the Russian Federation will take place. Among other things, cooperation between Russian universities and colleges in the “liberated territories” of Ukraine is already in full swing. Those who close their eyes to the situation in Ukraine and ignore the context of the years preceding the Russian military operation, the coup of 2014 and the resulting civil war, as well as the geopolitical contexts and interests in the background, can hardly understand the current situation. But Western media and governments don’t seem interested in understanding it. The constant media reports about small successes of Ukrainian troops will not change anything in the big picture. It would be better to recognize the realities both in Ukraine and in Russia soon, in order to be able to deduce the best course of action to end the conflict."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557307-poroshenko-comments-minsk-agreement/,Minsk deal was used to buy time – Ukraine's Poroshenko,"Petro Poroshenko has admitted that the 2015 ceasefire in Donbass, which he negotiated with Russia, France and Germany as president of Ukraine, was merely a distraction intended to buy time for Kiev to rebuild its military. He made the comments in interviews with several news outlets this week, including Germany’s Deutsche Welle television and the Ukrainian branch of the US state-run Radio Free Europe. Poroshenko also defended his record as president between 2014 and 2019. “We had achieved everything we wanted,” he said of the peace deal. “Our goal was to, first, stop the threat, or at least to delay the war – to secure eight years to restore economic growth and create powerful armed forces.” He cited Sun Tzu’s stratagems as an inspiration for the deception. Winning a war does not necessarily require winning military engagements, Poroshenko said, calling the deal he made a win for Ukraine in that regard. Poroshenko failed to be reelected in a landslide vote for President Volodymyr Zelensky, who promised voters that, unlike his predecessor, he would secure peace in Donbass. In the interviews, Poroshenko spoke about his role in negotiating the Minsk agreements, a roadmap for reconciliation between his government and the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics. The former president apparently confirmed that Kiev hadn’t come to the talks in good faith, but simply wanted a reprieve after suffering a military defeat. The agreements included a series of measures designed to rein in hostilities in Donbass and reconcile the warring parties. The first steps were a ceasefire and an OSCE-monitored pullout of heavier weapons from the frontline, which were fulfilled to some degree. Kiev was then supposed to grant general amnesty to the rebels and extensive autonomy for the Donetsk and Lugansk regions. Ukrainian troops were supposed to take control of the rebel-held areas after Kiev granted them representation and otherwise reintegrated them as part of Ukraine. Poroshenko’s government refused to implement these portions of the deal, claiming it could not proceed unless it fully secured the border between the rebellious republics and Russia. He instead endorsed an economic blockade of the rebel regions initiated by Ukrainian nationalist forces. Zelensky’s presidency gave an initial boost to the peace process, but it stalled again after a series of protests by right-wing radicals, who threatened to dispose of the new Ukrainian president if tried to deliver on his campaign promises. Kiev’s failure to implement the roadmap and the continued hostilities with rebels were among the primary reasons that Russia cited when it attacked Ukraine in late February. Days before launching the offensive, Moscow recognized the breakaway Ukrainian republics as sovereign states, offering them security guarantees and demanding that Kiev pull back its troops. Zelensky refused to comply. Now an opposition MP, Poroshenko, called on Western nations to provide more and heavier weapons for Kiev so that Ukrainian soldiers can “do [the West’s] job” and defend Europe from Russia. He also called for more anti-Russia sanctions and for his country to join the EU and NATO as soon as possible. Poroshenko claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin was the one who broke the Minsk agreements. He claimed credit for Ukraine not falling into Russia’s hands within a matter of days, which was the prediction of some Western officials. The country stood up to the attack thanks to military reforms that his government implemented, the former president claimed. Moscow never gave a timeline for its military operation in Ukraine, stating only that it has proceeded as intended. The Ukrainian official also called for the “de-Putinization” of Europe, his own country and Russia itself. He said this meant curbing Russian influence in other nations and toppling Putin. It is the only way to save the world from an “existential threat” that, Poroshenko claimed, the Russian leader poses."
2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557310-putin-attends-petersburg-forum/,Putin to deliver ‘extremely important’ speech – Kremlin,"Russian President Vladimir Putin will deliver a speech at the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) on Friday. It will be his first major appearance before an international audience since Russia launched its military campaign in Ukraine in late February. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Putin’s speech this year will be “extremely important.” He added that the president will focus on the Russian economy, but also comment on global events. Putin is expected to address the rise in energy prices and the looming global food crisis, among other matters. The president will take part in a SPIEF plenary session, moderated by RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan. SPIEF is an annual gathering of business leaders, investors and politicians. The forum started on Wednesday and will run through June 18. This year’s event has been overshadowed by sweeping sanctions imposed on Moscow by EU and NATO member states, with many large corporations leaving the Russian market. Putin said this month that companies leaving the Russian market will come to regret the move. On Thursday, he linked the exodus to countries “which can’t make sovereign decisions.”"

2022-06-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/557297-plane-su25-crash-belgorod/,Warplane crashes in Russian region bordering Ukraine,"A Sukhoi Su-25 close air support jet crashed in Russia’s Belgorod region on Friday. The military said the pilot ejected and was rescued, after the plane went down due to a technical malfunction. Local authorities explained that the plane hit the ground in the Korochansky district, located to the northeast of the regional capital, Belgorod. The aircraft exploded after crashing in a field, emergency services said. No casualties or damage to buildings or infrastructure have been reported. The Su-25 is a single-seat jet with over four decades of operational history. The subsonic plane is meant for supporting ground troops during combat. The Russian Air Force operates some 200 such planes, including roughly 80 upgraded Su-25SM variants."
2022-06-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/557292-ukraine-outlaws-parties-opposition/,Zelensky outlaws more Ukrainian opposition parties,"Two more political movements, the Left Opposition and the Party of Shariy, have been banned by a Ukrainian court. Both featured on a list of eleven political factions suspended in March by Ukraine’s Security Council. Thursday’s announcement brings the total number of outlawed parties to nine. The Volodomyr Zelensky regime has already outlawed the country's largest opposition group, Opposition Platform – For Life. According to rulings by the Eighth Administrative Court of Appeal in the western city of Lviv, all activities of the Left Opposition and the Party of Shariy have been prohibited, with “funds and other assets” set to be nationalized. As Justice Minister Denis Malyuska explained, the two join other banned “pro-Russian” parties, whose activities were allegedly aimed at “undermining the sovereignty” of Ukraine. Explaining the court decision, the minister cited the law “On political parties” and amendments to it, adopted in the wake of the Russian military offensive, and simplified procedures to ban a political party for the duration of martial law. “Materials on the illegality of political parties are provided to the Ministry of Justice by law enforcement agencies, and with these materials the Ministry files an administrative lawsuit to ban the political party. At the same time, the activity of a political party can be banned only by a court decision,” the ministry said in a statement. Court hearings on Opposition Platform – For Life have been postponed till June 20. The party was led by Viktor Medvedchuk, a businessman who favored a different approach to relations with Russia and the West. He was placed under house arrest in April of last year, after his faction overtook Zelensky's Servant of the People in opinion polling. The politician has since ended up in the custody of Ukraine's security services. The Party of Shariy was founded in 2015 by Anatoly Shariy, a prominent blogger and critic of the Ukrainian government. In May, the Ukrainian Security Service announced that Shariy had been detained by Spanish police as the result of a “a special operation.” He was later released on bail. Shariy was granted political asylum in the EU by Lithuania in 2012. Back then, he said that he was fleeing persecution by the government of Viktor Yanukovich. The Left Opposition coalition was formed in 2015 and comprised five political parties, including the Communist Party of Ukraine, as well as more than a dozen public organizations."
2022-06-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/557273-lukyanov-russia-ukraine-relations/,Russia's top foreign policy expert issues warning on Ukraine,"The Russian military offensive in Ukraine is likely to last for a long time and will bring about the “decoupling” of the Russian and Western economies, Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent expert on international relations and editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs said on Thursday. Speaking to RT, Lukyanov spoke about short-term prospects for the conflict, noting that at the beginning of the Russian “special military operation” in Ukraine both Moscow and the West probably had some “illusions” that the conflict could be resolved diplomatically. “Now we have this particular situation where military force only decides,” he said. Both Russia and Ukraine, he stressed, are now led by “a military logic” which suggests that any cessation of military action would give the other side a chance to regroup and prepare for further actions. “So there is no chance for a political or diplomatic solution at this point and I am afraid that we will follow military activities for quite a long [time] ahead of us,” Lukyanov said. He believes Russia was not as well prepared for the attack as it should have been and, therefore, after its initial first gains, it had to withdraw forces from some territories which had already been taken. Now, Lukyanov said, Russian forces are making slow but steady progress. Aside from the declared target of “liberation” of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, Russia has “other goals which have not been officially announced.” Fulfilling those goals may mean Russia taking other parts of Ukraine under its control, he added. “Everything we hear from Russian officials, both in Moscow and on the field, gives us the feeling that the territories already taken by Russian army will never return back to Ukraine,” adding that he doubts even Russian leaders know where the operation will end and what Ukraine will look like following the conflict. At the same time, Lukyanov argued, “It doesn’t look very likely that anybody will recognize those gains.” Asked to comment on possible referendums on Russia-controlled territories, Lukyanov said that he doesn’t think referendums make much sense because, whatever the vote result is, it will be rejected by other sides. “In this regard it would be important to see and to know the real will of people who live there but, under the current circumstances, I don’t see how to do it,” he said. In light of Russia’s military progress in Ukraine, Western supporters of Ukraine have two options: To continue providing Kiev with arms but without any guarantee of victory, or to seek some sort of armistice which “could give some period of peace.” For now, the “aggressive” approach seems to be prevailing, Lukyanov said. The important question is how the remaining part of sovereign Ukraine will develop its statehood in these new circumstances, Lukyanov noted, as Kiev is likely to be dependent on Western aid for a long time. On the subject of Russian relations with the West, there should be no expectation that the sanctions imposed on Moscow will be lifted any time soon, he claimed. In the expert’s opinion, the “decoupling” of Russian and European economies “is irreversible for a very long period.” However, the speed of imposing sanctions is likely to decrease, Lukyanov suggested, as “all of the next packages, if serious, will harm the European economy more than the Russian economy.” Russia will suffer badly due to sanctions, Lukyanov believes, so the country’s main goal now is “to adapt to the new situation and to find new ways for development.” Commenting on US attempts to persuade China and India to join the “collective West” in its hardline approach towards Russia, Lukyanov said that Washington’s stance was “very strange.” “Addressing big guys such as the Chinese and India and asking them for some help, you have to offer something in return. But it doesn’t happen,” he said, adding that the US might “overestimate” its significance for Beijing and New Delhi. Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, following Kiev's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."
