Senior Saudi officials pressed their U.S. counterparts to scrap a policy of selling only defensive arms to its top Gulf partner in several meetings in Riyadh and Washington in recent months, three of the sources said ahead of President Joe Biden’s visit to the kingdom this week. The internal U.S. deliberations are informal and at an early stage, with no decision imminent, two sources said, and a U.S. official told Reuters there were no discussions on offensive weapons under way with the Saudis “at this time.” But as Biden prepares for a diplomatically sensitive trip, he has signaled that he is looking to reset strained relations with Saudi Arabia at a time when he wants increased Gulf oil supplies along with closer Arab security ties with Israel to counter Iran. At home, any move to rescind restrictions on offensive weapons is sure to draw opposition in Congress, including from Biden’s fellow Democrats and opposition Republicans who have been vocal critics of Saudi Arabia, congressional aides say. Soon after taking office early last year, Biden adopted a tougher stance over Saudi Arabia's campaign against the Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen, which has inflicted heavy civilian casualties, and Riyadh’s human rights record, in particular the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist and political opponent Jamal Khashoggi. Biden, who as a presidential candidate denounced Saudi Arabia as a “pariah,” declared in February 2021 a halt to U.S. support for offensive operations in Yemen, including “relevant arms sales.” Saudi Arabia, the biggest U.S. arms customer, has chafed under those restrictions, which froze the kind of weapons sales that previous U.S. administrations had provided for decades. Biden’s approach has softened since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in March, which has prompted the United States and other Western countries to appeal to Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, to pump more oil to offset loss of Russian supplies. Saudi Arabia also won White House praise for agreeing in early June on a two-month extension of a U.N.-brokered truce in Yemen, scene of the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Washington would now like to see it turned into a permanent ceasefire. A person in Washington familiar with the matter said the administration had begun internal discussions about the possibility of removing Saudi weapons restrictions but indicated they had not reached a decision-making stage. Among the times when Saudi officials raised the request was during Deputy Minister of Defense Khalid bin Salman's visit to Washington in May, according to a second source. Asked whether the administration was considering ending the freeze on offensive weapons, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan did not directly address the question but told reporters on Monday: “Right now, there is nothing on the table to lift that ban."" ""Right now, we're focused on strengthening and sustaining what is a fragile but real ceasefire"" in Yemen, he added. The Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment. The sources stressed, however, that no announcement was expected around Biden’s July 13-16 trip, which will include stops in Israel and the West Bank. Any decision, they said, is expected to depend heavily on whether Riyadh is deemed to have done enough to find a political settlement to the Yemen conflict. Among the biggest-ticket items the Saudis would likely seek are precision-guided munitions (PGM) such as those approved under former President Donald Trump in the face of objections from members of Congress. But the Biden administration is expected to move cautiously as it discusses which systems might be offered, two sources said. Amnesty International said U.S.-made precision-guided bombs were used in a Saudi-led coalition air strike on a detention center in Yemen in January that killed scores. If Washington eases the ban, it may be easier to push through sales of less-lethal equipment such as armored personnel carriers or replenish stocks of less-sophisticated ground-to-ground and air-to-ground weaponry. Even under existing restrictions, the United States began stepping up its military support for Saudi Arabia earlier this year following Houthi missile strikes on the kingdom. Washington approved missiles and an anti-ballistic defense system sales to Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon said in November, and the United States sent Patriot missiles this year as well - all deemed by U.S. officials to be defensive in nature. The Biden administration has also maintained backing for the Saudis to receive a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system first approved in 2017 to counter ballistic missile threats. While lawmakers have mostly acquiesced to such sales, Biden could face fallout on Capitol Hill if he decides to sell Riyadh offensive weapons again. Some have questioned Biden’s decision to visit Saudi Arabia, seeing it as lending legitimacy to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi de facto leader who the U.S. intelligence community concluded was behind Khashoggi’s murder. Among the likely opponents would be Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, a staunch critic of the Saudi campaign in Yemen who praised Biden when he froze offensive arms sales. An aide said Murphy does not believe now is the time to resume such supplies."

The civilian deaths hammered home the human cost of Russia's invasion, now in its fifth month, as Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces push to capture all of Ukraine's industrial Donbas region after declaring victory in one of its two provinces this month. In the city of Chasiv Yar, rescue workers made voice contact with two people in the wreckage of the five-storey building demolished on Saturday. Video showed them pulling survivors from the debris, where up to two dozen people had been trapped. But the death toll also rose steadily, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said, as more bodies were pulled from under ruined concrete. In a nightly address, Zelenskiy said 31 people had been killed and nine saved from the rubble. One survivor, who gave her name as Venera, said she had wanted to save her two kittens. ""I was thrown into the bathroom, it was all chaos, I was in shock, all covered in blood,"" she said, crying. ""By the time I left the bathroom, the room was full up of rubble, three floors fell down. ""I never found the kittens."" Rescuers could be seen lifting one person from the ruins to a stretcher, and carrying away two bodies in white bags. Military experts say Russia is using barrages like the one on Chasiv Yar in Donetsk province to pave the way for a renewed push for territory by ground forces, after claiming victory in Luhansk province on July 4. Both have been partly controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Putin, who says he aims to hand control of Donbas to the separatists, on Monday eased rules for Ukrainians to acquire Russian citizenship. ""(Russia) indeed unfortunately has a big advantage in artillery,"" President Zelenskiy told reporters in Kyiv earlier on Monday alongside Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. ""With all the partners who are ready to give support, I talk about artillery. There is indeed not enough."" A spokesman for Ukraine's International Legion, a fighting unit of foreign troops, said Ukraine's heavy artillery was outnumbered roughly eight to one by Russian guns. Reuters could not independently verify battlefield accounts. Further north in the second-largest city of Kharkiv, Russian artillery, rocket and tank attacks killed three and injured 31, including two children, regional governor Oleh Synehubov said. At least one strike hit a residential building in the city, where a column of flats had collapsed into rubble. ""I saw lights, the headlights of rescuers and I started screaming 'I am alive, please get me out',"" survivor Valentina Popovichuk told Reuters on a nearby Kharkiv street. She was asleep when her building was hit three or four times in the early morning. ""The rescuers entered the hallway, knocked down the door and took me out."" Kharkiv, in the northeast close to the Russian border but outside the Donbas, suffered heavy bombardment in the first few months of the war followed by a period of relative calm that has been shattered by renewed shelling in recent weeks. Moscow denies targeting civilians but many Ukrainian cities, towns and villages have been left in ruins. Since the Feb. 24 invasion, attacks on a theatre, shopping centre and railway station have caused many civilian deaths. Zelenskiy said Russia had carried out 34 air strikes since Saturday. The war has exposed diplomatic faultlines across Europe and sent energy and food prices soaring. The West aims to reopen Ukraine's Black Sea ports, which it says are shut by a Russian blockade, halting exports from one of the world's main sources of grain and threatening to exacerbate global hunger. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who has offered to mediate on the grain issue, discussed it with Putin by telephone. The Kremlin said the talks took place in the run-up to a Russian-Turkish summit scheduled for the near future. A summit with Erdogan would potentially be Putin's first face-to-face meeting with a leader of a NATO country since the invasion, and were it to take place in Turkey, it would also be his first trip outside the territory of the former Soviet Union. Europe's dependence on Russian energy was preoccupying policymakers and businesses as the biggest pipeline carrying Russian gas to Germany began 10 days of annual maintenance. Governments, markets and companies are worried the shutdown might be extended because of the war. Putin calls the conflict, Europe's biggest since World War Two, a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise Ukraine and rid it of dangerous nationalists. Ukraine and its Western allies say Putin's war is an imperial-style land grab. Ukraine's general staff said Russia had launched a wave of bombardments as they seek to seize Donetsk. It said the widespread shelling amounted to preparations for an intensification of hostilities. Russia's defence ministry said its missiles struck ammunition depots in Ukraine's central Dnipro region used to supply rocket launchers and artillery weapons. Ukraine is preparing a counter-attack in the south of the country where Russia seized territory early in the war. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned civilians in the Russian-occupied Kherson region in the south on Sunday to urgently evacuate. She gave no time frame."

Security Council appears set to allow U.N. deliveries of aid to some 4 million people in northwest Syria from Turkey until January, diplomats said on Monday after days of wrangling with Russia over how long to let the huge operation continue. The mandate for the operation, which has been delivering food, medicine and shelter to the opposition-controlled area of Syria since 2014, expired on Sunday. Council authorization is needed because Syrian authorities did not agree to it. The 15-member body will vote on a draft resolution - put forward by Ireland and Norway - that mirrors a Russian text, which failed when put to a vote on Friday. The United States, France and Britain opposed it because they said six months is not long enough for aid groups to plan and operate effectively. It was not immediately clear when the council vote would be scheduled. To pass, a resolution needs nine votes and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, France or Britain. Russia initially vetoed a one-year extension on Friday, which was supported by 13 council members, while China abstained. Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said Moscow would continue to veto any text other than its own. ""The Russians did get to shape the outcome of this process, but they looked pretty lonely along the way,"" said Richard Gowan, Crisis Group U.N. director, noting that China lobbied for a compromise and didn't join Russia in casting a veto. Only Russia and China backed the Russian draft on Friday, and the remaining 10 council members abstained. Russia argues that the U.N. aid operation violates Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It says more aid should be delivered from inside the country, raising opposition fears that food and other aid would fall under government control. The Security Council vote on the authorization of the aid operation has long been a contentious issue, but this year also comes amid heightened tensions between Russia and Western powers over Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. In 2014, the Security Council authorized humanitarian aid deliveries into opposition-held areas of Syria from Iraq, Jordan and two points in Turkey. But veto powers Russia and China have whittled that down to just one Turkish border point."

So far 11 candidates have thrown their hat in the ring to succeed Johnson as leader of the ruling Conservative Party and prime minister after he quit following a dramatic rebellion by his own lawmakers and ministers after a series of scandals. The 1922 committee of Conservative members of parliament (MPs) which organises the leadership contest said hopefuls would need at least 20 nominations from the party's 358 lawmakers to even proceed to the first round of votes on Wednesday. Anyone who then received less than 30 votes will be eliminated before another vote follows on Thursday. Nearly all the contenders have promised extensive tax cuts to win over the support of their colleagues. ""I am very keen we get this concluded as smoothly, cleanly, and rapidly as possible,"" said Graham Brady, the committee's chair. The field will be whittled down to a final two candidates by lawmakers, before a postal ballot of the Conservative Party's members, who number fewer than 200,000, takes place over the summer. A poll for the Conservative Home website on Monday found former defence minister Penny Mordaunt was the most popular with members, followed by equalities minister Kemi Badenoch and Rishi Sunak, whose resignation as finance minister helped bring down Johnson. ""There seems to be a quite a big field at the moment, a lively contest,"" Brady said. ""I hope we will have a very constructive contest, but (also) a really good opportunity for a proper, healthy, constructive debate about the future direction of the Conservative Party."" The battle to secure the top job comes after one of the most tumultuous periods in modern British political history, when more than 50 government ministers and aides quit, denouncing Johnson's character, integrity and inability to tell the truth. The new leader will also have to reverse evaporating support for the Conservatives. A survey by Savanta ComRes on Monday put the opposition Labour Party at 43% compared with 28% for the Conservatives, its biggest poll lead since 2013. The succession contest has already become personal. Former finance minister Sajid Javid, another of the candidates, criticised what he called ""poisonous gossip"" and ""attack memos"" delivered by some colleagues over the weekend. ""This isn't the 'House of Cards' or the 'Game of Thrones', and the people who are here just because they enjoy the game, they are in the wrong place,"" he said. ""This is a time for pulling together, not apart."" The issue of tax cuts was fast becoming the central battle in the race with nearly all of the candidates promising to cut business or personal taxes. Setting out her pitch, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who has held ministerial jobs in a number of government departments including trade, justice and the treasury, said she would reverse the recent rise in National Insurance contributions and signalled a cut to corporation tax. Fellow contenders Jeremy Hunt and Javid both pledged to cut corporation tax, while Mordaunt has promised to cut fuel duty. Sunak is the early front-runner, but he is the only candidate who has played down the prospect of imminent tax cuts, saying the adoption of ""comforting fairy tales"" would leave future generations worse off. This has prompted his rivals to attack his economic record after the tax burden rose to the highest level since the 1950s. One lawmaker confirmed that a dossier criticising Sunak's record had been circulating on lawmaker WhatsApp groups. Nadhim Zahawi, appointed finance minister in the turmoil of last week, said he was also being targeted by rivals after media reports raised questions about the former businessman's personal finances and tax record. Whoever wins the leadership race will be faced with a daunting in-tray. Britain's economy is facing rocketing inflation, high debt, and low growth, with people coping with the tightest squeeze on their finances in decades, all set against a backdrop of an energy crunch exacerbated by the war in Ukraine which has sent fuel prices soaring. On the issue of immigration, all the main leadership candidates have pledged to keep the government's policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, showing how the party has moved to the right of the political spectrum in recent years. Other candidates include the attorney general, Suella Braverman, the chair of parliament's foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat, and the transport secretary Grant Shapps. Labour leader Keir Starmer in a speech took aim at an ""arms race of fantasy economics"" from the Conservative leadership candidates, claiming that more than 200 billion pounds ($239 billion) of commitments made by them over the weekend were unfunded. Johnson has declined to endorse any of the candidates. ($1 = 0.8357 pound)"

The military-civilian administration said Yevgeny Yunakov, chief administrator of Velikyi Burluk, had been killed by a Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance group, according to TASS. While Russia has said explicitly that it wants to remove the eastern Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk from Kyiv's control, it shows no sign of wanting to relinquish other territories that it has seized since invading Ukraine on Feb. 24. Alongside parts of the Kharkiv region in the east, Russian forces have also captured swathes of the southern Ukrainian provinces of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Also on Monday, occupation authorities in Zaporizhzhia reported that Andrei Siguta, the Russian-installed district head of Melitopol, one of the first towns to fall to Russian forces, had escaped an attempt on his life by a saboteur shooting at his house. Vladimir Rogov, a senior member of the Russian-appointed civil-military administration of Zaporizhzhia province, said on his Telegram channel that the would-be assassin had been killed in a shootout. On June 24, a senior official in the Russian-installed Kherson regional administration was killed by a bomb, according to the deputy head of the administration. The following day, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence declined to comment on partisan resistance efforts in occupied territories, but told Reuters that ""those people who betrayed Ukraine and all those wretches who came here to destroy our country will be destroyed"". Russia calls the invasion a ""special military operation"" and says it had to act to protect Ukraine's Russian-speakers from persecution and defuse a Western-backed threat to Russia's security.

The remarks by Andrzej Duda were made on the 79th anniversary of the 1943 killings in Volhynia in Nazi-occupied Poland and were a pointed reminder of the complex historical ties between Warsaw and Kyiv at a time when Russia's invasion of Ukraine has brought the two neighbours closer together. Poland has opened its doors to Ukrainian refugees and Duda has allowed his country to be used as a logistics hub to keep Ukraine supplied as it fights an exhausting war of attrition against Russia. But at a Warsaw ceremony on Monday, Duda said that the truth about the wartime massacres and others like it in Eastern Galicia from 1944-45 had to be “firmly and clearly stated” regardless and called on Kyiv to acknowledge the ethnic cleansing of Poles by Ukrainian nationalist militias. “It was not about and is not about revenge, about any retaliation. There is no better proof of this than the time we have now,” Duda said, referring to the two countries' current cooperation against Russia. The issue was complex for Ukrainians, he said, since some regarded the same militias as heroes for the resistance they mounted against the Soviet Union and as symbols of Kyiv's painful struggle for independence from Moscow. ""Those who we know were murderers were also heroes for Ukraine, at other times and with a different enemy, and often died at the hands of the Soviets, fighting with deep faith for an independent, free Ukraine,"" said Duda. There was no immediate reaction from Ukraine to Duda's comments, but his remarks are likely to be seen as ill-timed in some Ukrainian circles who view attempts to discuss such events now as part of a Russian-inspired attempt to falsely cast Ukraine as a country in need of de-Nazifying, one of the stated aims of what Russia calls its special military operation. The Polish parliament has said that the murders, carried out between 1943 and 1945 by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists under the leadership of Stepan Bandera, bore elements of genocide. Ukraine has not accepted that assertion and often refers to the Volhynia events as part of a conflict between Poland and Ukraine which affected both nations. Polish historians say that up to 12,000 Ukrainians were also killed in Polish retaliatory operations."

The annual ""Children and Armed Conflict"" report also verified the recruitment and use of 6,310 children in conflicts globally in 2021. Other violations it covers are abduction, sexual violence, school and hospital attacks and denial of aid. It found the highest number of verified violations against children in 2021 were in Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, Israel and the Palestinian Territories. Guterres said next year's report would include verified violations against children in Ukraine, Ethiopia and Mozambique. His special envoy for children and armed conflict, Virginia Gamba, said that the two most concerning violations emerging from the conflict in Ukraine were the killing and maiming of children and attacks on schools and hospitals. ""So I think these two clearly are going to be very high,"" Gamba, who compiles the annual U.N. report, told reporters. Russia invaded neigboring Ukraine on Feb. 24 and denies targeting civilian areas. Without laying blame, U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said last week that as of July 3, 4,889 civilians had been killed in Ukraine, including 335 children, stressing that the real figure is likely much higher. The children and armed conflict report includes a blacklist intended to shame parties to conflicts in the hope of pushing them to implement measures to protect children. It has long been controversial, with diplomats saying Saudi Arabia and Israel exerted pressure in recent years in a bid to stay off the list. Israel has never been on the blacklist, while a Saudi-led military coalition was removed from the list in 2020 several years after it was first named for killing and injuring children in Yemen. Israeli security forces killed 78 Palestinian children, maimed another 982 and detained 637 Palestinian children in 2021, according to the report, while in Yemen the Saudi-led coalition killed and maimed 100 children last year. ""Should the situation repeat itself in 2022, without meaningful improvement, Israel should be listed,"" Guterres wrote.

The retail chain began rebranding stores in Russia under the Sephora banner in 2018 and was still in the process of doing so when the global pandemic hit in 2020. The beauty retailer's stores in Russia have been closed since early March, when LVMH and other luxury goods companies announced they were suspending operations in the country in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. LVMH said in March that it had a total of 124 stores and 3,500 employees in Russia. Leading European luxury labels Burberry (BRBY.L), Hermes (HRMS.PA), Cartier-owner Richemont (CFR.S), Kering (PRTP.PA) and Chanel temporarily closed their stores in Russia after the Ukraine invasion, which prompted a wave of sanctions from the United States and the European Union. Sephora said the deal, which would clear the way for the reopening of the chain, was subject to antitrust clearance. It did not disclose the price of the transaction. Plans for a law allowing Moscow to seize the assets of foreign businesses and impose criminal penalties has prompted some to accelerate their departure, such as Nike (NKE.N), which decided to leave last month after suspending operations in March."

Navalny came to prominence by using his Foundation to catalogue the wealth of senior Russian officials in a series of caustic and widely watched videos, and has become President Vladimir Putin's fiercest critic.

Navalny's social media feeds said on Monday that the new Anti-Corruption Foundation International would be ""completely transparent and understandable"", and that its first funds would be the 50,000 euro ($50,000) Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought that the European Parliament awarded him last year. ""As always, we are counting on your help and support, and we promise that we will work well,"" Navalny was quoted as saying. Navalny was jailed in 2020 for violating bail conditions on his return from Germany, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal poisoning in Russia with a Soviet-era nerve toxin. This year he was sentenced to a further nine years in prison for fraud and contempt of court, charges that he says were fabricated in order to thwart his political ambitions. ($1 = 0.9918 euros)"

NATO and European Union member Latvia plans to gradually raise its defence budget to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2025 from around 2% now, as it boosts security after its neighbour Russia sent troops into Ukraine in late February. Levits, 67, said on Monday that the existing spending plans covered the building of more military bases to accommodate more troops from NATO allies - an increase agreed at the NATO summit in Madrid last month - but that Latvia, a former Soviet nation like Ukraine, may need to spend more. ""Security is priority of our politics today,"" Levits told Reuters. ""2.5% (of GDP) is already committed now but maybe it would not be enough and we should be prepared for that."" The president of neighbouring Lithuania has called on defence spending to increase to 3%, after Poland introduced the same target. Meanwhile, the country's defence minister, Artis Pabriks, has also raised the prospect of reintroducing compulsory military service abandoned in the mid-2000s. Levits suggested that the service should cover all citizens irrespective of their gender. ""I think we should have equality in this respect and I support this idea for all Latvian citizens of specific age … this should be done independently of their sex,"" he said, as it would allow for a rise in the number of people with military skills in reserve. Both proposed changes - to military service and any increase in spending - will be reviewed by parliament before taking effect. The defence ministry wants the military service to start voluntarily next year before becoming mandatory from 2028. Latvia was among the first countries to call on using around $300 billion in Russian state reserves frozen by Western sanctions to rebuild Ukraine and Levits said European lawyers were looking into the ways how to implement it. ""The violation of international law by Russia is the heaviest violation of the international law since the Second World War and international law also provides for reparations,"" he said. ""We should not allow one state to breach international law without consequences."" Russia says it is conducting a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise Ukraine and denies targeting civilians. It calls NATO an ""aggressive bloc"" but has said it wants to avoid any direct confrontation. Asked whether he expects any direct conflict between the Baltic states and Russia, Levits said: ""No... For the first and the main reason - NATO is capable of defending each NATO member state and there is a very strong political will to do it."""

The EU executive, which acts as the competition enforcer in the 27-country bloc, earlier on Monday said it would seek feedback from EU countries on its proposal before making a final decision, but it did not provide figures. The Commission in March relaxed its state aid rules to allow EU states to give up to 400,000 euros in state support and compensation up to 30% of energy costs. It now wants to jack up the amount to 500,000 euros where the state aid can be direct grants, tax and payment advantages or other forms such as repayable advances, guarantees, loans and equity, the document said. Companies in the agriculture sector may be allowed to get up to 62,000 euros in state support and those in fishery and aquaculture up to 75,000 euros versus a current 35,000-euro cap. The Commission will also make it easier for governments to invest in renewable energy, including renewable hydrogen, biogas and biomethane, and renewable heat as part of its goal of moving away from Russian oil and natural gas and diversifying its energy sources. EU countries will also be incentivised to set up new tender based schemes or directly support projects without tenders to increase energy efficiency and help decarbonise industry. ""We are proposing to adjust the Temporary Crisis Framework so that it reflects and supports the important and urgent REPowerEU Plan objectives of accelerating the diversification of energy supplies to become independent from fossil fuels even more quickly,"" Commission Vice-President Margrethe Vestager said.

The closure of the CPC pipeline that carries oil from Kazakhstan to the Black Sea Russian export terminal in the port of Novorossiisk would shut in more than 1% of global oil supply, exacerbating what is already the most severe energy crunch since the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s. The pipeline, which runs through Russian territory and is owned by a consortium of Western, Asian, Russian and Kazakh companies, has been in the spotlight since Russia on Feb. 24 invaded Ukraine in what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"". Last Wednesday, a court in Novorossiisk ordered CPC to suspend operations for 30 days, citing concern about oil spill management. A Russian court on Monday overturned the ruling against CPC and instead fined it 200,000 roubles ($3,300). The sources, however, said they still thought major disruption likely. Pipeline co-owner Russia has said all stoppages are driven by technical issues. Storm damage in March has already interrupted flows through the 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) oil artery, operated by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. Major oil companies, including Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Italy's Eni, in addition to several Russian and Kazakh firms have stakes in the CPC. Western companies also hold stakes in Kazakh oilfields. The CPC pipeline is the route for nearly all Kazakh oil exports. Three sources at Western oil companies operating in Kazakhstan, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, said they expected a prolonged CPC pipeline suspension. One trader at a Western major said such an outage would result in a decline of 50 million tonnes of oil per year (1 million bpd) because land-locked Kazakhstan has limited alternative export routes. Many Western companies have exited operations in Russia, with oil majors among the first to leave in the days after the conflict began. Western sanctions have disrupted Russian exports and pushed up energy prices. In response, Russia made steps towards seizing oil and gas projects Sakhalin 1 and 2, where Shell and Exxon have stakes. A Western executive familiar with CPC operations said Sakhalin was ""a definite sign of things to come for CPC"". Shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, international oil prices spiked to their highest levels since the records of 2008. They have since eased to just above $100 a barrel as the market anticipates economic weakness will lower demand, although selling has been limited by concerns of tight supplies that would be exacerbated by a cut in CPC output. ""Losing one million barrels per day in an already tight environment can lead to an unsolvable problem for the oil market,"" Amrita Sen from Energy Aspects in London said. JP Morgan analysts predicted last week oil prices could jump to an all-time high of $190 per barrel if a combined 3 million bpd of output from Russia and Kazakhstan was hit by sanctions and related issues. Kazakhstan produces some 1.6 million bpd of oil, and exports about 80% of that volume, mostly through the CPC. Of the remainder, 15% leaves the country also via Russia, and around 5% goes to China and various destinations via rail and the Caspian Sea, Kazakhstan's Energy Ministry data shows. Last week, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev told his government to diversify oil supply routes. But that would take time, Camille Chautard, analyst at Moody’s ratings, said. Oil majors have studied the viability of alternative routes in recent months, the three sources said, including to China and trans-Caspian shipments to Azerbaijan and Georgia. All of those options are challenging. The pipeline to China can take oil from east and central Kazakhstan, but most of the large fields are in the West. On the Caspian Sea, exporters face tanker shortages and have little capacity to take more oil. ""To be honest, I don't think we can re-route anything,"" one Western trader familiar with CPC operations said. Chevron would be particularly exposed to any pipeline closure because it has the biggest Western stake in Kazakh production at around 380,000 bpd, or more than 12%, of its total output. Recent temporary disruptions should not have a material impact on the company’s credit standing, but an eventual ""prolonged disruption would be very material to Chevron's production volumes,"" Elena Nadtotchi from Moody’s said. If Chevron’s investments in Kazakhstan were impaired or lost, that could lead to a ratings downgrade, she said. A long-term closure would also threaten Chevron’s future growth plans. The U.S. major planned to boost output by 40% at Kazakhstan's largest field Tengiz to around 1 million bpd. Credit Suisse analysts estimate that Chevron, which controls 50% of Tengiz, would have seen free cash flow rising to $3.0-$3.5 billion by 2024 following the expansion and to $4.0-$4.5 billion by 2026 on the basis of oil prices of $60 per barrel. In May, Chevron flagged the risk of sanctions to its output but said measures had not yet had a material impact. The Chevron-led Tengiz consortium TCO, which also includes Exxon, declined to comment on specific details if the CPC pipeline was shut. ""As global oil markets continue to encounter challenges arising from geopolitics, TCO’s primary focus is on maintaining safe operations, and we are exploring potential crude oil exporting options,"" it said in a statement to Reuters. Exxon is the second largest foreign producer in Kazakhstan with output of 213,000 bpd of oil and 234 million cubic feet of gas. It is followed by Eni with some 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, Shell with around 100,000 boed and TotalEnergies with some 80,000 boed in 2021. Shell, Eni and Total declined to comment, as did Exxon, saying TCO was best-placed to respond."

Russia's existing ""gay propaganda"" law, passed in 2013, has been used to stop gay pride marches and detain gay rights activists. Authorities say they are defending morality in the face of what they argue are un-Russian liberal values promoted by the West, but human rights activists say the law has been broadly applied to intimidate Russia's LGBT community. Under the proposed changes, any event or act regarded as an attempt to promote homosexuality could incur a fine. ""We propose to generally extend the ban on such propaganda regardless of the age of the audience (offline, in the media, on the internet, social networks and online cinemas),"" the head of the State Duma's information committee, Alexander Khinshtein, said on his Telegram social media channel. Parliamentary Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said last week that since Russia had quit the Council of Europe human rights watchdog after sending troops into Ukraine, it would now be able to ban the promotion of ""non-traditional values"". ""Demands to legalise same-sex marriages in Russia are a thing of the past,"" he said. ""Attempts to impose alien values on our society have failed."" Homosexuality was a criminal offence in Russia until 1993 and classed as a mental illness until 1999. President Vladimir Putin has aligned himself closely with the Orthodox Church - which rejects same-sex relationships - and has made its social conservatism part of a narrative of Russian political and cultural revival that is now also being used to help justify the invasion of Ukraine. A new constitution enacted in 2020 that extended presidential term limits also defines marriage exclusively as the union of a man and a woman. In a ranking of Europe's most LGBT-friendly nations in this year's ""Rainbow Europe"" index compiled by ILGA-Europe, Russia came third to last."

In a statement sent to Reuters, Akhmetov said Media Group Ukraine would hand over the licences for its television channels and print media to the Ukrainian state, and cease online media, describing his decision tersely as ""involuntary"". Ukraine last year passed a law to order ""oligarchs"" to register and stay out of politics, and proposed identifying them with criteria such as those with ""significant impact on the media"". President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has hailed the legislation as a historic chance to reform Ukraine, even as some foreign diplomats in Kyiv called it largely cosmetic. ""I made an involuntary decision that my investment company SCM will exit its media business,"" Akhmetov said, citing the legislation. ""Being the largest private investor in the Ukrainian economy, I have repeatedly stated that I have never been and am not going to be an oligarch,"" he said. Akhmetov said his SCM investment company was unable to sell its media business on market terms because of Russia's war in Ukraine and a six-month deadline given by the anti-oligarch legislation for the sale of media assets. Following Akhmetov's announcement, presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak described the law as ""the beginning of a new page in relations between the state and business."" ""Relationships based on transparency and (a) rejection of the backroom,"" he wrote on Twitter, calling Akhmetov's decision ""a worthy example."" Media Group Ukraine includes an array of television channels including Ukraine and Ukraine 24 that are among the most viewed in the country. ""Within the next few days the surrender of all broadcast and print licenses in Ukraine will be initiated. This will automatically deprive license holders of ... mass media status,"" a SCM spokesperson told Reuters. In the months preceding Russia's invasion, Akhmetov's TV channels became more critical of Zelenskiy as the billionaire battled the government over the proposed oligarch law and rail cargo tariff increases. Zelenskiy alleged in November that Moscow was planning to rope Akhmetov into a coup attempt against him. Akhmetov dismissed the allegations and said he was ""outraged by the spread of this lie""."

McDonald's quit Russia after a Western backlash against Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine, which included a barrage of economic sanctions, and sold all the restaurants it owned to a local licensee in May. The new ownership, however, now faces problems securing supplies of potatoes, blaming a poor harvest in Russia and difficulty in importing potatoes due to supply chain disruptions. Under the new name Vkusno & tochka, or ""Tasty and that's it"", the restaurants started reopening on June 12, and sold almost 120,000 burgers that day. But after customers last week began posting pictures of menus without French fries, Vkusno & tochka said it would be leaving fries and potato wedges off the menus of some of the newly opened restaurants until autumn. It said that while it had for years focused on buying ingredients locally, it was now ""impossible to import from markets that might have become temporary suppliers of potatoes"". ""Potatoes will return to the chain's menu in full at the beginning of the next harvest year, autumn 2022,"" it said.

The last talks between representatives of Russia and Ukraine were held in Istanbul in the end of March. The Kremlin did not immediately reply to a request for further comment after issuing a statement on the phone call. ""An exchange of views on the situation around Ukraine continued, including in the context of coordinating efforts to ensure the safety of navigation in the Black Sea and grain exports to global markets,"" it said. The Turkish state-owned Anadolu news agency said Erdogan had told Putin on Monday that it was time to act on a United Nations plan to set up a sea corridor for Ukrainian grain exports through the Black Sea. Since the start of the conflict, Ukraine, one of the world's biggest grain producers, has been unable to use the seaports had been its main export conduit, and has been able to export only around a third of the grain it would previously have sent abroad. A lack of Ukrainian grain has helped to drive global food prices to record highs and fuelled concerns about food security. Grain constitutes nearly a fifth of all Ukraine's exports, according to official data. NATO member Turkey, which has good ties with both Moscow and Kyiv, has criticised the Russian military campaign but also rejected Western sanctions on Russia. It has, however, refused to accept commercial shipments from Crimea at Kyiv's request since Russia seized the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.

The rouble is down around 16% from the more than seven-year highs hit in late June, having dropped sharply after several officials voiced concerns about its strength, which dents Russia's income from exporting commodities and other goods priced in dollars and euros. By 1500 GMT, the rouble was 2.4% stronger against the dollar at 59.47 , earlier touching 58.80, its strongest mark since July 5. It gained 3.8% to trade at 59.98 versus the euro , earlier strengthening to 59.40. The rouble is the world's best-performing currency so far this year, boosted by measures - including restrictions on Russian households withdrawing foreign currency savings - taken to shield Russia's financial system from Western sanctions imposed after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. The currency has also benefited from soaring proceeds from commodity exports and a sharp drop in imports. Analysts have said there is little difference between 50 and 60 roubles to the dollar in terms of how critical it is for the budget. Officials prefer a rate of 70-80, they have said. ""(The rouble) may return to 55 to the dollar ahead of quarterly taxes and dividend payments,"" said Dmitry Polevoy, head of investment at Locko-Invest. ""We also doubt that the recovery of imports and fall of exports will be significant enough in July to strongly affect the rouble."" The rouble may see weaker upside pressure from interest rates at home as the central bank is widely expected to cut its key rate from 9.5% at the July 22 board meeting after Russia posted a drop in consumer prices in June. The central bank could cut the key rate by 50-100 basis points next week, Promsvyazbank analysts said. Russian stock indexes were mixed on Monday.

The Nord Stream 1 pipeline transports 55 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year of gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. Maintenance lasts from July 11 to 21. Operator Nord Stream AG confirmed the shutdown started as planned at 0600 CET and that gas flows would drop to zero a few hours later. Last month, Russia cut flows to 40% of the pipeline's total capacity, citing the delayed return of equipment being serviced by Germany's Siemens Energy (ENR1n.DE) in Canada. Canada said at the weekend it would return a repaired turbine, but it also said it would expand sanctions against Russia's energy sector. Europe fears Russia could extend scheduled maintenance to restrict European gas supply further, throwing plans to fill storage for winter into disarray and heightening a gas crisis that has prompted emergency measures from governments and painfully high bills for consumers. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck has said the country should confront the possibility that Russia will suspend gas flows through Nord Stream 1 beyond the scheduled maintenance period. ""Based on the pattern we've seen, it would not be very surprising now if some small, technical detail is found and then they could say 'now we can't turn it on any more',"" he said at an event at the end of June. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed claims that Russia was using oil and gas to exert political pressure, saying the maintenance shutdown was a regular, scheduled event and that no one was ""inventing"" any repairs. There are other big pipelines from Russia to Europe, but flows have been declining gradually and Ukraine halted one gas transit route in May, blaming interference by occupying Russian forces. Russia has cut off gas supplies to several European countries that did not comply with its demand for payment in roubles. ""The last few months have shown one thing: Putin knows no taboos. A complete halt to gas supplies through the Nord Stream pipeline cannot therefore be ruled out,"" said Timm Kehler, managing director of German industry association Zukunft Gas. Germany at the weekend welcomed Canada's decision to issue a ""time-limited and revocable permit"" to allow equipment to be returned for the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. But Ukraine's energy and foreign ministries said they were ""deeply disappointed"" and urged Canada to reverse a decision that they said amounted to adjusting the sanctions imposed on Moscow ""to the whims of Russia"". Siemens Energy said it was working on further formal approvals and logistics to have the equipment in place as soon as possible. Zongqiang Luo, gas analyst at consultancy Rystad Energy, said it was ""not impossible"" Gazprom could use any delay as a justification to extend the maintenance period. In previous years the annual maintenance period on Nord Stream 1 has lasted about 10-12 days and has finished on time. It is not uncommon for additional faults to be detected during routine maintenance at pipelines or gas infrastructure and operators can prolong outages if necessary. While a complete halt of gas is considered unlikely, Gazprom has not been re-routing flows via other pipelines, meaning a prolonged reduced flow rate is probable, analysts at Goldman Sachs said. Germany has moved to stage two of a three-tier emergency gas plan, which is one step before the government rations fuel consumption. It has also warned of recession if Russian gas flows are halted. The blow to the economy could be 193 billion euros ($195 billion) in the second half of this year, data from the vbw industry association of the state of Bavaria showed last month. ""The abrupt end of Russian gas imports would also have a significant impact on the workforce in Germany ... Around 5.6 million jobs would be affected by the consequences,"" said Bertram Brossardt, vwb's managing director. The effects would be wider still. A complete halt would keep European gas prices higher for longer, having already stung industry and households. Wholesale Dutch gas prices, the European benchmark, have risen more than 400% since last July. ""If Nord Stream gets cut off, or if Germany loses all its Russian imports, then the effect will be felt on the whole of north-western Europe,"" said Dutch energy minister Rob Jetten. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, he said the Dutch Groningen gas field could still be called upon to help neighbouring countries in the event of a complete cut off in Russian supplies, but ramping up production would risk causing earthquakes. A halt of supply through Nord Stream 1 would hurt Russia as well as western Europe. Russia's finance ministry had said in June that it expected to receive 393 billion roubles ($6.4 billion) more oil and gas revenue than forecast in its budget planning. For July it expects 259 billion roubles more than its budget plan projected.

In 2018, the United States reimposed sanctions that had been suspended three years earlier as part of Iran's nuclear deal with major world powers. That November, Binance informed traders in Iran it would no longer serve them, telling them to liquidate their accounts. But in interviews with Reuters, seven traders said they skirted the ban. The traders said they continued to use their Binance accounts until as recently as September last year, only losing access after the exchange tightened its anti-money laundering checks a month earlier. Until that point, customers could trade by registering with just an email address. ""There were some alternatives, but none of them were as good as Binance,"" said Asal Alizade, a trader in Tehran who said she used the exchange for two years until September 2021. ""It didn't need identity verification, so we all used it."" Eleven other people in Iran beyond those interviewed by Reuters said on their LinkedIn profiles that they too traded crypto at Binance after the 2018 ban. None of them responded to questions. The exchange's popularity in Iran was known inside the company. Senior employees knew of, and joked about, the exchange's growing ranks of Iranian users, according to 10 messages they sent to one another in 2019 and 2020 that are reported here for the first time. ""IRAN BOYS,"" one of them wrote in response to data showing the popularity of Binance on Instagram in Iran. Binance did not respond to Reuters' questions about Iran. In a March blog post, published in response to Western sanctions on Russia, Binance said it ""follows international sanction rules strictly"" and had assembled a ""global compliance task force, including world-renowned sanctions and law enforcement experts."" Binance said it used ""banking grade tools"" to prevent sanctioned people or entities from using its platform. Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not respond to a request for comment. The Iranian trading on the exchange could draw interest from U.S. regulators, seven lawyers and sanctions experts told Reuters. Binance, whose holding company is based in the Cayman Islands, says it does not have a single headquarters. It does not give details about the entity behind its main Binance.com exchange which does not accept customers in the United States. Instead, U.S. clients are directed to a separate exchange called Binance.US, which - according to a 2020 regulatory filing - is ultimately controlled by Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao. Lawyers say this structure means Binance is protected from direct U.S. sanctions that ban U.S. firms from doing business in Iran. This is because the traders in Iran used Binance's main exchange, which is not a U.S. company. But Binance does run a risk of so-called secondary sanctions, which aim to prevent foreign firms from doing business with sanctioned entities or helping Iranians evade the U.S. trade embargo. As well as causing reputational damage, secondary sanctions can also choke off a company's access to the U.S. financial system. Binance's exposure would depend on whether sanctioned parties traded on the platform and whether Iranian clients dodged the U.S. trade embargo as a result of their transactions, four lawyers said. Non-U.S. exchanges ""can face consequences for facilitating sanctionable conduct, whereby they have exposure for allowing the processing of transactions for sanctioned parties, or if they're on-boarding those types of users,"" said Erich Ferrari, principal attorney at Ferrari & Associates law firm in Washington. Reuters did not find evidence that sanctioned individuals used Binance. Asked about traders in Iran using Binance, a spokesperson for the U.S. Treasury declined to comment. Binance kept weak compliance checks on its users until last year, despite concerns raised by some senior company figures, Reuters reported in January, drawing on interviews with former senior employees, internal messages and correspondence with national regulators. The exchange said in response it was pushing industry standards higher. Reuters' new reporting shows for the first time how the gaps in Binance's compliance programme allowed traders in Iran to do business on the exchange. Binance dominates the $950 billion crypto industry, offering its 120 million users a panoply of digital coins, derivatives and non-fungible tokens, processing trades worth hundreds of billions of dollars a month. The exchange is increasingly going mainstream. Its billionaire founder Zhao – known as CZ – this year extended his reach into traditional business by pledging $500 million to Tesla boss Elon Musk's planned takeover of Twitter. Musk has since said he is pulling out of the deal. Last month Binance hired Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo to promote its NFT business. Since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, the West and the United Nations have imposed sanctions on Iran in response to its nuclear programme, along with alleged human rights violations and support for terrorism. Iran has long maintained the nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. Under the 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers, Tehran curbed its nuclear programme in return for an easing of some of the sanctions. In May 2018, President Donald Trump ditched the accord and ordered the reimposition of the U.S. sanctions that were relaxed under the deal. The curbs came back into effect in August and November that year. After Trump's move, Binance added Iran to a list of what it called ""sanctioned countries"" on its terms of use agreement, saying it could ""restrict or deny"" services in such areas. In November 2018, it warned its customers in Iran by email to withdraw their crypto from their accounts ""as soon as possible."" Publicly, some Binance executives lauded its compliance programme. Its then chief financial officer said in a December 2018 blog it had invested heavily in countering dirty money, saying it took a ""proactive approach to detecting and squashing money laundering."" In March the following year, it hired a U.S. compliance platform to help it screen for sanctions risks. By August 2019, Binance deemed Iran – along with Cuba, Syria, North Korea and Crimea – a ""HARD 5 SANCTIONED"" jurisdiction, where the exchange would not do business, according to an internal document seen by Reuters. The May 2020 document included Iran on a list of countries headed ""strictly no,"" citing Chief Compliance Officer Samuel Lim. Even as Binance's stance on Iran hardened, its profile among the country's legions of crypto users was growing, traders said, citing their knowledge of the local industry. Cryptocurrencies grew attractive there as sanctions took a heavy toll on the economy. Since the birth of bitcoin in 2008, users have been drawn to crypto's promise of economic freedom beyond the reach of governments. Cut off from global financial services, many Iranians relied on bitcoin to do business on the internet, users said. ""Cryptocurrency is a good way to circumvent sanctions and make good money,"" said Ali, a trader who spoke on condition he was identified by only his first name. Ali said he used Binance for around a year. He shared with Reuters messages with Binance customer service representatives that showed the exchange closed his account last year. They said Binance was not able to serve users from Iran, citing recommendations from United Nations Security Council sanctions lists. Other traders at the exchange cited its weak background checks on clients, as well as its easy-to-use trading platform, deep liquidity and a large number of cryptocurrencies that could be traded as reasons for its growth in Iran. Pooria Fotoohi, who lives in Tehran and says he runs a crypto hedge fund, said he used Binance from 2017 until September last year. Binance won over Iranians because of its ""simple"" know-your-customer controls, he said, noting how traders could open accounts simply by providing an email address. ""They succeeded in gaining a huge trading volume, with many pairs of currencies, within a short period of time,"" said Fotoohi. Binance's Angels – volunteers who share information on the exchange across the globe – also helped spread the word. In December 2017, Angels announced the launch of a group called ""Binance Persian"" on the Telegram messaging app. The group is no longer active. Reuters couldn't determine how long it operated, but identified at least one Iranian who was an active Angel after Washington reimposed sanctions. Mohsen Parhizkar was an Angel from November 2017 to September 2020, managing the Persian group and helping its users, according to his LinkedIn profile. A person who worked with Parhizkar confirmed his role and shared messages they exchanged. Contacted by Reuters, Parhizkar said Binance had cancelled programmes in Iran because of sanctions. He didn't elaborate. After its 2018 ban, at least three senior Binance employees were aware that the exchange remained popular in Iran and was used by clients there, 10 Telegram and company chat messages between the employees that were seen by Reuters show. By September 2019, Tehran was among the top cities for followers of Binance's Instagram page, topping New York and Istanbul, one message from the same month shows. The employees then made light of this. One jokingly suggested advertising Binance's popularity in Iran, saying, ""Push that on Binance U.S. Twitter."" In a separate exchange from April 2020, a senior employee also noted that Iranian traders were using Binance, without saying how he knew this. A Binance compliance document from the same year, reviewed by Reuters, gave Iran the highest risk rating of all countries for illegal finance. Further underpinning Binance's growth in Iran, traders said, was the ease with which users could skirt curbs via virtual private networks (VPNs) and tools to conceal internet protocol (IP) addresses that can link internet use to a location. North Korean hackers used VPNs to obscure their locations while setting up accounts on Binance to launder stolen crypto in 2020, Reuters reported in June. Mehdi Qaderi, a business development worker, said he used a VPN to trade around $4,000 worth of crypto on Binance in the year to August 2021. ""All of the Iranians were using it,"" Qaderi said of Binance. In a 2021 guide to how sanctions applied to crypto firms, the U.S. Treasury said sophisticated analytic tools existed that could detect IP address obfuscation. Crypto companies could also gather information to alert them to users in a sanctioned country, it said, such as from email addresses. ""Crypto exchanges would be expected to have these types of measures in place in order to comply with sanctions,"" said Syedur Rahman, legal director at Rahman Ravelli law firm in London. Binance itself had supported the use of VPNs. Zhao, Binance's CEO, tweeted in June 2019 that VPNs were ""a necessity, not optional."" He deleted the remark by the end of 2020. Asked about the tweet, Binance didn't comment. In July the following year, Binance published on its website a ""Beginners' Guide to VPNs."" One of its tips: ""You might want to use a VPN to access sites that are blocked in your country."" Zhao was aware of crypto users circumventing Binance's controls in general. He told interviewers in November 2020 that ""users do find intelligent ways to get around our block sometimes and we just have to be smarter about the way we block.""

Putin used a meeting with parliamentary leaders on Thursday to dare the United States and its allies to try to defeat Russia in Ukraine, which Russia invaded on Feb. 24. Parliamentary leaders all thanked Putin for his decisions. The Russian parliament, dominated by a party which always supports Putin, listed some amendments on competition and information policy that would be discussed at the extraordinary session. Vladimir Vasilyev, the head of the United Russia party, which has 325 seats in the 450-seat parliament, said that lawmakers would discuss more than 60 issues at the session. ""It is necessary that the processes going on now receive a legal response,"" Vasilyev said on the pro-Putin party's Telegram channel. ""So the council discussed the agenda for the 15th: we plan to consider a little than 60 issues,"" Vasilyev said. He did not disclose what the issues were. The Communist Party said more than 80 draft laws would be discussed. At the meeting with Putin on Thursday, Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin told Putin that the Russian parliament would help two Russian-backed self-declared breakaway republics in eastern Ukraine to develop their legal system. Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because Moscow had to defend Russian-speaking people against persecution which he says the West has ignored. Ukraine and its Western backers say that Putin has no justification for what they say is an imperial-style land grab against a country whose borders Moscow recognised as the Soviet Union collapsed. Putin has increasingly cast the war as a battle between Russia and the United States, which he says humiliated Russia since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union by enlarging NATO eastwards and was using Ukraine to threaten Russia. The United States has repeatedly said it does not want to fight Russia. President Joe Biden said in March that Putin could not remain in power, remarks the White House later said did not mean Washington was seeking regime change in Moscow."
27,https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-germany-gas/germanys-gas-crisis-in-charts-pipeline-repair-and-then-what-idUSKBN2OM0II,"July 11, 2022","Germany's gas crisis in charts: Pipeline repair, and then what?"," The flow of gas from Russia to Germany through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline stopped on Monday as a planned 10-day maintenance period began. The question is: Will flows then resume? Germany, Europe's largest economy, is largely dependent on Russian gas to fuel its export-led economy and to keep homes warm. But the nation has been bracing for a possible complete halt in Russian supplies if Moscow steps up its use of gas as an economic weapon against the West while it wages war in Ukraine. Already down from last year, Russian gas flows slowed even further through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline last month, and Berlin moved to the second of three stages of its supply emergency plan. Industry executives and economists are scrambling to figure out how Germany will fare in the coming months and beyond, and where it is especially vulnerable. Germany is known for its cars, and its machine tools fill factories throughout China, but sectors likely to be hardest hit are also its glass and chemicals industries. Here are six charts that illustrate Germany's exposure: 1. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia through the Baltic Sea is the most important direct gas route into Germany. Before the start of maintenance, flows were already down to 40% of capacity, with Russia citing trouble with turbines and sanctions. There is concern that after the maintenance period the pipeline closes for good. In that event, storage caverns would not be filled in time for the winter heating season, which is just three months away. 2. It's not just Germany. Gas flows to Europe are also curtailed via routes linking Russia with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Austria via Ukraine and on another route through Belarus and Poland. 3. Less gas and caps on prices for consumers have put the squeeze on energy suppliers like the German utility Uniper (UN01.DE), which is in talks with the government about a possible bailout. Uniper's plight is so far the most vivid example of the war's effect on corporate Germany. 4. German industry, which includes titans like Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Siemens , is the biggest consumer of gas, but half of all households, which heat with gas, aren't far behind. Emergency plans say homes should be prioritised if the state is forced into rationing, alongside hospitals and essential services, but there are also calls to make households part of savings programmes. 5. Within the industries consuming gas for their processes, Germany's chemical sector is the biggest single consumer. According to Moody's, BASF (BASFn.DE) alone uses 4% of Germany's gas at its Ludwigshafen site. ""In a scenario of reduced gas availability, European chemicals producers could face at least two winters with tight gas supplies,"" Moody's said in a research note, adding costs would go up as well. 6. In the grimmest scenario, a complete halt to Russian natural gas exports could cost Germany 12.7% of economic performance in the second half of 2022, according to the Bavarian vbw industry association. That would translate into 193 billion euros ($195.57 billion) in total economic losses. Germany may be famous for its cars, but the industries that stand to see their activities most curtailed by lack of gas include glass, iron and steel, ceramics, food and printing, with vast knock-on effects to other sectors.

Physical flows dropped to 439,720 kilowatt-hours per hour (kWh/h) on Monday, from 9 am to 10 am, compared with physical flows over 29 million kwh/h earlier in the morning and over most of the previous day. Nord Stream 1 started annual maintenance on Monday, with flows expected to stop until maintenance ends on July 21, but governments, markets and companies are worried the shutdown might be extended due to war in Ukraine. Nominations for Russian gas flows into Slovakia from Ukraine via the Velke Kapusany border point stood at 37.8 million cubic metres (mcm) per day, up from 36.9 mcm the previous day, data from the Ukrainian transmission system operator showed. Russian gas producer Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said its supply of gas to Europe through Ukraine via the Sudzha entry point was seen at 39.4 mcm on Monday compared with 41.9 mcm a day earlier. Eastbound gas flows via the Yamal-Europe pipeline to Poland from Germany rose on Monday morning, data from pipeline operator Gascade showed. Exit flows at the Mallnow metering point on the German border were at 4,803,874 kWh/h, up from levels around 4,100,000 kWh/h for much of the previous day."
