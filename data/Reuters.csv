A missile strike on the northeastern city of Kharkiv wounded three civilians, its governor said, though Russia's main attacks appeared focused southeast of there in Luhansk and Donetsk. Those two provinces, parts of which were held by pro-Russian separatists before the conflict began in February, comprise the eastern industrial region of the Donbas. Ukrainian officials reported strikes in both on Saturday, while Britain's Ministry of Defence said Moscow was assembling reserve forces from across Russia near Ukraine.  Donetsk regional Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on the Telegram messaging service that a Russian missile had struck Druzhkivka, a town behind the front line, and reported shelling of other population centres. Luhansk Governor Serhiy Gaidai said on Telegram that Russian forces were ""firing along the entire front line"", though a subsequent Ukrainian counter-attack that hit weapons and ammunition stores had forced Moscow to halt its offensive. Russia, which claimed control over all of Luhansk province last weekend, denies targeting civilians. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dismissed several of Kyiv's senior envoys abroad.  In a decree posted on the presidential website, Zelenskiy gave no reason for firing ambassadors to Germany, India, the Czech Republic, Norway and Hungary. Zelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and high-end weapons to slow Russia's advance. U.S. President Joe Biden signed a weapons package for Ukraine on Friday worth up to $400 million, including four additional high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS).  Zelenskiy said those armaments were priority needs. In reaction, the Russian Embassy in Washington said the United States wanted to ""prolong the conflict at all costs"". On Saturday U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urging the international community to join forces to condemn Russian aggression, told journalists he had raised concerns with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi over Beijing's alignment with Moscow.  The pair held over five hours of talks on the sidelines of the G20 gathering of foreign ministers on the Indonesian island of Bali. On Friday, Russia's Sergei Lavrov had walked out of a meeting there, denouncing the West for ""frenzied criticism"". The Chinese foreign ministry said, without giving details, that Wang and Blinken had discussed ""the Ukraine issue"". It also quoted Wang as saying that Sino-American relations were in danger of being further led ""astray"", with many people believing that ""the United States is suffering from an increasingly serious bout of 'Chinaphobia'."" Shortly before the Russian invasion, Beijing and Moscow announced a ""no limits"" partnership, although U.S. officials have said they have not seen China evade U.S.-led sanctions on Russia or provide it with military equipment. Kharkiv's Governor Oleh Synehubov said on Telegram that, as well as the missile strike, fighters had repulsed two Russian attacks near Dementiivka, a town situated between the city and the border with Russia. Russia's defence ministry said its forces hit two ""bases of foreign mercenaries deployed near Kharkiv"". Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov also said troops had destroyed ammunition depots in the Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions. Russian-backed forces in the territory of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) said three people died and 17 were wounded there in the past 24 hours as Ukrainian forces shelled 10 locations. Alexei Kulemzin, mayor of Donetsk, wrote on Telegram that two women had died as a result of shelling in the city's Kirovskyi district. Reuters could not independently verify battlefield accounts. Following Friday's testy G20 exchanges, President Vladimir Putin also signalled that the Kremlin was in no mood for compromise, saying sanctions against Russia risked causing ""catastrophic"" energy price rises.  Putin had indicated on Thursday that prospects of finding a solution to the conflict were currently slim, saying Russia's campaign in Ukraine had barely started. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Saturday that sanctions were working, and echoed calls for more deliveries of high-precision Western weapons. ""Russians desperately try to lift those sanctions which proves that they do hurt them. Therefore, sanctions must be stepped up until Putin drops his aggressive plans,"" Kuleba told a forum in Dubrovnik by videolink. Since Russia, which has also seized a big chunk of territory across Ukraine's south, started what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine, cities have been bombed to rubble, thousands have been killed, and millions displaced. Ukraine and its Western allies say Russia is engaged in an unprovoked land grab."

The diplomats both described their first in-person discussions since October as ""candid"", with the meeting taking place a day after they attended a gathering of G20 foreign ministers on the Indonesian island of Bali. ""I shared again with the state councillor that we are concerned about the PRC's alignment with Russia,"" Blinken told a news conference after the talks, referring to the People's Republic of China. He said did not think China was behaving in a neutral way as it had supported Russia in the United Nations and ""amplified Russian propaganda"". Blinken said Chinese President Xi Jinping had made it clear in a call with President Vladimir Putin on June 13 that he stood by a decision to form a partnership with Russia. Shortly before Russia's Feb. 24 Ukraine invasion, Beijing and Moscow announced a ""no limits"" partnership, although U.S. officials say they have not seen China evade tough U.S.-led sanctions on Russia or provide it with military equipment. U.S. officials have warned of consequences, including sanctions, should China offer material support for the war that Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" to degrade the Ukrainian military. Kyiv and its Western allies say the invasion is an unprovoked land grab. Asked about his refusal to hold talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at the G20, Blinken said: ""The problem is this: we see no signs whatsoever that Russia, at this moment in time, is prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy."" Wang exchanged in-depth views on ""the Ukraine issue"" during Saturday's talks, according to a statement released by his ministry, without giving details. He also told Blinken that the direction of U.S.-China relations was in danger of being further led ""astray"" due to a problem with the United States' perception of China. ""Many people believe that the United States is suffering from an increasingly serious bout of 'Sinophobia',"" Wang was quoted as saying.  Wang also said Washington should cancel additional tariffs imposed on China as soon as possible and cease unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies. U.S. officials had said before the talks that the meeting was aimed at keeping the difficult U.S.-China relationship stable and preventing it from veering inadvertently into conflict.  ""Moving forward, the United States wants our channels of communication with Beijing to continue to remain open,"" Blinken said. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in late June that U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping were expected to speak again in the next few weeks.  Daniel Russel, a top U.S. diplomat for East Asia under former President Barack Obama who has close contact with Biden administration officials, said ahead of the talks a key aim for the meeting would be to explore the possibility of an in-person meeting between Biden and Xi, their first as leaders, possibly on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Bali in November. The United States calls China its main strategic rival and is concerned it might one day attempt to take over the self-ruled democratic island of Taiwan, just as Russia attacked Ukraine. Despite their rivalry, the world's two largest economies remain major trading partners, and Biden has been considering scrapping tariffs on a range of Chinese goods to curb surging U.S. inflation before November midterm elections, with control of Congress in focus.  (This story corrects paragraph 14 to make clear it was the U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, speaking in June, not Blinken, who said Biden and Xi expected to speak again in coming weeks)"

The Conservative Party's so-called 1922 Committee of legislators will set out the exact rules and timetable for the contest next week after Johnson was forced to quit by his own party. Many lawmakers are pushing for a fast-tracked process. On Saturday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and finance minister Nadhim Zahawi became the latest Conservative lawmakers to officially declare they were putting themselves forward for the leadership, taking the total to six, but around 10 others are also expected to join the race.  The Mail on Sunday said Foreign Secretary Liz Truss would launch her campaign on Monday with a promise to cut taxes and tackle the cost-of-living crisis, while one of her main rivals for the role, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, ruled himself out. ""My aim is a simple one: to provide the opportunities that were afforded to my generation, to all Britons, whoever you are and wherever you come from. To steady the ship and to stabilise the economy,"" Sky News quoted Zahawi, who was appointed finance minister by Johnson on Tuesday, as saying. Shapps told the Sunday Times he was ruling out holding a national election if successful, but would produce an emergency budget within his first 100 days that would cut taxes for the most vulnerable and give state support to firms with high levels of energy consumption. Conservative lawmakers will hold a series of votes to reduce the field to two final candidates, who will then face a postal ballot of the wider Conservative Party membership.  ""Clearly what we would want to do, and I think even the candidates would admit this is, is to eliminate some of those that are clearly not going to get enough support to get in the last two at a relatively early stage,"" 1922 Committee treasurer Geoffrey Clifton-Brown told Times Radio. Clifton-Brown said this could be done by upping the number of signatures from other Conservative lawmakers required to be nominated, and by increasing the threshold of votes candidates must receive to progress to the next round. ""I think that we will be able to frame a process to actually come up with two names by the time parliament goes down on the 20th of July,"" he said. ""We should have an answer by the time of the party conference in October and maybe before that."" Wallace, who has risen in popularity thanks to his handling of the Ukraine crisis and was considered one of the frontrunners, ruled himself out on Saturday.  ""It has not been an easy choice to make, but my focus is on my current job and keeping this great country safe,"" he said on Twitter."

In a decree that gave no reason for the move, Zelenskiy announced the sacking of Ukraine's ambassadors to Germany, India, the Czech Republic, Norway and Hungary. It was not immediately clear if the envoys would be assigned new positions. Zelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and military aid for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. Kyiv's relations with Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies and also Europe's biggest economy, are particularly sensitive. Andriy Melnyk, who was appointed by Zelenskiy's predecessor as ambassador to Germany in late 2014, is well-known among politicians and diplomats in Berlin. The 46-year-old regularly engages in outspoken social media exchanges, and has branded politicians and intellectuals who oppose arming Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion as appeasers. He once accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of behaving like an ""offended liver sausage"" when Scholz did not immediately accept an invitation by Zelenskiy to visit Kyiv. Kyiv and Berlin are currently at odds over a German-made turbine undergoing maintenance in Canada. Germany wants Ottawa to return the turbine to Russian natural gas giant Gazprom to pump gas to Europe.  Kyiv has urged Canada to keep the turbine, saying shipping it to Russia would be a violation of sanctions imposed on Moscow. "

Since the Feb. 24 invasion, Russian forces have taken control of a big chunk of territory across Ukraine's southern flank above Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Russia is slowly pushing Ukrainian forces out of two Russian-backed rebel regions of east Ukraine which it has recognised as independent states. When asked how the conflict might end, Russian Ambassador Andrei Kelin said it was difficult to see Russian and Russian-backed forces withdrawing from the south of Ukraine, and that Ukraine's soldiers would be pushed back from all of Donbas. ""We are going to liberate all of the Donbas,"" Kelin told Reuters in an interview in his London residence where Winston Churchill used to discuss World War Two strategy with Josef Stalin's ambassador. ""Of course it is difficult to predict the withdrawal of our forces from the southern part of Ukraine because we have already experience that after withdrawal, provocations start and all the people are being shot and all that."" Russia says Ukraine has repeatedly killed civilians in attacks on territory held by Russian backed separatists in Ukraine's Donbas since 2014. Fighting over the frontline in that region caused thousands of casualties on both sides long before Russia's invasion this year. The ambassador's comments mark one of the most explicit public descriptions of Russia's potential endgame in Ukraine: essentially a forced partition that would leave Ukraine shorn of more than one fifth of its post-Soviet territory. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says Ukraine will never accept Russian occupation of its territory and will fight on until the last Russian soldier is pushed out of Ukraine. The Ukrainian government did not immediately comment on the Russian ambassador's remarks. Sooner or later, Kelin said, Ukraine would have to decide: strike a peace deal with Russia or ""continue slipping down this hill"" to ruin. President Vladimir Putin on Thursday accused the West of decades of aggression towards Moscow and warned that if it wanted to attempt to beat Russia on the battlefield it was welcome to try, but this would bring tragedy for Ukraine.  ""Is escalation possible? Of course,"" Kelin said. ""If the flow of weapons is organised in such a way that it endangers our strategic situation, our defense, we will have to take serious measures against that."" Kelin said the West did not understand the true causes of the conflict and had ignored Russia's concerns. ""The narrative is very short: Russia has been aggressive against an innocent Ukraine,"" Kelin said. ""This is not true at all."" Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because Moscow had to defend Russian-speaking people against persecution which he says the West has ignored. He also casts the war as a necessary revolt against the United States, which he says has humiliated Russia since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union by enlarging NATO eastwards and was using Ukraine to threaten Russia. Ukraine and its Western backers say that Putin has no justification for what they say is an imperial-style land grab against a country whose borders Moscow recognised as the Soviet Union collapsed. The conflict in Ukraine began in 2014: after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, fighting was triggered between Russian-backed forces and Ukraine's soldiers in eastern Ukraine. Before the invasion, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission found human rights violations were committed by all sides in eastern Ukraine. It found no evidence of genocide. Moscow has also criticised a Ukrainian law which obliges all citizens to know Ukrainian. Ukraine denies it persecutes Russian speakers. Kelin said Ukraine had been preparing for war for some time, helped by the United States and Britain. Putin says Ukraine is being used by the West as part of a plan to weaken and even destroy Russia. ""I don’t think that Europe understands what Ukrainian nationalism is,"" Kelin said. The result: Russia is moving closer to China, he said. ""If sanctions will continue to be imposed on Russia, we will make a big turn to China and the East."""

Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the Canadian minister, Melanie Joly, that their countries had never been rivals but partners, and China had never been posed a threat but an opportunity. The ministers met on Friday on the sidelines of a G20 meeting in Bali, Indonesia. Tension between China and Canada deepened after Canada in 2018 detained an executive of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei on a U.S. warrant linked to a suspected breach of U.S. sanctions on Iran. China, which said the accusation was fabricated, subsequently arrested two Canadians on spying charges. Canada dismissed the accusations against the two. The diplomatic standoff ended when all three were released in September 2021.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine was in the spotlight at the G20 meeting, as was China's position on the conflict. Last month, G7 leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, pressed China to use its influence with Russia to end its attack on Ukraine and drop ""expansive"" Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea.  Also in June, Canada's military accused Chinese warplanes of harassing its patrol aircraft as they monitored North Korea sanction evasions.

Biden, a Democrat, has been under pressure from his own party to take action after the landmark decision last month to overturn Roe v Wade, which upended roughly 50 years of protections for women's reproductive rights. The order directs the government's health department to expand access to ""medication abortion"" - pills prescribed to end pregnancies - and ensure women have access to emergency medical care, family planning services and contraception. It also mentions protecting doctors, women who travel for abortions and mobile abortion clinics at state borders. But it offered few specifics and promises to have limited impact in practice, since U.S. states can make laws restricting abortion and access to medication. ""What we're witnessing wasn't a constitutional judgment, it was an exercise in raw political power,"" Biden told reporters at the White House. ""We cannot allow an out of control Supreme Court, working in conjunction with extremist elements of the Republican party, to take away freedoms and our personal autonomy."" The White House is not publicly entertaining the idea of reforming the court itself or expanding the nine-member panel. Instead, Biden laid out how abortion rights could be codified into law by voters if they elected ""two additional pro-choice senators, and a pro-choice House"" and urged women to turn out in record numbers to vote. He said he would veto any law passed by Republicans to ban abortion rights nationwide. Jen Klein, director of the president’s Gender Policy Council at the White House, did not name any specifics when asked what the order would change for women. ""You can’t solve by executive action what the Supreme Court has done,"" she said. Still, progressive lawmakers and abortion rights groups welcomed the directive. Senator Elizabeth Warren called it ""important first steps,"" and asked the administration to explore every available option to protect abortion rights. The issue may help drive Democrats to the polls in the November midterm elections, when Republicans have a chance of taking control of Congress. Protecting abortion rights is a top issue for women Democrats, Reuters polling shows, and more than 70% of Americans think the issue should be left to a woman and her doctor.  Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said ""Democrats are out of touch with the American people"" after Biden's remarks. In June, Biden proposed that U.S. senators remove a legislative roadblock by temporarily lifting the Senate ""filibuster"" to restore abortion rights, but the suggestion was shot down by aides to key Democratic senators.  Earlier in June, sources told Reuters the White House was unlikely to take the bold steps on abortion access that Democratic lawmakers have called for, such as court reform or offering reproductive services on federal lands.  The Supreme Court's ruling restored states' ability to ban abortion. As a result, women with unwanted pregnancies face the choice of traveling to another state where the procedure remains legal and available, buying abortion pills online, or having a potentially dangerous illegal abortion."

Biden had been due to discuss the tariffs with his advisers on Friday, but it was unclear when he would make a decision on whether to remove some of them to try to fight inflation, people familiar with the deliberations said. ""I haven’t made that decision,"" Biden told reporters when asked about his plans for the tariffs after signing an executive order to protect access to abortions. ""We’re going through them one at a time,"" he said of the tariffs. Biden has been struggling in recent weeks to balance competing desires to use every lever possible to ease inflation and to maintain pressure on China to try to win concessions on Beijing's state-driven economic policies. The discussions surround the ""Section 301"" tariffs imposed in 2018 and 2019 by then-President Donald Trump on thousands of products valued at $370 billion at the time over China's alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property. Some in the administration, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have argued that many of these duties are ""non-strategic"" and raise costs for American consumers and businesses. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai has said the tariffs are ""a significant piece of leverage"" in the U.S.-China trade relationship. Other sources close to the process have said that Biden is taking his time to work through the complex web of options and consequences, which include removing a substantial amount of tariffs goods, and cutting them from a more limited list of Chinese-made consumer products. The White House also is considering an expanded process for approving product-specific exclusions from the tariffs and whether to pair any action with a new Section 301 investigation into China's state subsidies and plans to dominate high-technology industries, the sources have said. The White House had no immediate comment on the tariff discussions. More than 400 requests from industry and labor groups have requested that the U.S. Trade Representative's office keep the China tariffs in place, indicating that Biden could face some backlash if he chooses a substantial tariff reduction.

In a 4-3 ruling, the court's conservative majority also said voters cannot have other people return their completed ballots in person to a clerk's office, though it declined to rule on whether anyone other than a voter can send in ballots by mail. The decision ensures that drop boxes will not be in place for the state's August primary election as well as November's general election, when Democratic Governor Tony Evers and Republican U.S. Senator Ron Johnson will both seek re-election in crucial midterm races. Republicans across the country have sought to limit the use of absentee ballots after the 2020 election, when then-President Donald Trump falsely claimed that mail voting and drop boxes helped facilitate election fraud. Election officials say the boxes are secure. Wisconsin is likely a key battleground in the 2024 presidential election. In 2016, Trump won the state by fewer than 25,000 votes out of 2.8 million cast, and in 2020, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, carried Wisconsin by fewer than 21,000 votes out of 3.2 million cast. The Wisconsin high court affirmed a ruling from a lower court judge after a conservative group, the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, sued the state's elections commission on behalf of two voters. The commission had approved the use of drop boxes in response to the pandemic, when many voters were anxious to limit in-person interactions. The November 2020 election included 528 boxes statewide, according to election officials. But Justice Rebecca Bradley, writing for the majority, said that under state law ballots must be returned to a clerk's office or another designated site, not an ""inanimate object"" such as an unstaffed box. ""Only the legislature may permit absentee voting via ballot drop boxes,"" she wrote. In dissent, Justice Ann Walsh Bradley - joined by the court's two other liberals - said the decision erected a new barrier to voting with little justification. ""Although it pays lip service to the import of the right to vote, the majority/lead opinion has the practical effect of making it more difficult to exercise it,"" she wrote. The dissent also argued that the decision to bar other people from returning ballots to clerks' offices would primarily hurt homebound residents, including disabled and sick people. In a statement, Evers said, ""Today's decision is another in a long line of Wisconsin Republicans' successes to make it harder for Wisconsinites to exercise their right to vote, to undermine our free, fair, and secure elections, and to threaten our democracy."" Robin Vos, the Republican leader in the state assembly, praised the decision on Twitter. ""Our next step has to be electing a new governor who will sign additional election reforms,"" he wrote."

Griner was speaking at the second hearing of her trial on a narcotics charge that carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, days after she urged U.S. President Joe Biden to secure her release.  ""I'd like to plead guilty, your honour. But there was no intent. I didn't want to break the law,"" Griner said, speaking quietly in English which was then translated into Russian for the court. ""I'd like to give my testimony later. I need time to prepare,"" she added. The next court hearing was scheduled for July 14. Griner's lawyers told reporters they were hoping for the most lenient sentencing possible, taking into account ""the nature of her case, the insignificant amount of the substance and BG’s personality and history of positive contributions to global and Russian sport."" ""We, as her defense, explained to her the possible consequences. Brittney stressed that she committed the crime out of carelessness, getting ready to board a plane to Russia in a hurry, not intending to break Russian law,"" said Griner's attorney, Maria Blagovolina, a partner at Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin and Partners law firm. ""We certainly hope this circumstance, in combination with the defence evidence, will be taken into account when passing the sentence, and it will be mild."" Griner's legal team said it expected the trial to conclude around the beginning of August: ""Brittney sets an example of being brave."" Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medallist, was detained in February at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport with vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in Russia, and has been kept in custody since. The WNBA's players association released a statement reiterating its support for the eight-time All-Star. Griner will be recognised as an honorary starter at this weekend's WNBA All-Star Game. ""The WNBA continues to work diligently with the U.S. State Department, the White House, and other allies in and outside government to get Brittney home safely and as soon as possible,"" said WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert. The White House said Griner's guilty plea would have no impact on U.S. negotiations to bring her home. In a handwritten note, Griner appealed to Biden directly earlier this week to step up U.S. efforts to bring her home. ""I realize you are dealing with so much, but please don't forget about me and the other American detainees..."" Griner wrote. ""Please do all you can to bring us home."" Biden spoke to Griner's wife on Wednesday, telling her he was working to have the basketball star released ""as soon as possible"", the White House said.  Officials from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow attended Griner's trial and delivered a letter to her from Biden, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. ""We will not relent until Brittney, Paul Whelan and all other wrongfully detained Americans are reunited with their loved ones,"" he tweeted, referring to former U.S. Marine Whelan who has been imprisoned in Russia since 2018 on espionage charges. U.S. officials and many athletes have called for the release of Griner - or ""BG"" as she is known to basketball fans - who they say has been wrongfully detained. Her case has prompted concerns that Moscow could use it as leverage to negotiate the release of a high-profile Russian citizen in U.S. custody. Griner, a centre for the Phoenix Mercury in the Women's National Basketball Association, had played for UMMC Ekaterinburg in the Russian Women's Basketball Premier League to boost her income during the WNBA off-season, like several other U.S. players. Russian authorities say there is no basis to consider Griner's detention illegal and that the case against her is not political despite Moscow's fraught relations with the United States over the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Moscow's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Thursday that it was difficult to exchange prisoners with the United States and suggested Washington stop talking about the fate of Griner.  Asked about Ryabkov's remarks, the State Department said it would not comment on speculation. ""Using the practice of wrongful detention as a bargaining chip represents a threat to the safety of everyone traveling, working and living abroad. The United States opposes this practice everywhere,"" a State Department spokesperson said. The Russian foreign ministry has said Griner could appeal her sentence or apply for clemency once a verdict has been delivered."

Signalling that the Kremlin was in no mood for compromise, President Vladimir Putin said continued use of sanctions against Russia for the invasion it launched in February risked causing ""catastrophic"" energy price rises.  His top diplomat, Sergei Lavrov, clashed with his Western counterparts at a G20 meeting, where they urged Russia to allow Kyiv to ship blockaded Ukrainian grain out to an increasingly hungry world.  Meanwhile, Moscow's envoy to London offered little prospect of a pull-back from parts of Ukraine under Russian control. Ambassador Andrei Kelin told Reuters that Russian troops would capture the rest of Donbas in eastern Ukraine and were unlikely to withdraw from land across the southern coast. Ukraine would eventually have to strike a peace deal or ""continue slipping down this hill"" to ruin, he said.  On the Donbas frontlines, Ukrainian officials reported Russian shelling of towns and villages ahead of an anticipated push for more territory. A Ukrainian infantry unit on the road to the town of Siversk, whose members spoke to Reuters, had set up positions on the edge of a deep earth bunker covered with logs and sandbags and defended by machine guns.  In the Russian-occupied parts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in southern Ukraine, meanwhile, residents were urged to evacuate by the Ukrainian deputy prime minister in order to allow Ukrainian forces to launch a counter-offensive. ""Please leave - our army will begin retaking these areas. Our determination is rock solid. And it will be very difficult later to open humanitarian corridors when children are involved,"" said Iryna Vereshchuk, quoted in Ukrainian media. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy went on a visit to areas at and near the front, and said he spent the day visiting a hospital in Dnipro treating wounded soldiers and touring areas in the forward lines of defence in Dnipropetrovsk and Kriviy Rih regions. Mykhailo Podolyak, the Ukrainian chief negotiator in stalled talks with Russia, said a turning point was starting to take shape as Russian forces were forced to take an operational pause due to losses and to resupply. ""It is clear that they have to redeploy things, bring forward new troops and weaponry, and this is very good. A certain turning point is beginning to take shape because we are proving we are going to attack storage facilities and command centres,"" Podolyak told Ukraine's 24 Channel television. On Thursday, Putin had indicated that current prospects of finding a solution to the conflict were dim, saying Russia's campaign in Ukraine had barely started. Ambassador Kelin's remarks gave an insight into Russia's potential endgame - a forced partition that would leave its former Soviet neighbour shorn of more than a fifth of its post-Soviet territory. An escalation of the war was possible, Kelin said. Ukrainian officials, echoing comments by the deputy commander of the infantry unit outside Siversk, said they needed more high-grade Western weapons to shore up the their defences. U.S. President Joe Biden signed a new weapons package worth up to $400 million for Ukraine on Friday, including four additional high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and more ammunition.  Zelenskiy on Twitter thanked Biden for the HIMARS and shells, which he said were priority needs. ""It is what helps us press on the enemy,"" he said. The United States started providing the key precision rocket weapon system to Ukraine last month after receiving assurances from Kyiv that it would not use them to hit targets inside Russian territory. Kyiv has attributed battlefield successes to the arrival of the HIMARS. ""When they came in, the Russian war machine could instantly feel its effect,"" Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, told Reuters. But more Western military aid was vital, he added.  At the G20 meeting in Bali, Indonesia, some of the staunchest critics of the invasion confronted Lavrov, who walked out of a meeting and denounced the West for ""frenzied criticism."" High on the list of foreign ministers' concerns was getting grain shipments from Ukraine out through ports blocked by Russia's presence in the Black Sea and naval mines. Ukraine is a leading exporter and aid agencies have warned that many developing countries face devastating food shortages if supplies fail to reach them. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Moscow to let Ukrainian grain out, a Western official said. ""He addressed Russia directly, saying: 'To our Russian colleagues: Ukraine is not your country. Its grain is not your grain. Why are you blocking the ports? You should let the grain out,'"" the official said. Since Russia started in February what it calls a special operation to demilitarize Ukraine, cities have been bombed to rubble, thousands have been killed, and millions displaced. Ukraine and its Western allies say Russia is engaged in an unprovoked land grab. Russian forces have seized a big chunk of territory across Ukraine's southern flank and are waging a war of attrition in the Donbas, the eastern industrial heartland made up of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces. Luhansk's governor said Russian forces were indiscriminately shelling populated areas on Friday. ""They are not stopped even by the fact that civilians remain there, dying in houses and yards,"" Serhiy Gaidai said. Reuters could not independently verify battlefield accounts. In the city of Sievierodonetsk, which was fully occupied by Russian forces last month, most of the infrastructure has been destroyed and major repairs are needed, said Oleskandr Stryuk, the mayor, warning that sanitation in the meantime will be ""catastrophic."""

Marking the CIA's 75th anniversary, Biden said he had been involved with the agency for 52 of those years, first as a junior senator on a 1975 committee set up to investigate mind control experiments and other abuses by the agency. Intelligence gathered by the CIA had exposed Putin's plans and allowed Washington to warn other countries about the war, he said. ""It was thanks to the incredible work of our intelligence professionals that we were able to forewarn the world what Vladimir Putin was planning in Ukraine,"" he said. ""Exposing Putin's playbook punched a gigantic hole in the pretense, and discredited his lies about what we were doing in Ukraine."" Before Russia's invasion on Feb. 24, as Russia massed more than 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border, Putin repeatedly accused the United States and other Western powers of deliberately creating a scenario to lure Moscow into war. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation."" Biden's speech was a stark contrast to that of former President Donald Trump, who made his first speech as president at the CIA headquarters, where he criticized the news media and his political opponents in front of the ""wall of stars"" memorializing dozens of CIA agents who died on duty. Biden noted that two stars had been added to the wall this year. ""Your physical health and well-being are critically important to me and to your leadership here at the CIA,"" Biden said, in a possible reference to the Havana Syndrome, a series of anomalous health incidents that has affected some 200 U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers worldwide."

The current U.N. Security Council mandate for U.N. humanitarian aid - including food, medicine and shelter - to some 4 million people in opposition-controlled northwest Syria from Turkey expires on Sunday. Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said the only solution that Moscow would not veto was its own. That draft resolution failed on Friday after only Russia and China voted in favor. The United States, Britain and France voted against the Russian text, while the remaining 10 council members abstained. ""I do not see at this point any other option. Given the fact of the words that have been said today, I think this has been made almost impossible,"" Polyanskiy told reporters, adding that another council member could again put Russia's text to a vote. Before its own draft resolution failed, Russia had vetoed a proposal for a one-year extension - drafted by Ireland and Norway - which received 13 votes in favor. Despite a ""no limits"" strategic partnership with Moscow, China abstained on the vote. ""This is a life and death issue and tragically, people will die because of this vote and the country who shamelessly deployed the veto,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the council. China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun called on all council members ""not to give up"" and to continue negotiations, while Ireland's U.N. Ambassador Geraldine Byrne Nason said: ""We're not daunted by this veto. This is not the end of the road."" However, when asked if Russia would again veto any draft text that was not its own, Polyanskiy replied: ""Obviously."" Russia argues that the U.N. aid operation violates Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It says more aid should be delivered from inside the country, raising opposition fears that food and other aid would fall under government control. The United States, Britain and France said on Friday that a six-month extension is not long enough for aid groups to plan and operate effectively. Western powers are also against funding broad reconstruction efforts until progress is made toward a political solution in Syria, where a crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 led to civil war. The Security Council vote on the authorization of the aid operation has long been a contentious issue, but this year also comes amid heightened tensions between Russia and Western powers over Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. In 2014, the Security Council authorized humanitarian aid deliveries into opposition-held areas of Syria from Iraq, Jordan and two points in Turkey. But veto powers Russia and China have whittled that down to just one Turkish border point. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed to the council last month to extend its approval of the aid operation, telling the body: ""We cannot give up on the people of Syria."""
18,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-war-conscription-insig/more-russian-men-look-to-avoid-military-service-some-lawyers-and-rights-groups-say-idUSKBN2OJ0VP,"July 8, 2022","More Russian men look to avoid military service, some lawyers and rights groups say"," LONDON, July 8 (Reuters) - Danila Davydov said he left Russia within weeks of the Kremlin sending troops into Ukraine because he feared having to fight in a war he doesn’t support. The 22-year-old digital artist who had been living in St Petersburg said that as the conflict dragged on he was concerned that Russia could place pressure on young people like him to serve in the military. ""I didn't want to go to war or go to prison, so I decided to leave,"" Davydov told Reuters from Kazakhstan, where he said he’s currently working. He is among what some lawyers and rights advocates say is an increased number of young Russian men looking to avoid the country’s mandatory military service since the conflict with Ukraine began in late February, illustrating the ambivalence in Russian society to the conflict. Some young men are leaving the country while others are seeking advice on obtaining exemptions or alternative avenues, or simply ignoring their summons in the hopes that authorities don’t pursue them, according to Reuters interviews with seven men currently seeking to avoid serving in the military as well as five lawyers and rights advocates. That is despite the risk of facing fines or up to two years in prison - in a country where military service is mandatory for young men aged 18 to 27. One man told Reuters that refusing to fight has led to tensions with family members who believe military service is a young man’s duty. Davydov said that he was able to take himself off the military service register and leave the country because he had a job offer abroad. He wants to return home one day, he said, but laments it may not be any time soon: ""I love Russia and miss it very much.” The Kremlin referred questions to the defence ministry, which didn’t respond to a request for comment about how widespread draft avoidance is and whether it is impacting the function of the Russian armed forces. The ministry, on its website, says that ""service in the army and navy is the honourable duty of a Russian citizen that bestows considerable advantages in the future."" Moscow says it is conducting a special military operation and that it is going as planned. Russian President Vladimir Putin has lauded those who fight for Russia as ""heroes"" who are saving Russian-speakers from persecution and foiling what he says is a Western plan to destroy Russia. In March, he described Russians whose thoughts were more in line with the West than Russia as “traitors.”  On Feb 24 Russia sent thousands of troops into Ukraine, embarking on Europe’s biggest ground invasion since World War Two. Following Russia’s withdrawal of troops from near Kyiv, the war has slowed to a grinding artillery contest with Moscow focused on taking territory in eastern Ukraine. Putin is betting on a professional army that the West says has sustained significant losses in the war. If the army cannot recruit enough contract soldiers, Putin’s options would include using conscripts, mobilising Russian society or scaling back his ambitions. Although Putin has repeatedly publicly said conscripts should not fight in the Ukraine conflict, the defence ministry in early March said some already have. Last month, a military prosecutor told the upper house of parliament that about 600 conscripts had been drawn into the conflict and that around a dozen officers had been disciplined as a result.  Ukraine has imposed martial law: men aged 18 to 60 are banned from leaving the country. Kyiv says it will fight to the end against what it casts as an unprovoked imperial-style land grab. Since Peter the Great transformed Russia into a major European power, its rulers have often relied on conscription as part of Russia's vast military, one of the world's biggest fighting forces. Men of military age must serve a year as a conscript. Russia calls up around 260,000 annually in a twice-yearly draft. Russia's combined armed forces total about 900,000, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).  Avoiding the draft is a well-established practice, including via legitimate routes like deferring service by studying and claiming medical exemptions. But recent months have seen an increase in young men seeking help on how to do so, according to four lawyers and rights advocates groups that offer advice and legal aid to such young men. That has been mostly from people in major cities like Moscow and St Petersburg, according to two of those. One group that provides free legal advice called Release is co-run by Dmitry Lutsenko, a Russian now living in Cyprus. He said the membership of a public Telegram group for those seeking advice on how to avoid conscription that the group runs has increased to more than 1,000 people, up from about 200 prior to the conflict. Another rights group, called Citizen. Army. Law, focuses on advice to people seeking alternative types of military service, which involves working in a state-run organisation such as a hospital instead of the military. The group said it had seen a ten times increase in the number of people asking about alternative service to more than 400 this year, compared to about 40 during the equivalent period last year. “Many people are scared. They don’t want to go into an army that is fighting,” said Sergei Krivenko, who heads the organisation. Lawyer Denis Koksharov, chairman of the Prizyvnik legal association, said that earlier in the conflict he had seen a roughly 50% increase in the number of people seeking advice on avoiding military service, without specifying numbers. He added that the number of requests had since declined and more recently the organisation has seen an increase in young men wanting to volunteer to fight. Koksharov attributed the fluctuation to people becoming accustomed to the current situation and an increase in people “displaying patriotism.” MISSING HOME Fyodor Strelin, a 27-year old from St Petersburg, said he had protested against the war in the immediate aftermath of the invasion but decided to leave Russia in late February. Now in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, Strelin said he had previously avoided the draft after securing an exemption last year due to shortsightedness but chose to leave Russia due to concern about a general mobilisation. “I miss my home and for now I feel that I lost my place in life,” he said. Some young men who have been summoned for military service are ignoring the call in the hopes that the authorities get sufficient take up elsewhere, according to six of the young men, lawyers and rights advocates that Reuters spoke to. Kirill, a 26-year-old from southern Russia who works in technology, said that he received a conscription summons in April followed by a phone call in May requesting he attend a medical but has not responded because he doesn’t support Russia’s operation in Ukraine. That has caused tension with some family and friends who back the war and believe everyone should do their service, said Kirill, who asked his surname not be used. “The people in Ukraine are like brothers. I know many people in the country and I can’t support these actions,” he added. In June, police visited his home when he was out and asked his mother why he was avoiding his military service, according to Kirill. Reuters wasn’t able to corroborate Kirill’s account. Reuters attempted to reach the Russian interior ministry’s media relations office. The person answering the phone provided another number that went unanswered on multiple attempts. Reuters also sent an email but received an automated response saying it was undeliverable. Kyiv and Western allies estimate that Russia has lost at least as many men as the 15,000 Soviets killed in the Soviet-Afghan war of 1979-1989. Moscow has not updated its official casualty figure since late March, when it said that 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed and thousands more wounded since the start of the military campaign in Ukraine. There are signs that Russia is looking for more men to fight. In May, Putin signed a law that removed the upper age limit of 40 for people wanting to enlist in the Russian military. Lawmakers at the time said the change was to attract experienced people with specialism in areas such as advanced military equipment and engineering. One Russian man in his 30s, who requested he not be identified, told Reuters he was summoned by telephone to report to a military office on the pretext of clarifying some personal details. While there, he was questioned by an unidentified man in military clothing about his previous military service and offered 300,000 roubles ($5,000) a month if he signed up to fight in Ukraine, he said. Reuters was unable to independently verify his account. The man said he declined the offer because he was not a professional soldier and had never fired a shot since completing his service. “What use is 300,000 roubles to a dead man?” he said."
