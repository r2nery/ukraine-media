Those sanctioned include Alexander Abramov and Alexander Frolov, who Britain described as known associates of oligarch Roman Abramovich, himself sanctioned earlier this year. Abramov has an estimated net worth of 4.1 billion pounds ($4.7 billion) and Frolov 1.7 billion pounds, the foreign office statement said. They were targeted for their involvement in the extractive, transport and construction sectors, it added. Frolov is the former chief executive officer of Evraz, which was also sanctioned by Britain for operating in sectors of ""strategic significance to the government of Russia"". ""Today we are sanctioning an additional four oligarchs who rely on Putin for their positions of authority and in turn fund his military machine,"" Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said. ""By targeting these individuals, we are ramping up the economic pressure on (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and will continue to do so until Ukraine prevails."" The sanctions implemented include travel bans, asset freezes and transport sanctions, the foreign office said. The British government, which has been led by three prime ministers this year, has been consistent in its stance on the war, having imposed sanctions on hundreds of Russian individuals and entities since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. On a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy after taking office last week, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised him that the country's support for Ukraine would be steadfast and ""as strong as ever under his premiership"". The government said it has also sanctioned Airat Shaimiev, who has an estimated net worth of 902 million pounds, and Albert Shigabutdinov, with an estimated net worth of 977 million pounds. Shigabutdinov controlled roughly 96% of chemical and petrochemical processing in the Tatarstan region of Russia, including the production of crude oil, the statement said. ($1 = 0.8693 pounds)"
2022-11-02,https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-germany/iran-nuclear-deal-has-no-future-senior-german-coalition-party-official-idUSKBN2RS165,Iran nuclear deal 'has no future' - senior German coalition party official," Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers ""has no future and is not in line with reality"", a senior official in Germany's Free Democrats (FDP), junior partner in the ruling coalition, told two online news outlets in an interview published on Wednesday. Bijan Djir-Sarai, general secretary of the liberal FDP, told Web.de News and Gmx News that continuing talks on the deal would mean ""negotiating with an inhuman regime that is completely rejected by its own people and has no legitimacy whatsoever"". ""From my point of view, this agreement has no future and is not in line with reality,"" Djir-Sarai, who was born in Iran, said in a transcript of the interview released by the FDP. Efforts to revive the nuclear deal have stalled and ties between Iran and the West are increasingly strained as Iranians keep up anti-government protests despite an increasingly deadly state crackdown. U.S. President Joe Biden had sought to negotiate the return of Iran to the nuclear deal after then-President Donald Trump pulled out of the agreement in 2018. But last month the White House said it had set aside diplomacy for now and said Tehran had supplied drones to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson said last month the United States lacked the political will for the revival of the deal. The 2015 agreement limited Iran's uranium enrichment activity to make it harder for Tehran to develop nuclear arms, in return for lifting international sanctions."

""In response to today’s news, the Ascot-led ‘AsOne’ facility is quoting again, effective immediately, and we have already issued quotes this morning,"" Chris McGill told Reuters by email. Ascot said on Monday it was suspending the cover after Moscow suspended its participation in the U.N.-brokered grains export deal on Saturday. Other insurers also provide cover through the Ascot facility, which also includes broker Marsh. Ships entering the three Ukrainian ports that have been part of the UN-backed agreement, are usually required by their banks to have various insurance policies in place including hull and cargo war cover, which is renewed every seven days. Two insurance industry sources said other underwriters had also resumed offering cargo cover for grains shipments, which had been temporarily paused this week. Hull cover had been quoted although it was unclear if any insurance was taken due to the uncertainty. ""Now that the inspection process is restored we will see more (underwriters) coming back,"" one source said. Moscow announced the sudden reversal after Turkey and the United Nations helped keep Ukrainian grain flowing for several days without Russian participation in inspections."
2022-11-02,https://www.reuters.com/article/veon-divestment-russia/telecom-operator-veon-seeks-to-sell-russian-business-idUSKBN2RS0G2,Telecom operator VEON seeks to sell Russian business," Dutch telecoms operator Veon Ltd (VON.AS) said on Wednesday it was seeking to sell its Russian operations, which make up more than half of its revenue and earnings. Many companies have sought to reduce exposure to Russia since the start of the Ukraine conflict in February and have halted or terminated operations there. Veon, which also has operations in Ukraine, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, said it was conducting a ""competitive sales process"" for the business, which operates one of Russia's biggest mobile networks under the Beeline brand. ""There can be no assurance that the sales process mentioned above will result in an acceptable offer or, even if an acceptable offer is obtained and results in an acquisition agreement being reached, that the requisite approvals will be received,"" the company said in a statement. Veon's shares rose as much as 11% in thin trade in Amsterdam, to 0.50 euros. Veon's shares have traded near record lows since tumbling after Russia sent its armed forces into Ukraine in February, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"". Credit rating agencies S&P and Fitch have withdrawn ratings for Veon, which had $8.1 billion in net debt and $3.2 billion in cash liquidity as of Oct. 7, based on recent company statements. The outcome of the sale will be important for shareholders and creditors as Veon's non-Russian businesses are profitable on an operating basis but small in relation to the company's debt. Veon's position is complicated due to its presence in Ukraine, where it has struggled to keep the Kyivstar mobile network operating throughout the conflict. CEO Kaan Terzioglu told Reuters in March he hoped the company would be allowed to continue operating in both markets as an essential service. The company said on Wednesday it hoped to broker the best possible outcome for the company, shareholders, creditors, customers and employees ""both inside and outside Russia"". ""There has been no request from any government for VEON to sell its Russian operations,"" a spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday. More than half of Veon's 44,500 employees are in Russia, based on the company's 2021 annual report. Beeline had earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 20 billion roubles ($325 million) through the first eight months of 2022. It competes with larger rival MTS, as well as Megafon and Tele2. Veon's group total EBITDA in the same period was $604 million."
2022-11-02,https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-europe-industrials/energy-crisis-chips-away-at-europes-industrial-might-idUSKBN2RS0B2,Energy crisis chips away at Europe's industrial might," Europe needs its industrial companies to save energy amid soaring costs and shrinking supplies, and they are delivering - demand for natural gas and electricity both fell in the past quarter. It is far too early to rejoice, though. The drop is not just because industrial companies are turning down thermostats, they are also shutting down plants that may never reopen. And while lower energy use helps Europe weather the crisis sparked by Russia's war in Ukraine and Moscow's supply cuts, executives, economists and industry groups warn its industrial base may end up severely weakened if high energy costs persist. Energy-intensive industries, such as aluminium, fertilisers, and chemicals are at risk of companies permanently shifting production to locations where cheap energy abounds, such as the United States. Even as an unusually warm October and projections of a mild winter helped drive prices lower, natural gas in the United States still costs about a fifth what companies pay in Europe. ""A lot of companies are just quitting production,"" Patrick Lammers, management board member at utility E.ON (EONGn.DE) told a conference in London last month. ""They actually demand destruct."" Euro-zone manufacturing activity this month hit its weakest level since May 2020, signaling Europe was heading for a recession. The International Energy Agency estimates European industrial gas demand fell by 25% in the third quarter from a year earlier. Analysts say widespread shutdowns had to be behind the drop because efficiency gains alone would not produce such savings. ""We are doing all we can to prevent a reduction in industrial activity,"" an European Commission spokesperson said in an email. But a survey released on Wednesday showed companies in Europe's industrial powerhouse Germany were already scaling back because of energy costs. More than one business in four in the chemicals sector and 16% in the auto sector said they were being forced to cut production, a survey of 24,000 businesses by the German chambers of commerce and industry (DIHK) showed. Moreover 17% of auto sector companies said they were planning to move some production abroad. ""The effects are clearly visible: energy-intensive producers of intermediate goods in particular are cutting back on production,"" said DIHK Managing Director Martin Wansleben, referring to critical semi-finished products, such as chemicals and metals. European industry has been shifting production to locations with cheaper labour and lower other costs for decades, but the energy crisis is accelerating the exodus, analysts said. ""If the energy prices stay so elevated that part of European industry becomes structurally uncompetitive, factories will shut down and move to the U.S. where there is an abundance of cheap shale energy,"" said Daniel Kral, senior economist at Oxford Economics. For example, EU primary aluminium output was halved, cut by 1 million tonnes, over the past year. Trade figures compiled by Reuters show all nine zinc smelters in the bloc have either cut or stopped production, which was replaced by imports from China, Kazakhstan, Turkey, and Russia. Reopening an aluminium smelter costs up to 400 million euros ($394 million) and is unlikely given Europe's uncertain economic outlook, Chris Heron at industry association Eurometaux said. ""Historically, when these temporary closures happen, permanent closures come as a consequence,"" he added. Western efforts to secure supplies not just for energy but also for key minerals used in electric vehicles and renewable infrastructure are also at risk from high energy prices. Brussels is expected to propose new legislation early next year - the European Critical Raw Materials Act - to build up reserves of minerals indispensable in the transition to green economy, such as lithium, bauxite, nickel, and rare earths. But without more renewable power and lower costs, companies are unlikely to invest in Europe, Emanuele Manigrassi, climate and energy senior manager at European Aluminium, warned. Examples of industrial erosion are piling up. Europe became a net importer of chemicals for the first time ever this year, according to Cefic, the European Chemical Industry Council. More than half of European ammonia production, a key ingredient in fertilisers, has shut, and has been replaced by imports, according to the International Fertilizer Association. Norwegian fertiliser maker Yara (YAR.OL) has cut two-thirds of its European ammonia production and has no immediate plans to ramp it back up. ""We are watching the situation in the gas market closely and are making contingency plans,"" CEO Svein Tore Holsether told Reuters via email. Last week, the world's largest chemical group BASF (BASFn.DE) questioned whether there was a business case for new plants in Europe. The company has also warned it would have to shut production at its main Ludwigshafen site - Germany's single-biggest industrial power consumer - if gas supplies fall below half of its needs. Some firms, including German viscose fibre maker Kelheim Fibres which supplies Procter & Gamble (PG.N), are looking to other energy sources. This year, the German company has cut output twice at its factory in Bavaria. ""From Jan. 1, we will be able to switch to oil,"" company executive Wolfgang Ott said, as the company seeks government help to cushion energy costs. It is even pondering a 2 megawatt solar project. In Greece, Selected Textiles, a small cotton yarn producer, has cut output as orders mainly from northern Europe have fallen. At its plant in Farsala, central Greece, CEO Apostolos Dontas estimated production would fall 30% this year. ""We see our clients (...) are seriously concerned whether there will be an equivalent consumption of finished products in Europe and whether northern European manufacturers themselves will have access to natural gas,"" he told Reuters. Tata Chemicals (TTCH.NS), which usually operates on a five-year plan, is now working on a quarterly basis, its Europe managing director Martin Ashcroft said. ""If this is a structural change and gas prices stay high for three or four years, the real risk is industry investment will be directed elsewhere to places with lower energy prices,"" Ashcroft added.

A freight train carrying the ""Orlov Trotter"" horses left Russia's far east through the Khasan-Tumangan crossing, according to Russia's veterinary service. It posted a picture of several horses in a train wagon. ""The animals, 5 stallions, 25 mares, were quarantined in the city of Suzdal, Vladimir region, and then arrived at the Khasan railway checkpoint in three specially equipped trucks for subsequent shipment to the DPRK,"" Russia's state veterinary service said in a statement. The ""Orlov Trotter"" is Russia's most famous horse and is known, according to the veterinary service, for its ""frolicky trot"". Russia's RIA state news agency said it was the first train to North Korea since COVID restrictions were imposed in 2020. It said medicines would follow in later cargos. It was not immediately clear why 30 Orlov Trotter thoroughbreds were needed in North Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a keen horseman. He was shown in 2019 by North Korean media trekking through mountain snows astride a white stallion. Russian customs data shows North Korea has spent thousands of dollars on thoroughbred horses from Russia in previous years."

The rouble has now lost the support of month-end tax payments, that usually see exporters convert foreign currency revenues to pay local liabilities. ""Today in the course of trading we expect attempts by the rouble to recover its morning losses,"" said Banki.ru chief analyst Bogdan Zvarich. ""Despite a lower supply of foreign currency from exporters, the rise in oil prices may facilitate purchases in the national currency, which will allow the rouble to make a recovery over the course of the session and try to continue strengthening.""

Last year, delegations representing President Nicolas Maduro and the opposition led by Juan Guaido made no progress on resolving the nation's deep political crisis, which has stoked a sometimes-chaotic migration wave of over 7 million people. ""We are working on resuming the dialogue process in November,"" said one of the people familiar with the arrangements. Maduro and Colombia President Gustavo Petro said in a joint statement on Tuesday they hoped for ""a successful return"" to the dialogues. The renewed talks, again facilitated by the Norwegian government, would cover the election, status of hundreds of political prisoners, U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and a ""social agreement"" that would enable distribution of $3 billion in goods and investment for humanitarian aid from a U.N.-administered fund. Resumption of the dialogue has repeatedly been delayed by disagreements on terms, especially elections, a topic that may again force last-minute changes, including possibly postponing discussion to a second meeting, one of the sources said. Venezuela's information ministry, opposition's envoy Gerardo Blyde, the Norwegian government and Mexico's foreign affairs ministry did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Several parties warned Washington in October they are unwilling to support U.S.-backed Guaido's interim government in 2023. This makes resumption of talks crucial for the opposition coalition, which has been diminished by exile, imprisonment of leaders, internal fractures and lack of funds. The talks were abandoned by Maduro's envoys a year ago after disagreements over the extradition of an ally of the Venezuelan president who faces money laundering charges. Maduro had said his government would not return to talks unless all U.S. sanctions were lifted, while the opposition has insisted on guarantees for a fair and transparent presidential vote, supervised by foreign observers, in late 2023 or 2024. The U.S. government has tried to encourage dialogue, easing some sanctions and freeing two relatives of the Venezuelan fist lady, who were jailed on drug trafficking charges. Maduro also released six former executives of U.S.-based refiner Citgo Petroleum. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, trying to increase global oil supplies to bring down prices that have surged since Russia invaded Ukraine, has said the dialogue progress could trigger sanctions relief, including a license for U.S. oil company Chevron (CVX.N) to expand operations in Venezuela. A growing influx of Venezuelan migrants to the United States is also prompting Washington to look for solutions to the South American country's crisis."

On Wednesday, Klitschko wrote on messaging app Telegram that city authorities were considering different scenarios due to missile attacks. ""The worst one is where there will be no electric power, water or district heating at all,"" he said. ""For that case, we are preparing over 1,000 heating points in our city.""

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) was not immediately available to comment. Since Russia invaded Ukraine over eight months ago, Moscow has repeatedly accused what it calls Ukrainian ""saboteurs"" of targeting its energy infrastructure, including in August when it blamed Ukraine for damaging an electricity substation in Russian-annexed Crimea.

Construction of the temporary 2.5-metre (8ft) high and 3-metre deep barrier will start immediately, Mariusz Blaszczak told a news conference. With tensions rising due to the war in Ukraine, he cited security concerns and referred to a crisis triggered last autumn when thousands of African and Middle Eastern migrants tried to cross the Belarus border into Poland, some of whom died. However, a spokesperson for Poland's Border Guard said no illegal entries from Kaliningrad into Poland took place in October. ""The Polish-Russian border is stable and calm. There has been no illegal crossing of the border,"" Anna Michalska said. ""We are not only there in times of peace. We are prepared for various crisis situations and after what happened on the Polish-Belarusian border we are even more prepared for everything, for all of the darkest scenarios,"" she added. The European Union at the time accused Belarus - a close ally of Russia - of flying the migrants in as part of a ""hybrid"" warfare campaign to destabilise Europe. Minsk denied wrongdoing. Blaszczak said the Kaliningrad barrier would be similar to the one that Poland set up along the border with Belarus last year. Online business magazine Russia Briefing reported last month that Kaliningrad is seeking to attract airlines from the Gulf and Asia under a new open skies policy. The enclave, where Russia has a significant military presence, lies on the Baltic coast between Poland and Lithuania and is separated from Belarus by a border corridor."

Some sponsors are U.S.-based relatives of Venezuelans eager to flee political and economic turmoil back home. But others, like South Florida business consultant Maria Antonietta Diaz, are willing to help strangers. Diaz, a Venezuelan-American advocate who has lived in the United States for the past 25 years, got in touch with Venezuelans seeking sponsors via social media. Since the humanitarian program officially launched on Oct. 18, Diaz has already been approved to sponsor nine Venezuelans - six in her hometown of Maracaibo, Venezuela, and another three in Mexico en route to the United States. The program does not have explicit income requirements but Diaz and her husband earn $150,000 annually, far above the roughly $23,000 that would typically be required to sponsor someone for a U.S. green card. Around 7,000 Venezuelans have been approved for the new program since the Oct. 18 launch, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The source did not say how many had applied. ""It is clear that this orderly and limited way to live and work in the United States is providing incentives to Venezuelans to not put their lives in the hands of smugglers,"" the person said, requesting anonymity to share internal figures. Diaz's request to sponsor a Venezuelan man in Cuernavaca was approved in just an hour, she said. She submitted another for two women in Mexico City at midnight and woke at 7 a.m. to see it was approved. Other organizations tracking the program also said applications have been approved quickly. ""It's incredible,"" Diaz said, calling it ""huge progress"" compared with the normal pace of U.S. immigration processing, which can take years in some cases. U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, launched a two-pronged approach to deter illegal border crossings last month. Venezuelans caught crossing illegally are now expelled back to Mexico under a pandemic-era order known as Title 42, while up to 24,000 Venezuelans will be allowed to enter legally through the program if they apply while they are abroad. Biden, a Democrat, has struggled with record numbers of migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border during his presidency - including 187,000 Venezuelans just in fiscal year 2022 - and Republicans have ramped up criticism as they aim to take control of the U.S. Congress in Nov. 8 midterm elections. On Monday, Reuters video showed Border Patrol shot projectiles at Venezuelan and Central American migrants who crossed the Rio Grande during a protest that started on the Mexican side of the border. For 23-year-old Victoriana Loaiza, who was expelled from the United States to Mexico after trekking for more than a month through South and Central America to get to the border, Diaz was a lifeline. Loaiza managed a luxury accessory store in Maracaibo, but she said her $180 monthly income was not enough to support her 5-year-old son, as the price of a monthly basket of goods for a family has risen to around $375, according to the Venezuelan Finance Observatory. After being sent back to Mexico, she quickly found Diaz through a friend, contacted her on Oct. 18, applied for the program and was approved by Oct. 27. She flew to Orlando on Monday, where she met her boyfriend, who arrived last year but could not act as her sponsor as he himself is applying for U.S. asylum and lacks legal status. She hopes to bring over her son once she is settled. Venezuelans approved through the program - which is modeled on a similar effort launched earlier this year for Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion - receive permission to reside in the United States for up to two years and can apply for a work permits. U.S. sponsors do not need to be related to Venezuelans to support their applications, but they must have permission to reside in the United States. Both sponsors and Venezuelan applicants have to pass background checks. A week after the new program was announced and the Mexico return policy was enacted, U.S. authorities saw an 80% decrease in Venezuelan border encounters. Loaiza said the program provides a safer alternative to Venezuelans than venturing through the Darien Gap, a jungle separating Colombia and Panama that she traveled through on foot. ""It prevents a lot of people from risking their lives,"" she said."

In his first media briefing since taking office, Volker Turk said rights had become a ""battlefield"" that threatened to paralyse progress and prevent people from airing legitimate grievances. Turk, whose predecessor Michelle Bachelet drew criticism in some quarters for appearing soft on some governments when they were backsliding on human rights, also promised to speak out ""when we feel our voice can make a difference"". He takes charge of the U.N. human rights office at a time of turbulence in Europe over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as well as some of the most widespread unrest in Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution. The protests ignited by the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini on Sept. 16 after her arrest for inappropriate attire have shaken Iran's clerical establishment with people from all walks of life demanding wholesale political change. Iranian leaders have blamed the crisis on incitement by arch-enemy the United States and other Western powers, a narrative few Iranians believe, and a riot police crackdown on protesters has turned increasingly deadly. Turk pointed to what he called a pushback on human rights, especially with respect to gender issues, and highlighted to a ""strongman mentality"" and autocratic tendencies in a number of countries. ""The repression and the silencing of dissent is obviously, very particularly worrying,"" he said. ""And it has also the impact in particular on women and the rise in misogyny and misogynist attitudes which I really hope we can overcome. I mean we shouldn't even have to deal with that in the 21st century."" He said the world needed unity and multilateralism to deal with challenges but instead was retreating into ""groupthink"". ""And unfortunately, human rights is thrown into the vortex of these dynamics and has become a battlefield which we cannot afford and human beings cannot afford,"" he said.

2022-11-02,https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-cpi/russian-weekly-consumer-prices-edged-up-in-week-of-central-bank-rate-hold-idUSKBN2RS1IO,Russian weekly consumer prices edged up in week of central bank rate hold," Weekly consumer prices in Russia rose marginally for the sixth week running, data published on Wednesday showed, vindicating the central bank's decision to end its rate-cutting cycle last week and hold its key rate at 7.5%. The central bank cautioned that expectations of price rises had grown and that Russia's partial mobilisation could stoke longer-term inflation due to a shrinking labour force. The central bank had cut its key rate six times in a row after an emergency hike to 20% in February when Russia's decision to send troops into Ukraine caused inflation to spike. Russia's consumer price index rose 0.07% in the week to Oct. 31, the Rosstat federal statistics service said. In a separate set of data, the economy ministry said inflation was running at 12.69% on an annual basis, down from 12.88% a week earlier. The central bank targets inflation at 4%. Falling living standards have lowered consumer demand, hitting retail sales and leading to an extended period of deflation over the summer. President Vladimir Putin's military mobilisation drive threatens to undermine productivity, demand and economic recovery, analysts have said. High inflation has for years been a concern for Russian households as it dents their spending power and eats into living standards. Poverty rates are relatively high in Russia and surveys show more than half of all households have no savings. Since the start of the year, consumer prices have risen 10.71%, Rosstat said. At the same point in 2021, year-to-date inflation was running at 6.49%."

Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in a written statement to Reuters that Moscow's decision showed that Russian ""blackmail"" and ""escalation and threats"" fail when they meet a resolute response. ""One way or another, Russia, embarrassed, returned to the 'grain initiative' because it suddenly turned out that the grain corridor would work even without the Kremlin's participation,"" Podolyak said. ""This says only one thing: Russia is always inferior to those who are stronger, those who know how to take a blow, those who argue their position strongly."" Podolyak suggested the Kremlin had miscalculated when it suspended its participation in the deal on Saturday, saying it could not guarantee safety for civilian ships crossing the Black Sea because of an attack on its fleet there, part of which it said had originated from within the grains export corridor. Ukraine has said that was a false pretext. ""When you want to play blackmail, it is important not to outplay yourself,"" Podolyak said. ""Russia is used to constantly playing on escalation and threats. But if there is a firm position on the part of the other parties, the mediators, the guarantors, then it quickly becomes clear the threats are just formidable international PR."" Another senior Ukrainian official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters that Moscow's decision was mainly a result of Turkish pressure on Russia. In a tweet, Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov also expressed gratitude for the roles played by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres."

Kirby told a virtual briefing that North Korea was attempting to obscure the shipments by funneling them through countries in the Middle East and North Africa. ""Our indications are that the DPRK is covertly supplying and we are going to monitor to see whether the shipments are received,"" Kirby said, adding that Washington would consult with the United Nations on accountability issues over the shipments. ""We do have a sense on where they are going to transfer these shells,"" Kirby said, but declined to give any more details as the U.S. weighs its possible options. Kirby said the amount of shells was not insignificant, but was unlikely to change the momentum or outcome of the war. However, they could still be deadly for Ukrainians, he said. ""And it's certainly not going to change our calculus ... or with so many of our allies and partners about the kinds of capabilities we're going to continue to provide the Ukrainians,"" he said. Kirby said the North Korean shipments were a sign not only of Pyongyang's willingness to support Russia but of Moscow's munitions shortages brought on by U.S.-led sanctions and export controls. North Korea said in September it had never supplied weapons or ammunition to Russia and has no plans to do so, while warning the United States to ""keep its mouth shut"" and stop circulating rumors aimed at ""tarnishing"" the country's image. Referring to North Korea missile launches on Wednesday, Kirby said they did not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel in the region, and added that the United States would make sure it had the capabilities there to defend its allies. North Korea fired at least 23 missiles into the sea on Wednesday, including one that landed less than 60 km (40 miles) off South Korea's coast, which the South's President Yoon Suk-yeol described as ""territorial encroachment."" It was the first time a ballistic missile had landed near the South's waters since the peninsula was divided in 1945, and the most missiles fired by the North in a single day. South Korea issued rare air raid warnings and launched its own missiles in response."

It was the first time a ballistic missile had landed near the South's waters since the peninsula was divided in 1945, and the most missiles fired by the North in a single day. South Korea issued rare air raid warnings and launched its own missiles in response. The launches came just hours after Pyongyang demanded that the United States and South Korea stop large-scale military exercises, saying such ""military rashness and provocation can be no longer tolerated"". In Washington, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby called the North Korean launches ""reckless"" and said the United States would make sure it had the military capabilities in place to defend its treaty allies South Korea and Japan. The missile landed outside South Korea's territorial waters, but south of the Northern Limit Line (NLL), a disputed inter-Korean maritime border. South Korean warplanes fired three air-to-ground missiles into the sea north across the NLL in response, the South's military said. An official said the weapons used included an AGM-84H/K SLAM-ER, which is a U.S.-made ""stand-off"" precision attack weapon that can fly for up to 270 km (170 miles) with a 360-kg (800-lb) warhead. The South's launches came after Yoon's office vowed a ""swift and firm response"". ""President Yoon Suk-yeol noted North Korea's provocation today was an effective act of territorial encroachment by a missile intruding the NLL for the first time since (the two Koreas') division,"" his office said. When asked whether the missile was flying towards the South's territory and should have been intercepted, a senior presidential official said, ""Strictly speaking, it did not land in our territory but in the Exclusive Economic Zone under our jurisdiction, therefore it was not subject to interception"". North Korea has continuously been launching missiles over the past year in violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. ""It's unprecedented in the sense that there were so many,"" she said of Wednesday's launches. Kirby told his news briefing that the United States has information that indicates North Korea is covertly supplying Russia with a ""significant"" number of artillery shells for its war in Ukraine and that Washington would consult with the United Nations on accountability issues over the shipments. Kirby said North Korea was attempting to obscure the shipments by funnelling them through countries in the Middle East and North Africa. North Korea said in September it had never supplied weapons or ammunition to Russia and has no plans to do so. The missile that crossed the NLL was one of three short-range ballistic missiles fired from the North Korean coastal area of Wonsan into the sea, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said. The JCS later said as many as 14 other missiles of various types had been fired from North Korea's east and west coasts. The JCS said at least one landed 26 km south of the NLL, 57 km from the South Korean city of Sokcho, on the east coast, and 167 km from the island of Ulleung, where air raid warnings were sounded. ""We heard the siren at around 8:55 a.m. and all of us in the building went down to the evacuation place in the basement,"" an Ulleung county official told Reuters. ""We stayed there until we came upstairs at around 9:15 after hearing that the projectile fell into the high seas."" The North also fired more than 100 rounds of artillery from its east coast into a military buffer zone, South Korea's military said. The firing violated a 2018 military agreement banning hostile acts in border areas, the JCS said. North and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Nuclear-armed North Korea has tested a record number of missiles this year, and officials in Seoul and Washington say the North has completed technical preparations to conduct a nuclear weapon test for the first time since 2017. Despite Yoon's declaring a national week of mourning after more than 150 people were killed in a weekend crowd surge in Seoul, the United States and South Korea began one of their largest combined military air drills on Monday. Dubbed Vigilant Storm, the exercises involve hundreds of warplanes from both sides staging mock attacks 24 hours a day. North Korea, which for years has pursued missile and nuclear programmes in defiance of U.N. sanctions, had said that a recent flurry of launches were in response to allied drills. Pak Jong Chon, secretary of the Central Committee of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, said in a statement on Wednesday that the number of warplanes involved in Vigilant Storm proved the exercise was ""aggressive and provocative"" and specifically targeted North Korea. He said even its name imitated the U.S.-led Operation Desert Storm against Iraq in the 1990s. U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that the drills were purely defensive and harboured no hostile intent. Price added that Washington and its allies had also made clear that there would be ""profound costs and profound consequences"" if North Korea resumed nuclear testing. He did not elaborate. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a regular briefing in Beijing that safeguarding peace and stability on the peninsula was in everyone's interest. ""We hope that all parties concerned will stick to the direction of political settlement of the Peninsula issue, meet each other halfway, and prevent the situation from escalating,"" he said. South Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said that because of the launches, some air routes over the sea between North Korea and Japan would be closed until Thursday."

""Good that Finland can count on Hungary in our NATO ratification. I look forward to further strengthening our Fenno-Ugric connection also as allies,"" Niinisto said on Twitter, referring to the countries' shared liguistic history. The Hungarian government did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Finland and Sweden asked to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in May in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but ran into objections from Turkey. Hungary and Turkey are the only members not to have ratified the applications. Later on Wednesday, Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom was similarly optimistic Hungary would ratify Sweden's application after he spoke with his Hungarian counterpart Peter Szijjarto a few days ago. ""We have also had quite positive remarks made during that conversation,"" Billstrom told a news conference in Helsinki in connection with a Nordic Council meeting in the Finnish capital. ""We see a positive and progressive movement forward when it comes to the ratification by Hungary towards the Swedish and the Finnish applications,"" he said. Last month, Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas said he expected the Hungarian parliament to discuss the approval of the ratification document before its autumn session ends. ""As the autumn session ends by mid-December, there is a good chance this will happen by then,"" he told a press briefing at the time."
2022-11-02,https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-russia-budget/ukraine-conflict-sanctions-set-to-blow-hole-in-russias-finances-idUSKBN2RS19P,"Ukraine conflict, sanctions set to blow hole in Russia's finances"," The cost of Russia's military mobilisation and the impact of Western sanctions are set to blow a hole in the government's budget forecasts and drain Moscow's reserves to their lowest level in years, according to analysts' latest calculations. That will put an ever greater strain on the Kremlin's resources as President Vladimir Putin seeks to fund a conflict with no end in sight and prepares for a possible re-election bid in 2024. After eight months of what it calls a ""special military operation"", Moscow has drawn up a 2023 budget that takes no account of the cost of the recent call-up of 300,000 reservists, the declared annexation of four Ukrainian regions - the Kremlin says the four joined Russia freely - and Western efforts to cap Russian energy export prices, analysts say. While Russia's economy initially held up relatively well to the waves of Western sanctions imposed on it, the impact is beginning to show - in analysts' assessments, if not in those of the government. ""The macroeconomic forecast, upon which the budget is based, was calculated before mobilisation,"" said Alexandra Suslina, an independent analyst. ""It does not take into account new sanctions, and therefore is not reflecting reality."" Putin's current, fourth term as a president expires in 2024 and he is yet to say if he will run again - a process that, judging by past campaigns, would likely involve courting voters with promises to spend more on wages, welfare and pensions. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that Putin had not yet decided whether to run in 2024 but added: ""The social obligations of the state are an absolute priority."" Russian official forecasts estimate that GDP will fall 0.8% next year, while a Reuters poll of analysts sees the economy shrinking 2.5%. The World Bank expects a 3.6% contraction. Russia's finance ministry expects the budget deficit next year to almost double from this year to 3 trillion roubles, or 2% of gross domestic product. Analysts at state bank VTB (VTBR.MM) forecast the gap at an even wider 4-4.5 trillion roubles. Moscow sees energy revenues at 9 trillion roubles next year, or a third of its total income - a projection analysts say is also too optimistic amid upcoming sanctions on Russian energy imports by the west. ""The finance ministry forecasts incredible things such as that energy income ... would remain as before, like Russia would continue to produce the same amount of oil with demand unchanged,"" an economist at a western financial company said. As Europe cuts ties with Russia, Moscow risks losing a staggering 55% of its oil product exports, or over 80 million tonnes, next year, the government has estimated. Gazprom's gas exports already plunged 43% in January-October compared with the same period last year. The finance ministry sees non-energy revenue, or that related to economic activity, at 11.5% of GDP in 2023, around 7% higher than this year and on par with pre-pandemic levels. But analysts say that this, too, is hardly realistic. ""Consumer demand will be falling, people will be buying less, cheaper, lower in quality - and then the non-energy income forecast... will have to be revised,"" said Suslina. While Russia this week officially ended what it calls its ""partial"" mobilisation, some 300,000 reservists called up by the Kremlin for its campaign in Ukraine since September remain in military units, which also hurts economic activity. Lower economic activity and weak imports may see Moscow collecting around 1 trillion roubles less per year from value-added tax, its main non-energy income, according to a joint study by the Russian Presidential Academy Ranepa and the Gaidar Institute. Dmitry Polevoy, investment director at Moscow-based broker Locko Invest, estimates that payouts to those mobilised - including higher-than-average salaries and compensation in the event of injury or death - may come to between 900 billion roubles and 3 trillion roubles in the next half-year alone. The finance ministry did not reply to a Reuters request for a comment. Finance minister Anton Siluanov, without giving details, told Russian lawmakers last week that the budget ""allows (us) to meet all social obligations without harming macroeconomic stability."" Russia has few options for plugging the budget deficit, analysts say, as sanctions and counter-sanctions have hit foreign investors' ability to invest in domestic rouble bonds, and the finance ministry is already depleting the resources of the National Wealth Fund (NWF). As Russia has actively started spending NWF money on everything from economic support to social payments, the finance ministry sees the fund halving to 6.25 trillion roubles, or 4.2% of GDP - its lowest since 2018 - by the end of next year. ""The main budget risk amid significant sanctions pressure... is of a complete dry-out of the NWF, which could significantly undermine the federal budget's stability and the budget system as a whole,"" analysts at the Financial University said in a recent note. If it falls to 5.95 trillion roubles, or 3.7% of GDP, by the end of 2024, the amount of cash left would be the smallest Russia has had in its reserves in the last two decades, according to the budget comments by the state Audit Chamber. ""Sources to finance the budget deficit are now scarcer than ever,"" Suslina said. ""I very much hope that the finance ministry will avoid outright money printing."""
2022-11-02,https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-putin/dont-expect-putin-to-fall-anytime-soon-says-western-official-idUSKBN2RS1AV,"Don't expect Putin to fall anytime soon, says Western official"," President Vladimir Putin has been weakened by his decision to invade Ukraine, but a change in power at the top in Russia is unlikely any time soon due to the autocratic nature of its political system, a Western official said on Wednesday. Putin, the longest-serving paramount Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin, has dominated Russia for nearly 23 years since Boris Yeltsin gave him the nuclear briefcase on the last day of 1999. After changes to the constitution in 2020, some Russia-watchers expected Putin to rule until 2036. But the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has changed perceptions. ""He has been weakened by this really catastrophic error,"" said the Western official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to speak freely. ""We are seeing the Russian military humbled on the battlefield by Ukraine."" The official said the war had strengthened Ukrainian statehood and prompted the further enlargement of the NATO military alliance thus weakening Putin, who turned 70 on Oct. 7. ""People can see that he has made a big error,"" said the same official. ""They (the Russians) didn't have a Plan B - they thought that this was going to be really easy."" ""That has to mean that people are talking more about succession, they are talking more about what comes next, they are imagining a life beyond. But what I am not doing is suggesting that that's any time soon."" Though there was unlikely to be a change of Kremlin leader soon, the official said that the middle of the 2020s was starting to look ""more interesting"". Russia's next scheduled presidential election is in 2024. Putin has not yet said whether he will run again or not. The Kremlin, which declined immediate comment on the Western official's comments, says Putin is by far the most popular politician in Russia and has won four presidential elections. Putin has said he has no regrets on launching what he calls Russia's ""special operation"" against Ukraine and casts the war as a watershed moment when Russia finally stood up to an arrogant Western hegemony after decades of humiliation in the years since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. After the West imposed the most severe sanctions in modern history on Moscow due to the war, Putin says Russia is turning towards Asia, and in particular China, after centuries of looking to the West as the crucible of economic growth and technology. The war in Ukraine has killed tens of thousands and triggered the biggest confrontation with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when the Cold War superpowers came closest to nuclear war. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces are digging in for winter as temperatures start to fall, and the war is likely to continue to be ""a long, difficult and bloody conflict"", the official said. After Putin's Sept. 21 partial mobilisation order, at least 400,000 Russians have left the country in addition to the outflow of Russians who left shortly after the invasion was ordered, the official said. Russia's economy, they said, would contract by at least 4.5% in 2022 and would also contract next year, the official said. ""The GDP figures mask a really significant distortion in the economy because of the switch towards war production,"" they said. The official added that there was no sign, for now, that Russia was ready to seriously negotiate over Ukraine. ""This is going to continue to be a long, difficult, bloody conflict."""

Speaking in parliament, Erdogan said Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had informed his Turkish counterpart that the deal will resume. “After the call we held yesterday with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, Russian Defence Minister Mr. Shoigu called our National Defence Minister Hulusi Akar and expressed that the grain transports will continue as agreed before as of 1200 (pm) today,” Erdogan said. Citing the Russian defence ministry, state news agency TASS reported shortly after Erdogan’s comments that Russia will resume its participation in the Black Sea grain deal. The export deal was agreed upon by Russia and Ukraine and brokered by Turkey and the United Nations in July to ease a world hunger crisis caused in part by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, a major grain producer, and an earlier blockade of its ports. It is due to expire on Nov. 19. Russia suspended its participation on Saturday, saying it was responding to a drone attack on Moscow’s fleet in Crimea that it blamed on Ukraine. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility and denies using the grain programme’s security corridor for military purposes."

If Russia did so, however, Putin said it would not impede shipments of grain from Ukraine to Turkey. Moscow had on Saturday pulled out of the arrangement, brokered by Turkey and the United Nations, saying it could not guarantee the safety of civilian ships crossing the Black Sea because of a drone attack on its fleet there. Wednesday's U-turn followed a phone call between Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday and consultations between their defence ministers. In a statement, Russia's defence ministry said that, with the help of the United Nations and NATO-member Turkey, it had obtained sufficient written guarantees from Ukraine that it would not use the secure shipping corridor or its designated Ukrainian ports for strikes against Russia. Putin affirmed the receipt of those commitments, and said that if Russia withdrew once more because of Ukrainian breaches, it would substitute the entire volume of grain destined for the ""poorest countries"" for free from its own stocks. But, in a nod to Turkey's influence, as well as what he called its ""neutrality"" in Russia's conflict with Ukraine, he added: ""In any case, we will not in the future impede deliveries of grain from Ukrainian territory to the Turkish Republic."" Moscow had said on Monday it would be risky and unacceptable for ships to continue sailing through the secure corridor set up under the deal, which had freed up Ukrainian ports and shipping lanes that Russia had previously blockaded. Despite the Russian move, ships had continued to export Ukrainian grain, and a record volume moved on Monday. ""This is quite an unexpected turnaround,"" said Andrey Sizov, head of the Russia-focused Sovecon agriculture consultancy. ""We did not bury this deal, but we did not expect Russia's return to it so soon either, as it was not very clear what kind of guarantees Russia could get and how quickly it would happen. But, well, good job Erdogan."" Even after the call with the Turkish leader, the Kremlin had said Moscow would only consider resuming the agreement after a ""detailed investigation"" of a drone attack on Saturday against its Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, which it accused Ukraine of carrying out with support from Britain. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the attack and denies using the humanitarian corridor for military purposes. Britain has denied involvement and accused Russia of trying to divert attention from its military failures in Ukraine. Russian political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said Wednesday's announcement represented an acknowledgement by Putin that he could not block the shipments. ""The Kremlin itself simply fell into a trap from which it did not know how to get out,"" she said. ""It was necessary to retreat and put on a good face (not very successfully) when faced with a bad game. That is, Putin, no matter how preoccupied he is with Ukraine, his historical mission and his faith that he's right, remains a moderately rational politician who knows how to retreat if necessary."""

The Authorisation of Residence for Investment Activity for people from non-EU countries, commonly known as the golden visa programme, has been heavily criticised at home for sending house prices and rents up, and the European Commission has called for the end of such national schemes. In Portugal, it has attracted 6.5 billion euros in investment by foreigners, mainly from China, Brazil and South Africa, with the bulk of the money going into real estate. Rules have changed this year to redirect investments from a red-hot property market in big cities to depopulated areas. Speaking at Lisbon's Web Summit, Europe's largest tech event, Costa said several visa schemes offered by Portugal were currently being re-evaluated and the golden visa was one of them. ""(It) probably has already fulfilled the role it had to fulfil and, at this moment, is no longer justified to keep it"", Costa told reporters. An official decision would be announced when the evaluation is completed, he said. Costa said Portugal wanted to continue to be attractive, with one example being its recent law, enacted on Monday, that created the so-called digital nomads visa. It gives foreigners with high monthly income from remote work to live and work from Portugal for a year. The European Commission has called on EU governments to end national programmes to sell citizenship to investors, which the bloc has long considered a security risk. Britain scrapped golden visas for rich investors in February amid concerns about the inflow of illicit Russian money, just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine that brought on unprecedented Western sanctions against Moscow."

Western capitals have said Moscow is behind a ramping up of nuclear rhetoric since Russia invaded Ukraine in February - most recently by repeatedly accusing Kyiv of planning to use a radioactive ""dirty bomb"" without offering evidence. Kyiv has denied having any such plan. The Russian Foreign Ministry said it feared the five declared nuclear powers were teetering ""on the brink of a direct armed conflict"" and that the West must stop ""encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction, which can lead to catastrophic consequences"". ""We are strongly convinced that in the current complicated and turbulent situation, caused by irresponsible and impudent actions aimed at undermining our national security, the most immediate task is to avoid any military clash of nuclear powers,"" the ministry said in a statement. Moscow said it stood by a joint declaration issued together with the United States, China, Britain and France in January affirming their joint responsibility for avoiding a nuclear war. ""We fully reaffirm our commitment to the joint statement of the five nuclear-weapon states' leaders on the prevention of nuclear war and the avoidance of an arms race from Jan. 3, 2022,"" the ministry said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has appeared on several occasions to threaten a nuclear strike in connection with the war in Ukraine, and Moscow has repeatedly said its military doctrine permits the use of nuclear weapons if Russia's territorial integrity is under threat. In September, Putin said he was ""not bluffing"" when he stated that Russia was prepared to use ""all available means"" to defend its territory. He also said the United States had created a ""precedent"" at the end of the Second World War when it dropped two atomic bombs on Japan. Shortly afterwards, Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the Chechnya region and a key ally of Putin's, called for Russia to use a ""low-yield nuclear weapon"" in Ukraine. Moscow also frequently accuses Kyiv of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, and alleged at the start of the war that the Western NATO alliance planned to use Ukraine as a bridgehead to threaten Russia - allegations denied by Ukraine and NATO."

In analysis issued in response to the increase in number and severity of ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure in the United States since late 2020, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said it had received 1,489 ransomware-related filings worth nearly $1.2 billion in 2021, a 188% jump from the year before. Out of 793 ransomware incidents reported to FinCEN in the second half of 2021, 75% ""had a nexus to Russia, its proxies, or persons acting on its behalf,"" the report said. Washington is this week hosting a meeting with officials from 36 countries and the European Union, as well as 13 global companies to address the growing threat of ransomware and other cybercrime, including the illicit use of cryptocurrencies. ""We may approach the challenge of ransomware with a different lens - and in some cases, an entirely different set of tools - but we are all here because we know that ransomware remains a critical threat to victims across the globe and continues to be profitable for bad actors,"" Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told the officials. Ransom software works by encrypting victims' data, with hackers offering the victim a key in return for cryptocurrency payments that can run as high as millions of dollars. A U.S. Treasury official on Tuesday said the department last month repelled cyberattacks by a pro-Russian hacker group, preventing disruption, an example he said of the department's stronger approach to financial system cybersecurity."

In an Instagram post published on Tuesday, the 54-year-old founder of Tinkoff Bank wrote: ""I decided to renounce my Russian citizenship after Russia invasion of independent Ukraine. I am against this war, and the killing of peaceful people."" Tinkov, whose upstart digital credit card company, TCS Group Holding (TCSq.L), grew to become one of Russia's largest financial institutions, has been an outspoken critic of the invasion and President Vladimir Putin. He was forced to sell his 35% stake in TCS, Tinkoff Bank's parent, to Russian metals magnate Vladimir Potanin in April, following a string of anti-war comments. Tinkov said an original Instagram post published on Monday, with a picture of a certificate renouncing his citizenship as of Oct. 26, had ""mysteriously disappeared"". Tinkov also said on Tuesday he was suing to force the bank to stop using his name. ""My name should not be associated with fascism,"" Tinkov said. ""I hate when my brand/name is associated with the bank that collaborates with killers and blood."" The bank, for its part, said it had full legal rights to the use of the Tinkoff brand, the TASS news agency reported. The tycoon, who has likened himself to British billionaire Richard Branson and was worth almost $10 billion at his peak, launched electronics, frozen food and beer brands before setting up Tinkoff Bank in the mid-2000s. Before he sold his stake, Britain imposed sanctions on Tinkov, saying he was ""receiving benefits from the Russian government"" through his stake in a systemically important company. Tinkov is believed to live in London, where he underwent years of treatment for leukaemia. He says he now has no business interests in Russia. Tinkoff previously held U.S. citizenship, but renounced that around the time Tinkoff Bank went public in 2013 in what Washington said was an attempt to avoid tax liabilities. Tinkov reached a $500 million settlement with the Justice Department last year."

Rosneft's Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin said last week that BP is entitled to $700 million in second-half 2021 dividends, which Rosneft transferred into special ""C"" accounts in Russia, while BP remained Rosneft's ""shadow"" shareholder. Many Western companies, including oil majors, have left Russia since Moscow sent its armed forces into Ukraine on Feb. 24. Rosneft accounted for around half of BP's oil and gas reserves and a third of its production. ""We can only heartily advise our colleagues from BP to remove the issue of exiting assets in Russia from the agenda and return to their native bosom,"" Rosneft said. Rosneft also said its board will discuss payment of nine-month 2022 dividends later this month and BP may ""increase its earnings from the Russian business by another around $700 million"". BP was not immediately available for comment. It said last week that its position on Russia remained unchanged. Rosneft also said that nothing stops BP from using dividends on investments in developments of joint projects in Russia.

Russia's defence ministry said on Saturday that British navy personnel had blown up the Nord Stream pipelines in September, an assertion that London said was false and designed to distract from Russian military failures in Ukraine. ""There is evidence that Britain is involved in sabotage ... a terrorist act against vital energy infrastructure,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""Such actions cannot be put aside. Of course, we will think about further steps. It definitely cannot be left like this,"" Peskov said. The Kremlin has not provided evidence to support its claims Britain was behind the ruptures on the Nord Stream pipelines, which have threatened to put the multi-billion dollar gas link permanently out of use. The Kremlin also said no decision had been taken on whether to repair the Russian-controlled pipelines. Peskov said the Kremlin was awaiting for an expert assessment of the damage and that no decisions had yet been taken on the future of Nord Stream 1 or Nord Stream 2. Sweden last week ordered additional investigations to be carried out on the damage. Authorities in both Sweden and Denmark have concluded the gas leaks were caused by explosions, but have not said who might be responsible."

The rouble has now lost the support of month-end tax payments, that usually see exporters convert foreign currency revenues to pay local liabilities. The rouble may attempt to weaken past 62 against the dollar, Banki.ru chief analyst Bogdan Zvarich said. ""In the course of trading we expect pressure on the national currency to remain, which will be facilitated by the lower supply of foreign currency from exporters due to the passing of the peak of tax payments,"" Zvarich added. The rouble is the world's best-performing currency this year, supported by capital controls and a collapse in imports as a result of Western sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine, and scores of foreign companies pausing operations in the country. But imports have recovered around 90% since their April low, the Institute of International Finance said last week, and are close to levels seen before Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. That resurgence, along with rising inflationary risks, will put pressure on the rouble in the medium term, said analysts from First Asset Management.

In a post on Telegram, Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-backed head of the region, which is partially occupied by Russian forces, said he was extending an evacuation area in the region and - for the first time - asked civilians on the Dnipro river's eastern bank to leave their homes. The new area will cover an additional 15 kilometre (nine mile) zone around the Dnipro river, which splits the Kherson region, to include another seven settlements, Saldo said. ""Due to the possibility of the use of prohibited methods of war by the Ukrainian regime, as well as information that Kyiv is preparing a massive missile strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, there is an immediate danger of the Kherson region being flooded,"" Saldo said in a video message posted on Monday evening. That could result in ""the mass destruction of civilian infrastructure and humanitarian catastrophe"", he said. ""Given the situation, I have decided to expand the evacuation zone by 15 kilometres from the Dnipro... the decision will make it possible to create a layered defence in order to repel Ukrainian attacks and protect civilians."" Kyiv has denied it plans to attack the Kakhovka dam, a 30-metre (100 ft) high, 3.2-kilometre long facility, and unleash a reservoir the size of the Great Salt Lake across southern Ukraine, flooding towns and villages, several of which Russian forces seized at the start of the war. Ukraine said repeated Russian claims that Ukraine is preparing an attack on the dam, which regulates water supplies to the annexed Crimean peninsula and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, were a sign Russia itself was considering staging an attack and blaming it on Kyiv and its Western supporters. Russia has been evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from the western bank of the Dnipro river in recent weeks, under an advancing Ukrainian counteroffensive. Russian-installed officials are offering civilians one-time payments of 100,000 roubles ($1,628) to leave, and Moscow is providing housing in other regions of Russia, Saldo said. As recently as last week, some Russian-backed administrators in the region had ruled out evacuating citizens from the eastern bank of the Dnipro river.

Releasing a working paper that assessed savings measures to date and also looked ahead, researchers at the Berlin-based Hertie School's Centre for Sustainability said that lower usage was a prerequisite for overcoming the crisis. ""A further reduction in gas consumption in industry is likely in view of persistently high gas prices,"" they said. Their data did not count special temperatures and macroeconomic effects to allow for a year-on-year comparison of standard consumption for a given month. Manufacturing industries saved six terawatt hours (TWh) in its processes in September in absolute terms, saving 19% year-on-year over September 2021. By comparison, Germany 1,003 TWh of gas in 2021. To cope with the high costs, industry operators charged more for their output, switched to alternative fuels or substituted energy-intensive products with imports. German households, half of whom heat with gas, increased savings to 36% year-on-year in September, having saved 10% in March, the study said. The researchers explained these findings with delayed billing effects, delayed saving appeal campaigns and a lower price exposure of household prices to the wholesale market. It was unclear whether householders would continue to voluntarily turn thermostats lower in the cold season, they said. Gas spot prices on the Dutch wholesale hub, the Title Transfer Facility (TTF), averaged 100 euros ($98.83) per megawatt hour between October 2021 and mid-2022, peaking at 240 euros/MWh in August. This compared with a long-term, pre-COVID-19 price level of 15-20 euros/MWh.

Serbia, which was bombed by NATO two decades ago but now seeks to join the European Union, has long struggled to balance historically close ties with Russia against aspirations for economic and political integration with the West. An agreement between Serbia and Russia on enhanced cooperation had been met with surprise and disappointment, and was a poor fit with expectations that EU accession candidates should also adopt EU sanctions against Russia, the representative said. Serbia, an accession candidate since 2012, decided in September to hold regular foreign policy consultations on bilateral and multilateral activities with Russia. The move prompted harsh criticism from the EU. One got the impression that Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic was well aware of his pendulum position, the German government representative said. If he decided to lead his country in the direction of the European Union, he had the German government's support. ""Should he decide to go the other way, this will have consequences in reverse."""

President Vladimir Putin declared Russia's first call-up since World War Two on Sept. 21, after a series of military defeats. The announcement triggered an exodus of draft-age men, with hundreds of thousands heading for countries including Georgia, Armenia and Kazakhstan, while more than 2,000 people were detained at anti-mobilisation protests. Russia had already said it had recruited the 300,000 reservists it needed in just over a month, and that no more were required. But the Kremlin's refusal to issue a formal decree ending recruitment may increase concern among Russians that the mobilisations could still be restarted. Putin had said on Monday he would consult with legal experts to see if a new presidential order was necessary. ""A decree is not needed,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday. ""The Presidential Administration's legal department has reached its conclusion ... partial mobilisation has been completed. The relevant telegrams were sent from the Defence Ministry to military enlistment offices to end the despatch of draft papers."" The part of Putin's mobilisation decree outlining how many would be called up was classified and never made public, adding to fears that the enlistment campaign could resume. But Peskov said this was untrue. ""Included [in the decree] was a certain number: up to 300,000 people. Accordingly, this decree has been executed."" Asked if the original decree remained in force, he said ""No"". Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said 87,000 of the 300,000 mobilised soldiers had already been deployed to the conflict zone."

Turkey, one of the brokers and guarantors of the deal, sounded optimistic that a solution would be found to return Russia to the agreement and keep exports safe as the war rages on. The Istanbul-based Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) said in a statement that the ships' movement was agreed by the Ukrainian, Turkish and U.N. delegations working there, and that the Russian delegation had been informed. Amir Abdulla, the U.N. Coordinator for the Black Sea Grain Initiative, ""continues his discussions with all three member state parties in an effort to resume full participation at the JCC,"" the statement said. Separately, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that Ankara is making efforts with all sides to solve problems regarding the implementation of the deal. Erdogan expressed during the phone call that ""he is sure a solution-oriented cooperation will be established on this issue, as in many other topics,"" the Turkish presidency said. The export deal was agreed by Russia and Ukraine and brokered by Turkey and the United Nations in July to ease a world hunger crisis caused in part by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and an earlier blockade of its ports. Twelve ships set sail from Ukrainian ports on Monday, the single biggest day of exports since the programme began, while two arrived. Putin has said Russia's decision to suspend participation in the programme was a response to a drone attack on Moscow's fleet in Crimea on Saturday that he blamed on Ukraine. Moscow said on Monday it was ""unacceptable"" for shipping to pass through the corridor. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the attack and denies using the grain programme's security corridor for military purposes. The U.N. said no grain ships were using the Black Sea route on Saturday. Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar told Ukraine's defence and infrastructure ministers that keeping the initiative going was important and that, as a humanitarian initiative, it should be kept separate from the conflict in Ukraine, his ministry said on Tuesday.

As Ukrainian forces advance to the north and east of the strategic city, Russian-installed officials there have evacuated tens of thousands of civilians in recent weeks. Only a few remain, and some expressed frustration at not knowing what lay ahead. Compounding the uncertainty are claims and counter-claims by both sides in the eight-month-old conflict, which Russia calls a ""special operation"", that a nearby dam could be destroyed, potentially triggering floods downstream. Vladimir, a pensioner who declined to give his surname, said that during the evacuation from Kherson, Russian-installed officials cited the risk of a Ukrainian counter-offensive or of flooding. ""That's the worst thing for us,"" he said, speaking on Monday. ""Not knowing what the future holds."" Nearby, men were fishing peacefully on the waterfront. The rumble of what sounded like artillery fire could be heard in the distance, according to a witness. Ekaterina, a shopkeeper, said business had slowed abruptly after so many people left. She added that she was determined to stay. ""Why should I leave my ancestral house? My ancestors lived here. My great-grandfather, my grandfather. They built this house with their own hands. Why should I leave? ... What for? I will stay here to the very end."" Russian President Vladimir Putin acted to annex the Kherson region after staging referendums in four Ukrainian regions at the end of September that were dismissed as a sham and illegal by Kyiv and the West. Ukrainian armed forces have moved closer to the city after regaining some of the territory lost earlier in the conflict, and say that Russia has been reinforcing in the region to defend against a possible assault on Kherson. Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-backed head of the Kherson region that is partially occupied by Russian forces, has asked citizens on the eastern bank of the Dnipro to begin leaving their homes in an extension of the evacuation zone. The new area will cover an additional 15-kilometre (nine-mile) zone around the Dnipro, which splits the Kherson region, to include another seven settlements, Saldo said. He repeated claims, rejected by Kyiv, that Ukraine could be preparing to attack the Kakhovka dam and flood the region. Kyiv denies it plans to attack the dam, a 30-metre (100-foot)-high, 3.2 kilometre-long barrier, and unleash a reservoir the size of the Great Salt Lake across southern Ukraine, inundating towns and villages.

Russian forces have increasingly targeted Ukraine's infrastructure including power stations and the electricity grid, causing regular blackouts and disrupting heating and water supplies. The trench candles consist of empty enamel paint cans and pet-food tins stuffed with corrugated cardboard and paraffin wax - and crucially they provide warmth as well as light. The candles have been used by troops in previous conflicts, including World War Two. ""(The candles) can be used to dry out a trench, cook food, which is very important, boil water, and warm people up,"" said Nino Nazarova, 28, an organiser of the initiative. When Nazarova secured 10,000 cans from a factory in northern Ukraine a few weeks ago, she thought it would take months to turn them all into trench candles, but volunteers completed the task during an event on Sunday at a Kyiv cultural center, singing Ukrainian folk songs as they worked. ""These cans come with a cover. So you can close them, throw them into boiling water, heat them up and then put them under your coat,"" she said. The initiative has so far delivered more than 3,000 multi-functional candles to Ukrainian trenches in the south and east of the country, Nazarova added. The candles can reportedly burn for up to five or six hours. Polina Sheremet, a co-organiser, said the more that Russian missiles rain down on Ukraine, the stronger their motivation to help the army becomes. ""The people's desire to donate and help is growing alongside the risk of missile strikes and other attacks. This is how human nature works,"" she said. Some children joined their parents during Sunday's candle-making session, including Hordii who had come with his mother to help. ""At the beginning, it (the war) was really scary, but now I have got a little bit used to it,"" he said, dsistributing strips of cardboard to the volunteers."
2022-11-01,https://www.reuters.com/article/canada-economy-immigration/canada-plans-record-immigration-targets-amid-labour-crunch-idUSKBN2RR39J,Canada plans record immigration targets amid labour crunch," Canada plans to welcome a record 500,000 new permanent residents in 2025 and has boosted its targets over the next two years as the country looks to ramp up arrivals to address an acute labour shortage, Immigration Minister Sean Fraser said on Tuesday. Canada now expects to welcome 465,000 new permanent residents in 2023, up 4% from a previous target, and 485,000 in 2024, up 7.5%. ""This year's immigration levels plan will help businesses find the workers they need,"" said Fraser in a statement. He added the new targets would also allow Canada to fulfil commitments to help those fleeing violence and war in their home countries. Canada is projected to reduce the number of government-assisted refugees it resettles by about a third, from 23,550 in 2023 to 15,250 in 2025. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has sharply ramped up immigration since taking power in 2015. The country is on track to surpass its target of roughly 431,000 newcomers this year. Canada is struggling with an acute shortage of workers, particularly in skilled trades and industries like healthcare. The most recent job vacancy data showed there were 958,500 open roles in Canada in August and 1.0 million unemployed people. Many of the unemployed do not have the skills, or do not live in the right areas of the country, to fill those open positions. The new targets will boost the number of economic immigrants by about 13% between 2023 and 2025, with steep increases in relatively small regional programs that help funnel people to provinces and regions outside major urban centres. A record number of Canadians are now retiring, hastening a mass exodus of Canada's most highly skilled workers and leaving businesses scrambling. In a statement on Tuesday, the Business Council of Canada called for ""bolder targets"" in economic immigration. The United Nations refugee agency said in a statement it welcomed ""Canada's leadership on refugee resettlement."" Refugee lawyer Maureen Silcoff said Canada can do more to welcome vulnerable people. She contrasted Canada's policy offering refuge to Ukrainians, who are officially temporary residents under a special program and not subject to a cap, and Afghans who face danger from the Taliban for working with Canada but whose numbers are capped. ""Given what's going on in the world, given Canada's needs and given Canada's commitments, there's more that can be done."" There are many good reasons to increase immigration, said University of Waterloo economist Mikal Skuterud. But with rising interest rates, the tight labour market may slacken and newcomers may face challenges integrating, he said. ""We're at a real kind of inflection point.

Moves towards closer integration aim to bring greater stability to a region that emerged from the break-up of Yugoslavia and the ethnic wars of the 1990s and is still wracked by tensions. They also aim to bring Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania closer to their stated goal of joining the neighboring European Union amid fears about the rising influence of Russia and China in the region. Serbia in particular, which was bombed by NATO two decades ago, has long struggled to balance historically close ties with Russia against aspirations for economic and political integration with the West. One of the German government officials said on Tuesday that Serbia must decide whether it wants to join the European Union or enter into a partnership with Russia. ""The need for a decision is coming to a head in view of geopolitical developments,"" the official said in reference to Russia's war in Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is due to receive leaders of the six Balkan countries and the EU in Berlin on Thursday as a revival of the so-called ""Berlin Process"" that his predecessor Angela Merkel put in motion."

The Treasury has attributed the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks to Killnet, the Russian hacker group that claimed responsibility for disrupting the websites of several U.S. states and airports in October, said Todd Conklin, cybersecurity counselor to Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo. The incident, not previously reported, occurred a couple of days before similar attacks from Killnet on U.S. financial services firms, Conklin told a financial services industry and regulator conference on cybersecurity. Killnet claimed on Oct. 11 that it had attacked JPMorgan Chase & Co's network infrastructure, but the bank reported no impact on its operations. Conklin described the attack on the Treasury as ""pretty low-level DDoS activity targeting Treasury's critical infrastructure nodes."" In line with new procedures adopted under the Biden administration, he said the Treasury quickly shared internet protocol (IP) addresses used in the attack with financial services firms. ""It confirmed that we're on the right track with how we're trying to actually share tactical information with the sector in real time with the mind that we are interconnected and face the same threat actors,"" Conklin said, adding that this information includes downgraded intelligence and details on adversaries. The changes emanated from a shift in Treasury's cyber threat posture after Adeyemo and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen took office. Adeyemo created the cybersecurity counselor position, elevating Conklin to a department-wide coordinating role. Conklin joined Treasury during former President Donald Trump's administration. Adeyemo also told the conference that the incident was a ""stark reminder"" that Treasury and financial services firms face the same threats, especially since Russia launched its war on Ukraine in February. ""Before and over the course of this unconscionable invasion, we have remained in close contact with many of you to provide critical updates, flag potential risks, and ensure we are giving you what you need to keep your systems secure,"" Adeyemo told the regulator-led Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC) and the industry-led Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council (FSSCC). Adeyemo called for the two groups, launched 20 years ago after the 9/11 attacks, to deepen their cooperation to drive cloud and data protection workstreams and focus on new systemic risk issues."

As some among the crowd held Ukrainian flags, Zelenska, the wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked those in attendance to come up with ideas to “stop the terror, save people and restore the destroyed.” “You can help us stop the list of terrorism victims from expanding,” she said. “I believe that such technology is the future ... if it’s not, there simply won’t be a future to look forward to.” Russian forces swept into Ukraine in February in what Moscow calls a “special military operation” to eliminate dangerous nationalists and protect Russian-speakers. Kyiv calls Moscow’s military action an unprovoked imperialist land grab. The conflict has killed thousands, displaced millions and reopened Cold War-era divisions. “They (Russia) are attacking our power plants, there are blackouts everywhere in the country ... now, every day, we have no electricity, no communications and no internet for hours,” Zelenska said. She said her country was no longer able to invest in high technology in places such as schools because it must buy generators instead. More than 70,000 people are expected to attend the summit, which kicked off on Tuesday and will feature over 900 speakers ranging from Microsoft Corp’s vice chairman, Brad Smith, to Changpeng Zhao, founder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Web Summit’s boss, Paddy Cosgrave, told Reuters last week that 59 Ukrainian start-ups would attend the event. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s vice prime minister who also runs the ministry of digital transformation, will also speak."

""We are concerned about the threat picture, and we remain in constant contact through military and intelligence channels with the Saudis,"" said the spokesperson from the National Security Council. ""We will not hesitate to act in the defense of our interests and partners in the region."" The official spoke after the Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia has shared intelligence with the United States warning of an imminent attack from Iran on targets in the kingdom. The Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment. The top commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami, on Oct. 20 issued what he described as a warning to Saudi leaders not to rely on Israel and mentioned their ""glass palaces"". Riyadh had blessed U.S.-brokered pacts under which two of its Gulf allies forged ties with Israel in 2020 in a move that created a new regional anti-Iran axis, but also launched direct talks with Tehran last year in a bid to contain tensions amid Gulf uncertainty over U.S. commitment to the region. Saudi Arabia had blamed Iran for a 2019 missile and drone assault on its oil plants, a charge Tehran denies. The leading Sunni Muslim and Shi'ite powers have been locked in rivalry for decades, backing allies fighting proxy wars across the region. The latest concerns come at a time of strained relations between Riyadh and Washington after the Saudi-led OPEC+ alliance last month decided to cut oil output targets, which raised fears of a gasoline price spike in the United States. President Joe Biden had said there will be consequences for U.S. ties with Riyadh and several senators urged the White House to freeze all cooperation with Riyadh, including arms sales. Saudi Arabia relies heavily on the United States for its security. The United States has said Iran has supplied Russia with drones for use in its war against Ukraine, prompting Washington to set aside efforts to resurrect the Iran nuclear deal, which then-President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018."

He made his comments following talks with Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala. Russia announced on Saturday that it was suspending its role in the U.N.-backed initiative that escorts cargo ships through the Black Sea. ""On our side, we are continuing with the grain initiative because we understand what we offer the world. We offer stability on the food production market,"" Zelenskiy told a joint news conference alongside Fiala. Zelenskiy said he believed Russia had left the agreement despite the fact that Moscow said it had only ""suspended"" its participation. ""This means that it was Russia that is violating the agreement,"" Zelenskiy said. ""Let's hope that our partners will be able to calm down Russia's rhetoric."" Russia said on Monday it was ""unacceptable"" for shipping to pass through a Black Sea security corridor as Ukraine was using it to ""conduct military operations against the Russian Federation"". In his comments, Zelenskiy also drew attention to a document signed with the Czech prime minister aimed at increasing cooperation to reach standards needed for Ukraine to secure membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). Ukraine's bid to gain NATO membership has been denounced as unacceptable by Russia and was one of the key reasons cited by Moscow in justifying its invasion of its neighbour."
2022-10-31,https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-grains-wrap/u-n-black-sea-grain-pact-under-threat-as-russia-quits-idUSKBN2RQ0Y8,U.N. Black Sea grain pact under threat as Russia quits," Grain was flowing out of Ukraine at a record pace on Monday under an initiative led by the United Nations aimed at easing global food shortages despite Russia warning it was risky to continue after it pulled out of the pact. Russia said on Monday that the deal was hardly feasible as it was impossible to guarantee the safety of shipping after its withdrawal over the weekend following what it said was a major Ukrainian drone attack on its fleet in Crimea. Other participants, however, were pressing ahead with the deal while France said it was talking to other European Union states about how to boost Ukraine grain exports via land routes. Ukraine is one of the world's largest grain exporters and the conflict with Russia led to the closure of its seaports in February, driving up food prices and contributing to a steep rise in acute hunger across the globe. The deal, signed on July 22, created a safe corridor to allow exports to resume from three Ukrainian ports and helped to ease the crisis with more than 9.5 million tonnes of corn, wheat, sunflower products, barley, rapeseed and soy exported under the pact. U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths said on Monday the corridor does not provide cover for military action, adding there were no ships involved in a deal were transiting it on the night of Oct. 29, when Russia says its vessels in the Bay of Sevastopol in Crimea were attacked. A record volume of 354,500 tonnes of agricultural products was carried on vessels leaving Ukrainian ports on Monday as part of the Black Sea grain deal, a spokesperson for Odesa's military administration said. ""Civilian cargo ships can never be a military target or held hostage. The food must flow,"" tweeted Amir Abdullah, the U.N. official who coordinates the programme. Russia, however, cast doubts about the future of the pact. ""In conditions when Russia is talking about the impossibility of guaranteeing the safety of shipping in these areas, such a deal is hardly feasible, and it takes on a different character - much more risky, dangerous and unguaranteed,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Lloyd's of London insurer Ascot said on Monday it was pausing writing cover for new shipments using the Ukrainian grains corridor. ""From today we are pausing on quoting new shipments until we better understand the situation,"" Ascot head of cargo Chris McGill told Reuters. ""Insurance that has already been issued still stands."" Marcus Baker, global head of marine and cargo with broker Marsh, said that the change in the risk environment over the last 48 hours was ""very significant"". ""Given the change in circumstances it is not surprising that underwriters have taken the decision to suspend the facility until there is greater clarity,"" Baker said. Turkey, which helped broker the deal, remained committed to the deal which involves the inspection of cargoes at a Joint Coordination Centre in Istanbul. ""Even if Russia behaves hesitantly because it didn't receive the same benefits, we will continue decisively our efforts to serve humanity,"" President Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech. Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar told his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu on Monday that Moscow should re-evaluate the suspension of its participation. Wheat prices rose on Monday, climbing around 5% to $8.71 a bushel in Chicago, but remained far below a peak of $13.63-1/2 set in early March shortly after the conflict began. The strong pace of wheat exports from Russia, which harvested a record crop this summer, has helped to bolster supplies on the world market. Consultancy Sovecon on Monday estimated that Russia would export 4.5 million tonnes of wheat in October, up from 2.8 million in the same month last year. Corn prices rose around 1% to $6.87-1/2 a bushel in Chicago on Monday while soybean oil rose more than 2% to 73.36 cents per lb. Traders warned that hundreds of thousands of tonnes of wheat booked for delivery to Africa and the Middle East could now be at risk. ""If I have to replace a vessel which was due to come from Ukraine, what are the options? Not much really,"" said one Singapore-based grains trader who supplies wheat to buyers in Asia and the Middle East. Ukraine is also a major exporter of corn and there were concerns that shipments to the European Union were at risk. ""As far as Europe is concerned, corn is a bigger issue than wheat as we are getting into peak season for Ukrainian corn in November,"" said one grain trader said. Analysts warned that although global agricultural commodity prices have come off record highs in recent months, local retail food prices remain high and could now face further upside. ""Typically, it takes about two months for higher grain prices to filter through the supply chain and impact consumers at the retail level,"" said a Sydney-based analyst. ""But food processors do not have much forward coverage, so it is likely to be a lot quicker."""

The move could bolster Russia's struggling war effort in Ukraine by providing training grounds in Belarus for newly mobilised soldiers, something Western analysts have flagged as a logical step for Moscow at a time when its army is stretched and depleted. Lukashenko allowed Russian President Vladimir Putin, his close ally, to use Belarusian territory as a platform for the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. But he has refrained from committing his army to fight alongside Russia's in the eight-month-old war. Lukashenko has said he expects 9,000 Russian troops to be deployed in Belarus as part of a joint military grouping he announced on Oct. 10. Neither side has disclosed how many are in Belarus now or how the joint force will be deployed. Its creation appears at least partly aimed at forcing Ukraine to beef up security near its northern border with Belarus and diverting forces from its front lines with Russia in the south and east. The ""First Pool"" Telegram channel said Lukashenko had signed a decree approving a draft agreement with Russia to establish joint training centres for military personnel, but that the agreement was subject to further negotiations."

""The movement of ships along the security corridor is unacceptable, since the Ukrainian leadership and the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine use it to conduct military operations against the Russian Federation,"" the Russian defence ministry said in a statement. ""Under the current conditions, there can be no question of guaranteeing the security of any object in the indicated direction until the Ukrainian side accepts additional obligations not to use this route for military purposes."" It emphasised, however, that Russia was not withdrawing from the deal but only suspending it, in a move that Moscow announced on Saturday after what it said was a Ukrainian drone attack on its Black Sea fleet. The ministry did not say what Russia would do if ships continued to sail the route. On Monday a record volume of 354,500 tonnes of agricultural products left Ukrainian ports under the grain deal, despite Moscow's weekend announcement, a spokesperson for Odesa's military administration said. The Kremlin said earlier on Monday that without Russian security commitments, the grain deal was ""hardly feasible, and it takes on a different character - much more risky, dangerous and unguaranteed"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Moscow of ""blackmailing the world with hunger"" by pulling out of the agreement."

Moscow announced on Saturday that it was suspending its role in the U.N.-backed initiative that began in August and escorts cargo ships through the Black Sea, but ships carrying grain continued to sail from Ukrainian ports on Monday. ""Any disruption to the initiative risks spiking food prices, lowering the confidence of insurers and commercial shippers who have returned to Black Sea routes and further imposing hardships on lower income countries already reeling from dire humanitarian crises and global food insecurity,"" Price told reporters at a regular news briefing. Food prices had begun to rise before Saturday because Russian officials' comments had cast doubt on the longevity of the deal, he said. ""This is not a bilateral issue between Russia and Ukraine,"" he said, adding that 66% of the wheat exported under the initiative has gone to developing counties and 19% went to least developed countries. Overland routes were also being used to export Ukrainian grain, but there was ""no substitute"" for the quantities that could be shipped via the Black Sea, he said. ""It is not in anyone's interests - It is not in Russia's interest, it is not in the interests of the international community to see what could be a kind to a form of collective punishment for this to remain suspended,"" Price said."
2022-10-31,https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis/ukraine-grain-export-deal-back-on-track-as-russia-resumes-role-idUSKBN2RR3VX,Ukraine grain export deal back on track as Russia resumes role," Russia said on Wednesday it would resume its participation in a deal freeing up grain exports from war-torn Ukraine, reversing a move that world leaders had said threatened to exacerbate global hunger. Moscow announced the sudden reversal after Turkey and the United Nations helped keep Ukrainian grain flowing for several days without Russian participation in inspections. The Russian defence ministry justified the change by saying it had received guarantees from Kyiv not to use the Black Sea grain corridor for military operations against Russia. Kyiv did not immediately comment on that, but has denied in the past using the agreed shipping corridor as cover for attacks. ""The Russian Federation considers that the guarantees received at the moment appear sufficient, and resumes the implementation of the agreement,"" the Russian ministry statement said. The grain deal, originally reached three months ago, had alleviated a global food crisis by lifting a de facto Russian blockade on Ukraine, one of the world's biggest grain suppliers. The prospect that it could fall apart this week had revived fears of global hunger and pushed up prices. Russia suspended its involvement in the deal on Saturday, saying it could not guarantee safety for civilian ships crossing the Black Sea after an attack on its fleet. Ukraine and Western countries called that a false pretext for ""blackmail"", using threats to the global food supply. But Russia's suspension failed to stop shipments, which resumed on Monday without Russian participation, in a programme that was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had told his Turkish counterpart the deal would resume. ""The grain transports will continue as agreed before as of 12 (pm) today,"" Erdogan said in remarks to his AK Party. The prices of wheat, soybeans, corn and rapeseed fell sharply on global markets following the announcement, which allayed concerns about the growing unaffordability of food. Insurance companies had paused issuing new contracts, raising the prospect that shipments could stop within days, industry sources said. But Lloyds of London insurer Ascot told Reuters after Wednesday's resumption announcement that it had resumed writing cover for new shipments. ""This is clearly a positive development for grain users and consumers which will please the food industry and provide some reassurances as prices should ease,"" said Mark Lynch, partner at Oghma Partners, a finance advisory firm for consumer industries. ""We do however envisage that some risk premium is likely to be sustained due to the fragile nature of the agreement and the ongoing war in Ukraine,” Lynch said. Andrey Sizov, head of Russia-focused Sovecon agriculture consultancy, said Moscow's decision was ""quite an unexpected turnaround"" but the deal remained shaky given uncertainty about whether it will be extended past its Nov. 19 expiry. ""...The discussion around this topic will apparently continue,"" Sizov said. A European diplomat briefed on the grain talks told Reuters that Russian President Vladimir Putin was likely to use the need for an extension as a way to gain leverage and dominate the Nov. 13-16 G20 summit in Indonesia. Putin said on Wednesday Russia reserved the right to withdraw from the grain accord if Ukraine violated its guarantees. But, in a nod to Turkey's influence, as well as what he called its ""neutrality"" in Russia's conflict with Ukraine, Putin said that if Moscow did pull out, it would not impede grain supplies from Ukraine to Turkey. A senior Ukrainian official who declined to be identified told Reuters that Moscow's decision was mainly the result of Turkish pressure on Russia. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Moscow had miscalculated. ""When you want to play blackmail, it is important not to outplay yourself,"" he said. Ukrainian Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov expressed gratitude for the roles played by Erdogan and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The United Nations said Guterres ""warmly welcomes"" the deal and would continue working towards its renewal. The Russian blockade of Ukrainian exports through the Black Sea since its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 has worsened food shortages and a cost of living crisis in many countries. In a Tuesday night video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy credited Turkey and the United Nations for making it possible for ships to continue moving out of Ukrainian ports with cargoes. ""But a reliable and long-term defence is needed for the grain corridor,"" Zelenskiy said. ""At issue here clearly are the lives of tens of millions of people."" The grains deal aimed to help avert famine in poorer countries by injecting more wheat, sunflower oil and fertilizer into world markets. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlu Cavusoglu said earlier Russia was concerned about its fertilizer and grain exports, echoing Russian officials in saying ships carrying them could not dock even though the exports were not included in Western sanctions. There was no mention of any concessions on those issues in the Russian statement on the resumption, but the U.N. statement said Guterres would work to get those obstacles removed. ""The Secretary-General continues his engagement with all actors towards the renewal and full implementation of the Initiative, and he also remains committed to removing the remaining obstacles to the exports of Russian food and fertilizer,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said."

Putin proposed Turkey as a base for gas supplies earlier this month after the Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic Sea were damaged in September by blasts. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan says he agrees with the idea. Putin said it was very difficult to work directly with European commercial partners. The European Union, which previously turned to Russia for about 40% of its gas needs, is seeking to wean itself off Russian energy. ""It is easier for us to work with Turkey. President Erdogan is a man of his word ... and it is easier for us to control the Black Sea,"" Putin told a televised news conference. ""This is a quite realistic project and we can do it fairly quickly, and there will be enough people who want to conclude a contract ... I have no doubt that in Europe there are many who want to,"" he said. Putin also said Russia's Gazprom had been allowed to inspect the damage done when blasts hit the Nord Stream gas pipelines. Moscow accused British navy personnel of being responsible, a charge London dismissed. Sweden and Denmark have both concluded that four leaks on Nord Stream 1 and 2 were caused by explosions. Putin said the blasts had torn a 40-metre length of pipe out of Nord Stream 1 and hurled it into Nord Stream 2, causing damage. In total there was a 259-metre break in Nord Stream 1, he said."

Russia has accused Ukraine of using air and maritime drones to target vessels in the Bay of Sevastopol early on Saturday and suggested one of the drones may have been launched from a civilian vessel chartered to export food from Ukrainian ports. Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied it was behind the attack but says Russia's navy is a legitimate military target. Responding to Russia's accusation about possible misuse of cargo ships, U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths told the U.N. Security Council on Monday: ""None were in the corridor on the night of the 29th of October when the reported attacks took place, and no vessel reported an incident over the weekend."" After Saturday's attack, Moscow said it was suspending its participation in the July 22 deal that allowed Ukraine to restart food exports stalled by Russia's invasion on Feb. 24. No ships transited the maritime humanitarian corridor on Sunday. ""Today 12 ships sailed out from Ukrainian ports and two headed in to load food,"" Griffiths told the 15-member council. ""We're very encouraged by Russia's assurance ... that it is not pulling out of the initiative ... it is only temporarily suspending activities in the implementation of the initiative,"" he said, adding that the U.N.'s understanding was that the deal and ""commitments remain in force even during the suspension."" That includes a pledge by Russia and Ukraine not to attack cargo ships or port facilities, Griffiths said. He then told reporters: ""We believe very strongly that provision remains in force, including for the Russian Federation."" Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council that Russia had suspended its participation ""for an unspecified period of time"" because it ""cannot guarantee the safety of civilian vessels participating in the Black Sea initiative."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Twitter on Monday that he had spoken with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and confirmed Kyiv's commitment to the grain deal. More than 9.5 million tonnes of corn, wheat, sunflower products, barley, rapeseed and soy have been exported from Ukraine under the deal, according to the United Nations. The body has warned that Russia's war was worsening a global food crisis and pushing tens of millions more people into hunger. Kenya's U.N. Ambassador Martin Kimani told the Security Council about Russia's suspension of participation in the pact: ""The world is hungry and this development makes life harsher for millions who are not party to the war in Ukraine."" The Black Sea grain export deal is implemented by a Joint Coordination Centre in Istanbul made up of Turkish, Russian, U.N. and Ukrainian officials. Griffiths said Russian officials were still in Istanbul and U.N. officials were ""very actively engaged"" with them on trying to resume Russia's participation. The July deal also aims to facilitate exports of Russian grain and fertilizer exports. Griffiths heads talks on Ukrainian exports, while senior U.N. trade official Rebeca Grynspan leads discussions on Russian food and fertilizer exports. Russian grain exports have also increased since July, Grynspan told the U.N. Security Council on Monday. ""Exports from the Russian Federation tripled between July and September, while wheat exports from Ukraine more than quadrupled over the same period of time, resulting in lower food prices in international markets and improved access to food for humanitarian actors,"" Grynspan said. But she said more work needed to be done to alleviate a chilling effect of Western sanctions on Russian fertilizer exports."

""The grain and oilseed markets rose sharply overnight, led by wheat, as food shortage fears rise again after Russia pulls out of the Black Sea trade agreement,"" StoneX chief commodities economist Arlan Suderman said in a client note. Moscow suspended its participation in the Black Sea deal on Saturday in response to what it called a major Ukrainian drone attack on its fleet in Russia-annexed Crimea. Ships carrying grain sailed from Ukrainian ports on Monday, suggesting Moscow had stopped short of reimposing a blockade. But shipments could be interrupted again, not least if insurers stop underwriting them. Lloyd's of London insurer Ascot is suspending writing cover for new shipments using the Ukrainian grains corridor in the Black Sea until it has more clarity about the situation there, a senior official said. Russia's moves overshadowed market pressure from a firmer dollar, which tends to make U.S. grains less competitive globally, and hedge-related pressure from the ongoing Midwest harvest. After the close of the CBOT, the U.S. Department of Agriculture rated 28% of the newly-seeded U.S. winter wheat crop in good to excellent condition, below analyst expectations and the lowest for this time of year in USDA records dating to 1987. The USDA said the U.S. soybean harvest was 88% complete, ahead of the five-year average of 78%, and the corn harvest was 76% complete, ahead of the five-year average of 64%. In South America, roadblocks in at least 12 Brazilian states by truckers who support outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro could affect agricultural exports in one of the world's top food producers, according to the head of a key state farm lobby."

Putin has said that Russia hasn't talked about using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, saying instead that Kyiv could create and detonate a ""dirty bomb"". But Cleverly said it was an ""absurd claim"" to say Ukraine planned to detonate such a bomb, adding that Putin's rhetoric around nuclear weapons was ""irresponsible talk"". ""No other country is talking about nuclear use. No country is threatening Russia or President Putin,"" Cleverly told lawmakers. ""He should be clear that for the UK and our allies, any use, at all, of nuclear weapons would change the nature of the conflict. There would be severe consequences for Russia."" Russia's defence ministry said that British navy personnel blew up Nord Stream gas pipelines last month, and that ""British specialists"" from the same unit directed Ukrainian drone attacks on its Russian Black Sea fleet in Crimea on Saturday. Britain has said the accusations are false. Cleverly did not directly reference those comments, but said: ""Now the Kremlin is resorting to peddling false claims, churning out invented stories that say more about the fractures within Russia's government than they do about us."" Russia on Saturday suspended its participation in a U.N.-brokered Black Sea grain deal, citing the drone attack on its fleet. Cleverly said it would be ""unconscionable"" for people in low and middle income countries to suffer as a result. ""I urge Russia to stop impeding this vital initiative that is feeding the hungry across the world and agree to its extension,"" he said."

Shoigu dismissed assertions by Kyiv and the West that Russia has suffered heavy losses, and said 90% of wounded Russian soldiers had returned to the frontline. * U.S. President Joe Biden will try to rally the world against Russia's invasion of Ukraine in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, saying Moscow's war against its neighbor violates the tenets of the U.N. charter. * Germany nationalised gas importer Uniper (UN01.DE) on Wednesday and Britain capped the wholesale cost of electricity and gas for businesses, in Europe's latest moves to keep the lights on and heaters running this winter as the war in Ukraine escalates. * Stocks fell, while safe havens such as government bonds and the dollar rose, as already anxious investors fled risk assets after Putin ordered a partial mobilisation and accused the West of ""nuclear blackmail"". * The rouble recovered from two months lows and Russian stocks pared losses on Wednesday after earlier plunges triggered by President Vladimir Putin's move to order Russia's first military mobilisation since World War Two. * ""Those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the weathervane can turn and point towards them,"" Putin said in the televised address. * ""Sham referenda and mobilization are signs of weakness, of Russian failure,"" Bridget Brink, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine said on Twitter.

2022-08-09,https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-grain-explainer/explainer-can-ukraines-grain-deal-ease-the-global-food-crisis-idUSKBN2PF1CM,Explainer: Can Ukraine's grain deal ease the global food crisis?," Russia said on Wednesday it would resume participation in a deal to free up vital grain exports from war-torn Ukraine after suspending its involvement over the weekend in a move that had threatened to exacerbate hunger across the world. The agreement, reached in July, created a protected sea transit corridor and was designed to alleviate global food shortages, with Ukraine's customers including some of the world's poorest countries. Developing nations such as Somalia and Eritrea also rely heavily on imports of wheat from Russia. The agreement from the outset was based on facilitating commercial shipments. Here are some of the issues: The pact created a safe shipping channel for exports from three ports in Ukraine and the early focus was enabling some of the ships that had been trapped in the war torn country since Russia's invasion in February to leave. So far, some 9.76 million tonnes of agricultural products have been shipped, predominately corn, but also volumes of soybeans, sunflower oil, sunflower meal and barley. Shipments of wheat have reached 2.8 million tonnes, or nearly 30% of the total. This partly reflects the timing of Russia's invasion, as much of last year's wheat crop had already been exported in February. Wheat is harvested several months before corn and so tends to be shipped earlier. For a full breakdown of the countries and quantities exported:  HAS IT ALLEVIATED THE FOOD CRISIS? A drop in shipments from major exporter Ukraine has played a role in this year's global food price crisis, but there are also other important drivers. These include the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate shocks which continue to challenge agricultural production, mostly recently droughts in both Argentina and the United States. The corridor has led to a partial recovery in shipments from Ukraine but they remain well below pre-invasion levels and will not fully recover for the foreseeable future. Transporting grains to ports there remains challenging and expensive, while Ukrainian farmers have reduced sowings of crops such as wheat after in many cases selling last year's crops at a loss, with domestic prices remaining very low. The three ports involved in the deal - Odesa, Chornomorsk and Pivdennyi - have the combined capacity to ship around three million tonnes a month. According to estimates from consultants APK-Inform Ukraine could export between 23.9 to 40 million tonnes of grains in 2022/23 depending on the situation with the three seaports. As of Nov. 2 it had exported 13.4 million tonnes, including 5.1 million tonnes of wheat and 7.1 million tonnes of corn, according to agriculture ministry data that includes shipments via smaller Danube ports and by land. However, there have been too few large ships coming in to keep up the pace and volumes needed. Many bigger shipowners have remained wary of entering a war zone, particularly with the threat posed by mines and the high cost of insurance. The exclusion of Mykolaiv, Ukraine's second-largest grain terminal according to 2021 shipment data, has made a bigger export push challenging. Prices of wheat on the Chicago Board of Trade rose sharply in the aftermath of Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine but are now only slightly above pre-conflict levels. Ukraine's ability to export millions of tonnes of wheat through the corridor has been one element driving down prices. Other factors include a record crop in major exporter Russia this year, the gloomy global economic outlook and a strong dollar. But prices for wheat-based food staples such as bread and noodles remain well above pre-invasion levels in many developing countries despite the decline in Chicago futures, due to weak local currencies and higher energy prices which have raised costs such as transport and packaging. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of planting the many naval mines that now float around the Black Sea. These pose a significant threat and were cited as the one thing feared by a crew member on the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, the first ship to pass through the corridor on Aug. 1. The mines have drifted far from Ukraine's shores, with Romanian, Bulgarian and Turkish military diving teams defusing some that have ended up in their waters. It could take months to clear them and there was not enough time to do so before the grains pact came into effect. The Istanbul based Joint Coordination Centre, which oversees the deal and is made up of Turkish, Russian, Ukrainian and U.N. officials, in August published procedures on the shipping channel, which aims to alleviate concerns of insurers and shipowners. Insurers initially said they were willing to provide cover if there were arrangements for international navy escorts and a clear strategy to deal with sea mines. Since then, they have created clauses for providing cover, including provisos that ships need to stay inside the corridor when transiting or risk invalidating their policies. Following the July 22 agreement, Lloyd's of London insurer Ascot and broker Marsh (MMC.N) set up a marine cargo and war insurance facility for grain and food products moving out of Ukrainian Black Sea ports with $50 million cover per voyage. The cost of overall insurance for ships sailing into Ukrainian ports - which includes separate segments of cover - is nevertheless likely to remain steep. In September, Ukraine implemented a decree allowing its seafarers to leave the country despite wartime restrictions, a move aimed at freeing up vital manpower for both Ukrainian grain exports and the wider global shipping industry. At the start of the conflict there were around 2,000 seafarers from all over the world stranded in Ukrainian ports. The International Chamber of Shipping association estimated that figure had fallen to some 346 mariners as of Oct. 27."
