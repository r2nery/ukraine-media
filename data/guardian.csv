Since the end of February, at least 480 Ukrainian families with children and 180 single adults have applied to councils for help with homelessness. Despite the government insisting that the Homes for Ukraine and family visa schemes would ensure that refugees had housing, both are leaving people struggling when arrangements break down. The data exposes the cracks already appearing in the Homes for Ukraine scheme, with 145 placements having ended in homelessness by 3 June. Of these, 90 ended because the arrangement broke down and a further 55 never got off the ground properly because the accommodation was unavailable or unsuitable on arrival. Lauren Scott, executive director of Refugees at Home, said: “We are frustrated and saddened but not surprised to see placements start to break down. Expecting vulnerable, traumatised refugees to rely on the goodwill of strangers they have met on Facebook was always a risk. “We urgently need a joined-up national fallback plan to help families whose placements go wrong. Across the country there is no consistent approach to rematching guests with new hosts, no standard way for Ukrainians to change their visa sponsors, and no single mechanism for moving funding from one host to another.” Many local authorities are treating Ukrainian families as homeless rather than attempting to rematch them with new hosts, leaving them in hostels and hotels, just as happened with Afghan refugees. Of the 145 failed Homes for Ukraine placements, only 20 were rematched with a new host. Scott said: “It is a nightmare situation – the very one that we had hoped to avoid.” Anna, 37, fled Kyiv with her husband and their three-year-old son when war broke out. They came to Britain at the end of March after matching with a family of four who lived in a large house in Northampton. After initially being welcoming, their hosts became less enthusiastic within a few weeks. “We didn’t understand what was happening because they changed their mood very quickly,” Anna said. Anna and her family were moved into an annexe. The host said he wanted a key to it and they agreed as long as he warned them before going in, but shortly afterwards he called the council to say he wanted to terminate his sponsorship. “They didn’t explain anything to us,” Anna said. “They were not ready to share their house. They tried to get rid of us as soon as possible.” Her family were put up in a Travelodge for several days by the council, sharing one room with no cooking facilities. They had no idea where to go. “We were desperate and felt we didn’t have any other options than to go back to Ukraine,” Anna said. Finally, after trawling the internet, they found Refugees at Home, who helped place them with another family. They are still scarred from the experience. “We lost our home in Ukraine, and when we came here we thought that we were safe, but actually we weren’t and we lost our home a second time.” The family visa scheme, which has been running the longest, accounted for 455 homeless applications. In many cases, families desperate to get their relatives out of Ukraine applied for visas but never had room for them to stay. The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, said: “It is worrying to see that desperate Ukrainian families who have fled war, endured trauma and heartbreak, arriving here, entrusting their safety in our hands, to have been left to fall into homelessness. “Ukrainian families arriving here need a warm welcome, safe housing and benefits, emotional support, and connection. We’re concerned that Ukrainians arriving on family visas are running into problems as not all relatives will have the space or the resources to support their family members – which is why there needs to be the same level of funding available to them and local councils as is provided under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.” Lisa Nandy MP, shadow levelling up and housing secretary, said: “It is utterly shameful that families that have fled Putin’s brutal war have found themselves homeless here in the UK. “The British people showed amazing generosity in stepping up in their thousands to provide the care and sanctuary that these people – many of them families with young children – needed and deserved in such awful circumstances. “But the government has failed miserably to play its part. Ministers were warned about the risk of refugees becoming homeless on the day they launched the sponsorship scheme, but they were more interested in grandstanding in television studios than doing their jobs to protect vulnerable people. “The government must urgently set out a plan to support councils to find safe homes for these families.” Cllr David Renard, housing spokesperson for the Local Government Association, said: “Currently, councils receive no data on, or funding for, people who are coming under the family visa scheme. Some of those families present as homeless once they have arrived, but we are asking that they should be able to be rematched with a sponsor under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. “Urgent work is needed on how councils can work with government and the community, faith and voluntary sector so those offering their homes can be quickly matched with a family in need.” A government spokesperson said: “More than 77,200 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK since Putin’s invasion and all arrivals have access to benefits and public services, as well as the right to work or study, from the day they arrive. “The overwhelming majority of people are settling in well, but in the minority of cases where family or sponsor relationships break down, councils have a duty to ensure families are not left without a roof over their head. Councils also have access to a rematching service to find a new sponsor in cases under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.”"

Those targeted by sanctions include the Russian children’s rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, the so-called mastermind behind the shadowy abduction programme. Lvova-Belova has been accused by Ukraine of organising the capture of more than 2,000 vulnerable children taking then violently from the Luhansk and Donetsk regions and orchestrating a new policy to facilitate their forced adoptions in Russia. Russia said in May that more than 190,000 children had arrived from Donbas, including about 1,200 from orphanages in the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia said the vast majority were Russian-speaking or supporting, and that once they had found homes, they would be provided with Russian citizenship. A raft of other Putin allies were issued with sanctions by the Foreign Office, including military commanders and Vladimir Mikhailovich, Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox church. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: “Today we are targeting the enablers and perpetrators of Putin’s war who have brought untold suffering to Ukraine, including the forced transfer and adoption of children. We will not tire of defending freedom and democracy, and keeping up the pressure on Putin, until Ukraine succeeds.” Giving MPs an update on the state of the fighting, she said: “We are now approaching a critical moment. Russia is bombarding towns and cities in the east. “Some outside Ukraine are questioning whether the free world can sustain its support and claiming that some are beginning tire of this war. The people of Ukraine do not have that luxury. Our answer must be clear. We will never tire of defending freedom and democracy. Russian aggression cannot be appeased.” She betrayed British nervousness that the upcoming G7 summit in Germany may be used by those that support an early negotiated settlement that stops short of victory for Ukraine. She said: “Through the G7 and Nato we are doing everything we can to strengthen Ukraine’s hand. We also need to make sure our Baltic friends and our Polish friends are involved. Sanctions must be kept in place while Russian boots are on Ukrainian soil.” Others to face fresh British sanctions – mainly asset freezes and travel bans – include Sergey Savostyanov, the deputy of the Moscow city Duma and member of Putin’s political elite, and Alexey Isaykin, president and board member of Volga-Dnepr Group, a Russian transport company with significant air operations that is contracted by the Russian government to create air bridges that carry critical goods. Four military colonels from the 64th separate motorised rifle brigade, a unit accused of killing, raping and torturing civilians in Bucha, have also been targeted with sanctions for the brigade’s role in Ukraine. Members of the “Salvation Committee for Peace and Order” – an organisation collaborating with the Russian army to support the occupation of the Kherson oblast, have also been targeted with sanctions. In an attempt to show the links between Russia and other authoritarian regime, the Foreign Office also imposed sanctions on Russian organisations responsible for supplying aircraft parts to the Myanmar armed forces. The precise number of children – many of them orphans – who are being abducted is unclear, but Ukraine has claimed the number is higher than 100,000. In what amounts to a form of modern slavery those abducted have been taken to the Vladimirskaya, Omskaya and Chelyabinskaya oblasts of Russia and the eastern island of Sakhalin, Ukraine claims. Some of the children were relocated from Mariupol to Donetsk (temporarily occupied by Russia) and then further to Taganrog in Russia. Russia tries to justify the illegal displacement of children as “taking care” of orphans. Last week the head of Ukraine’s mission to the OSCE, Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, read out messages from children who had been abducted and wanted to return to their grandparents. He claimed this was what is called Russia state policy: “First, they come to kill their parents, and then they take children away.” Ukraine claims 318 children have been killed in the war. The Russian Orthodox church accused the UK of an absurd attempt to intimidate. “Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,” a spokesperson for the church, Vladimir Legoyda, said on Telegram. “The church – now especially – is the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. “This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal.”"

The three were pictured together overnight in a train from Poland used to transport high-profile guests to Ukraine, but little information was given about the details of the highly anticipated trip.    Mario Draghi, Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz onboard the train bound for Kyiv. Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AP   “It’s an important moment. It’s a message of unity we’re sending to the Ukrainians, of support, to talk both about the present and the future, since the coming weeks, as we know, will be very difficult,” Macron told reporters at the train station in Kyiv. The three leaders were greeted with air raid sirens in the Ukrainian capital, as Russia continued to strike targets across the country. Local officials said on Thursday that an overnight Russian air-launched rocket strike hit a suburb of the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy, killing four and wounding six. “We’re here, focused, and we’re about to meet President Zelenskiy now to visit a war site where massacres have been committed, and then to lead the conversations that are scheduled with President Zelenskiy,” Macron added. Soon after their arrival, the three leaders were pictured visiting Irpin, a commuter town a few miles from Kyiv that was subject to some of the heaviest fighting in the first weeks of Russia’s invasion. Romania’s president, Klaus Iohannis, who also arrived in Kyiv on Thursday by train is expected to join them for talks with the Ukrainian leader. The visit comes as complaints grow louder in Kyiv about slow arms deliveries, with one official saying this week that Ukraine had only received 10% of the weapons it had requested from the west. Scholz has become the main target of complaints, with Ukraine particularly unhappy with Germany’s military aid. The country’s ambassador to Berlin, Andrij Melnyk, told German broadcaster NTV that he expected Scholz to hand over heavy weapons that had been long-promised but not yet delivered. The first joint visit from the leaders of the three largest EU economies is taking place a week before the EU summit where European leaders are expected to discuss Kyiv’s bid to join the 27-nation bloc. Macron previously tempered Ukraine’s ambitions to join the EU, saying it could take “decades” for Ukraine to be accepted into the EU.    Mario Draghi (left) and Emmanuel Macron pictured on the visit to Irpin in Ukraine. Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty Images   There are also fears in Kyiv that the three leaders would put pressure on Kyiv to accept a peace deal favourable to Vladimir Putin, as Russia continues to make gains in the Donbas region and currently occupies around 20% of Ukraine’s territory. Commenting on recent statements by Macron that it was vital for the west not to “humiliate” Russia’s president, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskiy, told the German newspaper Bild: “They will say that we need to end the war that is causing food problems and economic problems.”  At the same time, European unity has been challenged by the far-reaching consequences of Russia’s invasion, including rising costs of living and spiralling energy prices across the continent. A survey this week from nine EU member states plus the UK found support for Ukraine remained high, but that preoccupations had shifted to the conflict’s wider economic impacts, further heightening fears in Kyiv that western support for the country would fade as Russia continues to make advances in the east of the country. Speaking to journalists at the annual St Petersburg international economic forum in Russia on Thursday, Denis Pushilin, the leader of the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk, said that he hoped the so called “special military operation” would be over by the end of the year, as both sides prepared for a prolonged war of attrition with no short-term end in sight.

The report, one of the first detailed studies on how reparations for Ukraine might work, says little progress has been made in setting up a global mechanism to require Russia to pay compensation and says the delays must end. It says it is remarkable how far plans are lagging in comparison with the number of war crimes investigations being launched, even though history suggests the numbers of Russian soldiers or politicians likely to be prosecuted is low. The Ceasefire report says payment of state reparations is well established in international law but basic questions remain to be answered. Questions that need answering include: “What form should such reparations take? To whom would they be made and on what authority? What sort of mechanism could be entrusted to take on the task of awarding and administering reparations on such a scale? Where will the money come from?” Ceasefire’s director, Mark Lattimer, proposes a UN general assembly or multilateral mechanism to take charge of administering reparations to civilian claimants, with the UK and other national governments using national and international law to put sanctions on assets to make Russia pay. “The legal obligation to pay reparations falls most heavily on Russia, but self-evidently it will not pay of its own accord. The example of the Iran-US claims tribunal set up in the wake of the US embassy hostage crisis shows, however, that sanctioned assets can be used as leverage to ensure that reparations are paid – or in the alternative those assets could be used to pay reparations directly.” The report finds for differing reasons that neither the international court of justice, the international criminal court nor the European court of human rights “are in a position to award reparations any time soon with the scope and scale required by the conflict in Ukraine”. It suggests the UN general assembly does have powers following an example in Syria to set up an investigating body to determine reparations, but even then the UN body would have no power of enforcement. “Russia’s veto-wielding power means that the UN security council – and with it the UN system – is effectively prevented from taking enforcement action against Russia.” The lack of consensus on reparations has led individual national legislatures to start ad hoc proceedings. The US and Canada have begun legal steps whereby reparations could be paid, by repurposing frozen assets, including yachts and property, held overseas by Russian oligarchs. The EU has so far set out plans that largely focus on criminal accountability, as opposed to financial redress, for Russia’s war crimes and other breaches of humanitarian law. Germany alone, for instance, claims to have frozen €4.5bn (£3.9bn) of Russian assets since May. It is a major step to move from simply freezing an oligarch’s assets to seizing them, and then handing them to an international body to pay reparations to the Ukrainian people, especially if there is little evidence that these private assets were gained corruptly. The second source of potential revenue is the $300bn (£250bn) of Russian central bank reserves held in G7 territories. There is resistance in Europe, and British Conservative circles, to the simple seizure of Russian bank reserves. The former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a strong supporter of Ukraine, admitted he had concerns about the impact on faith in the global financial system. He said: “We are a country that believes in the rule of law and due process. You do not confiscate other people’s assets on a political judgment on the spur of the moment just because you feel sorry for people. It creates a very very disturbing precedent. The consequences go far beyond Ukraine.” Although the US has seized state assets in the cases of Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and Venezuela, it has not yet declared Russia a state sponsor of terrorism, illegitimate or an adversary in a declared war, the previous legal bases for their seizure of assets.   Related: ‘It was worse than hell’: life in Mariupol under Russian occupation   The Ceasefire report proposes that it would be better that Russia’s arm was twisted to make it pay reparations “voluntarily”, by making the lifting of global sanctions contingent on payment, as opposed to a straightforward clause in a humiliating peace agreement. This could follow the model used after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and carve out a set slice of oil revenue to pay for reconstruction costs. Dedicating a proportion of Russian oil revenues to compensation – as Iraq was required to do to fund a UN compensation commission – might, for example, prove more advantageous to Russia than being forced to sell its oil at a discount, the report suggests. “As the combined effect of sanctions produces severe economic contraction and, according to predictions by the Bank of Russia, ‘years of reverse industrialisation’, the incentives to come to the negotiating table could well intensify.” But the body that was used to transfer the Iraq cash – the UN compensation commission – has just been closed down, and it is unlikely Russia would allow a new body to be established."

Those who were left behind are largely cut off from the outside world with limited mobile phone and internet connection. “It was worse than hell there. There are no words to describe it,” said 55-year-old Vladimir Korchma, who had lived all of his life in Mariupol where he worked as a machinist at a local factory. “We had no gas or electricity. Only the lucky ones had water,” said Korchma, who left the city at the end of May. Korchma, a sturdy man with piercing blue eyes, spoke outside the help centre in Kyiv for people fleeing Mariupol. The centre, which provides food and organises housing, is the first port of call for many who had left the city. Korchma proceeded to open his phone to show images of a destroyed apartment block, as did many of his fellow ex-Mariupol residents, all desperate to show the impact of Russia’s invasion on their lives. “This was our home,” said Korchma, pointing to the screen. “Now it is in ruins. I would never have believed that I would be homeless at 55.”    Vladimir Korchma shows images of a destroyed apartment block in Mariupol. Photograph: Pjotr Sauer/The Guardian   Contact with his brother and others who stayed in Mariupol is very difficult but not impossible, Korchma said. Internet and phone provider Kyivstar stopped working at the end of March, and Korchma said his brother had to walk to the outskirts of town to find a signal. Russia has been eager to fill the information vacuum experienced in Mariupol by bringing vans with large mounted screens into the captured city. The “mobile information complexes”, as Russia calls them, play state TV news segments and political chat shows where pundits support the invasion.    “They had put those screens around all the main squares,” said Katerina, who asked for her last name to be withheld because she was currently in the Russian border town of Rostov-on-Don after leaving Mariupol on the 6 May. “When my mother and I were in line to get food and water, we were forced to listen to stories about how we were being liberated from Nazis,” she added. Russian state media have eagerly announced that the sign welcoming people to Mariupol has been replaced with one painted in the colours of the Russian flag.   We had no gas or electricity. Only the lucky ones had water   “De-Nazification has been a success in Mariupol,” wrote Vladimir Solovyov , one of Russian state TV’s main presenters.  More reports from the city, even from those who supported the war, have painted a far less rosy picture. Even months after the Kremlin claimed to have near-total control of the city, Russian media have done little to hide the dire state of affairs in Mariupol.    A man waits to get water in Mariupol. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images   “Residents of the destroyed Mariupol are cooking broth from pigeons on bonfires in their courtyard,” Russia’s state-owned NTV reported from the city late in May. Much of the city lacks electricity and water, those reports said. Meanwhile, the deteriorating health situation and lack of medicine are making matters worse. Back at the help centre, Oleh said that shortly before leaving the city on 2 May, he brought his younger brother to the dentist after his sibling experienced weeks of “agonising” tooth pain while hiding in the bunkers. While there, they discovered that the dentist had run out of anaesthetics. “His tooth infection was spreading so they had to do something. They took his tooth out without anaesthesia. He screamed and screamed,” Oleh said. There are now fears that cholera and other deadly diseases could kill many more people, as corpses lie uncollected and the summer brings warmer weather. “The smell in the city was just so intense wherever you went,” said Katerina. Videos posted on the Telegram сhannel “Mariupol Now” – which was set up by a Ukrainian volunteer to get information out of the city – show disturbing scenes. In one particularly gruesome picture, which the channel said was taken a few days ago, dozens of bodies are seen lying in a parking lot.   Think about the end of the Soviet Union, but five times worse   Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol, recently estimated that 22,000 died in the two months of fighting, while a person coordinating burials in the city told the Guardian that the number could be closer to 50,000. While pro-Russian separatists have pledged to rebuild the city into a “resort”, the economy appears to be at a standstill with long queues for food and humanitarian help everywhere. “Think about the end of the Soviet Union, but five times worse,” said 54-year-old Tatiana, who left Mariupol in April but has been in touch with her sister and mother who are still there. Soon after the pro-Russian separatists came, Tatiana said the “occupiers” promised locals that their outstanding pensions would be paid out, but Tatiana and others said that very few in the city had received any payments. Instead, she said, pro-Russian officials ordered that only those who had traded their Ukrainian passports for Russian ones could apply for benefits. Pro-Russia separatists had earlier announced that they had started handing out Russian passports in Kherson and Melitopol, two occupied cities west of Mariupol.    Psychologist Anna Chasovnikova offers therapy to those who, like her, fled the violence in Mariupol. Photograph: Pjotr Sauer/The Guardian   “A never-ending stream of pain,” is how Anna Chasovnikova, the psychologist at the help centre, described her therapy sessions with those who have left Mariupol. “One of the biggest problems is that people are struggling to accept that their past lives are gone forever. They can’t look forward anymore,” said Chasovnikova, who herself left the city at the very beginning of the war. She admitted that, despite being an experienced psychologist, she often found it hard to help her patients, who were coming to her with stories that “were unimaginable for the 21st century”. “What do you say when a girl tells you how her father was blown up in front of her during his own birthday celebration?” she asked. Chasovnikova said her patients also had a hard time understanding why a country that many in Mariupol had considered a friendly neighbour “could do such a thing”. Mariupol, just 60km (37miles) from the Russian border, is a largely Russian-speaking city where both economic and family ties with Moscow run deep. “In the end,” Chasovnikova said, “I tell them that these are the actions of a schizophrenic president. And maybe there is just no point trying to understand him.” The help centre has conducted daily animal-assisted therapy sessions. At the centre, one family sat in a circle, patting an excited labradoodle.    Anna Chasovnikova runs animal-assisted therapy sessions in a help centre for refugees in Kyiv. Photograph: Pjotr Sauer/The Guardian   “It helps the children and their parents to forget about the past, at least for an hour,” Chasovnikova said. About 90,000 people remain in Mariupol, compared with its pre-war population of 500,000, many of whom were too old to leave or didn’t want to abandon their homes. “Ukrainians are very attached to their belongings,” Chasovnikova explained. “Some of those who stayed just didn’t want to leave their houses.” But there was also some resentment felt towards those with pro-Russia sentiments who stayed. Nadia, a former boxing coach in Mariupol who left for Kyiv in March, said she knew of several men who were part of her gym that had welcomed the Russian forces and had since stayed. “Well, now enjoy living in it,” she said. For Korchma, the machinist, and others who moved to Kyiv, a long and uncertain road lies ahead. While he said he was grateful for the apartment that he and his family had received in the capital, he “longed” for the days he could return to his hometown. “I had a purpose there, we built a life. Things weren’t perfect, but they worked,” he said. “It was all taken from us.”"

He and other European leaders visited the town before meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.   German chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian prime minister Mario Draghi and Macron arrived in Kyiv after an overnight train journey from Poland. The three leaders were greeted with air raid sirens in the Ukrainian capital, as Russia continued to strike targets across the country. Scholz said Russia’s war of “unimaginable cruelty” and “senseless violence” in Ukraine must end. Romania’s President Klaus Iohannis also visited Irpin with them, and is expected to join them later for talks with the Ukrainian leader.   Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the leaders of France, Germany and Italy should “not be focused exclusively on weapons shipments to Ukraine” during their visit. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president and now deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, said the visit of the French, German and Italian leaders to Kyiv is of “zero use”.   Ukraine has ignored a Russian ultimatum to surrender Sievierodonetsk, with Moscow controlling 80% of the embattled eastern city that has become a focal point of Russia’s advances in the east of the country. Russia ordered Ukrainian forces to stop their “senseless resistance and lay down arms” from Wednesday morning and accused Kyiv of disrupting plans to open a humanitarian corridor for civilians to leave the area.   Thousands of civilians, including women, children and elderly people, are trapped in Sievierodonetsk with a diminishing supply of food, clean water, sanitation and electricity. An urgent situation is developing in the bunkers beneath the Azot chemical plant in the city, a UN spokesperson said. About 500 civilians believed to be trapped alongside soldiers inside Azot were preparing to flee the city through a possible humanitarian corridor.   Serhai Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has said “Fierce battles are fought for every house” in Sievierodonetsk, as Russia continues its attempts to capture the city in eastern Ukraine.   Russia’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said Moscow was ready to restart peace talks with Kyiv but claimed it had yet to receive a response to its latest proposals.   Russia’s combat force in the Donbas is highly likely operating in increasingly ad hoc and severely undermanned groupings, the UK ministry of defence has said in its latest report.   An overnight Russian air-launched rocket strike hit a suburb of the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy, killing four and wounding six.   Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, has called for “all Russian cities” in Ukraine, including Odesa, to be occupied by pro-Russian forces.   Children born in Ukraine’s Kherson region since 24 February will automatically receive Russian citizenship, according to a statement by the Russian-imposed authority occupying the region.   Britain has announced a fresh wave of sanctions against Russia aimed at people involved with the “barbaric treatment of children in Ukraine”. Those who have been sanctioned include Moscow’s children’s rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, for the “forced transfer and adoption” of 2,000 Ukrainian children. Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church and a long-time Putin ally and vocal supporter of the war in Ukraine, has also been sanctioned.   Russia’s foreign ministry announced new sanctions against 121 Australian citizens, including journalists and defence officials, citing what it calls a “Russophobic agenda” in the country.   US President Joe Biden yesterday announced a new $1bn arms packages for Ukraine , following appeals by Kyiv for help on the eastern and southern fronts. The support package, confirmed on Wednesday, includes 18 additional howitzers with tactical vehicles to tow them, 36,000 rounds of 155mm ammunition for the howitzers and two Harpoon coastal defence systems, the defence department said.   Russia and the United States must discuss the extension of the START nuclear arms reduction treaty, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the RIA news agency in an interview on Thursday. The matter was important for global security and Russia’s military operation in Ukraine was no reason to avoid its discussion, Peskov added.   Two American volunteers in Ukraine have gone missing and are feared to have been taken prisoner by Russia, officials and family members said on Wednesday. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, 27, are both US military veterans who had been living in Alabama and went to Ukraine to assist with war efforts.   Zelenskiy has urged the EU to tighten sanctions on Russia and warned Moscow’s forces could attack other countries. In an address to the Czech parliament Wednesday, Ukraine’s president said Moscow’s invasion “is the first step that the Russian leadership needs to open the way to other countries, to the conquest of other peoples”.   Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Wednesday allies would continue to supply Ukraine with heavy weapons and long-range systems, with an agreement on a new package of assistance to Kyiv expected at the summit in Madrid later this month. The agreement would help Ukraine move from old Soviet-era weaponry to “more modern Nato standard” gear, he said. Stoltenberg was speaking before a meeting in Brussels of defence ministers from Nato and other countries to discuss and coordinate help for Ukraine.   At the meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said Ukraine was facing a “pivotal moment on the battlefield” in Sievierodonetsk, with Russian forces using long-range weapons to try to overwhelm Ukrainian positions. Austin urged America and its allies not to “let up and lose steam” and to “intensify our shared commitment to Ukraine’s self-defence”.   China’s Xi Jinping has assured Vladimir Putin of China’s support on Russian “sovereignty and security” prompting Washington to warn Beijing it risked ending up “on the wrong side of history”. China is “willing to continue to offer mutual support [to Russia] on issues concerning core interests and major concerns such as sovereignty and security”, the state broadcaster CCTV reported Xi as saying during a call with Putin held Wednesday . A US state department spokesperson responded: “China claims to be neutral, but its behaviour makes clear that it is still investing in close ties to Russia.” "

The 38-year-old has become the most senior former or current athlete who still lives in Russia to publicly condemn the conflict. Denisov, who captained the Russian national team from 2012 to 2016, said in an interview with a sports journalist: “These events are catastrophic. It’s horrific. I am not sure if I will be jailed or killed for this, but I am saying it as it is.” Denisov, who also scored in Zenit St Petersburg’s 2008 Uefa Cup final victory over Rangers, added that he had written to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, asking him to stop the war. The Russian parliament recently passed legislation imposing jail terms of up to 15 years for anyone spreading “fake news” or carrying out any public action that would discredit the military action. Tennis player Andrey Rublev wrote “no war please” on a camera lens at the end of a match in Dubai shortly after the invasion of Ukraine began in February. Since the invasion began, the Russia national football team has been banned from competing in international competitions, while domestic teams have been barred from European tournaments.

Russia ordered Ukrainian forces a day earlier to stop “senseless resistance and lay down arms” from Wednesday morning, as Moscow controls 80% of Sievierodonetsk, a city that has become a focal point of Russia’s advances in the east of the country. Moscow on Wednesday also accused Ukraine of disrupting plans to open a humanitarian corridor for civilians to leave the area. The evacuation planned to bring civilians from the Azot plant to Svatove, a city north of Sievierodonetsk controlled by pro-Russian forces, and Ukraine had not publicly commented on Moscow’s proposal. More than 500 civilians, including 40 children, are trapped inside the Azot factory. Weeks of Russia’s relentless bombardment of Sievierodonetsk, including its industrial area, have reduced much of the city to rubble. The shelling of the Azot plant echoes the earlier bloody siege of the Azovstal steelworks in the southern port of Mariupol, where hundreds of fighters and civilians took shelter from Russian shelling. Saviano Abreu, a spokesperson for the UN’s humanitarian affairs office, described the situation in Azot as a “huge concern”. “The lack of water and sanitation is a big worry. It’s a huge concern for us because people cannot survive for long without water,” he told the BBC.  Interactive  In its latest intelligence briefing, Britain’s defence ministry said elements of Ukraine’s armed forces as well as several hundred civilians were sheltering in underground bunkers in the Azot plant. Ukraine has not publicly acknowledged that members of its armed forces were sheltering there, and it was not possible to verify the claim. Russia continues to make gains in Sievierodonetsk, a key city in Russia’s push for full control of the eastern Luhansk region. The mayor of Sievierodonetsk, Oleksandr Stryuk, told Ukrainian television on Wednesday afternoon that Russian forces were trying to “push towards the city centre”. “This is an ongoing situation with partial successes and tactical retreats,” Stryuk said. Meanwhile, Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, wrote on Facebook that 75 people had been evacuated from Sievierodonetsk, despite the three bridges that led out of the city being destroyed. “The evacuation is extremely difficult because the shelling does not subside. Police officers and volunteers were able to successfully evacuate 75 people, and all of them are safe,” he said. “We will not stop, as long as there is such an opportunity to evacuate people.”  Off the battlefield, Joe Biden announced a new package of arms and ammunition worth $1bn (£825m) for Ukraine, including more artillery, coastal anti-ship defence systems and ammunition for artillery and advanced rocket systems that Ukraine is already using. In the phone call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Biden said he reaffirmed his “commitment that the United States will stand by Ukraine as it defends its democracy, and support its sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression”, according to a US statement. Biden also announced $225m worth of humanitarian assistance. Meanwhile, Ukraine continued its pursuit of more European support as Nato defence ministers gathered in Brussels. “Brussels, we are waiting for a decision,” Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy, wrote on Twitter. Anna Malyar, the country’s deputy defence minister, said Ukraine had received just 10% of the weapons it had requested from the west. “No matter how hard Ukraine tries, no matter how professional our army is, without the help of western partners we will not be able to win this war,” she said. In Russia, where Putin is expected to make a major speech on Friday during the annual St Petersburg international economic forum, a rare voice of public anti-war dissent emerged from Igor Denisov, the former captain of the country’s football team. “These events are catastrophic. It’s horrific. I am not sure if I will be jailed or killed for this, but I am saying it as it is,” Denisov said in an interview with a sports journalist. Denisov’s statements made him the most senior Russian former or current athlete who was still in Moscow to have spoken out against the war. His comments came as Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and a close Putin ally, further escalated his rhetoric against Ukraine, writing on his Telegram channel: “Who said Ukraine is even going to exist on the world map in two years?” It was the latest in a string of statements by senior Russian officials that questioned Ukraine’s statehood. A day earlier, Russia’s space chief, Dmitry Rogozin, called on Russia to “finish off” Ukraine “once and for all”."

Yields from shipping crude and oil products rose 11% from a month earlier despite a 3% fall in exports, according to the International Energy Agency’s monthly report. Western nations have imposed sanctions on Russian oil and gas – the Kremlin’s largest source of revenues.The US banned Russian fuel imports, while the UK and the EU have agreed to phase out their use. However, Asian nations including China and India have ramped up their imports of Russian fuel, enticed by record discounts of more than 30% on Brent crude. Russia has been able to cope with the discounts due to the surge in the price of Brent crude. Urals, Russia’s main export blend, averaged $78.81 a barrel in May, up almost 12% from a month before. Oil prices are up 70% over the last year, at about $121 a barrel. Although the price came down this week on fears the US Federal Reserve will surprise markets with a higher-than-expected interest rate hike. The US government appears poised to follow the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in introducing a windfall tax on excessive oil company profits. Goldman Sachs said last week that oil prices could reach $140 this summer, triggering more pain at the pumps. Britons are facing record petrol and diesel prices due to a weakened pound and a squeeze on refining capacity.    Wholesale gas prices are also rising as an extended outage at the Freeport liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant following a fire at the US facility, and the curtailment of supplies via the Russian Nord Stream 1 pipeline, stoked supply concerns. The gas contract for within-day delivery in the UK rose by 10p to 180p per therm and the day-ahead contract jumped by 14p to 180p a therm – a two-month high for both contracts. UK gas contracts for delivery in July are up about 25% to £1.97 per therm. Freeport LNG said on Tuesday that repairs to its Texas Gulf Coast plant after an explosion last week could last until the end of the year and it would restart some operations in 90 days, rather than in July. The supply headache for European nations was exacerbated as Russia said it would cut capacity on the huge Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany by around 40%. Moscow has retaliated after delays to the return of gas turbines to Russia’s Gazprom that Siemens Energy said had been blocked by Canadian sanctions after maintenance in Montreal. Analysts at Jefferies warned issues at Shell’s Prelude liquefied natural gas facility off Western Australian could also hit volumes. Workers began weeks of strike action last week and an investigation by regulators into the site’s smoke detectors may also impact supply. Last week, the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, labelled the failure by governments and businesses to accelerate energy efficiency efforts as “inexplicable”."

The US president told a Philadelphia union convention on Tuesday that he was working with European governments on the plan “to help bring down food prices”. An estimated 20m tonnes of grain has been trapped in Ukraine – the world’s fifth-biggest wheat exporter – since the war began in late February, leading to fears of famine in some countries. When Russia invaded, it blockaded Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. Russian and Ukrainian forces have also filled the surrounding waters with mines. Attempts to restart shipping have failed, and about 84 foreign vessels are stuck in Ukrainian ports, many with grain cargoes on board.   Related: How do you get 20m tonnes of grain out of Ukraine?   A huge diplomatic effort to rescue Ukraine’s grain has faltered as it has always been transported by sea rather than through less reliable road or rail networks. In his speech, Biden said the grain could not “get out through the Black Sea because it will get blown out of the water”, referring to floating mines. Instead, he said, Washington was developing a plan to get grain out by rail but noted Ukrainian railway tracks were different to those in Europe – being slightly wider spaced – so the grain would have to be transferred to different trains at the border. “So we’re going to build silos, temporary silos, on the borders of Ukraine, including in Poland,” Biden said. Grain could be transferred from Ukrainian railway cars into the new silos, and then on to European freight cars to “get it out to the ocean and get it across the world”, he said, adding the plan was taking time. “This is just one of the possibly useful steps in ensuring food security. But we also need a green corridor for our ports,” Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an online post, referring to the blockade. Ukraine’s agriculture ministry on Tuesday said European countries were considering providing temporary silos to “preserve the harvest and secure future grain supplies”. The holdup in exporting grain has contributed to what analysts have called a “perfect storm” for global food supplies, as farmers face rising oil and fertiliser costs and the lingering effect of coronavirus labour restrictions. The head of the African Union warned last month that Moscow’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports risked “a catastrophic scenario” of food shortages and price rises. Reuters contributed to this report"

In an eerie echo of photographic dispatches from the Vietnam war in the 1960s, our cover image this week – taken by Diego Herrera Carcedo – captures some of the despair and anxiety suffered by Ukrainian soldiers fighting on the eastern front, as they come under sustained artillery fire. Amid reports of fierce fighting, some estimates claim Ukraine’s forces in the region are outnumbered by 15 to 1, with Kyiv’s troop losses running as high as 150 a day. Isobel Koshiw and Luke Harding speak to soldiers ground down by weeks of conflict, while Dan Sabbagh weighs the impact of heavy sustained losses on Ukrainian morale. Then, Phillip Inman assesses the effect of western sanctions on Russia, amid calls to lift them as a bargaining chip to bring Moscow to the negotiating table. There has been alarm and anger since the disappearance of the British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian activist Bruno Pereira in a remote region of Brazil earlier this month. As hopes for their safe return faded this week, we look at how a shared love of the Amazon brought Phillips, who was a frequent contributor to the Guardian Weekly, and Pereira, a respected advocate for the rights of Brazil’s Indigenous peoples, together.

The survey in nine EU member states – Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden – plus the UK found support for Ukraine remained high, but that preoccupations have shifted to the conflict’s wider impacts. “Europeans had surprised Putin – and themselves – by their unity so far, but the big stresses are coming now,” said Mark Leonard, a co-author of a report by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) on changing attitudes to Russia’s invasion. Governments’ ability to retain public support for potentially harmful policies would be crucial, Leonard said, warning that the gulf between the “peace” and “justice” camps could be “as damaging as that between creditors and debtors during the euro crisis”.  The survey found that despite strong support across Europe for Ukraine’s bid to join the EU and the west’s policy of severing ties with Moscow, many voters in Europe want the war to end as soon as possible – even if that means Ukraine losing territory. That view often did not reflect the position of national governments, the authors said, cautioning EU leaders against “maximalist positions” over the war and suggesting they remain tough on Russia but cautious about the dangers of escalation. “In the early stages of the war, countries in central and eastern Europe felt vindicated in their hawkishness towards Russia,” write Leonard and his co-author Ivan Krastev. “But in the next phase countries such as Poland could find themselves marginalised if the ‘peace’ camp broadens its appeal among the other member states.” The polling, carried out between 28 April and 11 May, found near-universal support for Ukraine, with 73% of respondents across the 10 countries blaming Russia for the war.  Interactive  More than 80% in Poland, Sweden, the UK (83%) and Finland (90%) said they held Russia responsible, along with strong majorities in Italy (56%), France (62%) and Germany (66%), while majorities or pluralities also saw Russia as the main block to peace. There was strong support for cutting links with Russia. A majority across the 10 countries felt governments should sever economic and cultural relations with Moscow, with most – rising to 71% in Poland – also favouring an end to diplomatic ties. Similarly, 58% across the 10 countries – rising to 77% in Finland – wanted the EU to reduce its dependence on Russian energy, even at the expense of the bloc’s climate goals, suggesting public support for a new round of EU sanctions, including on oil. But ECFR’s polling showed a clear divide between Europeans who want peace as soon as possible (35% across the 10 countries), and those who want justice – defined as restoring Ukraine’s territorial integrity and holding Russia to account (22%). A third “swing” group, who share the anti-Russian feelings of justice supporters but also the peace camp’s fears of escalation, accounted for about 20% of voters, the report found – with major distribution differences between countries.  Interactive  The peace camp – whose backers also tended to believe Ukraine would be worse off than Russia at the end of the conflict – was most strongly supported in Italy (52%), the polling found, while Poland had the biggest justice camp, at 41%. Crucially, views on the EU’s policy response to the invasion varied depending on which camp respondents were in, with justice voters backing the severance of economic, diplomatic and cultural ties, and peace voters supporting only the first of these. Asked what worried them most about the war, respondents in Germany, Italy and France were most concerned about the cost of living and energy prices, while respondents in Sweden, the UK and Poland were most concerned about the threat of nuclear war. As the conflict drags on and costs grow, governments will increasingly be forced to “balance the pursuit of European unity with opinions that diverge both within and among member states”, the authors write, pointing to a “growing gap between the positions of many governments and the public mood in their respective countries”."

Victoria and Oleksiy Manoylo, landscape designers who were at a garden festival in Milan, Italy, when Russian troops invaded their village near Bucha and destroyed their home, have poured their trauma and defiance into the garden, which will feature at the RHS Hampton Court Palace garden festival next month. They hope the garden will help bring in donations to a charity they have set up, Yellow and Blue Makes Green, which aims to raise awareness and funding to support the rebuilding of public parks, gardens and natural areas that have been destroyed by the war. Now staying in Duisberg, Germany, the couple sought to convey the resilience of Ukrainians through their garden, What Does Not Burn. “When the bombing and shelling started, we just looked from afar. We didn’t know what to do,” said Victoria, 48, “We were in shock. We tried to understand what was happening. We wanted to go home. Every week we thought one week more and we can go home. It was a terrible time, psychologically.” They went to Germany hoping to find work and realised they were not very far from the home of Carrie Preston, a friend and show garden designer who lives in the Netherlands. It was she who came up with the idea of a show garden “I suggested it at first because I wanted to distract them from thinking endlessly about the war. And they were in this bad place. So it was: ‘OK, let’s find a purpose,’” said Preston.    Oleksiy and Victoria Manoylo say they didn’t know what to do when the bombing started. Photograph: Handout   Victoria came up with the What Does Not Burn theme after talking to one of her clients back in Ukraine. The client had built his home two years ago, and she had landscaped the garden. “We had planted this beautiful garden. Now everything was burnt to the ground. Everything was ashes. Nothing remains. My client said to me: ‘We’ll plant a new garden.’”  Victoria wanted to show that the spirit of the Ukrainians “cannot be erased”. “I wanted to show the ashes; to show that Ukrainians will stand and be reborn, like a Phoenix from these ashes,” she said. The Global Impact garden expresses Ukrainian culture and strength, as well as hope for the future. The remains of the burnt-out cottage are adorned with rushnyk, a traditional embroidered cloth used in Ukrainian rituals on occasions such as births, weddings and funerals. The cottage will be surrounded by plants native to the country, including barley and hollyhocks. Field weeds such as wild carrot, chamomile and cornflower will be sown around wild fruit trees, such as wild pear. Inside the structure, a sculpture in the form of a tryzub, the Ukrainian trident based on the falcon, references the archetypal symbol of the phoenix rising from the flames. The couple are relying on donations and goodwill to bring the garden to Hampton Court in time for the festival, which runs from 4 to 9 July. With some sponsorship from the Guild of Landscape Architects of Ukraine, they then hope to repurpose the garden and take it to other countries, to help raise money to rebuild Ukraine’s green spaces. Everything from playgrounds to century-old trees, as well as gardening tools and machines, need to be replaced or restored, said Victoria. Donations can be made online.    Related: Boon for blooms as UK’s dry spring keeps plant diseases at bay   “Everybody knows how our cities have been destroyed. Of course everybody is thinking about how to give people shelter, but not for now thinking about trees and parks and the spaces where people can recover after suffering through the war,” she said. Preston said they did not want the garden to be “bloom and doom and heavy” for fear it might be too much for people to take in. “But you want to make sure you are not avoiding the conflict and that you are, in a visceral way, baring the truth. So it’s finding that balance of how you don’t avoid talking about how truly terrible the situation is, but you bring it in a way that expresses beauty and resilience and hope.”"

Serhiy Haidai, Ukrain’es governor of Luhansk region, said about 500 civilians, 40 of them children, were sheltering from heavy Russian attacks on the plant. Russia has told Ukrainian forces holed up there to lay down their arms   British intelligence appears to have confirmed the claims that civilians are hiding there. Russian forces now control the majority of the Ukrainian city, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest report.   Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the outcome of the battle for the Donbas region will determine the course of the war, adding that Ukraine’s forces are suffering “painful losses” in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. The battle for Luhansk’s Sievierodonetsk is now the biggest fight in Ukraine as its defenders try to repel a fierce Russian onslaught in the twin eastern cities.   Zelenskiy repeated his call for the west to step up the provision of heavy weapons to Ukraine. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar said the country had received only 10% of what it asked for and there was no path to victory without the aid: “No matter how hard Ukraine tries, no matter how professional our army is, without the help of western partners we will not be able to win this war”. Zelenskiy added that Ukraine does not have enough anti-missile systems to shoot down Russian projectiles targeting its cities. “Our country does not have enough of them ... there can be no justification in delays in providing them.”   Russia’s ministry of defence has claimed that it has destroyed an ammunition depot for weapons transferred by Nato as well as weapons and military equipment sent from the US and European countries at several railway stations.   Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has said six people including a one-year-old boy were injured when they were hit by debris from a Russian missile that had been downed.   Roman Starovoyt, the governor of Kursk, said the Krupets checkpoint in Rylsky district within Russia, was fired on by Ukrainian forces. The headquarters of the territorial defence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has claimed Ukraine shelled 18 settlements within the occupied region.   Dmitry Medvedev, a long-term ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, has posted a message to Telegram in which he expressed doubt that “Ukraine will even exist on the world map” in two years time.   Europe’s unity over the war in Ukraine is at risk as public attention increasingly shifts from the battlefield to cost of living concerns, polling across 10 European countries suggests, with the divide deepening between voters who want a swift end to the conflict and those who want Russia punished.   France’s President Emmanuel Macron is on a visit to Romania. He will travel to Moldova later today, and it is rumoured in diplomatic circles that he will visit Kyiv tomorrow alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.   US President Joe Biden said temporary silos will be built along the border with Ukraine, including in Poland, in a bid to help export more grain from the war-torn country.   Nato must build out “even higher readiness” and strengthen its weapons capabilities along its eastern border, the military alliance’s chief said on Tuesday ahead of a summit in Madrid at the end of the month. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance needed a “more robust and combat-ready forward presence and an even higher readiness and more pre-positioned equipment and supplies.”   Leaders of seven European Nato members pledged support for applications by Sweden and Finland to join the alliance. “My message on Swedish and Finnish membership is that I strongly welcome that. It’s an historic decision. It will strengthen them, it will strengthen us,” Stoltenberg told reporters after a meeting at The Hague on Tuesday.   Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has reportedly been moved to maximum-security prison. Navalny was moved to the IK-6 prison in the village of Melekhovo in the Vladimir region, Russian news agencies reported, citing Sergei Yazhan, chairman of the regional Public Monitoring Commission.   Russia banned British journalists, including correspondents from the Guardian, and defence industry figures from entering the country, calling it a response to western sanctions and pressure on its state-run media outlets abroad.   Pope Francis said Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine was “perhaps somehow provoked” as he recalled a conversation in the run-up to the war in which he was warned that Nato was “barking at the gates of Russia”.   Putin probably still wants to capture much if not all of Ukraine but has had to narrow his tactical objectives in war, the US undersecretary of defence has said. “I still think he has designs on a significant portion of Ukraine, if not the whole country. That said, I do not think he can achieve those objectives,” Colin Kahl said while speaking at an event hosted by the centre for new American security. "

Many – not only in the Kremlin – expected it to fall within days. Vladimir Putin’s hubris, Russian military shortcomings, courageous Ukrainian resistance and the sight of western nations rushing to show support created a glimmer of hope. Three and a half months on, the picture has darkened again. After Mariupol, Bucha and others, the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk is the latest scene of civilian suffering. Kyiv faces two immense challenges. The first is that Russia’s military has regrouped, concentrating its efforts on the Donbas, improving logistics and making other adjustments. The war has, for now at least, turned in its favour. It continues to make incremental gains while suffering severe losses of personnel and equipment. Ukraine has the will, but Russia has a tenfold advantage in firepower, according to Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. It is also easier to take a town if you do not mind destroying it. Ukraine, on its own estimates, is losing more than 100 soldiers a day, with hundreds more injured, and is increasingly reliant on enthusiastic but inexperienced newer recruits. The second challenge is maintaining external support. European nations are already divided over how much assistance to provide and how hard to press Moscow, and domestic political pressures will grow as countries struggle with the rising cost of living and soaring energy costs as winter approaches. The response to Ukraine’s very ambitious request for more heavy weaponry this week will be critical. On Wednesday, defence ministers will meet in Brussels to discuss future arms donations. On Thursday, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will reportedly visit Kyiv with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi. Unlike the UK, the Baltic states and Poland, these nations have been more hesitant on arms supplies and lean towards peace talks. Kyiv is visibly frustrated with delays in the arrival of promised German weaponry. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has also been understandably sharp in responding to Mr Macron’s remark that “we are not going to humiliate Russia”. Though an off-ramp is necessary when dealing with an autocrat with nuclear weapons, however little interest he shows in it, the comment was ill-judged. Last week, Mr Putin compared himself to Peter the Great, the 18th-century tsar, who he said did not seize but reclaim land from Sweden. “It seems it has fallen to us, too, to reclaim and strengthen,” the president said. Ukraine’s will is hardened not only by such rhetoric, but by the suffering its people have endured and the war crimes they have witnessed. A peace deal cannot be imposed upon it, and no one is foolish or cruel enough to say that it should be. But it can only continue to withstand Moscow with sufficient backing. If it can maintain substantial support – and if, therefore, its forces can successfully transition off Soviet-standard weaponry to western, and sanctions begin to really bite in Russia – the military balance might start to tilt towards Ukraine. Set against that, in the US, by far the largest supplier of arms, Joe Biden is increasingly preoccupied by domestic problems and Russia may hope for a more amenable president in a few years. While some military analysts anticipate an operational pause in the near future, due to the exhaustion of forces on both sides, they foresee at best a brief respite, not a path to resolution. Given all that Ukrainians have endured, the prospect of months and years more of war is unbearable. But hopes of bringing this conflict to a swift end appear as ill-founded as Mr Putin’s initial belief that he could rapidly unseat Mr Zelenskiy."

Moscow said the sweeping action was a response to western sanctions and the “spreading of false information about Russia”, as well as “anti-Russian actions of the British government”. “The British journalists included in the list are involved in the deliberate dissemination of false and one-sided information about Russia and events in Ukraine and Donbas,” the ministry said in a statement. Twenty individuals it described as “associated with the defence complex”, including military figures, senior aerospace figures and MPs, were also banned. Among the journalists banned are the Guardian correspondents Shaun Walker, Luke Harding, Emma Graham-Harrison and Peter Beaumont, as well as Katharine Viner, the editor-in-chief of the Guardian. British journalists working for the BBC, the Sunday Times, the Daily Mail, the Independent, Daily Telegraph, Sky News and a number of other outlets have also been banned. The editors-in-chief of the Times, Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail and Independent were also listed. A Guardian spokesperson said: “This is a disappointing move by the Russian government and a bad day for press freedom. Trusted, accurate journalism is more important now than ever, and despite this decision we will continue to report robustly on Russia and on its invasion of Ukraine.” Russia has launched an unprecedented crackdown on Russian and foreign independent news outlets since its 24 February invasion of Ukraine, as well as on foreign social media networks. Legislation was introduced soon after the war began to criminalise media outlets that disseminate “false information” about the Russian army. A number of media groups stopped operating in Russia as a result, with the draconian law in effect threatening to punish independent journalism with prison sentences of up to 15 years. Russia has also blocked access to several foreign news organisations’ websites, including the BBC and Deutsche Welle. Russia warned US news organisations this month they risked being stripped of their accreditation unless the treatment of Russian journalists in the US improved.  “Work on expanding the Russian ‘stop list’ will continue,” the statement said.

As fighting raged on for control of the city, local authorities said they still had ways to evacuate people, though it was not immediately clear what route the Ukrainian military was using. “The ways to connect with the city are quite difficult, but they exist,” Oleksandr Struik, the head of the Sievierodonetsk military administration, told Ukrainian television, adding that evacuations were taking place “every minute when it is quiet there, or there is a possibility of transportation”. “Russian troops are trying to storm the city, but the military is holding firm,” he added. Russia is believed to control about 70% of the city. Struik said about 500 civilians continued to shelter in the city’s Azot chemical plant, where it is feared a scenario similar to that in the southern port city of Mariupol, where hundreds of people were trapped for weeks in the Azovstal steelworks, could play out. A senior Russian commander said that Russian forces were ready to open up a humanitarian corridor on Wednesday morning to evacuate civilians from the Azot plant to Svatove, a city north of Sievierodonetsk controlled by pro-Russian forces. Col Gen Mikhail Mizintsev, the officer who was in charge of the devastating siege of Mariupol, said Ukraine asked the Russian side to help organise a humanitarian corridor to Lysychansk, a neighbouring city controlled by Ukraine on the other side of the Siverskyi Donets River from Sievierodonetsk, but that Russia’s defence ministry regarded Ukraine’s request as an attempt to save its encircled units. Fighters should “stop their senseless resistance and lay down arms” from 8am Moscow time (5am GMT), Mizintsev told the Interfax news agency late on Tuesday. Ukraine has not yet commented on the reported humanitarian corridor. It has previously accused Russia of violating ceasefire agreements. The Russian army has shifted the bulk of its military efforts to capturing Sievierodonetsk in its attempt to take full control of Luhansk and Donetsk, collectively known as Donbas. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk, told Ukrainian television on Tuesday that two more Russian battalion tactical groups had been moved into the area. The fight for Sievierodonetsk is turning into one of the war’s bloodiest battles and is seen as a potential turning point in Russia’s advances in the Donbas. During his nightly address on Monday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: “We are dealing with absolute evil. And we have no choice but to move forward and free our territory. The human cost of this battle is very high for us. It is simply terrifying.” Several Ukrainian officials have called on the west to supply Ukraine with heavier weapons while the country’s commander in chief, Valery Zaluzhnyi, said Russian forces had a tenfold advantage in firepower. Capturing Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk would give Russia full control over Luhansk as well as the possibility to focus its offensive on Donetsk. In a briefing on Monday, the Ukrainian military said Russian forces were “creating conditions” for offensives on the cities of Sloviansk, Lyman, Yampil and Siversk in Donetsk. Pro-Russian separatists and Russian news agencies reported that several Ukrainian artillery strikes on Donetsk city – which Russia controls – killed a child and injured several others.  Answering a question from Danish journalists on Tuesday, Zelenskiy said Ukraine “wasn’t interested” in targeting Russian civilians. “We are not terrorists to shell civilian areas. We are normal, healthy people.” Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian military had enough ammunition and weapons but needed more long-range weapons. “What we don’t have enough of are the weapons that really hits the range that we need to reduce the advantage of the Russian Federation’s equipment.” Pointing to the alleged strikes on Donetsk city, Denis Pushilin, the leader of the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk, said the proxy state would turn to Russia for more military help. Asked about Pushilin’s request, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told journalists that the “protection” of the two breakaway republics was the main goal of Russia’s “special military operation”. In the same call with journalists, Peskov said British authorities had not contacted Moscow regarding the fate of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner who, along with Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, were sentenced to death last week for “mercenary activities” by the court of the self-declared Donetsk republic. “They should address the authorities of the country that pronounced the sentences, and that is not the Russian Federation,” Peskov said, adding he was “sure” the Russian-backed separatist officials in Donbas would be willing to listen to an appeal from Britain. The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Tuesday said she would do “whatever was necessary” to secure the release of the two British nationals who have been sentenced to death in what international human rights groups have called a “show trial” designed to exert pressure on the UK."

The UN’s emergency food assistance agency said it had planned to deliver aid to more than 6 million acutely food-insecure people in South Sudan this year, as it did in 2021, albeit with smaller rations. But, in a major cut likened by a spokesperson to a form of humanitarian triage, the WFP said it would now have to prioritise 4.5 million of the most vulnerable people in order to stop them dying of starvation during the lean season, between April and July. “It’s a drastic cut because it’s a third of the total of people that we know require food assistance, but we had to do a kind of triage, if you will. We had to decide who to keep assisting and who we can afford to suspend the assistance from – not because they’re not in need but because they can survive,” said Marwa Awad, WFP spokesperson in South Sudan’s capital, Juba.  Interactive  She is now very worried about the 1.7 million people cut off from support. “They are food insecure. And if aid is not given to support them, they will slide further down the scale of hunger and reach starvation level. If people are not nourished and are not reached regularly, they will get worse and worse and join the ranks of their brethren who are already looking death in the eye.” Included in the cuts are free school meals for 178,000 of the poorest children. Awad said she had already heard through colleagues on Tuesday that parents were planning to take their children out of school and put them to work as a result of the suspension. A case of child marriage – a common byproduct of humanitarian crises – had also been reported, she added. South Sudan, which gained independence in 2011 only to enter a protracted and bloody civil war shortly after, continues to see repeated bouts of conflict, as well as climatic shocks such as severe flooding and localised drought. The Russian invasion has ratcheted up the pressure in several ways. Chiefly, funding is dwindling as countries race to allocate large budgets to meet the enormous humanitarian needs of Ukraine. “Donors are no longer actively supporting South Sudan as a crisis,” said Awad.    Houses submerged in flood waters in Bentiu in Unity State, South Sudan, November 2021. Photograph: Medecins Sans Frontieres/Reuters   Compounding that shortage of funds is the pressure from the soaring costs of staples such as wheat and sunflower oil, much of which has historically been produced by Ukraine. A knock-on effect of the high price of wheat is that it has, in turn, inflated the cost of alternatives such as sorghum and maize, which Awad said had gone up by as much as 59% in South Sudan. “In the marketplace I saw families going from one shop to the next to ask for sorghum. On finding that the price is very high, they’re unable to purchase it and they just go home hungry,” said Awad. Rising fuel prices have also placed pressure on the WFP’s operations in the country, where less than 2% of roads are paved, she added. The agency has calculated it needs an extra $2.8m just to cover food transportation costs.   Related: The Black Sea blockade: mapping the impact of war in Ukraine on the world’s food supply – interactive   Overall, the WFP says it needs an extra $426m (£352m) to reinstate its full intended programme of food assistance for the next six months. “The World Food Programme [has] a foothold in the hardest-to-reach areas,” said Awad. “So with that funding we can make a difference. But we need donors to be generous again and to support people here.” The most recent Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) assessment warned that 7.74 million people in South Sudan will face severe acute hunger during the lean season, while 1.3 million children will be acutely malnourished. The 4.5 million people who will continue to receive WFP food rations this year include 87,000 who are already experiencing catastrophic hunger and living in famine-like conditions."

In an interview with the Jesuit magazine La Civiltà Cattolica, conducted last month and published on Tuesday, the pontiff condemned the “ferocity and cruelty of the Russian troops” while warning against what he said was a fairytale perception of the conflict as good versus evil.  “We need to move away from the usual Little Red Riding Hood pattern, in that Little Red Riding Hood was good and the wolf was the bad one,” he said. “Something global is emerging and the elements are very much entwined.” Francis added that a couple of months before the war he met a head of state, who he did not identify but described as “a wise man who speaks little, a very wise man indeed … He told me that he was very worried about how Nato was moving. I asked him why, and he replied: ‘They are barking at the gates of Russia. They don’t understand that the Russians are imperial and can’t have any foreign power getting close to them.’” He added: “We do not see the whole drama unfolding behind this war, which was, perhaps, somehow either provoked or not prevented.” Shortly before the invasion, Vladimir Putin had demanded Nato rule out allowing Ukraine, which borders Russia, into the military alliance. The pope said he was not “pro-Putin” and that it would be “simplistic and wrong to say such a thing”. He also said Russia had “miscalculated” the war. “It is also true that the Russians thought it would all be over in a week. They encountered a brave people, a people who are struggling to survive and who have a history of struggle.” On Tuesday morning, the pontiff published a message saying the invasion of Ukraine was a violation of a country’s right to self-determination. “The war in Ukraine has now been added to the regional wars that for years have taken a heavy toll of death and destruction,” he said in a message for the Roman Catholic church’s World Day of the Poor, which will be marked in November. “Yet here the situation is even more complex due to the direct intervention of a ‘superpower’ aimed at imposing its own will in violation of the principle of the self-determination of peoples.” Meanwhile, he told La Civiltà Cattolica that he hoped to meet the Russian Orthodox patriarch, Kirill, a close ally of Putin who supports the war in Ukraine, at an interreligious event in Kazakhstan in September. Kirill scolded Francis after the pontiff urged him not to become the Kremlin’s “altar boy” in an interview with the Corriere della Sera newspaper. Kirill accused the pope of choosing an “incorrect tone” to convey his message, adding that such remarks would damage dialogue between the two churches. The pair had been due to meet in Jerusalem in June but the trip was cancelled due to the war."

For weeks after leaving Russia for Ukraine, the former vice-president of Gazprombank spent his days trying to convince officials to provide him with Ukrainian documents and allow him to sign up for military service to fight against a country where he had spent most of his adult life. “The moment war broke out, I knew right away I wanted to go and defend Ukraine,” Volobuyev said in an interview in the Ukrainian capital. “I first wanted to join the territorial defence units in the Sumi region, where I grew up. I reached out to a lot of officials but legally it was not possible for me to fight there as a Russian.” Soon, however, Volobuyev was presented with the option to join the “Freedom for Russia” legion, a special military unit that is part of the Ukrainian armed forces and is made up entirely of Russian nationals. He said he embraced the chance with open arms, and on Saturday in a video address, Volobuyev, holding an automatic gun, announced that he had joined the legion. “I am very glad I have achieved my first goal. But now I have to quickly undergo military training so I can actually go and fight. I can’t stop halfway,” he said. The 50-year-old has Ukrainian roots but holds a Russian passport and lived most of his life in Moscow where he became the vice-president at Gazprombank, Russia’s third-largest bank which is owned by energy company Gazprom. He was one of a handful of high-profile Russian defectors who condemned the war. Now, his decision to take up arms against Russia is another twist in a remarkable story. His public defection had already caused shockwaves given his senior role in a company that is at the heart of the Russian establishment and is chaired by Alexei Miller, the CEO of Gazprom, who is close to Vladimir Putin. “I made compromises with myself for a long time … But on the 24 February [the day Russia launched its invasion], any talk of compromise became impossible,” he said. “I could not be part of this crime.” Not much is known about the Freedom for Russia legion that Volobuyev joined. News of its formation was announced on Telegram on 12 March and some of its members – wearing balaclavas – held a press conference in Kyiv in early April. On its Telegram channel, it frequently publishes pictures of its members engaged in military preparations. “I was already known to the public so I could speak out,” said Volobuyev. “But for the other members and their families, it is very dangerous to talk about this, so the group is very secretive.” Volobuyev declined to say what the size of the legion was and where it has been fighting, citing military secrecy, but added the unit was frequently engaged in active fighting. He stressed that the unit was “not a group of mercenaries” but an official part of the Ukrainian armed forces and therefore, if captured, the soldiers should be treated under international humanitarian law.    The unit’s badge Photograph: Handout   The unit’s official badge is displayed on Volobuyev’s uniform. The white and blue flag is used by Russian anti-war protesters both inside and outside the country. It mimics the design of the Russian flag but with the red band changed to white to remove the association with “blood and violence”, Volobuyev said. While Volobuyev’s main motivation for picking up arms was to defend Ukraine, which he described as his “only motherland”, he said most of the Russians in the legion were seeking regime change in Moscow. “From what I have already seen, it is a group of highly motivated Russians who believe that defeating Russia now is the only way to create a democratic, civilised country,” he said. Artyom (not his real name), another member of the unit,  said he joined “because it was the only chance to get rid of this regime” and had been engaged in opposition politics in Russia before leaving the country in 2020. He said he moved to Ukraine shortly before the war, sensing an imminent Russian attack. “I love my motherland,” he said. “I wish it didn’t have to come to this, but we have to end this system. I hope I can return home after the war.” Some Russians have found other ways to contribute to Ukraine’s military efforts.    Maxim Motin who is making body armour for the Ukrainian military. Photograph: Handout   Soon after the war broke out, Maxim Motin, a former local opposition deputy in Moscow who has lived in Kyiv for the last four years, quickly set up several production lines to make body armour vests and helmets for the Ukrainian army. “Especially in the early days of the war, there was a big demand for body armour. We have made over 700 vests so far and many helmets,” Motin said in a phone interview from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where he coordinates production of the army gear. For years, Motin said he wanted to change Russia from the inside via politics, but he said he was forced to eventually flee the country in 2018 after threats from the Russian security services. Now, he said, he didn’t think twice about supplying military gear to help the Ukrainian army in its fight against his homeland. Motin said the authorities in Moscow had recently opened two criminal cases against him for his support of Ukraine, including the serious charge of terrorist financing. “I don’t associate myself at all with the bloody regime in Russia and everyone who supports the war,” Motin said. “I believe Russia needs to lose, on the battleground.”"

It is simply terrifying. The battle for the Donbas will without doubt be remembered in military history as one of the most violent battles in Europe,” he said in an address to the nation late on Monday.   All three bridges to the embattled eastern city of Sievierodonetsk have been destroyed, according to the governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai. In a video update, Haidai said Russia had not “completely captured” the city and “a part of the city” was under Ukrainian control. Russian artillery was hitting an industrial zone where 500 civilians were sheltering in the eastern Ukrainian city, Haidai added. Ukrainian troops in the city must “surrender or die”, a Russian-backed separatist leader in the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk warned.   Russia’s ministry of defence has again claimed today that surrendering Ukrainian forces in the Donbas have been fired on by their own side, in a move it described as “the Kyiv nationalist regime is trying to stop the retreat and surrender of its units by punitive actions of detachments”. The claims have not been independently verified.   The deputy head of the Russian-imposed military-civilian administration of the occupied Kherson region in Ukraine, Kirill Stremousov, has said it will remain forever Russian.   Ukrainian authorities said they discovered a new mass grave of civilians near Bucha in the Kyiv region. Investigators exhumed seven bodies from makeshift graves in a forest outside the village of Vorzel, less than 10km from Bucha, the scene of previous alleged Russian atrocities. Kyiv region’s police chief, Andriy Nyebytov, said: “This is another sadistic crime of the Russian army.” One man, he said, “has two injuries. He was shot in the knee with a gun. The second shot was into his temple.”   The UK’s ministry of defence has issued its daily assessment of the situation on the ground in Ukraine, suggesting “Russia’s operational main effort remains the assault against the Sievierodonetsk pocket in the Donbas and its Western Group of forces have likely made small advances in the Kharkiv sector for the first time in several weeks.”   The UK’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has refused to be drawn on whether she would negotiate directly with the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic over the situation of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner. The two British men have been sentenced to death in eastern Ukraine by what Truss called a “sham trial”.   Pope Francis has said Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine was “perhaps somehow provoked” as he recalled a conversation in the run-up to the war in which he was warned that Nato was “barking at the gates of Russia”. In an interview with the Jesuit magazine La Civiltà Cattolica, conducted last month and published on Tuesday, the pontiff condemned the “ferocity and cruelty of the Russian troops” while warning against what he said was a fairytale perception of the conflict as good versus evil.   Ukraine has called on the west to supply 300 rocket launchers, 500 tanks and 1,000 howitzers before a key meeting on Wednesday. The request was made publicly by Mykhailo Podolyak, a key presidential adviser, amid concern in some quarters it is pushing its demands for Nato-standard weapons to the limit.   Zelenskiy accused the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, of being too concerned about the repercussions his support for Ukraine would have for Berlin’s ties with Moscow. “We need from Chancellor Scholz the certainty that Germany supports Ukraine,” he said in an interview with German public broadcaster ZDF. “He and his government must decide: there can’t be a trade-off between Ukraine and relations with Russia.” Local media reports have speculated that Scholz could on Thursday make his first trip to Kyiv since the start of the war.   The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boychenko, has accused “traitors” of passing on vital information to Russian forces during the bombardment of the southern port city at the beginning of the invasion. Boychenko said the destruction of the city’s critical infrastructure, including power supplies, was well-coordinated because Russia was provided with the coordinates.   About 1,200 bodies, including those found in mass graves, have not yet been identified, according to the head of the national police in Ukraine, Ihor Klymenko. Criminal proceedings had been opened over the deaths of more than 12,000 Ukrainians, Klymenko said. About 75% of the dead were men, 2% children and the rest women, he said.   Russia earned €93bn in revenue from fossil fuel exports in the first 100 days of the war, according to research by Finland’s Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea). With 61% of these exports, worth €56bn (£48bn), going to the member states of the European Union, the bloc of countries remains Russia’s largest export market.   Ukraine has lost a quarter of its arable land since the Russian invasion, notably in the south and east, deputy agriculture minister Taras Vysotskiy said. At a news conference on Monday, Vysotskiy insisted food security for the country’s population was not under immediate threat: “Crop planting this year is more than sufficient [and] the current situation of crop planting areas … does not pose a threat to Ukraine’s food security”.   The UN’s rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, described the “arbitrary arrests” of a “large number” of anti-war protesters in Russia as “worrying”. Speaking at the UN’s human rights council in Geneva, Bachelet also expressed concern about the “increase of censorship and restrictions on independent media” in Russia.   Mikhail Kasyanov, Russia’s prime minister from 2000 to 2004, has said he expects the war in Ukraine could last up to two years. Kasyanov, who championed close ties with the west while prime minister, said he felt that Vladimir Putin was already not thinking properly and that he was convinced Russia could return to a democratic path.   More than 15,000 millionaires are expected to flee Russia this year, as wealthy citizens turn their back on Putin’s regime, according to an analysis of migration data by London-based firm Henley & Partners.   The Wikimedia Foundation, which owns Wikipedia, has filed an appeal against a Moscow court decision demanding that it remove information related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The foundation arguing that people have a right to know the facts of the war and that removing information is a violation of human rights. "

“All bridges are destroyed,” Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said in a video address on Monday evening, adding that Russia had not “completely captured” Sievierodonetsk and “a part of the city” was under Ukrainian control.
Earlier in the day, Haidai said Russians were continuing to storm the embattled city and, “having a significant advantage in artillery”, had pushed back Ukrainian soldiers. “The Russians are destroying quarter after quarter,” he said, adding that the Russian army had been “partially successful at night” and controlled 70% of the city.
The destruction by Russian forces of the remaining two bridges over the Siverskyi Donets River over the last two days leaves stranded civilians with no escape west to the neighbouring city of Lysychansk, which is also being shelled but remains in Ukrainian hands.
“Evacuation and transport of human cargo is now impossible,” Haidai said.

Addressing the nation in his nightly video address, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the country was “dealing with absolute evil”.
“The human cost of this battle is very high for us,” he added. “It is simply terrifying.” 
There are fears that a scenario similar to the one seen in the southern port city of Mariupol, where hundreds of people were trapped for weeks in the Azovstal steelworks, could play out in Sievierodonetsk’s Azot chemical plant, where Haidai said 500 civilians were sheltering, 40 of them children.
Haidai said the Ukrainian side was negotiating the evacuation of civilians from Azot with Moscow but so far had failed to reach an agreement. “We are trying to agree, with the help of [Ukrainian deputy prime minister] Irina Vereshchuk, to organise a corridor. So far it has been unsuccessful,” the official said. “Azot’s shelters are not as strong as in Mariupol’s Azovstal, so we need to take people out with security guarantees.”
Sievierodonetsk has become the focal point of Moscow’s efforts to advance in eastern Ukraine, where Russia wants to capture the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, which are collectively known as Donbas, after its failure to quickly seize Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, at the beginning of the war.
Ukrainian troops were fighting street by street to hold on to the city, with both Ukrainian and Russian forces suffering heavy losses, Roman Vlasenko, head of the Sievierodonetsk district administration, told local TV. “Our boys are holding on but the conditions are tough,” he said. Vlasenko said the city had been without communications and normal services for a month.

The militia head of the self-proclaimed pro-Russian republic in Donetsk, Eduard Basurin, warned Ukrainian troops in Sievierodonetsk they should “surrender or die”.







The UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence report that river crossing operations were likely to be among the most important determining factors in the course of the war.
The key, 90km-long central sector of Russia’s frontline in Donbas lies to the west of the Siverskyi Donets River and in order to achieve success in the current operational phase of its offensive, Russia was “either going to have to complete ambitious flanking actions or conduct assault river crossings”, the MoD said.
Last month Russia incurred heavy losses during multiple attempts to cross the river. In one attempt, Russia is believed to have lost more than 80 vehicles as a result of Ukrainian fire, according to open source estimates.
But given Russia’s military superiority in the Donbas, military observers said Moscow is likely to make further gains in the area, and Ukrainian officials have been making daily appeals to their western partners to send Kyiv heavier weapons.
“Being straightforward – to end the war we need heavy weapons parity: 1,000 howitzers caliber 155 mm; 300 MLRS; 500 tanks; 2,000 armoured vehicles; 1,000 drones … We are waiting for a decision,” Mykhailo Podolyak, a political adviser to Zelenskiy, wrote on Twitter.
Ukraine’s commander in chief, Valeriy Zaluzhny, said during a meeting with his American counterpart, Mark Milley, late on Monday that Russian forces had a 10-fold advantage in firepower.
Also on Monday, the Ukrainian authorities uncovered another mass grave site in a forest near Bucha containing the bodies of seven civilian men. “Seven civilians were tortured by the Russians and brutally executed with bullets in the head,” the Kyiv region police chief, Andrei Nebitov, wrote on his Facebook page.
“Multiple victims had their hands tied and their knees shot. We are working to identify the deceased,” Nebitov added.
Ukraine’s national police said earlier in the day that up to 1,200 bodies of Ukrainians, including those found in mass graves, had not yet been identified.
The discovery of the mass grave came as Amnesty International released a report accusing Russia of war crimes in Ukraine, saying attacks – many using banned cluster bombs – on Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv had killed hundreds of civilians.
“The repeated bombardments of residential neighbourhoods in Kharkiv are indiscriminate attacks which killed and injured hundreds of civilians, and as such constitute war crimes,” the rights group said in a report entitled Anyone can die at any time.

Serhiy Haidai said a bridge out of the city had been blown up, as fears grow for those who have not yet managed to leave. Ukrainian troops in Sievierodonetsk must “surrender or die”, a Russian-backed separatist leader in the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk said.   Russian forces have taken most of Sievierodonetsk, where fierce street fighting continues after a fire broke out at the Azot chemical plant, where hundreds of civilians are sheltering. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his nightly video address that Russia’s military was trying to deploy reserve forces to the Donbas region. Ukrainian troops reportedly remain in control of an industrial area.   Russia’s defence ministry said its missiles destroyed a large quantity of weapons and military equipment in the Donbas, including some sent from the US and Europe. It said high-precision air-based missiles struck near the Udachne railway station, hitting equipment that had been delivered to Ukrainian forces. It has not been possible to independently verify this claim.   Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, has said Russia is using “weapons of mass destruction” in Ukraine. Both sides are using “increasingly heavy” weapons, Niinistö said, including, in Russia’s case, thermobaric bombs. Amnesty International accused Russia of war crimes in Ukraine, saying attacks on Kharkiv – many using banned cluster bombs – had killed hundreds of civilians.   About 1,200 bodies, some found in mass graves, have not yet been identified, according to the head of the national police in Ukraine, Ihor Klymenko. Criminal proceedings have been opened over the deaths of more than 12,000 Ukrainians, Klymenko said. About 75% of the dead were men, 23% were women and 2% were children, he said.   Russia earned €93bn in revenue from fossil fuel exports in the first 100 days of the war, according to research by Finland’s Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea). With 61% of these exports – worth €56bn (£48bn) – going to the member states of the EU, the bloc remains Russia’s largest export market.   The UN’s rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, described what she called the arbitrary arrests of a large number of anti-war protesters in Russia as worrying. Speaking at the UN’s human rights council in Geneva, Bachelet also expressed concern about the “increase of censorship and restrictions on independent media” in Russia.   Mikhail Kasyanov, Russia’s prime minister from 2000 to 2004, has said he expects the war in Ukraine to last up to two years. Kasyanov, who championed close ties with the west while prime minister, said he felt that Vladimir Putin was already not thinking properly, and he was convinced Russia could return to a democratic path.   River crossing operations are likely to be among the most important determining factors in the course of the war over the coming months, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest report. Ukrainian forces have often managed to demolish bridges before they withdraw from territory, while Russia has struggled to put in place the complex coordination necessary to conduct successful, large-scale river crossings under fire, the report added.   A former British soldier has died fighting Russian forces in Sievierodonetsk. The British Foreign Office confirmed that Jordan Gatley was shot and killed in Ukraine. He left the British army in March “to continue his career as a soldier in other areas” and had been helping Ukrainian troops defend their country against Russia, his father, Dean, wrote in a statement posted on Facebook.

About 15% of Russians with more than $1m (£820,000) in ready assets are expected to have emigrated to other countries by the end of 2022, according to projects based on migration data by Henley & Partners, a London-based firm that acts as matchmaker between the super-rich and countries selling their citizenships. “Russia [is] haemorrhaging millionaires,” said Andrew Amoils, the head of research at New World Wealth, which compiled the data for Henley. “Affluent individuals have been emigrating from Russia in steadily rising numbers every year over the past decade, an early warning sign of the current problems the country is facing. Historically, major country collapses have usually been preceded by an acceleration in emigration of wealthy people, who are often the first to leave as they have the means to do so.” Ukraine is projected to suffer the greatest loss of high net worth individuals (HNWIs) as a proportion of its population, with 2,800 millionaires (or 42% of all HNWIs in Ukraine) expected to have left the country by the end of the year. The world’s wealthy have traditionally relocated to the US and the UK but Henley said the United Arab Emirates is expected to overtake them as the No 1 destination for millionaire emigrants. “UK has lost its wealth hub crown, and the US is fading fast as a magnet for the world’s wealthy, with the UAE expected to overtake it by attracting the largest net inflows of millionaires globally in 2022,” Henley said in its report, which is based on “systematically tracking international private wealth migration trends”. About 4,000 HNWIs are expected to have moved to the UAE by the end of the year, ahead of Australia, which is expected to attract about 3,500, Singapore (2,800) and Israel (2,500). Large numbers of millionaires are also expected to move to “the three Ms”: Malta, Mauritius and Monaco. “Malta has been one of Europe’s great success stories of the past decade, not just in terms of millionaire migration but also in terms of overall wealth growth,” Amoils said. “It is currently one of the world’s fastest-growing markets, with US dollar wealth growth of 87% between 2011 and 2021. Its citizenship by naturalisation process has brought substantial new wealth to the island nation and has been credited with propelling Malta’s strong growth in multiple sectors including financial services, IT and real estate. Approximately 300 millionaires are expected to move to Malta in 2022.” The Guardian reported last year that many wealthy people buying “golden passports” to Malta (and thereby the EU) often planned to spend little time in the country. At the time, Henley said it was “proud of the service that it has provided to Malta and its people”. The Indian Ocean island nation Mauritius is described by Henley as a “wealth magnet” because of the creation of an international financial centre offering significant tax breaks. The country has no capital gains tax, no inheritance tax, and maximum tax rate of 3% of global companies.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  According to the Africa Wealth Report 2022, Mauritius is now home to 4,800 HNWIs compared with 2,700 a decade ago. Approximately 150 millionaires are expected to move to Mauritius in 2022, mainly from South Africa and Europe. Monaco has long attracted the world’s super-rich because it does not charge income tax, capital gains tax or property tax. Just under seven in 10 people living in Monaco are dollar millionaires. The UK’s HNWI population is expected to decline by 1,500, taking the number of people with more than $1m in ready assets to 738,000. There are currently just over 15 million HNWIs in the world."
24,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/13/ukraine-asks-the-west-for-huge-rise-in-heavy-artillery-supply,2022-06-13T16:15:17Z,Ukraine asks the west for huge rise in heavy artillery supply,"Ukraine has called on the west to supply 300 rocket launchers, 500 tanks and 1,000 howitzers before a key meeting on Wednesday amid concern in some quarters it is pushing its demands for Nato-standard weapons to the limit. The maximalist request was made publicly by Mykhailo Podolyak, a key presidential adviser, on Twitter on Monday where he argued that Ukraine needed “heavy weapons parity” to defeat Russia and end the war. That would require, he said, 300 of the multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) – vastly more than seven or so committed thus far by the US and UK – and greater than the 60 or more that other advisers have previously said would meet its needs. Podolyak’s full list also included “1,000 howitzers” of the Nato 155mm standard, several times more than what has been dispatched so far. The US, the leading arms supplier, had delivered 109 by the end of May. A special meeting of defence ministers takes place on Wednesday in Brussels, which will be chaired by Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, to discuss future weapons donations, the third such meeting since the war began. Ben Wallace, his UK counterpart, is among those scheduled to attend. It comes at a time when Ukraine’s military is struggling to resist an intense Russian artillery-led assault on its eastern Donbas region and losing, on some days, 200 soldiers killed in action in the heaviest fighting in Europe since the end of the second world war. Amid such pressure, the meeting has acquired a particular significance in Kyiv, which wants substantial and rapid munition deliveries so that it can try to force the Russian invaders from its territory before the weather turns. Some experts said that Podolyak’s tweet was best interpreted as a negotiating gambit. But there are also questions whether such overt lobbying could be counterproductive, particularly with countries such as Germany, which has repeatedly hesitated over weapons supply and been slower than the US and UK in delivering to Ukraine what it publicly promised. German weapons committed at the end of April include howitzers and Gepard mobile artillery, but the artillery is due to arrive at the end of this month and the specialist armoured vehicles in July, to the frustration of Kyiv. The other demands made by Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, were “500 tanks; 2,000 armoured vehicles; 1,000 drones” – all significant numbers of heavy weaponry that would dramatically alter the military balance and, in some cases, run down western supplies considerably. Three hundred MLRS would roughly amount to half the US existing stock. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) the US army has 363 Himars truck rocket artillery and 225 M270 tracked launchers, and the US Marines have a further 47. The UK has 35 of its version of the M270s. Last week, another Ukrainian presidential adviser, the military analyst Oleksiy Arestovych, said Kyiv would need 60 of the rocket launchers to stop the Russian invaders “dead in their tracks” – and some believe that Ukraine’s real demand is for 100, well in excess of the current level of western offers. A gift of 1,000 howitzers would roughly match the US arsenal. IISS figures, compiled before the donation of 109, show that the US army has 518 M777 towed howitzers of the type already supplied and the US Marines a further 481. However, there are many more than 500 tanks available to western powers. The US army alone has an estimated 2,645 Abrams tanks and somewhere around 3,450 more in storage, according to the IISS’s annual review of military stocks. Both before and at the beginning of the war western countries said they would only supply “defensive weapons” to Ukraine to either deter an invasion or halt an advance. Russia, however, has succeeded in occupying a significant portion of territory in the east and the south, prompting calls for its forces to be pushed out."

It’s time to bury it | Nick Dearden","When delegates arrive in Geneva today for the long delayed World Trade Organization (WTO) summit, they will find an institution in the middle of an existential crisis. For 18 long months, the WTO has been debating a moderate proposal from South Africa and India which would have allowed countries to temporarily override the property rights of pharmaceutical corporations so they could produce patented Covid-19 vaccines. Opposition by Britain, Switzerland and other European countries has kept it from progressing. Even a global pandemic, it seems, isn’t sufficient cause to prompt a temporary rethink of the WTO’s pro-business approach. Just as bad, the WTO cannot agree a common approach to the food crisis fast spreading across the globe, or the invasion of one of its members by another, or, most serious of all, the climate catastrophe facing humanity. All it can do is fall back on the mantra of more free trade. Unable to break with a “market knows best” ideology which is actively exacerbating the world’s problems, the WTO is now a failed institution. It’s time to bury it. The WTO’s crisis is part and parcel of the greater crisis of free-market globalisation as a whole. It was formed in the mid-1990s, the high point of free-market capitalism, when the answer to every problem was more markets, more private sector, less government red tape. There was, we were told, simply no alternative. Summing up the feeling a few years later, Tony Blair told the Labour party conference, “I hear people say we have to stop and debate globalisation. You might as well debate whether autumn should follow summer.” But it hadn’t always been that way. Before the WTO, there had been a much looser set of international trade rules created at the end of the second world war. This system was also based on the idea that trade was a good thing and high tariffs were usually a bad idea. But to the extent that free-trade policies didn’t achieve those goals, countries had a fair bit of freedom to ignore them. There was no enforcement mechanism, and plenty of room for developing countries, in particular, to design policies they thought worked best for their own development. The WTO changed all that. Radical free trade became an end in itself. WTO treaties laid the basis for a set of hard global economic rules, embedded in international law. At their core, they removed power from the state to interfere with the supposed rights of big business and big finance, undermining the ability of governments to protect their farmers and infant industries, and to regulate big finance and big business. Unlike its predecessor, the WTO incorporated a dispute system with real teeth which made the whole system enforceable. We can see the results all around us. Far from creating a global version of a farmers’ market, it has encouraged the growth of agricultural monopolies practising intensive farming, which dominate our food system at huge cost to the environment. It has encouraged manufacturers to “offshore” production to wherever labour is cheapest and regulations are lowest, creating political resentment and fuelling rightwing populism in the west. It has created staggeringly complex and vulnerable supply chains, best symbolised by an oversized container ship becoming stuck in the Suez canal and bringing global trade to a halt. And it has allowed a handful of multinational corporations to dictate the world’s ability to produce the vaccines needed to end a global pandemic, because they owned the – often publicly funded – research behind those medicines. None of this should surprise us. The great theorist of capitalism, Karl Polanyi, warned us 75 years ago that trying to turn the whole world into a gigantic marketplace would end in the “demolition of society”. The fascism of the 1930s was the nightmare reaction that Polanyi lived through, but we see our own version of that social breakdown today. This system cannot cope well with crisis. But crises are now a defining feature of our era. Which is why many governments, including Joe Biden’s administration in the US, are moving gradually away from the WTO’s free-trade system. It’s a process initiated, perhaps unwittingly, by Donald Trump. Seeing which way the wind was blowing, Biden has continued in this direction – with less bullying and bluster – eschewing free trade deals and standing up to the corporate monopolies that globalisation has created.   Related: The WTO faces a make or break week over vaccines | Larry Elliott   This is to be welcomed. But we’ll need to go further and faster if we don’t want to replace a global free-market system with one of nationalist competition in which the strongest player wins. We need a fundamentally different global trade system, which helps rather than hinders government action in protecting their people and the planet. The WTO cannot play that role. It is not reformable, as the Covid waiver debacle proves. Developing states have always been especially constrained by this system. If we want change, these countries will have to work together to begin creating change on the ground: building up their own industries, supporting their small farmers, regulating and taxing big business and big finance, and using the proceeds to build up public services to remove people’s basic needs from the market. There are hopeful signs – from South Africa’s creation of “open source” medical research to Indian farmers successfully refusing to be further liberalised. The globalisation project cut short the developing world’s experiment with economic decolonisation. It’s time to return to it. Any attempt by the US and Europe to punish these countries will have to be met with resistance, there and here. From this point, we can begin rebuilding an international architecture for actual fair and free trade. None of the problems we face will be solved by the WTO’s “market knows best” proposals, which will only accelerate social and environmental breakdown. It would be no loss to the vast majority of the world if this WTO summit was the last. It’s long past time for something else.  Nick Dearden is director of Global Justice Now "

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show EU goods exports rose for the third consecutive month to £16.4bn in April, the highest monthly level in current prices since comparable records began in 1997. Reflecting the impact of the war in Ukraine as EU nations seek to diversify energy supplies away from Russia, the data suggests the UK is acting as a hub for liquified natural gas (LNG) imports from the rest of the world before pumping it through pipelines to the continent.   Related: UK petrol price rises could grind to a halt this week, says AA   UK fuel exports rose by £500m on the month, driven by gas and crude oil to the Netherlands and Ireland, in a sign of heightened demand on the continent to refill gas storage sites in the run-up to winter. Much of the rise in total goods exports was driven by the rising value of fuel prices rather than volumes of other products. After adjusting for inflation, goods exports were the highest since December 2020, the last month before the Brexit transition ended. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has contributed to a dramatic rise in global energy prices amid concern over the security of supply, fuelling the highest rates of inflation for decades in several countries including the UK. EU nations reliant on Russia for much of their energy have sought alternative supplies while reducing imports in response to the war. Analysts said EU countries such as Germany lacked LNG terminal facilities. Jack Sirett, the head of dealing at Ebury, a financial services firm, said: “The UK is a key global importer of the fuel which it then exports to Europe via pipeline, particularly given small storage capability in the UK.” The UK is home to three of the largest terminals in Europe for converting LNG back into gas, two at Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire and the other at the Isle of Grain in north Kent. Imports to these sites have risen sharply from the US and Qatar as western governments move to reduce their reliance on Russian supplies.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  The ONS said UK exports to Russia fell to the lowest monthly value since January 1999, while monthly imports fell to the lowest since March 2004. Although the UK has among the highest LNG terminal capacities in Europe, it has among the smallest storage facilities to build stockpiles in the run-up to winter. The UK’s biggest gas storage plant, the Rough facility in the North Sea, was closed in 2017 after the government refused to subsidise maintenance and upgrades needed to keep it open. HSBC estimates Europe’s four biggest storage holders – Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and France – have capacity equivalent to more than a quarter of annual consumption, while the UK has only 2% of annual demand. This makes the UK more dependent on domestic production, pipeline and LNG imports."

Neither of these commands quite the same excitement in 2022. This was Vertov’s first sound film, celebrating the role played by the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine and its mineral and agricultural riches in Joseph Stalin’s five-year plan, and nothing could have been less conventionally “symphonic”: a piercing, clanging, screeching sound-collage, mixing crowds, shouts, boots and industrial machinery as well as ordinary music and speech. Religion is swept away by Communist party orthodoxy. The pious, icon-kissing elderly people of Donetsk are shown with trenchant, irreverent irony and Brechtian alienation: they are surrounded by tramps, drunks and crowds of younger people they don’t understand; their streetscapes are tipped into weird Dutch angles and confusion. The churches of Donetsk have their steeples torn down and the buildings turned into social clubs for the workers. A vast explosion of energy is being released, and it is channelled into something overwhelmingly important: the Stakhanovite overproduction of coal (and wheat) to exceed the five-year plan. An eerie proto-TV screen announces to a secular congregation of party faithful that there is a “shortage” for which colossal overcompensation is necessary.    Enthusiasm, with its bold cuts and POV shifts and uproarious sound cues, fetishises and eroticises the revolutionary upheaval that makes it all possible: the smashing up of religious loyalties, and the tearing up of the ground to get the coal. This is industrial futurism of the most sensual and hysterical kind: that initial detonation of revolutionary fervour, scattering numberless shards of image and sound. It is here that Vertov’s own enthusiasm is at its most vital, although it should also be said that once he begins to concentrate on the business of coal and steel itself, the film becomes less experimental. This is something to be compared with Fritz Lang’s Metropolis or Leni Riefenstahl’s Olympia; there is an occult passion to it. • Enthusiasm is available on 16 June on Klassiki."

Everything is different when you do it in person,” the celebrated Russian stage and screen director said in an interview an hour before the first performance of Der Freischütz. For Serebrennikov, one of Russia’s most prominent cultural figures whose stage work has been produced across Europe, it was the first time in more than four years he had been able to attend the premiere of an opera that he had directed. Beginning in August 2017, Serebrennikov spent nearly two years under house arrest in Moscow and was later convicted of embezzling 133m rubles (about £1.7m) in a case that many have called politically motivated and part of a wider crackdown on artistic freedom. The high-profile court case resulted in a suspended sentence for the director in June 2020 and a one-and-a-half-year travel ban. Despite initially being restricted to his flat, Serebrennikov continued to work, using his defence team to smuggle instructions to theatres abroad when, at first, he wasn’t allowed to use the internet and later overseeing rehearsals through his screen. “That digital way of work was interesting at times. You sit somewhere far away, giving instructions to people on monitors, and they listen to you fearfully, without opposing too much,” Serebrennikov said, wearing lightly tinted sunglasses and a baseball cap. “In person, it’s more interesting but actually more difficult.”    Serebrennikov has turned Der Freischütz into a satire of the harsh realities of the modern opera industry. Photograph: Bart Grietens/Dutch National Opera   But the director’s buzz about his upcoming opera quickly faded as his attention turned to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which passed the 100-day mark last week. “Overall, of course, I’m in a very worried, gloomy mood,” he said. Despite frequent run-ins with the authorities, the director never fled Russia. But after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Serebrennikov decided to leave for Berlin at the end of March. He has since become a vocal critic of the war. “How can I not get enraged over what happens when Ukrainians are dying because of the Russian bombs? When cities get wiped off the map? When civilians get killed?. How the hell can one not speak out. How? How can I call this murder a special military operation?”    Serebrennikov looking out from a defendants’ cage during a hearing at Moscow’s Basmanny district court in August 2017. Photograph: Vasily Maximov/AFP/Getty Images   Mentally, he said, he had prepared himself for not going back any time soon. “I have proclaimed ‘fuck the war’ so many times now. We both know that is a criminal offence,” he said, referring to new draconian laws that have criminalised anti-war dissent. His first work stop in Europe was Cannes, where he premiered Tchaikovsky’s Wife. The film focuses on Antonina Miliukova, the wife of Russia’s most famous composer, as she descends into delirium after realising her husband is gay, a mostly taboo subject in Russia. Serebrennikov does not expect the film to be screened in Russia in the foreseeable future. “They, those in power, dislike everything about this film. The director is wrong, the way Tchaikovsky is portrayed is wrong,” he said. Despite receiving a standing ovation in Cannes, not everyone was happy to see him invited to the festival, with some members of the Ukrainian film industry calling for a total boycott of Russian films. Serebrennikov said he “understood” why people were demanding a boycott but disagreed with the idea. “Should we shoot ourselves in the leg out of solidarity? What is the benefit of that?  “Yes, now is not the time for pieces about Russian dolls, balalaikas, folk dancing. But there should always be space for clever, intricate, honest Russian culture and human stories. We don’t do any propaganda, anything praising the imperial ambitions of the government, all that shit.”    Photocall for Tchaikovsky’s Wife in Cannes in May. From left: Ilya Stewart, Odin Biron, Alena Mikhailova and Kirill Serebrennikov. Photograph: Earl Gibson III/Rex/Shutterstock   Serebrennikov said calls to boycott Dostoevsky, Chekhov and Tchaikovsky would only play into the Kremlin’s narrative, pointing to recent statements made by Putin, who has accused the west of “cancelling” Russian culture. But it was not just the director’s presence that raised some eyebrows in France. At one press conference in Cannes, Serebrennikov called for the lifting of western sanctions on Roman Abramovich, one of the investors behind his latest film. Asked about his public defence of a man considered by many to be an enabler of Putin’s regime, Serebrennikov said he was merely repeating the words of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who in March asked the US president, Joe Biden, to hold off on imposing sanctions on the former Chelsea owner because the Ukrainians felt he might be useful in their talks with the Russians. When pressed on the issue again, Serebrennikov said it would have been “dishonest” for him to stay quiet. “It was important for me to speak out. Abramovich has helped Russian contemporary culture a lot. He literally helped Russian artists survive,” he said, revealing that the oligarch paid for the medical treatment of the Oscar-nominated director Andrey Zvyagintsev in Germany. Zvyagintsev spent weeks in a medically induced coma last year after contracting coronavirus. Serebrennikov’s staunch defence of Abramovich shows some of the ways in which the very rich and powerful have sought to navigate Putin’s Russia, becoming both patrons of critical art and financial backers of the Kremlin regime.

Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images   For years, Serebrennikov and his Gogol Center, a backwater theatre that he turned into Moscow’s most vibrant cultural institution, were also forced to turn to government financing to continue operating. But Serebrennikov swiftly rejects any suggestion he ever profited from or compromised with the authorities, pointing to the years of persecution he and the Gogol Center have faced. “We didn’t receive grants, we received problems. We received criminal cases and investigations. We were on every single blacklist,” he said. “They have been wanting to shut down Gogol Center for years. With the war, I am worried they finally will. This war is a tragedy for Ukraine and a suicide for modern, open Russia.” Seeing Serebrennikov rage about the war, it was easy to forget the director was in Amsterdam for the premiere of his version of Der Freischütz. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the avant garde director turned the classic German opera by Carl Maria von Weber into a daring satire of the harsh realities of the modern opera industry, featuring music by Tom Waits. He admitted it was sometimes hard to focus on directing the opera as the war continued. “I was doing it somewhat heavy-heartedly because I can’t isolate myself from what is going on outside. But I hope it turned out to be a funny, entertaining piece,” he said, as he excused himself and departed backstage. Three and a half hours later, Serebrennikov emerged at the curtain call to a thunderous standing ovation. It was clear that, in Amsterdam, his talents were still very much in demand."

Jordan Gatley left the British army in March “to continue his career as a soldier in other areas” and had been helping Ukrainian troops defend their country against Russia, his father Dean wrote in a statement posted on Facebook on Saturday. “Yesterday [10/06/22] we received the devastating news that our son, Jordan, has been shot and killed in the city of Sievierodonetsk, Ukraine … He loved his job and we are so proud of him. He truly was a hero and will forever be in our hearts,” the statement said. Gatley died in the battle for the key strategic city in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where fighting has been intense in recent days. He is thought to be the second Briton to have been killed during the war in Ukraine. Tributes were paid in April to Scott Sibley, a British military veteran believed to have died fighting Russian troops. The Gatley family statement said: “We have had several messages from his team out there telling us of his wealth of knowledge, his skills as a soldier and his love of his job. “His team say they all loved him, as did we, and he made a massive difference to many people’s lives, not only soldiering, but also by training the Ukrainian forces. “Jordan and his team were so proud of the work they were doing and he often told me that the missions they were going on were dangerous, but necessary.”    Jordan Gatley (left) with his father Dean. Photograph: Facebook   A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Ukraine.” Gatley, who it is understood had served as a rifleman with the Edinburgh-based third battalion of the Rifles, was also praised by Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Podolyak said the Briton will always be remembered for his contribution. Alongside a picture of the soldier standing in uniform with his father, Podolyak wrote: “It takes a lot of courage to leave home and go thousand miles to defend what you believe in. Just because the heart says so. Because you can’t stand the evil. “Jordan Gatley was a true hero. We will always remember his contribution to the protection of Ukraine and the free world.” Kyiv has acknowledged over the last week that it is taking heavy losses in Russia’s assault in the east. Thousands of foreigners are believed to have entered Ukraine after Zelenskiy announced the establishment of an international legion of volunteers from abroad in the early days of Russia’s invasion.  A significant number are thought to be UK citizens, despite the British armed forces urging Britons not to go to the country. Two British men and a Moroccan national captured while fighting with the Ukrainian army in Mariupol were sentenced to death by pro-Russia officials in what was described as a “disgusting Soviet-era show trial”. Russian state media has portrayed them as mercenaries, and the court convicted them of being as much despite evidence that all three men were serving in the Ukrainian marines and so should be protected by the Geneva conventions on prisoners of war. Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic where the three foreigners were tried, said on Sunday that no mercy should be shown. The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, called the judgment a “sham” with “absolutely no legitimacy.” In a separate case, Russia said the former Royal Marine Ben Grant had helped to kill a Chechen brigade commander in Ukraine after footage emerged of the British national fighting in the country.

He previously told British media that he was part of a unit of 15 British and US volunteers who had been preparing an assault on Russian targets in the Kharkiv area. "

The governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said in an interview with local television that the Azot chemical plant remained under Ukrainian control, adding that fighting was under way on Sunday on the “outskirts of the city, in the streets directly near the plant”. Russian troops had also blown up a bridge over the Siverskyi Donets River that was a possible evacuation route from Sievierodonetsk to Lysychansk, where artillery fire on Sunday killed one woman and destroyed four houses, Haidai said. Sievierodonetsk has become the focal point of Moscow’s efforts to advance in eastern Ukraine with Russian offensives shifting their focus on to capturing the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, collectively known as the Donbas, after their failure to quickly seize Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. Capturing Sievierodonetsk and its twin city of Lysychansk would give Russia full control over Luhansk. During his nightly address on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that “fierce street fights continue in Sievierodonetsk”, adding that the Donbas region was “holding up”. “Remember how in Russia, at the beginning of May, they hoped to seize all of the Donbas?” the president said. “It’s already the 108th day of the war, already June. Donbas is holding on.” Haidai on Sunday reiterated that Ukraine remains in control of the Azot plant, the largest chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk, where hundreds of civilians are sheltering. The Ukrainian official also dismissed as “lies” claims made by Russian-backed separatists that 300 to 400 Ukrainian fighters were trapped in the plant which was under a “blockade”. “Russia is ​​throwing all its forces in order to capture this city and control it in full, but has not succeeded so far,” Haidai added. Ukrainian officials previously rejected potential comparisons between the situation in Azot and the months-long siege of the Azov steel mill in the port city of Mariupol, where civilians and Ukrainian fighters were holed up for weeks under Russian attack. The fighting is among the toughest Ukraine has faced since Russia’s invasion on 24 February. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update that Moscow was using its superiority in force ratio and artillery to gradually seize territory in and around Sievierodonetsk, adding that Russia has probably started preparing to deploy the third battalion from some combat formations to increase its offensive capacity. “Deploying all three of their battalions simultaneously will likely reduce formations’ longer-term capacity to regenerate combat power after operations,” the intelligence update added. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned over the last week that their military was quickly running out of ammunition and losing against Russia on the frontlines, calling on its western partners to step up their supply of heavy weapons. Ukrainian officials have also admitted that its casualties are running at a rate of somewhere between 600 and 1,000 a day. Pointing to Russia’s military superiority in Sievierodonetsk, Haidai said: “The enemy’s artillery is simply dismantling – floor-by-floor – the houses used by our troops as shelters. “So, when we push the enemy out of one street, they start using their tanks and artillery to destroy the area house-by-house,.” An unnamed senior US defence official told the Washington Post at the weekend that Russia is likely to seize control of the entire Luhansk region within a few weeks as Ukraine’s supplies of ammunition decline. Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday its cruise missiles had destroyed a large depot containing US and European weapons in Ternopil in western Ukraine, a claim disputed by Ukrainian officials who said no weapons were stored there. The Ternopil region governor said that a rocket attack on the city of Chortkiv launched by Russia from the Black Sea had partially destroyed a military facility as well as a number of residential buildings, injuring 22 people, including seven women and a 12-year-old. The Guardian could not independently confirm either of the differing accounts. The strike was a rare attack in the west of the country, and air raid sirens were also heard in the city of Lviv, close to the Polish border. Elsewhere in the country, Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian army was gradually liberating territory further west in the Kherson region and had had some successes in Zaporizhzhia, the only large city in south-eastern Ukraine under Ukrainian control. In Moscow, his counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on Sunday called on Russians to be “united” as he congratulated his country on the occasion of its national day.

Such unity, devotion to the Motherland, is a responsibility passed on to us by our ancestors,” the Russian president said during a televised ceremony in which he pinned awards on pro-Kremlin scientific and cultural figures. Putin last week compared himself to the 18th-century Russian tsar Peter the Great, drawing a parallel between what he portrayed as their twin historic quests to win back Russian lands."

Friends and family of Saadoun have called for his freedom, telling the Guardian he was an active-duty marine and not a mercenary as claimed by Russian media and pro-Russia officials in eastern Ukraine who announced the sentence. The 21-year-old is a former aeronautics student who was well liked in Kyiv’s underground techno scene. He moved to Ukraine in 2019 to study as an engineer but joined the army to fight “injustice”, deploying to Mariupol just months before Russia invaded. Friends and family in Ukraine and Morocco are rallying under the banner #SaveBrahim to raise awareness for the soldier, whose fate is tied to the two Britons, 28-year-old Aiden Aslin, from Newark, 48-year-old Shaun Pinner, from Watford, also sentenced to death by the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk. “Basically, everyone who met Brahim, they all loved him,” said Dasha Oleynik, a friend who has known Saadoun for several years and kept in touch with him during his deployment. “Everyone who knows him is heartbroken.” Dmytro Khrabtsov, another friend, said that he met Saadoun at a party in 2019 and they had spent half the night discussing aerospace engineering. The Moroccan had come to Kyiv Polytechnic Institute because Ukrainian education was “very good for the price you pay”.    Saadoun and his friend Dmytro Khrabtsov (right). Photograph: Dmytro Khrabtsov/PA Media   He had eventually joined the armed forces, Khrabtsov said, because “he had a deep sense that injustice was being committed against Ukraine”. According to Khrabtsov, Pinner had helped Saadoun over Facebook to join the armed forces. Saadoun appeared alongside Pinner and Aslin in a show trial last week, which ended with a Russian proxy official sentencing the three men to death. While Russia may seek to trade them for its own soldiers convicted of war crimes, the threat of a firing squad or long imprisonment has horrified his friends and family in both Ukraine and Morocco. Two friends and a relative of Saadoun confirmed to the Guardian that he was a member of the Ukrainian marines and had not served as a mercenary, as alleged by Russian officials and their proxies. One close friend, Muiz Avghonzoda, told the German broadcaster DW that he had “all the copies of his documents, all those contracts signing with the armed forces of Ukraine”. He had called Saadoun “a victim of DPR [the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic] playing games, a victim of Russia, a victim of this war”. Saadoun’s friends were also concerned as media attention focused on the fate of several Britons in east Ukraine, mostly mentioning the Moroccan in passing. They say the outpouring of support that he has received since his arrest has shown how he was integrated into Ukrainian society. He is a “really good person”, said Khrabtsov. “You see by the way people in Ukraine react to his imprisonment that he has touched a lot of lives in a positive way.” Friends say that he had had few job prospects and wanted to gain military experience while going where he felt he was needed. “You could see he was never going to be working in an office; he had the mentality of an adventurer, defender. He was very perceptive, had a strong sense of justice.” Saadoun’s friends and family found out that he had been captured in a hostage interview conducted by Alexander Sladkov, an employee of Russian state television. “I can see in some moments that he is trying to choose his words wisely when he speaks in these videos,” said Oleynik. “I’m pretty sure he is held in very bad conditions. This is how it looks, but we don’t know any details.” Since then, he has not been given an opportunity to contact his family or friends. “They haven’t spoken,” said Oleynik. “It’s incredibly hard for us and of course for his family.” Saadoun had called Oleynik regularly even after he joined the military, where he had served as a driver before being deployed to Mariupol in November. On the first day of the war, as helicopters were flying toward Kyiv, Saadoun called Oleynik and told her to run to a bomb shelter as quickly as possible. “The day the war started, he was in a hotspot and he called me to tell me that he sees helicopters moving to Kyiv,” she said. “He called me to say, ‘I see those helicopters, please hide in the bomb shelter …’ It was obvious that he didn’t have much time and that he was calling from some random number, but he still took time to call.” She said she hoped bringing attention to his fate could encourage western governments to find a way to bring him home. “We’re really suffering a lot because of no contact with him,” said Oleynik. “I can see how he’s tired and exhausted. I wish he knew how much support he actually has … how many people care, how many people write about it, how many people post about it … so he has a reason to hold on, to know that he is not alone.”"

Ukraine will pay the price,"A shield deters an enemy and signifies resolve. It is also something to hide behind, in order to avoid a fight. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has been used for both purposes by US and European politicians of varying degrees of valour. But what if the shield is broken or fundamentally flawed? The western powers may be about to find out. Nato’s summit in Madrid this month is billed as its most consequential, “transformative” gathering since the cold war era. Expect much self-congratulation over how the 30-country alliance united to protect the “free world” against Russian aggression. Yet huge question marks remain. Speaking in Poland in March, Joe Biden, US president and de facto Nato boss, set the tone. He vowed to defend “every inch of Nato territory with the full force of our collective power” – while keeping out of the war. Months later, Biden remains infuriatingly vague about long-term outcomes. Ben Wallace, the UK’s defence secretary, echoed this refrain last week in Iceland. Russia’s Vladimir Putin may target Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia next, Wallace warned, because, like Ukraine, he does not view them as “real” countries. But, like Biden, Britain has no discernible plan to ensure that an independent Ukraine survives. While many allies have stepped up, important European Nato members cower behind an alliance they previously disparaged and neglected. They use it to avoid making costly national commitments to Kyiv that might anger Moscow. Daydreaming of EU strategic autonomy, France’s Emmanuel Macron prefers talk to action. Germany’s Olaf Scholz epitomises dither and delay. Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s sanctions-busting prime minister, often seems to bat for the other side.  Cynically self-serving attempts by Turkey’s troublemaker president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to sabotage Finland and Sweden’s membership applications also undermine a united front. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s inoffensive secretary general, will struggle to repair these fissures. Poland and other “frontline” states want a tougher approach, including permanent positioning of additional troops, heavy weapons and planes on Russia’s borders. In response, Nato officials promise “robust and historic” decisions. As for Ukraine, its leadership has all but abandoned hopes of membership, solemnly promised at Nato’s 2008 Bucharest summit, and has ceased calling for direct military intervention. “Of course, we will hear words of support… we are very grateful for that,” said its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. Having previously accused Nato of “doing nothing”, he does not expect concrete action in Madrid on accession or, for example, “Black Sea security”. That last remark referred to the unforgivable, ongoing US-European failure to challenge Moscow’s illegal blockade of Ukraine’s ports, which is creating global food shortages.    Nato could and should be exerting greater pressure on Russian forces, so helping persuade Putin to end his genocidal war   It’s one of many areas where Nato could and should be exerting greater pressure on Russian forces, so helping persuade Putin to end his genocidal war. Why is Nato not doing more? Taken together, all the rationales and excuses for passivity and inaction produce a picture of an alliance significantly less united, powerful and organised than its admirers pretend. Initially backing Ukraine, albeit at arm’s length, gave Nato a boost. Its stock rose from the low-point of last year’s Afghan withdrawal debacle.  But if, as expected, the war grinds on, if both sides grow desperate, if the diplomatic impasse deepens, and if the threat of wider conflict rises, Nato’s long unaddressed weaknesses and vulnerabilities will become both more obvious and more hazardous for those crouching behind its battlements. Its post-Soviet bluff may finally be called. It would be unrealistic to expect seamless political unanimity in so large an organisation. But the fact that each member has an equal say when, in terms of military capacity, they are absurdly unequal, hinders swift, bold decision-making. A Russian nuclear or chemical provocation, for example, would be likely to produce a paralysing cacophony of conflicting voices within Nato – and Putin surely knows it.  At the same time, there is huge over-reliance on the US, a military superpower without whose agreement nothing happens and behind whose might the laggards lurk, refusing to pay their way. Organisationally and militarily, too, Nato is all over the place. It has three joint command headquarters – in Italy, the Netherlands and the US. But its top general is based in Belgium. Inter-operability of different countries’ weapons systems is lacking, as are joint training exercises, arms procurement and intelligence-sharing. Nato is also increasingly overstretched, caught between a Russian threat in the Euro-Atlantic area and challenges in the Indo-Pacific from an aggressively expansionist China. Leaders from Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand are expected in Madrid. Their shared nightmare: a “no limits” totalitarian Sino-Russian global axis with echoes of the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact. Nato is due to publish its 10-yearly “strategic concept” on how to deal with all this, plus trans-national terrorism, destabilising climate change, cyber warfare and the rise of anti-democratic states. It’s a tall order.  Overdue, too, is the Biden administration’s new Asia-focused national security strategy, which had to be hastily recalibrated following the Ukraine invasion. Yet if it is to move forward effectively on these numerous fronts, Nato must also look back, admit past mistakes and accept some responsibility for the current crisis. By keeping Ukraine in membership limbo while failing to punish Putin for war crimes in Chechnya and Syria, his 2008 attack on Georgia, his annexation of Crimea and his post-2014 Donbas proxy war, complacent western leaders unwittingly paved the way for today’s catastrophe. After the Soviet collapse in 1991, Nato dropped the ball. Like football fans invading the pitch before the final whistle, they thought it was all over! But it wasn’t, and it isn’t. Right now, Putin is battering the shield, putting the west to the test. If its risk-averse approach does not change, there may soon be nowhere left to hide. Will Nato fail again?"

From a laboratory in the US state of Virginia, Daniels and his colleagues have monitored the despoiling and destruction of cultural targets since the invasion began, and have detected patterns in the crimes.  The trail of thefts focuses heavily on precious Scythian gold. These are high-worth ancient filigree pieces, often depicting animals. They were produced by tribes of the area of central Asia and eastern Europe once known as Scythia. “These items are visually stunning, and there are now so many reports of thefts it is evident that it is a strategy,” said Daniels. “The Ukrainians, of course, are also very keen that we establish a list of stolen items.” Daniels told the Observer that it was hard to know if the monetary value was the most important factor for the Russians, or whether the objects were chosen for their cultural significance. “There is a possibility it is all part of undermining the identity of Ukraine as a separate country by implying legitimate Russian ownership of all their exhibits.” What is clear to Daniels is that the thefts tend to follow the menacing interrogation of museum curators and custodians. Russian attempts to locate and steal hidden artefacts in occupied Ukrainian cities are becoming more determined. “We have growing concern for the museum workers and security staff, particularly when they find themselves behind Russian lines,” said Daniels."

The anxiety reflects a growing normalisation of the conflict in which large parts of the country feel distant from the war in eastern Donbas – as it becomes clear that casualties are mounting and economic costs soaring. “It’s a very real threat, that people get tired psychologically,” said Lesia Vasylenko, an opposition MP with the liberal Holos party. International media coverage has dropped markedly in the past two months, she added, and “as that number goes down further, there’s a very high risk of the support from the west going down”. Ukraine has become increasingly dependent on western help as the war has continued, both in terms of weaponry and humanitarian support, and will need international aid money to help rebuild towns and cities destroyed by the Russians in the early phase of fighting. Its treasury is bare. Russia, meanwhile, appears close to taking the shattered Donbas city of Sievierodonetsk, after a failed counterattack by Ukraine’s forces.    Ukrainian medic tends to an injured serviceman close to the front near Svitlodarsk. Photograph: EPA   After weeks of silence about casualties, key Ukrainian presidential advisers have admitted in the past week that as many as 150 are being killed in fighting every day and 800 wounded. Weapons supply remains top of the list of Ukraine’s demands. This week Kyiv admitted it had all but run out of Soviet-standard stocks. There is frustration with the pace of supply, and criticism of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government for not devolving operational decision making further down the chain. Two military commanders, who asked not to be named, told the Observer that for all the president’s international achievements, not enough had been done to tackle the military’s post-communist bureaucracy, and that supplies of some key equipment, such as encrypted battlefield radio, were short. Complaints include a lack of practical unit-level information-sharing with the west or points of contact to help with weapons training. There is also an absence of ways to find out what equipment might be available, and a need for practical help with the logistics transfer from munitions hubs in south-east Poland.  Interactive  They even wondered if there was a relative lack of urgency on the part of the country’s leaders. “It would be better if Kyiv was under threat,” murmured one, arguing that some of the pace had gone out of the war effort once it was clear the Russian assault on the capital had failed in April. A missile attack on a railway yard in a distant eastern suburb last Sunday was the first strike on the city for over five weeks. Air raid sirens go off periodically but nobody in the relatively busy capital reacts. Danger seldom follows – and there is a fatalism that, if a missile does strike, nothing much could be done about it. Scratch the surface, and the story is very different. An estimated 7 million Ukrainians are internally displaced, according to the UN, and while many people have lost loved ones, the city is also full of everyday stories like Yana’s, an IT worker whose house near the border east of Kharkiv was overrun by Russian soldiers on the first day of the war. It took the 31-year-old and her mother until this week to get back to Kyiv, where they can stay with an aunt, first via her brother’s in St Petersburg, Russia, and then, when they were confident “there would be something to return to”, back to their homeland via Estonia. But their house remains in occupied territory and it is unclear what condition it is in. There are more ominous reports about the situation in the occupied territories, where Russia has been trying to issue passports and where this week some officials in Zaporizhzhia were indicating there were plans to hold referendums on whether the territory should join Russia Tamila Tasheva, permanent representative of the president of Ukraine for occupied Crimea, has also been monitoring the situation in neighbouring Kherson, taken by Russian forces in the first days of the war. She believes there have been 600 cases of imprisonment and torture in Kherson province since the war began, and “maybe one or two million people deported” from Ukraine to Russia by the invaders.    A woman flies the Ukrainian flag on top of a destroyed Russian tank in Kyiv. Photograph: Natacha Pisarenko/AP   Those closer to the president are more philosophical about waning media attention – as long as western politicians do not lose focus, and unity among Nato allies remains relatively strong. Oleksiy Arestovych, a high-profile military adviser to the president’s office, said media fatigue was unavoidable as the conflict drew on. “It was inevitable that the Johnny Depp/Amber Heard trial garnered more views and likes than the war. People are getting weary and tired, but we couldn’t care less. You don’t have to talk about us at all. Just give us the weapons,” he told the Observer. But there was a real sense of relief in Kyiv circles that Boris Johnson survived Monday’s no-confidence vote. Zelenskiy said that victory was “great news” on Tuesday. The president looked obviously pleased on Friday as he greeted Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, on his surprise visit. Wallace was there to discuss how the UK “will continue to meet Ukraine’s needs as the conflict enters a different phase”, the Ministry of Defence said. “The thing that Ukrainians dreaded most was the possibility of the no-confidence vote for Boris Johnson leading to a change of government,” added Vasylenko, who has an informal role as a link to British politicians. “Any change of government means time for reshuffling and attention away from Ukraine,” added the MP, who is due to travel to the UK next week. Ukraine’s military tactic seems to amount to fighting hard and taking high casualties to slow down the Russian attempt to capture Sievierodonetsk and the rest of the Donbas region while hoping that newly promised western weapons – such as multiple rocket launchers from the US and UK – will allow its embattled forces to take back territory lost to the invaders.    President Zelenskiy continues to state Ukraine’s case across the globe, this time via video link in Singapore. Photograph: Roslan Rahman/AFP/Getty Images   Meanwhile, there is particular frustration with Germany for being slow on weapons supply and France for appearing to be more willing to engage with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Arestovych focused on Germany, where six weeks after the Bundestag voted overwhelmingly to send heavy weapons to Ukraine, nothing has been received. Howitzers are expected later this month and Gepard mobile artillery in July. The anxiety is that slow supply is preventing Ukraine from winning. “If we had all the weapons the Germans had been talking about, we would have kicked out the Russians, Kherson would have been liberated,” Arestovych said – before going on to describe Olaf Scholz’s government as “disgraceful” and accusing the chancellor of trying to engage in a flawed balancing act aimed at not hurting the Russians excessively. Others worry that such fighting talk is over-optimistic. It is unclear what difference, if any, the latest batch of longer-range artillery will make, and substantially more western military help could be needed. Vasylenko said she feared that Russia may be able to “wear out the international attention towards Ukraine” if an attritional war drags on, and so gradually “push the world into some sort of peace agreement” that would amount to a greater partition of the country."

In a joint press conference with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during a surprise visit to Kyiv on Saturday, Von der Leyen said: “We want to support Ukraine in its European journey.” Such a recommendation would be a step on a long road to full membership. Speaking alongside Von der Leyen, Zelenskiy said that the EU’s decision on Ukraine would “determine” the future of Europe. The US president, Joe Biden, has said that Volodymyr Zelenskiy “didn’t want to hear” warnings of the Russian invasion. Speaking at a fundraising reception in Los Angeles, Biden said “there was no doubt” Vladimir Putin had been planning to “go in”. “Nothing like this has happened since world war two,” he told donors. “I know a lot of people thought I was maybe exaggerating. But I knew we had data to sustain [Putin] was going to go in, off the border. There was no doubt … and Zelenskiy didn’t want to hear it.” The family of a British man sentenced to death for fighting Russian forces have said they are “devastated” and called for “urgent cooperation” to secure his release. Shaun Pinner, 48, received the death penalty, along with fellow Briton Aiden Aslin, in what the UK government has branded a “sham” sentencing. The pair were captured in April while fighting as part of the Ukrainian army to defend the southern port city of Mariupol against invading Russian troops. Rolls-Royce Germany has provided two superpower generators to Ukraine, the country’s ministry of health announced on Saturday. In a statement, the ministry of health said, “One such generator is capable of providing the work of not only one building, but all the buildings, if it is a large regional hospital.” The US has announced that it will be boycotting the St Petersburg International Forum that is set to take place in Russia later this month. “We urge governments and companies to join our boycott and send a clear message that there is no ‘business as usual’ while Russian forces brutalise Ukraine,” said Ned Price, the US state department spokesperson. Russia’s military has set up another field hospital due to heavy casualties, Kyiv Independent reports. It is in the village of Shebekino in Russia’s Belgorod Oblast, according to the general staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ukraine remains in control of the Azot chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk where hundreds of civilians are sheltering, the region’s governor has said. Ukraine has said about 800 people were hiding in several bomb shelters underneath the Azot plant, including about 200 employees and 600 residents of Sievierodonetsk. A Russia-backed separatist claimed 300 to 400 Ukrainian fighters were also trapped there. A United Nations commission arrived in Ukraine on Saturday to investigate war crimes. The deputy speaker of Ukraine’s parliament, Olena Kondratyuk, said the commission’s goal was to record war crimes and human rights violations. Approximately 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia’s invasion of the country in February, according to a military adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He added that in terms of daily Ukrainian casualties, around “200 to 300 die, no less”. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency says 2.5 million Ukrainians have returned there since the war started in February. The agency said 5.5 million Ukrainians have fled to the EU since the war began. Russia is attempting to repeat the Holodomor, a deliberately induced famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of people under the Soviet regime, the head of the office of the Ukrainian president has said. On Saturday, Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office head, said: “Russians shell Ukrainian fields with firebombs. Those creating global food crisis attempt to reconstruct Holodomor.” The armed forces of Ukraine have received new Starlink satellite communication systems from SpaceX. The Ukrainian defence ministry said the Starlinks would be used for intelligence missions. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is planning a visit to Kyiv alongside the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi. The leaders want to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy prior to the G7 summit. "

Such a recommendation would be a preliminary step on a long road to full membership, and Ukraine would need the backing of all 27 EU governments before candidate status was given. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been pushing for rapid admission into the EU to provide the country with more security since the Russian invasion.
“We want to support Ukraine in its European journey,” von der Leyen said in a joint press conference with Zelenskiy on a surprise visit to Kyiv on Saturday. Heavy fighting is continuing in the eastern Donbas region, where Russia has been making incremental gains.
“The discussions today will enable us to finalise the assessment by the end of next week,” von der Leyen added, saying that the Ukrainian authorities had “done a lot” towards a candidacy, but that there was “still need for reforms to be implemented, to fight corruption for example”.
Speaking alongside von der Leyen, Zelenskiy said that the EU’s decision on Ukraine would “determine” the future of Europe.
“It is now being determined what the future of a united Europe will be, and whether there will be a future at all. A positive response from the European Union to the Ukrainian application will signify a positive answer to the question of whether the European project has a future at all,” he said.
“All of Europe is a target for Russia, and Ukraine is just the first stage in this aggression,” he added.
Since Russia’s invasion on 24 February, senior EU officials, including von der Leyen, who was making her second trip to Kyiv since the start of the war, have spoken in favour of putting Ukraine on a speedy path to the EU accession by granting it candidate status.
And while a number of EU states including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland have backed these calls, there are still doubts in Berlin and Paris and other western European capitals over whether it is possible to begin the formal process already.
On Thursday, Bloomberg, citing a diplomatic note, reported that Denmark believed Kyiv did not sufficiently fulfil the criteria to apply to join the EU, saying that the country “would need to fundamentally improve its legislative and institutional framework”.
Last month, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said it would be “decades” for Ukraine to be accepted into the EU, suggesting Kyiv could join a “parallel European community” while it awaited a decision.
EU leaders are expected to further discuss Ukraine’s application during a summit on the issue later month, alongside the applications of Moldova and Georgia.
Kyiv sees the chance to join the EU as both a symbolic and a strategic way of addressing its geopolitical vulnerability after Zelenskiy earlier acknowledged that Ukraine will not become a Nato member.

Recent surveys suggest that support for EU membership among Ukrainians has soared to 91% since the start of the invasion.
Russia, which has used Ukraine’s earlier push to join Nato to justify its invasion, has recently declared that it saw Ukrainian membership of the EU to be equivalent to Ukraine joining Nato."

The business daily newspaper Kommersant reported this month that Botox imports saw a threefold drop to 74,500 units in the period between January and March compared with the same time last year, after one western manufacturer stopped exporting to Russia. While the beauty industry is a small cog in the machine, the decision by western allies to sever financial and trade ties with Russia has plunged the country’s economy into a deep recession, with the OECD forecasting a 10% contraction this year and a fall of more than 4% in 2023. Sanctions have not halted the military assault, but some are now asking whether a promise to lift them could bring Russia to the negotiating table: a return to global markets, in exchange for peace in Ukraine. The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, held out such a prospect in March, when she suggested Britain could lift sanctions if Russia commits to a full ceasefire and withdrawal, with a promise of “no further aggression”. Some of the allies have closer links to Russia than others. Last week, Germany’s former premier Angela Merkel defended her decision to increase trade links with Russia, and Germany’s reliance on Russian hydrocarbons, after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. “It is a great tragedy that it didn’t work, but I don’t blame myself for trying,” she said. But Tim Ash, a Russia expert at the Chatham House thinktank, says Germany underestimated Putin for a long time. He says sanctions, which should have been tougher in response to Crimea, are working and should remain in place. “The sanctions have exceeded most people’s expectations and they have exceeded Putin’s as well,” he says. “The self-sanctioning by the likes of McDonald’s has also hit the Russian economy, with around 1,000 major businesses pulling out of the country when they didn’t need to. They weren’t on any sanctions list.” Output in industries from aviation to automotive has crashed. In May, the number of cars sold across Russia tumbled by 83% from the previous month, to 24,000. Rewind to May 2021 and monthly sales were nearer 150,000. Likewise, Russian plane makers are in a fix now that US, Japanese, EU and UK sanctions have blockaded the industry. Russia’s transport ministry, forecasting a successful outcome to hostilities from Moscow’s perspective, believes it will take until 2030 for air passenger traffic to reach pre-pandemic levels. A “pessimistic” forecast based on sanctions continuing for years concluded that more than half of the Russian aircraft fleet could be dismantled for parts by 2025 to keep the remainder in the sky.   The high-end machine tools and sophisticated components needed to run major IT systems in Russia’s major cities come from countries robustly supporting the sanctions regime   At the beginning of the invasion, many people believed the west would impose only weak sanctions and that Moscow would find allies to circumvent the most damaging ones. Ash says neither assumption has proved to be true. When Russia was booted out of the international payments network Swift, for example, China was expected to step in and build an alternative in alliance with Moscow’s central bank. But, says Ash, “President Xi is angry because Putin lied about his intentions towards Ukraine. Now the invasion has gone ahead, it has triggered a cost-of-living crisis in China that makes worse Xi’s other economic problems.” Also, he adds, “Xi doesn’t want to upset the US too much.” Yakov Feygin, a Russia expert at the Berggruen Institute in the US, agrees that China has rejected Putin’s overtures to circumvent sanctions. India is also likely to be wary of sanctions-busting, he says. “It was a major flaw in Putin’s strategy to think China would bail him out. It was a colossal delusion.” There will be countries that buy Russian oil rejected by Europe, and there is also likely to be a market for stolen Ukrainian grain, but the high-end tools and sophisticated components needed to run IT systems in Russia’s major cities come from countries robustly supporting the sanctions regime. “You can smuggle in components and raw materials” says Feygin. “And Russia will probably do what it can to import goods by the back door. But they cannot do it on a large scale or dependably. And that will force Russian companies to ration how much they produce. It will also limit how much the Russian military can replenish the hardware it needs to fight in Ukraine.” Critics of sanctions tend to believe that Putin’s aims are limited to eastern Ukraine and sanctions detract from diplomatic efforts to secure a peace. Robert Skidelsky, the economist and Labour peer who until last year was a board member of a Russian company, argues against the use of wide-ranging sanctions during the current war in a new pamphlet, Economic Sanctions: A Weapon Out of Control. There is no evidence that sanctions trigger regime change, he says. Instead, citizens blame the sanctioners for their hardships. Accusing governments of wasting sanctions for decades in the pursuit of incoherent aims, he says they “should be used only after diplomatic efforts at peaceful solutions have been exhausted, never as an alternative to them”. Some analysts have argued that the recovery in Russia’s currency since last month and recent reductions by the central bank in previously sky-high interest rates shows that Moscow is coping with the sanctions regime. Feygin says the increase in the rouble can be explained by the collapse in imports while exports, primarily of oil and gas, have continued unabated. “When you have more exports than imports your currency appreciates, but that is not really a guide to the health of the nation or its financial situation. The rouble is not really a currency at the moment. It is more like funny money,” he says. At the moment, peace seems a distant prospect. Sanctions, with their boomerang effect on wheat and gas, restricting shipments and raising prices, will remain in place for many more months."

Shaun Pinner, 48, received the death penalty, along with fellow Briton Aiden Aslin, this week in what the UK government has branded a “sham” sentencing. The pair were captured in April while fighting as part of the Ukrainian army to defend the southern port city of Mariupol against invading Russian troops. After the conclusion of their trial by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, a Russian puppet regime supported by Vladimir Putin, Pinner’s family called the situation “awful”. In a statement released via the Foreign Office, they said: “Firstly, our whole family is devastated and saddened at the outcome of the illegal show trial by the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic. “As a Ukrainian resident for over four years and contracted serving Marine in the 36th Brigade, of which he is very proud, Shaun should be accorded all the rights of a prisoner of war according to the Geneva conventions and including full independent legal representation. “We sincerely hope that all parties will cooperate urgently to ensure the safe release or exchange of Shaun. “Our family, including his son and Ukrainian wife, love and miss him so much and our hearts go out to all the families involved in this awful situation.” Both families say Pinner and Aslin, 28, were fighting legitimately as part of the Ukrainian army and should be treated as prisoners of war. Boris Johnson demanded his ministers do “everything in their power” to secure the release of the men, who were sentenced alongside a Moroccan national. A No 10 spokesperson said: “The prime minister was appalled at the sentencing of these men. “He has been following the case closely and has asked ministers to do everything in their power to try and reunite them with their families as soon as we can. “We completely condemn the sham sentencing of these men to death. There’s no justification at all for this breach of the protection they’re entitled to.” Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, suggested that negotiations for a possible prisoner swap with Moscow were already under way. He told BBC News: “It will be a swap. The important question is what will be the price for this, because the Russians were talking about some Ukrainian MPs being swapped for them, especially for those who, I now understand, were working for them for all these years.” Meanwhile, the foreign secretarysaid she had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, “to discuss efforts to secure the release of prisoners of war held by Russian proxies”. Liz Truss tweeted: “The judgement against them is an egregious breach of the Geneva convention. The UK continues to back Ukraine against Putin’s barbaric invasion.” The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, made an unannounced visit to Kyiv for talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Friday."

The Gulf state has emerged as a key refuge for the Russian super-rich fleeing the impact of global sanctions, with private jets and superyachts linked to oligarchs heading to the UAE after the invasion of Ukraine. Bill Browder, the financier and critic of Vladimir Putin’s regime, said: “Dubai has long been a safe place for dirty money. It should now be put on financial blacklists and its leaders shouldn’t be welcome here.” He said secondary sanctions should be imposed on the UAE unless it provided assistance to countries pursuing the oligarchs’ assets. It emerged last week that, for more than three months, one of the world’s most expensive private jets, belonging to the former Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, has been grounded in Dubai. The US Department of Justice cited the last recorded flight of the $350m Boeing 787 Dreamliner – from Moscow to Dubai on 4 March – in legal documents applying for its seizure. Agents were also authorised by a judge to seize a second aircraft belonging to Abramovich – a Gulfstream G650ER – in Moscow, despite no prospect of it being immediately impounded. FBI investigators have found, like many others pursuing the assets of oligarchs, that the trail frequently leads to the UAE. There has also been a surge in Russians buying properties there. The UAE was put on a “grey list” by global watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in March because of deficiencies in its measures to combat money laundering and other financial crimes, and there are now calls for the country to be included on similar international lists. Officials in the UAE do not consider that they are required to implement sanctions drawn up by other countries, but insist they are working to remedy concerns highlighted by the FATF. The country also signed a number of mutual legal assistance and extradition pacts with other states, including the US, on 24 February, the same day that Russia invaded Ukraine. The fate of Abramovich’s private jet may now be a test of its commitment to international cooperation. On 25 February, the UAE abstained from a UN security council resolution condemning the Ukraine invasion. Karen Greenaway, an attorney and former FBI agent who specialised in illicit money flows, said US officials would almost certainly seek the assistance of the UAE authorities over the jet linked to Abramovich.  “UAE officials say they are cleaning up their act on financial transparency but are now having to walk the line between Russia and the US, the UK and the EU,” she said. The UAE is a popular destination for Russian tourists and also has about 100,000 Russian-speaking residents. A report by the Dubai property agency Betterhomes found property purchases in the emirate increased by 67% in the first three months of 2022. A superyacht that has “gone dark” on ocean tracking systems – the futuristic £240m Motor Yacht A linked to the billionaire Andrey Melnichenko – has been spotted in port in the northern emirate Ras al-Khaimah, according to the Financial Times. Melnichenko was subjected to sanctions by the EU in March, and the Italian authorities impounded his 143-metre Sailing Yacht A the same month. Motor Yacht A has so far escaped enforcement of sanctions. The superyacht Madame Gu has been linked to Andrey Skoch, a billionaire and member of Russia’s parliament who is subject to sanctions by the US, Britain and the EU. The superyacht is also under American sanctions but its location is unknown. Its last reported sighting was in Dubai on 6 March.   Related: Dubai throws open the doors for the rich Russians escaping sanctions   Dubai’s role as a sanctuary for the Russian elite since the Ukraine invasion has once again put a spotlight on its measures to combat money laundering and illicit money. An investigation published last month into a leak of Dubai property data revealed numerous property owners accused or convicted of crimes or under international sanctions, including business people close to the Kremlin. Members of the European parliament last month wrote to Mairead McGuinness, commissioner for financial services, urging that the UAE be included on its list of third countries which pose significant threats to the financial system. Kira Marie Peter-Hansen, a Danish MEP, said the latest investigation had revealed how the UAE was a safe haven for criminal proceeds, corrupt officials and Russian oligarchs. She said: “We want the UAE put on a blacklist, especially in light of the large number of Russian oligarchs using the country to avoid sanctions.” UAE officials did not respond to a request for comment."

Speaking at a fundraising reception in Los Angeles on Friday, Biden said “there was no doubt” Vladimir Putin had been planning to “go in”. “Nothing like this has happened since World War Two,” he told donors. “I know a lot of people thought I was maybe exaggerating. “But I knew we had data to sustain [Putin] was going to go in, off the border. There was no doubt … and Zelenskiy didn’t want to hear it.” Biden was talking about his work to rally and solidify support for Ukraine as the war continues into its fourth month. However, despite the west’s ongoing support for Ukraine and Zelenskiy, a former head of the British army accused leaders of lacking a long-term strategy in the conflict. Gen Lord Richards said the British government had adopted a “let’s see how it goes strategy” and was failing to show “decisiveness”. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: “There is, at best, what might be termed incremental strategy with again no early and decisive synchronisation of ends, ways and means. It is a ‘let’s see how it goes strategy’, in other words not really strategy at all. “There is still little idea in London, Washington or elsewhere how ‘we’ want the war to pan out, or what sort of Russia we are seeking to shape, especially on the vital long-term issue of relations with China.” He said leaders ought to be considering if there was an opportunity to “persuade a weakened Russia to align with the west” rather than be drawn into China’s influence. “Britain remains one of the world’s leading economies and military powers even if it is a decidedly regional strategic power these days,” he added. “Strategy is about choices and the more choices one needs to make to balance the ends, ways and means when pursuing the national interest, the more informed they need to be.” Zelenskiy said on Saturday that Ukraine was on course to win the grinding war with Russia, as fighting becomes focused on a key city in the east. Russian forces have been trying to seize Sievierodonetsk in an eastern advance, turning it into one of the bloodiest battles of the conflict to date. “We are definitely going to prevail in this war that Russia has started,” Zelenskiy told a conference in Singapore by video link. “It is on the battlefields in Ukraine that the future rules of this world are being decided.” But neither side’s forces have so far been able to steal a march despite ferocious street fighting, which has seen much of the city reduced to rubble, the Reuters news agency reported. Britain’s defence ministry said on Saturday that Russian forces had not made advances into the south of the city as of Friday. “Intense street-to-street fighting is ongoing and both sides are likely suffering high numbers of casualties,” the ministry said in an intelligence update posted on Twitter. Addressing the Shangri-La Dialogue event from a secret location in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said it was crucial that the nations sending aid did not let up. “If … due to Russian blockades we are unable to export our foodstuffs, the world will face an acute and severe food crisis and famine in many countries in Asia and Africa,” he said.   Related: Russian invasion is ‘Covid-22’ and arms are a vaccine, says Volodymyr Zelenskiy   He said that Russia is blocking ports in the Black Sea and Azov Sea, preventing Ukraine from exporting food to the rest of the world. It comes as the governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said Russians were in control of most of the city, after days of grinding advances and slow retreats by both sides in a conflict that one Ukrainian military official said had become “an artillery war”. Meanwhile, the mayor of Mariupol said sanitation systems were broken and corpses were rotting in the streets of the southern city decimated by Russian bombardment. The office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general said on Telegram that at least 287 children had died in the war so far, after it said it had learned about the deaths of 24 more children in Mariupol."

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons chief, Fernando Arias, met Ukraine’s parliamentary chairman, Ruslan Stefanchuk, to discuss “the implementation of the chemical weapons convention”, the Hague-based organisation said on Friday. Russia has demolished 1,300 high-rise buildings in the city of Mariupol without removing dead bodies of residents, according to Vadym Boichenko, mayor of Mariupol. He said cholera and other deadly diseases could kill thousands of people in the southern Ukrainian city as the corpses lie uncollected and summer brings warmer weather. Ukrainian forces were holding their positions in intense street fighting and under day and night shelling in Sievierodonetsk, officials said. It came amid Ukrainian appeals for more help from the west as Russia pushes to control the key frontline city in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. Russia has labelled a non-governmental organisation that fights for investigations into torture allegations as a “foreign agent”. On Friday, the Russian justice ministry updated its website list of blacklisted entities to include the Committee Against Torture, a United Nations-linked human rights treaty body. Moscow announced its withdrawal on Friday from the UN World Tourism Organisation after it suspended Russia in April as a result of its military invasion of Ukraine. The Russian government said that it “accepted a proposal from the foreign ministry ... concerning the withdrawal of Russia” from the organisation, according to a decree signed by the prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin. Thirty-seven thousand women are in the Ukrainian army and more than 1,000 women have become commanders, the Ukrainian first lady, Olena Zelenskam said on Friday. “Most of our doctors are women, as well as 50% of our entrepreneurs who work to support the economy at war.” Ihor Zhovka, diplomatic adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that Ukraine will not “cede an inch” of territory to Russia. Speaking to Bloomberg, Zhovka said, “We are not going to give away territory, we won’t cede an inch - especially not in Donbas. Russia has thrown everything at it – I won’t get tired of saying Ukraine needs immediate supply of heavy weapons.” Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vučić, appeared on Friday to reject calls from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for Serbia to join the European Union in imposing sanctions on Russia. Vučić said he did not believe sanctions were “efficient” and that his country was in a complicated position, given the longstanding special relationship between Serbia and Russia. A video of one of many mass graveyards in Ukraine has emerged online, Ukraine’s Centre for Strategic Communications and Information Security under the ministry of culture and information policy tweeted on Friday. Ukraine has conducted its 11th prisoner swap with Russia since the start of Moscow’s invasion in February, exchanging four Russian captives for five Ukrainians, the Mykolaiv region governor, Vitaliy Kim, wrote on Telegram. Reuters reported him saying one of the freed Ukrainians was a local village head who had been “kidnapped” by Russian forces on 10 March. Ukraine tried to push back Russian troops in the east and south on Friday as France offered to help ensure access to Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Odessa and ease a global grain crisis. An adviser to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said France was ready to assist in an operation to allow safe access to Odessa. "

Catch up with the must-read news and analysis,"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. Kyiv hit by missile attack The week started with the sound of explosions heard around the Ukrainian capital in the small hours of Sunday morning. Dan Sabbagh reported on Russian cruise missiles striking a railway depot in the eastern Dniprovsky suburb of Kyiv. Ukraine said the strike hit a rail car repair works; Moscow said it had destroyed tanks sent by eastern European countries to Ukraine. It was the first time anywhere in the capital has been hit for more than five weeks. One person was hospitalised, and a plume of smoke rose and was visible from high points in the city. Five cruise missiles were launched from Tu-95 bombers, one of which was intercepted, Ukraine’s air force said, in an attack that represented a change of approach from Russian forces.    Smoke seen from high points in Kyiv on 5 June after explosions hit the Ukrainian capital early that morning. Photograph: Sergei Supinsky/AFP/Getty Images   Putin ‘rational, cold, cruel, black evil’ Luke Harding and Dan Sabbagh spoke to Ukraine’s former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who described Russian president Vladimir Putin as “absolutely rational, cold, cruel, black evil” and claimed he is determined to go down in Russian history alongside Stalin and Peter the Great. In an exclusive interview in Kyiv, Tymoshenko dismissed the suggestion that Putin was “crazy”. “He acts according to his own dark logic,” she said. “He’s driven by this idea of historic mission and wants to create an empire. That’s his hyper-goal. It comes from a deep inner desire and belief.” Tymoshenko, a leader of the 2004 Orange revolution and twice prime minister, had several one-on-one meetings with the Russian president. They held negotiations in 2009 after Putin, then prime minister, turned off the gas supply to Ukraine. Tymoshenko stood for president in 2010, 2014 and 2019, finishing second twice and then third. Close up, Putin was “always cautious” in what he said and always suspicious that he might be being taped, she said. “He is from a KGB school,” she said. Before Russia’s full-scale invasion in February, he made no secret of his belief that there was “no such nation as Ukraine, and no such people as Ukrainians”, she said.    Former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images   Ukraine ‘almost out of ammunition’ Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence has told Isobel Koshiw that Ukraine is losing against Russia on the frontlines and is now almost solely reliant on weapons from the west to keep Russia at bay. “This is an artillery war now,” said Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence. The frontlines were now where the future would be decided, he told the Guardian, “and we are losing in terms of artillery”. “Everything now depends on what [the west] gives us,” Skibitsky said. “Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our western partners have given us about 10% of what they have.” Ukraine is using 5,000 to 6,000 artillery rounds a day, according to Skibitsky. “We have almost used up all of our [artillery] ammunition and are now using 155-calibre Nato standard shells,” he said of the ammunition that is fired from artillery pieces.    Incendiary ammunition airbursts are seen during a shelling, as Russia’s attack on Ukraine continues, in the town of Marinka in the Donetsk region. Photograph: Reuters   Life in Donbas as the frontline creeps closer Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw reported on the deteriorating conditions for those living in Donbas as Moscow continued to concentrate its firepower on Ukraine’s east. In the city of Slavyanask, a one-time spa resort near Sievierodonetsk, a terrible battle draws near. Sitting on a bench outside city hall, the deputy mayor, Yuriy Pidlisnyi, said he told residents to flee. About 25,000 people out of its population of about 100,000 had stubbornly ignored his advice, he said, as conditions inside the city get steadily worse. There is no gas or water, and only intermittent electricity. With petrol expensive, many residents get around on bikes. Some who left have come back after running out of money. The local economy is trashed. Soldiers queue outside a market cafe to buy cost-price 60 Hryvnia (£1.80/$2.25) kebabs. Slava Vladimirovich, a member of Ukraine’s Donbas battalion who has been evacuating civilians from the beleaguered city of Lysychansk, asked: “Why did God punish me by making me be born here? I liberated Popasna and Lysychansk eight years ago and took part in the biggest battles. And then the Russians came back to us again.” Isobel and Luke also spoke to troops in Bakhmut who described their perilous fight to hold Ukraine’s east. Soldiers said they had become used to remorseless shelling from the Russian side. “The first time you see a tank you are afraid,” said Sasha, a young medic. “After a time you don’t feel it. It’s like going into a trance. Your objective is to kill the enemy. You can’t do this if you have a normal psyche. You become other. My parents tell me I’m disconnected from reality.” Dan Sabbagh’s analysis of the Donbas battle noted there are signs that the invaders are reaching exhaustion and questioned whether Ukraine can cope with the losses it is sustaining.    A Ukrainian serviceman takes a break after digging trenches near the frontline in the Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, on Wednesday. Photograph: Bernat Armangué/AP   Battle for control of Sievierodonetsk Heavy fighting has seen Russian forces concentrate their efforts on trying to surround and capture the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk, advancing at a rate of 500m to 1km a day, Dan Sabbagh reports. “Sievierodonetsk remains the epicentre of the confrontation in Donbas,” Zelenskiy said in a late-night address to the nation on Wednesday evening, claiming that Ukraine had inflicted “significant losses on the enemy”. The Ukrainian leader corroborated reports of heavy fighting, saying the battle for Sievierodonetsk was “probably one of the most difficult during this war”. “In particular, the fate of Donbas is being decided there,” he added. Capturing Sievierodonetsk would give Russian president Vladimir Putin control of all of Luhansk – the region that, with Donetsk, makes up Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland – consolidating a shift in battlefield momentum after his forces were pushed back from Kyiv and northern Ukraine.  Interactive Russian forces are concentrating their efforts on capturing the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk  Highlighting the importance of the fight for Sievierodonetsk, Zelenskiy on Sunday visited the beleaguered city of Lysychansk, just a few kilometres south. On the frontline close to the fiercest fighting, he spoke to his troops. “What you all deserve is victory – that is the most important thing. But not at any cost,” he said in a video later broadcast from his visit. Death sentences at a show trial Andrew Roth and Emine Sinmaz reported on the “disgusting Soviet-era show trial” that resulted in death sentences for two British men and a Moroccan national captured while fighting in the Ukrainian army in Mariupol. On Thursday a court in Russian-controlled east Ukraine convicted 28-year-old Aiden Aslin, from Newark, 48-year-old Shaun Pinner, from Watford, and Saaudun Brahim on charges of “terrorism”. Observers said the process was intended to imitate the war crimes trials of Russian soldiers taking place in Kyiv. Both Britons have said they were serving in the Ukrainian marines, making them active-duty soldiers who should be protected by the Geneva conventions on prisoners of war. However, Russian state media has portrayed them as mercenaries, and the court convicted them on the charge of “being a mercenary”. The ruling was swiftly condemned by top British officials. “I utterly condemn the sentencing of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner held by Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine,” said the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss. “They are prisoners of war. This is a sham judgment with absolutely no legitimacy … my thoughts are with the families. We continue to do everything we can to support them.”  Our visual guide to the invasion is updated regularly and can be found here. "

Truss has already called it a “sham judgment” and said it had “absolutely no legitimacy”. The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, is appalled by the death sentences and has ordered ministers to do “everything in their power” to secure their release, a spokesperson said.   A British MP has said the only person who can immediately resolve the situation with the two men is the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Robert Jenrick described the sentencing as a “war crime”, “absolutely outrageous” and “a flagrant breach of international law”. He said the two men were being “essentially used as hostages” by pro-Russian forces in the region.   The two British men and a Moroccan national were captured while fighting in the Ukrainian army in Mariupol and have been sentenced to death by pro-Russia officials after a days-long process described as a “disgusting Soviet-era show trial”. A court in Russian-controlled east Ukraine convicted 28-year-old Aslin, from Newark-on-Trent, 48-year-old Pinner, from Watford, and Saaudun Brahim on charges of “terrorism”.   Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said two British nationals and one Moroccan were sentenced to death in the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) had committed crimes on the territory of the self-proclaimed state. Lavrov declined to comment on the cases, saying they are under the jurisdiction of the DPR, which is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine. A senior Ukrainian official said Russia wants to use the men as “hostages” to put pressure on the west over peace negotiations.   Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, travelled to Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, to discuss the UK’s support of Ukraine. During his two-day visit, Wallace met with Zelenskiy to discuss how the UK would continue to give support “to meet Ukraine’s needs as the conflict enters a different phase”, the MoD said. Zelenskiy said he was grateful for Britain’s support of Ukraine, adding that the war “highlights who is our friend […] I believe Great Britain is a friend”.   Ukrainian troops claim they have advanced in fierce street fighting in Sievierodonetsk but say their only hope of turning the tide is with more artillery to offset Russia’s massive firepower. Zelenskiy said the country was “holding on” to key frontline cities in Donbas. “Sievierodonetsk, Lysychansk and other cities in Donbas, which the occupiers now consider key targets, are holding on,” he said, adding that Ukraine had had some success in Zaporizhzhia.   Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has said: “The whole free Luhansk region came under heavy shelling. Fierce street fighting continues in Sievierodonetsk. We are exhausting the enemy.”   Russia is looking for weak points in Ukrainian defences near the Siverskyi Donets river in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian defence ministry spokesperson Oleksandr Motuzyanyk has said. He told national television that Russian forces had not abandoned attempts to launch storming operations in the area.   Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, has said that Russia has not been able to advance in his region, despite extensive shelling.   Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boychenko, warned cholera and other deadly diseases could kill thousands of people in the Russian-occupied city in southern Ukraine as corpses lie uncollected amid rising temperatures. Boichenko said wells had been contaminated by the corpses of people killed during weeks of Russian bombardment and siege. Mariupol is at risk of a major cholera outbreak, the UK’s defence ministry said in its latest report.   Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate said it believes Russia has the economic resources to continue the war at its current pace “for another year”. The Kremlin “probably will try to freeze the war for a while in order to convince the west to lift sanctions, but then continue the aggression” it said, adding that Russia’s goal “is all of Ukraine and not only Ukraine”.   Ukraine’s defence ministry said it had struck Russian military positions in the southern Kherson region, one of the first areas to be seized by Moscow’s troops after it invaded the country in February. The ministry said there was “a series of strikes on enemy bases, places of accumulation of equipment and personnel, and field depots around five different settlements in the Kherson region”. It has not been possible to independently verify these claims.   Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence has said Ukraine is losing against Russia on the frontlines and is now almost solely reliant on weapons from the west to keep Russia at bay. “This is an artillery war now,” said Vadym Skibitsky. The frontlines were now where the future would be decided, he told the Guardian, “and we are losing in terms of artillery”.    Russia is struggling to provide basic public services to the population in Russian-occupied territories and Mariupol is at risk of a major cholera outbreak, the UK Ministry of Defence has said.   Zelenskiy lobbied again for more weapons from the west, comparing Russia’s invasion to Covid and describing weapons and sanctions as a vaccine. “Weapons and sanctions are … a vaccine … against Covid-22 brought by Russia,” Zelenskiy said via video link at a gala to celebrate Time magazine’s 100 most influential people of the year.   The number of Russian soldiers killed since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine could now be as high as 20,000, according to the latest assessment by western officials. Previous estimates, given several weeks ago, were about 15,000. The official did not speculate on the number of Ukrainians killed in the war.   Putin paid tribute to the tsar Peter the Great, drawing a parallel between what he portrayed as their twin historic quests to win back Russian lands. After visiting an exhibition in Moscow dedicated to the 350th birthday of the 18th-century ruler on Thursday, Putin told a group of young entrepreneurs that “you get the impression that by fighting Sweden he was grabbing something. He wasn’t taking anything, he was taking it back”.   Ukrainian military casualties are between 100 and 200 a day, according to Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy, who spoke with the BBC on Thursday. The Ukrainian president said last week that the Ukrainian army was losing 60 to 100 soldiers a day.   The Kremlin said no agreement had been reached with Turkey on exporting Ukrainian grain shipments across the Black Sea. Turkey has been pushing for an agreement between Russia and Ukraine to ease the global food crisis by negotiating safe passage for grain stuck in Black Sea ports, but its efforts have been met with resistance. Ukraine says Russia is imposing unreasonable conditions and the Kremlin says shipment is dependent on ending sanctions.   Nato’s deputy chief, Mircea Geoană, said he was “confident” that Sweden and Finland would join the military alliance, despite objections from Turkey. Ankara has some “legitimate” concerns “when it comes to terrorists”, Geoană said, adding that he did not see any real risk to the Nordic countries from Russia in the period up until they become fully fledged Nato members.   Finland’s government is planning to amend border legislation to allow the building of barriers on its eastern frontier with Russia, it said. The move to amend border legislation comes as the Finnish government rushes to strengthen border security amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Finland’s move to join the Nato military alliance.   Swedish foreign minister Ann Linde has said in parliament that Sweden aims to make constructive progress in talks with Turkey over the Nordic country’s application to join Nato.   Nearly 5 million Ukrainians have been registered across Europe since the beginning of the war, according to figures by the UN’s refugee agency. Far more will have actually left the country, with UNHCR data showing that more than 7.3m border crossings out of Ukraine had been recorded by 7 June. Another 2.3m crossings had been registered back into the country. The war in Ukraine has “caused one of the largest human displacement crises in the world”, the UNHCR said.   Russia may be getting more revenue from its fossil fuel sales now than before its invasion of Ukraine, according to one US official. Increases in global oil prices have offset the impact of import bans, the US energy security envoy, Amos Hochstein, told lawmakers during a Senate hearing. Russia had been able to sell more cargoes to other buyers, including major energy consumers China and India, by offering it at a discount to oil from other origins, he said.   Zelenskiy said he had a phone conversation with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in which “special attention was paid to Ukraine’s path to the EU”. “We are coordinating steps,” he said. "
44,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/10/ukraine-casualty-rate-russia-war-tipping-point,2022-06-10T16:26:05Z,Ukraine’s high casualty rate could bring war to tipping point,"Any way you count it, the figures are stark: Ukrainian casualties are running at a rate of somewhere between 6oo and 1,000 a day. One presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, told the Guardian this week it was 150 killed and 800 wounded daily; another, Mykhaylo Podolyak, told the BBC that 100 to 200 Ukrainian troops a day were being killed. It represents an extraordinary loss of human life and capacity for the defenders, embroiled in a defence of the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk that this week turned into a losing battle. Yet the city was also arguably a place that Ukraine could have retreated from to the more defensible Lysychansk, across the Siverski Donets River, the sort of defensive situation that Ukraine has fared far better in. The sheer number – more than 20,000 casualties a month – raises questions about what state Ukraine’s army will be in if the war drags on into the autumn. The same is true for the Russians too, of course. But the invaders already control large chunks of Ukraine, and they can pause the fighting with the territorial upper hand. Consider the figures in context. Ukraine’s army was 125,000 strong, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and there were 102,000 national and border guards in addition. Analysts’ crude estimates suggest that since the start of the war the total could have doubled to an impressive 500,000. Kyiv’s forces are far from a point of collapse. But several months of high casualties will erode its fighting strength significantly, even allowing for some of the wounded to recover. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s forces are already being pushed back in a Donbas artillery bombardment so intense it is likely to have a shell-shock impact on many of those who survive it. Morale is certainly an issue for the Russians, but there are now reports of desertions from the Ukrainian side too.  Interactive  So pressing is the situation that foreigners with combat experience who pass the tests to join the international legion could be on the frontline in less than a month after crossing the Ukrainian border. But again, the high level of casualties now being openly discussed may act as a deterrent to recruits in the future. Western officials prefer not to discuss the impact of the war on the defenders, instead highlighting the problems for the Russians in their briefings. This week, one of those officials said their estimate was that the invaders had lost “15,000 to 20,000 dead”, out of an invasion force that was 150,000 or more. Yet despite this, Moscow’s army has still not lost its offensive capability. But they chose not to provide similar estimates for Ukraine, which can create a lopsided impression that the Russians are faring worse. In fact, with an artillery overmatch of 10 or 15 to one, according to the Ukrainians, it may well be that the invaders’ casualty rate is far lower at the moment, because they are able to deal death from a greater distance to defenders who cannot see them. Ammunition is certainly running short on the Ukrainian side, again by their own admission. Vadym Skibitsky, the deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, has said Ukraine is using 5,000 to 6,000 artillery rounds a day, and has “almost used up” its stockpile of Soviet 152mm standard shells. It is now relying on Nato-standard 155mm howitzers; it is unclear how many of these it has. Commanders have told the Guardian that Ukraine struggles for some basic equipment such as encrypted radios (where mobile phones work, it is not uncommon to rely on the secure Signal app instead) or advanced sights and optics of the types commonly used by western militaries. Ukraine is not short on bravery and determination. Western support is still in place, as shown by the UK announcement to supply a handful of – perhaps three – multiple rocket launchers this week, even if Kyiv said almost immediately it wanted many times more. But it is Russia’s forces that have found a way to advance in the Donbas, raising the question of whether the three-month war is at another turning point."
45,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/10/trial-donetsk-precedent-conflict-21st-century,2022-06-10T16:08:37Z,The ‘trial’ in Donetsk has set a chilling precedent for conflict in the 21st century | Sadakat Kadri ,"There’s a lot that is unclear about the fate of the three captured fighters – two of them British – who were sentenced to death in Donetsk on Thursday. Even the charges are obscure. All that’s obvious is that the authorities are trying to evade the Geneva conventions. It’s illegal to punish people simply for fighting, so Shaun Pinner, Aiden Aslin and Saaudun Brahim were charged with other crimes instead. They were accused of terrorism, mercenarism and attempting to topple the government. According to laws adopted unilaterally when Donetsk declared itself independent of Ukraine in 2014, that means they can now be shot by a firing squad. What’s more, the “trial” in Donetsk sends out a deeply worrying message about the future: not just concerning the course of the war, or relations between Russia and the west, but the very international legal frameworks that the world has tried to uphold since 1945.   Related: Britons sentenced to death after ‘show trial’ in Russian-occupied Ukraine   The allegations are inherently weak, in that all three men were serving with Ukraine’s army when they were captured in Mariupol. Even if they are taken at face value, though, the procedure to weigh up guilt was blatantly unfair. It’s not certain that the defendants had independent legal representation, let alone the quality of advice that is appropriate in a capital trial. Despite that, they were invited to plead guilty at their first appearance and sentenced behind closed doors within 24 hours. That’s not due process, it’s the kind of judicial procedure that gives rubber stamps a bad name. The men have already announced plans to appeal, and if that fails, they’ll be petitioning the head of the Donetsk People’s Republic for a pardon. But it’s not in eastern Ukraine that decisions about the case will be made. Though the Kremlin recognises the region as a sovereign state – unlike every other government in the world – its independence is fictional. And now that Russia’s proxies in Donetsk have condemned British prisoners to bargain with, Moscow is clearly looking forward to ramping up the pressure on London. The Kremlin’s spokesperson said, even before the men were sentenced, that Britain might need to discuss the case with Donetsk – observing that this would amount to recognition of its independence. Responding to complaints by foreign secretary Liz Truss that the trial was a “sham”, Russia’s foreign ministry has observed that the British reaction to such cases is “often hysterical”. That’s cynical enough. Though Russia was required to comply with the Geneva conventions when it took custody of captured prisoners in Mariupol, it clearly allowed the three defendants to be transferred to Donetsk – thus facilitating the improper death sentences that have just been handed down. But those sentences are a sign of worse to come – because it’s looking as though Russia plans to stage a grander judicial spectacle it can call its own. That’s been the plan from the start. When Putin announced Ukraine’s invasion, he promised not just “demilitarisation” and “denazification” but also trials for everyone “who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians”. At least a thousand of the fighters who surrendered at Mariupol are already in Russia, under “investigation”, and a show trial seems to be imminent. Russian media outlets are reporting that some captured fighters have swastika tattoos and dubious social media postings to account for. A law going through the Duma proposes to ban prisoner exchanges, so that “Nazi criminals” aren’t able to evade justice. One deputy has called for Russia to resume the death penalty – last used in 1996 – so as to eradicate the “beasts in human form” it now has in its custody. Legislators and state-sanctioned media commentators are predicting a judicial spectacle like that seen in Germany after 1945 – a “Nuremberg 2.0”.   Related: Who are the Britons condemned by Russian ‘show trial’ in Ukraine?   The promise is as ominous as it sounds. The denazification trials of postwar Germany always had two sides. They claimed to demonstrate that unprovoked violence is always punishable, and asserted that states can’t act just as they please. As far as Stalin was concerned, however, the trials were displays of force (so much so, that the man he appointed to judge Nazi leaders had previously ordered the execution of many of his Communist rivals), and it’s that darker tradition that is now about to be revived. As and when Nuremberg 2.0 begins, it won’t be an investigation into war crimes so much as a show trial. That doesn’t bode well for the three defendants who are now on death row in Donetsk – but the potential consequences could be a lot worse. The erratic prosecution of war crimes has provoked controversy for decades. There has been a failure to enforce grave breaches of international law in places from Bosnia and Kosovo to Israel, Iraq and Syria. But perspectives are suddenly diverging far more radically. With western nations and Russia accusing each other of the same crimes they defined and prosecuted together in 1945, the minimal compromises that allowed humanitarian law to develop over subsequent decades are falling apart. The purpose of denazification was originally to show that unprovoked violence had become impermissible. Whoever gets convicted or executed in the weeks to come, that shared aspiration is now history, in every sense.

46,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/10/were-almost-out-of-ammunition-and-relying-on-western-arms-says-ukraine,2022-06-10T16:06:40Z,"We’re almost out of ammunition and relying on western arms, says Ukraine","Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence has said Ukraine is losing against Russia on the frontlines and is now reliant almost solely on weapons from the west to keep Russia at bay. “This is an artillery war now,” said Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence. The frontlines were now where the future would be decided, he told the Guardian, “and we are losing in terms of artillery”. “Everything now depends on what [the west] gives us,” said Skibitsky. “Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our western partners have given us about 10% of what they have.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, praised the UK’s support for Kyiv on Friday and reiterated his call for more weapons, as the UK defence minister, Ben Wallace, made an unannounced visit to Ukraine.  “Words turn into actions. That’s the difference between Ukraine’s relationship with Great Britain and other countries,” Zelenskiy said in a video statement. “Weapons, finance, sanctions – on these three issues, Britain shows leadership.” Ukraine is using 5,000 to 6,000 artillery rounds a day, according to Skibitsky. “We have almost used up all of our [artillery] ammunition and are now using 155-calibre Nato standard shells,” he said of the ammunition that is fired from artillery pieces. “Europe is also delivering lower-calibre shells but as Europe runs out, the amount is getting smaller.” Zelenskiy said last week that between 60 and 100 Ukrainian soldiers were dying each day and a further 500 were being injured. Ukraine has kept the total number of its military losses secret. Soldiers speaking to the Guardian from Ukraine’s frontlines this week painted a similar picture. Skibitsky emphasised the need for the west to supply Ukraine with long-range rocket systems to destroy the Russian artillery pieces from afar. This week the Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych told the Guardian that Ukraine needed 60 multiple-rocket launchers – many more than the handful promised so far by the UK and US – to have a chance of defeating Russia. Ukraine is set to ask the west for a list of weapons and defensive equipment at the contact group meeting with Nato in Brussels on 15 June. Skibitsky thinks the conflict will remain predominantly an artillery war in the near future and the number of rocket attacks – which can be launched from Russia and have hit civilians – will remain at their current rate. In the first month, Russia was constantly striking Ukraine with rockets but in the last two months it has slowed. Recent figures published by the head of Ukraine’s armed forces assert that Russia launches between 10 and 14 a day. Rockets are expensive to manufacture. Each rocket can cost anywhere between a few hundred thousand dollars to several million. “We have noticed that Russia is carrying out far fewer rocket attacks and it has used H-22 rockets; they are old 1970s Soviet rockets,” said Skibitsky. “This shows that Russia is running low on rockets.” Skibitsky said Russia was unable to produce rockets quickly because of the sanctions and that it had used around 60% of its supplies. The sound of sirens has become a daily feature for Ukrainians. Sirens regularly sound in multiple regions simultaneously but most of the time, for people on the ground, it passes without a bang. According to Skibitsky, each siren signals a rocket has entered Ukrainian airspace but its impact is not always reported for security reasons. “The rockets take anywhere from 40 to 90 minutes to impact, depending on where they are launched from … We don’t know where they are going to land,” said Skibitsky. He noted that Russia was currently using long-range bombers which can reach anywhere in Ukraine without leaving Russian airspace. In terms of the three frontlines, Skibitsky said most of Russia’s forces were now concentrated in the Donbas region and seeking to occupy the administrative borders of both the Donetsk and Luhansk republics. This was the area, he said, where the artillery battles were the heaviest. In north-east Ukraine, around Kharkiv, he said Russian forces were focusing on defence after Ukraine’s counteroffensive pushed them out of several towns and villages in the region in May. “The threat to Kharkiv has lessened,” said Skibitsky, of Ukraine’s second-biggest city, which has been shelled regularly since the beginning of the war.   Related: ‘All hell broke loose’: weary soldiers tell of frontline holdout in Ukraine city   Lastly, in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, two southern Ukrainian regions that Russia almost completely occupies, Russian forces were digging in for the long haul, said Skibitsky. According to him, they are building double, sometimes triple, lines of defence. “It will now be harder to get that territory back,” said Skibitsky. “And that’s why we need weapons.” “If they succeed in the Donbas, they could use these territories to launch another attack on Odesa, [the city of] Zaporizhzhia [and] Dnipro,” said Skibitsky of major cities under Ukrainian control which are in close proximity to the southern Russian-occupied areas. “Their aim is the whole of Ukraine and more.” Ukraine’s military intelligence believes that Russia can continue at its current rate without manufacturing more weapons or mobilising the population for another year. Skibitsky does not exclude the possibility that Russia will freeze the war for a period of time in order to convince the west to lift sanctions. “But then they will start it again – look at the last eight years,” he added."

Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, have been convicted of taking action towards violent seizure of power at a court in the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk.
Truss said she had called the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, on Friday to “discuss efforts to secure the release of prisoners of war held by Russian proxies”.

No 10 has said the men are entitled to combatant immunity as prisoners of war.
Downing Street has also said that while Boris Johnson was “appalled” at the sentences, there were no plans for direct interventions with Russia, with the emphasis being on their status as members of Ukrainian forces. 
“The judgment against them is an egregious breach of the Geneva convention,” Truss said. “The UK continues to back Ukraine against Putin’s barbaric invasion.”
An adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister said on Friday that Russia had the men sentenced to death in order to gain leverage in its negotiations with Ukraine and its western allies.
“The trial of the foreigners raises the stakes in the Russian Federation’s negotiation process. They are using them as hostages to put pressure on the world over the negotiation process,” Vadym Denysenko said.
He said Ukraine would coordinate its position on the sentences with Britain, the US and the EU. Ukraine has already sentenced several Russian soldiers to long prison terms for war crimes and Russia may seek to trade the prisoners to get them back.

Russia has claimed it had no influence on the proceedings, which took place in a Russian-occupied territory in east Ukraine. “I’d rather not hinder the operation of the judiciary and law enforcement authorities of the Donetsk People’s Republic,” said the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, referring to the proxy government. 
The MPs who represent the two men as constituents, Robert Jenrick, the MP for Newark, and Richard Fuller, the MP for North East Bedfordshire, have called for Russian officials to be summoned to answer for their proxies’ actions in the Ukrainian region.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Jenrick said: “I’ve urged the foreign secretary to raise this immediately at the highest levels with the Russian government. The UK needs to be clear you can’t treat British nationals in this way. This really is the most egregious breach of international law.”

He added: “Aiden and Shaun are not mercenaries, they are combatants, who are prisoners of war now and should be treated in accordance with the Geneva conventions, and the Geneva convention is being breached in the most egregious manner by Russia in holding this kangaroo court and now this sentence to death.”
Jenrick said the men were being “hooked out and used in a Soviet-era show trial as a way of taking hostages or taking revenge against the UK”.
He said a prisoner exchange could be a solution but that required Russia to “play ball, take this issue seriously and start living up to their international obligations”.







Fuller said the men needed access to healthcare and legal advice. He said it was fair to argue they had exposed themselves to risk, but added: “What’s at the centre of this is the recognition by the Russian authorities and their proxies in this region that Shaun and Aiden were members of the Ukrainian military, they are prisoners of war, and that the Geneva convention applies. There appears to be no recognition of that.”
On Friday morning the school standards minister, Robin Walker, said the government would use all diplomatic channels to raise the case. He told Sky News: “We utterly condemn the approach that’s been taken here and we will use every method at our disposal to take this issue up.”

A Moroccan national, Saaudun Brahim, was convicted alongside Aslin and Pinner. The men were accused of being mercenaries after fighting with Ukrainian troops.
The Russian news agency Interfax claimed the men would be able to appeal against their convictions. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has described the British reaction to the sentences against the men as “hysterical” and said a UK appeal should be directed at the self-proclaimed Donetsk republic, a Russian-occupied territory internationally recognised as part of Ukraine. 
Aslin is originally from Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, and Pinner is from Watford, but his mother lives in Fuller’s constituency. They were both members of regular Ukrainian military units fighting in Mariupol, the southern port city that has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting since Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.
Concerns were also raised in Ukraine about the status of Andrew Hill, 35, who was captured in fighting in southern Ukraine. Unlike the other two Britons, Hill is a member of the International Legion, the group of several thousand volunteer soldiers who have agreed to fight as part of Ukraine’s army during the war.
A spokesperson for the Legion said they were worried about Hill’s welfare, who local reports had suggested was also going to be put on trial alongside Aslin and Pinner. “Then the trial came and went and it turned out that Andrew Hill was not among those sentences, which raises the question of what has happened to him. What’s his status? Is he even alive?”. "

The Ukrainian president, speaking via video link at a gala to celebrate Time magazine’s 100 most influential people of the year, lobbied again for more outside help because “the Ukrainian military are dying on the battlefield”.   Related: Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 106 of the invasion   He asked rhetorically whether the US president, Joe Biden, and members of Congress were using “all the capacity of our influence and our leadership” and called on them to be “100% influential”. “Weapons and sanctions are … a vaccine … against Covid-22 brought by Russia,” Zelenskiy said, hours after he said the fight for Sievierodonetsk could decide the fate of the entire Donbas – the name given collectively to the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk in his country’s east. Ukraine’s military is holding on to the industrial areas of Sievierodonetsk, as Russia concentrates airstrikes, artillery and mortar fire on taking control of the frontline city. At times Russian artillery has outnumbered the defenders by 10 to one, according to Ukraine’s military, and about a third of Russia’s total forces are concentrated around the city, where about 10,000 civilians remain, many of them elderly. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the local region of Luhansk, said on Thursday morning that “silence in Sievierodonetsk lasts only when guns are reloaded” and that “street fights continue in the regional centre” as Ukraine’s forces hung on. Russian forces were focusing all of their might in the area, Ukraine’s security council secretary, Oleksiy Danilov, told Reuters. “They don’t spare their people, they’re just sending men like cannon fodder,” he said. “They are shelling our military day and night.”   Interactive  Both sides have sustained heavy losses in the battle, with Ukraine admitting the number killed in the wider Donbas front could be 100 or more a day. Its forces appear to be have been pushed back after a failed counterattack over the weekend. In a rare update from Sievierodonetsk, the commander of Ukraine’s Svoboda national guard battalion, Petro Kusyk, said Ukrainians were drawing the Russians into street fighting to neutralise Russia’s artillery advantage. But he said his forces were suffering from a “catastrophic” lack of counter-battery artillery to fire back at Russia’s guns, and getting such weapons would transform the battlefield. “Even without these systems, we are holding on fine. There is an order to hold our positions and we are holding them. It is unbelievable what the surgeons are doing without the proper equipment to save soldiers’ lives.”  Russia’s permanent representative to the UN told the BBC that Moscow’s forces were making steady progress in Ukraine and predicted that the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions would be captured shortly. Vasily Nebenzya said: “It seems to me that there is progress. No one promised a result in three days or a week.” He added: “Just give it time ... and you will see the Donetsk and Luhansk regions liberated. And, I hope, this will happen very soon.” Overnight Zelenskiy acknowledged that the struggle for Sievierodonetsk, which has been raging for several weeks, was “probably one of the most difficult throughout this war” and that “in many ways, the fate of our Donbas is being decided there”. Ukrainian insiders have previously argued the city is not particularly strategic and that their goal has been to inflict heavy casualties on the Russians but Zelenskiy’s statement suggests the city has symbolic importance, not least because it is one of the last two population centres in Luhansk province that Kyiv controls. Haidai claimed if Ukraine had access to longer-range rocket artillery that had been promised by the US and UK it would be possible to retake the city quickly. “An artillery duel will begin, the Soviet Union [sic] will lose to the west, and our defenders will be able to clean up Sievierodonetsk in two or three days,” he said. Britain’s Ministry of Defence said Russian forces had also “increased their efforts” to advance south of Izium, from where they had failed to progress since April. South-east of the town lie the key cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, the last major population centres in Donetsk province. The attacks were partly designed to draw Ukrainian forces away from the fierce fighting further east. “Russia likely seeks to regain momentum in this area in order to put further pressure on Sievierodonetsk, and to give it the option of advancing deeper into the Donetsk oblast,” the MoD added."

Here is everything we know about the two fighters, who were captured in the besieged city of Mariupol, where they had been fighting for weeks. Aiden Aslin Aslin, 28, is originally from Newark in Nottinghamshire, and moved to Ukraine in 2018, where he met his fiancee. He settled in the southern city of Mykolaiv and obtained Ukrainian citizenship, which he holds alongside his British citizenship. A former care worker, he enlisted in the Ukrainian marines in 2018, and has remained in his unit for nearly four years. Previously, from 2015-17 he had fought in Syria against Islamic state with the People’s Defense Units (YPG), Kurdish armed units. He passed out as a marine with the Ukrainian military in 2018. His family understand his unit is the 36th Marine Brigade.    Aiden Aslin. Photograph: Twitter/@cossackgundi   According to his family, he “is not, contrary to the Kremlin’s propaganda, a volunteer, a mercenary, or a spy”, but rather a “much-loved young man with a strong network of friends around him and a loving wife-to-be”. His grandmother told the BBC that he had joined the army “because he made Ukraine his adopted home”. He had been planning a future outside the military, but “like all Ukrainians, his life was turned upside down by Putin’s barbarous invasion” and he wished to defend “Ukraine’s right to self-determination”, the family said. In a video shown on Russian television news in which Aslin is questioned, he is asked in Russian whether he understands the language, to which he replies in Russian “50/50”. He is then asked whether he killed anyone, or whether he saw others killed in his presence. Aslin replied in English: “I didn’t do any fighting.” He has been active on social media, tweeting updates and analysis on the Russian invasion under the handle @cossackgundi. He voiced his support for charities serving meals on the frontline and spoke about the “price of this war” in terms of Ukrainian soldiers killed. Shaun Pinner Pinner, 48, has been in Ukraine since 2014, when he visited Kyiv in the aftermath of its pro-Europe Maidan revolution. He subsequently joined a Ukrainian brigade, clearing mines and unexploded ordnance as a sapper. Originally from Bedfordshire, he moved to Ukraine four years ago and lived with his wife in Mariupol. Like Aslin, he is not a foreign legion volunteer but signed a legal, long-term contract several years ago with Ukraine’s defence ministry. He is also part of the 36th Marine Brigade, and it is understood that he fought in the Syrian Democratic Forces, too. In a statement released by the Foreign Office, Pinner’s family described him as “funny, much-loved, well-intentioned” and said he considered Ukraine “his adopted country” as he “enjoyed the Ukrainian way of life”. The statement read: “Shaun was a well-respected soldier within the British army serving in the Royal Anglian regiment for many years. He served in many tours, including Northern Ireland and with the UN in Bosnia. “In 2018 Shaun decided to relocate to Ukraine to use his previous experience and training within the Ukraine military”, which means he is “not a volunteer nor a mercenary”. During this time, the family said he met his Ukrainian wife, who is “very focused on the humanitarian needs of the country”. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday in January, Pinner shared his reasons for fighting: “I am here defending my family and adopted city. Russia started this war. It’s funded by Russia and driven by Russia, but we will fight them, make no mistake about that.” He told the paper that as a veteran British soldier, “death has been a part of my life for so long”, but said he was not “just another war junkie” and had “excelled better than most Ukrainians” in combat."

A court in Russian-controlled east Ukraine convicted Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Saaudun Brahim after a days-long process that observers have called a “show trial” on “trumped-up charges” meant to imitate war crimes trials against Russian soldiers in Kyiv. A spokesperson for the UK prime minister said Britain was “deeply concerned” by the death sentences passed down to Aslin and Pinner.   A Ukrainian commander has said that the battle in the key eastern frontline city of Sievierodonetsk is being fought house to house. Petro Kuzyk, commander of the Svoboda national guard battalion, said street fighting in the city in eastern Ukraine was taking place under heavy Russian artillery barrages that endangered troops on both sides. Earlier, the mayor of Sievierodonetsk, Oleksandr Stryuk, had described the situation as “difficult but manageable”.   Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, said if the west could supply long-range weapons, Ukrainian forces would be able to “clean up Sievierodonetsk in two or three days”. Haidai’s remarks on Telegram came after Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the battle for the eastern city would decide the fate of Donbas and was seeing probably the most difficult fighting since Russia’s invasion began.   The Ukrainian defence ministry has claimed that its forces have won back some territory from Russian forces in a counter-offensive in the Kherson area of southern Ukraine. It said Russian forces had “suffered losses in manpower and equipment”, mined territory as they were pushed back, and erected barricades for the Ukrainian troops. The claims have not been independently verified.   The Kremlin said no agreement had been reached with Turkey on exporting Ukrainian grain shipments across the Black Sea. Turkey has been pushing for an agreement between Russia and Ukraine to ease the global food crisis by negotiating safe passage for grain stuck in Black Sea ports, but its efforts have been met with resistance. Ukraine says Russia is imposing unreasonable conditions and the Kremlin says shipment is dependent on ending sanctions.   Nearly 5 million Ukrainians have been registered across Europe since the beginning of the war, according to figures by the UN’s refugee agency. Far more will have actually left the country, with UNHCR data showing that more than 7.3m border crossings out of Ukraine had been recorded by 7 June. Another 2.3m crossings had been registered back into the country. The war in Ukraine has “caused one of the largest human displacement crises in the world”, UNHCR said.   Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, has said the rising cost of living in the UK should not be a reason to abandon support for Ukraine. Some people will argue that the price of supporting Ukraine is too high, he said during a speech in Blackpool, but abandoning Ukraine would be “morally repugnant” and would encourage Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin.   A Russian-backed official in Ukraine’s partially occupied south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia said Russia has begun to send grain from occupied areas to Turkey and the Middle East through Crimea. A Russian official in Crimea, Oleg Kryuchkov, said the first train carrying grain had arrived from Melitopol, a city in Zaporizhzhia. The Kremlin also claimed shipments of grain would restart in the coming days from the Russian-occupied Ukrainian port of Berdiansk after work to de-mine the area.   The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, warned that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was “threatening to unleash an unprecedented wave of hunger and destitution, leaving social and economic chaos in its wake”. A new report by the UN said an estimated 94 countries, home to about 1.6 billion people, were “severely exposed to at least one dimension of the crisis and unable to cope with it”.   Russian-installed officials in the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region reportedly plan to stage a referendum later this year on joining Russia. A Kremlin-backed official, Vladimir Rogov, was quoted by the Russian state-owned news agency Tass as saying: “The people will determine the future of the Zaporizhzhia region.” Ukraine says any referendums held under Russian occupation would be illegal and their results fraudulent.   More than 1,000 Ukrainian service personnel and foreign mercenaries who surrendered in Mariupol have been transferred to Russia for an investigation there, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported. More Ukrainian prisoners of war would be taken to Russia “later on”, a Russian law enforcement source told the agency. "

A court in Russian-controlled east Ukraine convicted 28-year-old Aiden Aslin, from Newark, 48-year-old Shaun Pinner, from Watford, and Saaudun Brahim on charges of “terrorism”. Observers said the process was intended to imitate the war crimes trials of Russian soldiers taking place in Kyiv. 
Both Britons have said they were serving in the Ukrainian marines, making them active-duty soldiers who should be protected by the Geneva conventions on prisoners of war. However, Russian state media has portrayed them as mercenaries, and the court has convicted them on the charge of “being a mercenary”.
The ruling was swiftly condemned by top British officials.







“I utterly condemn the sentencing of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner held by Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine,” said the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss. “They are prisoners of war. This is a sham judgment with absolutely no legitimacy … my thoughts are with the families. We continue to do everything we can to support them.”

On Wednesday, the state-run news agency RIA Novosti shared footage of the men pleading “guilty” to the charges against them, which also included terrorism, committing a crime as part of a criminal group, and forcible seizure of power or forcible retention of power.
The pro-Russian officials claimed the men’s actions had “led to the deaths and injury of civilians, as well as damage to civilian and social infrastructure”.
A pro-Russia official in Donetsk said that while the men had pleaded guilty, they were given the death penalty because of “the main, unshakable principle – justice”. The process was closed and only small fragments of the proceedings were made public through pro-Kremlin media.

An official said that the men would have one month to appeal against their sentence and, if an appeal was accepted, they could receive a life or 25-year prison sentence instead of the death penalty. 
Russia is believed to be using the process in part to put pressure on the UK and may seek a prisoner exchange for Russian soldiers convicted of murder and other war crimes during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. There is a moratorium on the death penalty in Russia, but not in the territory it occupies in eastern Ukraine.
A No 10 spokesperson said: “We are obviously deeply concerned by this. We have said continually that prisoners of war shouldn’t be exploited for political purposes. You will know that under the Geneva conventions prisoners of war are entitled to combatant immunity and they should not be prosecuted for participation in hostilities.
“So we will continue to work with the Ukrainian authorities to try and secure the release of any British nationals who were serving in the Ukrainian armed forces and who are being held as prisoners of war.” 
Ukraine has given three Russian soldiers prison sentences for war crimes tied to the Russian offensive that began on 24 February. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was sentenced to life in prison on 23 May for killing a 62-year-old civilian in Ukraine’s north-eastern Sumy region early in the war. On 31 May, Alexander Bobikin and Alexander Ivanov were each sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for shelling attacks on population centres that “violated the laws and customs of war”. 
In a statement earlier this week, Aslin’s family said he had served in the Ukrainian marines for nearly four years and “is not, contrary to the Kremlin’s propaganda, a volunteer, a mercenary, or a spy”.
The family also accused Russia of violating the Geneva conventions by releasing video of Aslin “speaking under duress and having clearly suffered physical injuries”.
Robert Jenrick, Tory MP for Newark, said: “This disgusting Soviet-era show trial is the latest reminder of the depravity of Putin’s regime.
“Contrary to the Kremlin’s propaganda, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner are not mercenaries. They have been living in Ukraine and serving in its armed forces long before Russia’s illegal invasion, and as prisoners of war they and are entitled to protection under the Geneva convention[s].
“The Russian ambassador should be summoned to the Foreign Office to account for this egregious breach of the Geneva convention[s]. No one should think they can treat British citizens like this and get away with it.”
 Kristyan Benedict, Amnesty International UK’s crisis response manager, called the decision “grotesque”.

“This so-called trial always had the appearance of a show trial designed to exert pressure on the UK, and these sentences look like they’re intended to fire a warning shot to the UK over its support for Ukraine in this brutal war,” he said.
“Russia and its proxies in the Donetsk People’s Republic will be adding to a massive catalogue of war crimes if they attempt to carry out these sentences.
“The UK and the UN and other bodies should inform Moscow that these sentences are completely unacceptable and must be quashed immediately.”"

Can the parties be led towards compromise and settlement, or will their desperation, coupled with war fever by nonparticipants, drive the conflict into wider escalation and risk of catastrophe? The British government has offered Kyiv what it calls unwavering support. Boris Johnson has thus delegated his policy on Ukraine to Kyiv’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. This includes the ambition to drive Russian troops from all of Ukrainian soil, including Crimea and Donbas. Russia’s weight of numbers is already making such total victory and a return to pre-2014 borders ever less plausible. It would also require a massive uplift in western aid over a long period of time. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has already dubbed it the US’s proxy war against Russia. At this point in the war, the gamble is of a different nature. When Ukraine turned back the initial Russian advance, western aid appeared both crucial and glorious. In recent months the balance of military power has shifted into stalemate. France and Germany are now showing caution. Like most of Nato, they are giving Kyiv military and humanitarian assistance, but they rightly regard the war as one of Russian expansion. They do not use Joe Biden and Johnson’s language of a grand conflict involving the whole of the west. As ever more lethal “defensive” weapons are delivered by western powers to Ukraine, Russia’s complaint of a proxy war looks ever more plausible, and Vladimir Putin will continue to rattle his nuclear arsenal. If he can flatten entire Ukrainian cities with bombs, why not with nuclear howitzers? Western hawks have spent their lives practising for such a confrontation. You can sense they are eager to test Putin’s mettle – at a safe distance from home. The hawks must know he will not withdraw from all of Ukraine. So why not see how far his nuclear bluff can be called?   Related: Ukraine is desperate for peace, but we won’t sign up to a bogus Russian deal | Andriy Zagorodnyuk    As today’s wars drag on, their effect on public emotion ebbs and flows, while vested interests flex their muscles. When the Soviets occupied eastern Europe after the second world war, the west’s discipline was absolute. It followed George Kennan’s doctrine of containment, not rollback. The Soviet suppression of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 was not contested. A nuclear confrontation was agreed to be unthinkable. The Cuban missile crisis of 1962, and the ageing Andropov’s moment of madness in 1983 (when the Kremlin, spooked by a Nato exercise, almost launched a nuclear strike) saw military chiefs in paralysed excitement. Recent studies have shown how close the world came to disaster, averted only by frantic back channels, secret compromises and split-second decisions. Had the 1982 Falklands war been settled by UN trusteeship before the San Carlos landing – as it almost was after the sinking of HMS Sheffield – hundreds of lives could have been saved, not to mention the £60m a year still being spent on Fortress Falklands. In Afghanistan in 2001, the then US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld advised President George W Bush to go in, punish the regime and immediately get out. He was ignored by the “nation builders”, who proceeded to impose a vast imperial apparatus on Afghanistan and wreck it. These critical turning points are forgotten in war histories.From the moment a conflict becomes hot, war fever distorts reason with emotion. Fuelled by the media, it poisons every bid for peace with the cry, “too many have died to allow compromise”. Strategy is distorted, too. Just as we were told in 2003 that Iraq was planning a missile assault on Britain, so now we must believe that Putin is a similar threat to our security. The doctrine of cold war containment, tacitly agreed by Moscow and Washington, held to the scrupulous avoidance of an east-west confrontation between the major powers. Everything else was subordinate. Now we are at just such a turning point. Whatever settlement is reached in eastern Ukraine, it will be a compromise. Johnson and Britain have done their duty to common humanity in helping a foreign state, not an ally, resist an outrageous Russian aggression. Putin has barely advanced on his 2014 incursion, though advanced he has. Therein must lie the realm of compromise. If Johnson feels unable to plead for peace, he should at least stop yelling for war. The next chapter in Russia’s dealings with Ukraine must be for those two countries to decide.  Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist "

The constant thud of artillery could be heard in the distance. The city of Bakhmut felt deserted. There was little sense of life from before the war – no children, cars, and barely any people. Windows were boarded up with only a handful of civilians on the streets. Almost the only activity had been brought here by the war. The soldiers, weary and jaded, described a perilous fight to hold Ukraine’s east. First a relentless bombardment by Russian heavy equipment, quickly followed by advancing tanks and infantry soldiers – whose job it was to “clean up” any Ukrainian troops left standing.

Photograph: Bernat Armangué/AP   For 13 weeks, Russian forces have been trying to capture the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces. They have seized the city of Popasna, 18 miles (30km) east of Bakhmut, and have overrun most of Sievierodonetsk, 35 miles to the north-west. Bakhmut – known in Soviet times as Artemivsk – stands in the way of any further Russian advance. Despite the scale of their enemy, the soldiers said they were still convinced that willpower and good would win out over evil.  Interactive  The masses of weaponry the Russian side has and is prepared to throw at this war marks a difference with the proxy war fought in Ukraine’s east in 2014, said the soldiers. Back then Russia tried to disguise its involvement. Not this time. Ukraine’s army has plenty of highly motivated fighters, they said, but their equipment and men are being pounded by the masses of Russian shells, rockets and missiles.    Volodymyr Zelenskiy with Ukrainian soldiers during his visit to frontline positions in the Bakhmut and Lysychansk districts. Photograph: Ukrainian presidential press service/AFP/Getty Images   Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said between 60 and 100 Ukrainian soldiers were dying each day in the Donbas region and about 500 are injured. The Guardian was given access to Ukrainian soldiers on the condition it did not disclose their surnames and the location of Ukrainian positions. Zelenskiy visited the frontline on Sunday and went to Soledar, just north of Bakhmut, and the much-shelled city of Lysychansk. On the road to Bakhmut, Ukrainian army vehicles including ammunition and fuel trucks were visible as well as a spectacular 2S7 howitzer mounted on a loader. The dark traces of a Smerch multiple-launch rocket system stained the sky.    Alexey in Bakhmut. Photograph: Anastasia Taylor-Lind/The Guardian   Soldiers said they had got used to remorseless shelling from the Russian side. “The first time you see a tank you are afraid,” said Sasha, a young medic. “After a time you don’t feel it. It’s like going into a trance. Your objective is to kill the enemy. You can’t do this if you have a normal psyche. You become other. My parents tell me I’m disconnected from reality. “When you’re fighting in a city, positions are held in buildings,” added Sasha, who left his home city of Donetsk in 2014 when Russian and Russian-backed forces took over. “They fire at you with artillery – grads, missiles, mortar – and then, if you have nothing to answer with, you [retreat] to another building and they move forward.”    Vasyl, a soldier being treated at a hospital in Dnipro. Photograph: Anastasia Taylor-Lind/The Guardian   Sasha and his company were the third replacement unit sent to Rubizhne in Luhansk, one of the many cities in Ukraine’s east that has been obliterated by fighting. Like the first two companies, Sasha’s unit was eventually rotated out. While they were leaving, a rocket landed on their armoured vehicle. “We were driving out and three rocket-propelled grenades smacked into us. Our vehicle flipped over. We were pretty much all injured, myself included.” The next day, 11 May, Rubizhne fell to Russian forces. “There’s a lot of negative moments which aren’t being talked about,” said Sasha, referring to Ukraine’s wartime information strategy and censorship laws. “But I am ready to fight to the end because I don’t want anyone else to lose their home like my family did in Donetsk.” Most civilians have fled Bakhmut. A few remain, despite the constant thump of outgoing artillery and bursts of gunfire in the streets. Two people, Lena and Oleg, said they had stayed to look after Lena’s elderly father. “This used to be a great city. We had 15 factories. Bakhmut bloomed.” How far away was the battle? “It’s close,” Lena said. Fighting continues outside the city. On 31 May, Ivan, 24, a car mechanic from western Ukraine, was injured while fighting in an abandoned village on the outskirts of Rubizhne. He and his unit dug trench positions near a forest. Three of his friends were killed by Russian attackers.    Ivan, 24, a soldier being treated at a hospital in Dnipro. Photograph: Anastasia Taylor-Lind/The Guardian   “I went for a cigarette. Suddenly all hell broke loose,” said Ivan. “The Russians were hiding in the trees. There was an artillery barrage. Then a bullet flew past. A sniper was shooting at us.” Ivan and another soldier, Vitya, dived out of a nearby summer hut into one side of the trench. “Andrushka tried to reach us but he was shot in the head and died,” said Ivan. “Then our sergeant, Oleh, broke cover and ran towards my position but a bullet took half his head off and he collapsed almost on top of me.” A moment later the sniper also shot Vitya, who was to the right of Ivan, and killed him too. Ivan’s gun was out of cartridges so he reached for his sergeant’s rifle when he too was hit. “A bullet fragment went into my right eye and blood started flowing,” said Ivan, who had concussion and ringing in his ears from the blasts. “I came to my senses and tried to drag Oleg’s body to the nearest village house. I couldn’t see properly.” Ivan threw one of his two grenades, not to hit the Russians but as a distraction manoeuvre, he said. “I took the pin out of the other. I thought: ‘If they come I can blow myself up and take two or three of them with me.’” He added: “The battle lasted 15 to 20 minutes. Reinforcements arrived, they took the grenade out of my hand and pulled me out.” Still visibly shaken, Ivan is recovering in hospital from his eye injury. Doctors say he will be able to see after some time.    Ilya, a doctor, examines the eye of an injured soldier at a hospital in Dnipro.

Photograph: Anastasia Taylor-Lind/The Guardian   In the Dnipro region hospital where Ivan is being treated, doctors said more than 122 Ukrainian soldiers had been treated for eye injuries after they were hit by blast fragments. “The injuries are much worse than in 2014, back then it was just bullets,” said one doctor, Yulia Valentinivna. “It is very often both eyes that are damaged.” Vasia, a soldier whose eye was hit by shrapnel and is unlikely to fully recover, said he had no regrets. “Russia has more artillery than we do gun cartridges,” said Vasia. “The only way for us to resist is to lay down our lives.”"

They want more military equipment for Kiev and more maximalist military and political objectives, which range from pushing Russia entirely out of Ukraine, to carving up Russia, to the removal of President Putin himself. They’re right that Russia should lose the war and that Ukraine should win it. But they’re wrong about how to get there. Ukrainian and Russian forces are now in a slow, grinding war. Both have taken major losses, but Ukrainian casualties have been especially high. In the coming weeks, Russia might consolidate its position in the eastern Donbas region, Ukraine might scrape back a little more territory, or the fighting might come to a halt.   Related: ‘All hell broke loose’: weary soldiers tell of frontline holdout in Ukraine city   I am tempted to hope that Ukraine will fight on at least until it retakes its February borders, and perhaps beyond, regaining all the territory it lost back in the 2014 war. But the former intelligence analyst in me sees risks all around. In the best circumstances, regaining significant amounts of territory will almost certainly require a long and protracted fight. Risk of escalation would be ever-present. Costs to America and Europe would mount. And it would be especially bad for Ukraine. The fact is, Ukraine won’t win this war with a drawn-out, exhausting struggle to claw a few more hectares of territory back from Russia. Ukraine’s real victory is not on the battlefield, but in its post-conflict rebirth. The sooner that begins, the better. Ukraine wins by seizing the opportunity, while its still can, to immediately begin a massive, western-funded reconstruction effort that turbo-charges its political and economic integration into Europe, strengthens its security, and speeds it down the path toward a democratic future. Ukraine wins by demonstrating the extraordinary resilience of political and economic liberalism to the world and starting that process as soon as possible, not in five years when the country is destroyed and the world has moved on. Ukraine wins by stopping Russia from extinguishing its independence, which so far has been miraculously preserved, but remained at risk until the fighting stops. Ukraine wins by channeling the national energy that has been generated by the war into a better peace and a stronger, more prosperous nation. Western support for Ukraine has so far been extraordinary, reaching levels that almost no one could have expected just days before the war began. But today’s high levels of support will not last forever. Food and fuel costs worldwide are spiking. Nato has been unified in the first 100 days of the war, but over time divisions will emerge. Ukraine’s cause is widely viewed as just today, but the longer the war drags on, the greater the risk that moral clarity will fade. Ukraine should prefer to spend the goodwill it now enjoys on rebuilding its economy, infrastructure and democracy, instead of on more weapons. Reconstruction is already a massive undertaking, which under the best conditions will take a decade or more and require hundreds of billions of dollars in western aid. The longer the war goes on, the more Ukraine will be destroyed and the more expensive it will get. A protracted war meanwhile increases the risk of deepening corruption and greater centralization and personalization of power in Kiev, both of which plagued Ukraine in the past and work against the overarching goal of strengthening Ukrainian democracy. To be sure, de facto acceptance of a divided Ukraine, even if not de jure, means a hostile, potentially disruptive Russia on the border. This obviously presents challenges to Ukraine’s reconstruction, especially if Russia controls Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea. But a Russian presence on Ukraine’s border is unavoidable without a coup in Moscow or a broader war; transitioning to reconstruction now presents fewer challenges than an endless war that sees many more cities in Ukraine flattened and millions of its citizens living as refugees abroad. It will be hard to convince Ukraine’s leaders that this is their best option, now that their nation has suffered so grievously at Putin’s hands. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is unlikely to see his nation’s longer-term interest in a prosperous European future unless the United States and Europe use the influence they have as Ukraine’s economic and military lifeline to encourage him to do so. Accepting a limited victory will also require diplomatic leadership from Washington to overcome resistance in some allied capitals, and from the commentators who badly want revenge on the Kremlin. Indeed, in the zero-sum logic that prevails in many quarters, Ukraine can only win if Russia is dealt a humiliating and decisive blow. Unquestionably, Putin should pay a dear price for the havoc that he has wreaked on Ukraine and the resulting damage to European and global security. Justice also calls for this. But sanctions, diplomatic ostracism, and heavy losses to the Russian military are real costs that will bite more over time. Russia’s elites, meanwhile, have had their assets seized and doors slammed in their faces around the world. These costs will afflict Russia and its leadership for years to come. Perhaps the most famous dictum of strategy is that war ought to be a continuation of policy by other means. Western leaders should thus remember: Ukraine doesn’t win this war on the military battlefield. Nor does the west. It wins it when Ukraine becomes a healthy, prosperous democracy. This is already a challenge. A protracted war will not make it any easier.

The meaning of Russia’s claimed land bridge to Crimea,"The Kremlin is pushing ahead with attempts to consolidate its political, social and military grip on Ukraine’s south after claiming earlier this week it had established its “land bridge” to Crimea, one of Moscow’s key war aims. The announcement by the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, was accompanied by the announcement that rail traffic to the border with Russia had been restored and at least one service had included trucks carrying grain taken from the elevators in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol to Crimea, which was cut off from the Ukrainian rail network after its illegal annexation by Russia in 2014. Shoigu – who has been out of public view for parts of the Russian war on Ukraine – promised “comprehensive traffic” to and from Russia to occupied territory in Kherson and on to Crimea after announcing the repair of hundreds of kilometres of line.  Interactive  The claimed restoration of some railway services, which have been targeted by Ukrainian saboteurs, comes amid a growing campaign aimed at cementing Russian social and bureaucratic control in Ukraine’s south in all aspects, from use of the Russian language to the local government system and passports. Shoigu also said water was once again flowing to Crimea through the North Crimean Canal – which was cut off by Ukraine in 2014, although reports had suggested earlier in the conflict the canal was once again supplying water to Crimea. The moves on infrastructure come as Russia has intensified its efforts to dig in in other areas it controls in the south, including the roublisation of the economy, changing mobile communications to Russian networks and issuing passports.  Interactive  Last month the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, signed a decree simplifying the procedure to get a Russian passport for residents of the southern Ukrainian regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, which followed a similar 2019 measure for residents of the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk, eastern Ukraine’s breakaway regions. In response to the latest moves, however, the EU announced earlier this week it would not recognise the passports. The Russian passport strategy had already resulted in about 800,000 people in the eastern Donbas region being issued with Russian documents prior to the 24 February invasion.   Related: How do you get 20m tonnes of grain out of Ukraine?   There have been claims – including by Ukraine’s former human rights ombudsman Lyudmila Denisova – that hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens have been “illegally removed” to Russia since the war began. Mathieu Boulègue, an expert at the Chatham House thinktank who focuses on Russian policy and military affairs, sees the Russian announcement around the completion of the land bridge as aimed as much at public opinion in Russia around the war. “Establishing a land bridge was a stated Russian war aim but let’s not put too much into the terminology. It’s all occupied territory. It makes sense militarily that the Kremlin would want to control the territory in the south. It will subdue it because can’t control it politically.” That subjugation, argues Boulègue, is occurring on a twin track with the changing of school curriculums, the introduction of the rouble and new political structures, and so called “passportisation” being imposed in tandem with its military and security efforts. If Russia now announcing that its land bridge is done is significant it is because it is a “mission accomplished moment”, he says, referring to George W Bush’s infamous speech in May 2003 onboard a US carrier that was supposed to signal a US-led victory in Iraq. “It is major signalling, including the fact that it’s Shoigu who made the announcement. It is about propaganda: to say that everything is going according to plan.” Boulègue also suspects that the announcement, as well as being aimed at the Russian public to suggest that the war is succeeding, may suggest a desire on the Kremlin’s side to move on to the end of the period of “intense war fighting”. “It has to end,” he told the Guardian. “No army that size, and in such contested terrain, is going to keep fighting at so high an intensity for ever and inevitably there is going to be transition from movement warfare to positional warfare.” While Shoigu’s announcement marked the official claiming of the land bridge, for some the fall of Mariupol marked the moment of its reality, with Prof Michael Clarke of King’s College London telling Sky News a fortnight ago that the land bridge was a reality. “The Russians have now finished with Mariupol, they’ve got their land bridge,” he said. “The land bridge that runs from the Donbas through to Crimea and a little bit further westwards. And that land bridge will take some recapturing if the Ukrainians really want to push back in this war sometime later on.” And that remains the key question: whether Ukraine can retake the captured south. Although Kyiv has launched a counteroffensive in the south around Kherson, so far it has had limited success."

“Sievierodonetsk remains the epicentre of the confrontation in Donbas,” Zelenskiy said in a late-night address to the nation on Wednesday evening, claiming that Ukraine had inflicted “significant losses on the enemy”.
However, regional leaders said earlier that Ukrainian forces had been pushed back to the outskirts of the key frontline city amid heavy fighting there and in frontline villages to the south as Russia pursues a breakthrough in Donbas.
Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said most of the city was now in Russian hands and that it was no longer possible to rescue civilians stranded there.
“Our [forces] now again control only the outskirts of the city. But the fighting is still going on, our [forces] are defending Sievierodonetsk. It is impossible to say the Russians completely control the city,” the governor said.
Zelenskiy corroborated reports of heavy fighting, saying the battle for Sievierodonetsk was “probably one of the most difficult during this war”.
“In particular the fate of Donbas is being decided there,” he added.
Earlier Haidai had acknowledged it was possible that Ukrainian forces would have to pull back to “stronger positions” although he also insisted that the defenders would fight for every inch of territory.
It is estimated there are around 15,000 civilians remaining in both Sievierodonetsk and neighbouring Lysychansk, which had a combined population of around 200,000 before the war. Many are elderly and a handful, Haidai said, were waiting for the Russians to bring peace to the area.
Moscow has intensified its focus on Sievierodonetsk to the point where Ukraine’s ministry of defence estimated that Russian forces had as much as 10 times more military equipment than Ukrainian troops in some areas of the city.
Zelenskiy described Donetsk, the region bordering Sievierodonetsk, as a “ghost town that has lost most people, thousands of lives and absolutely all prospects”.
Ukraine also reported increased air raids, plus heavy shelling, rocket-propelled grenade and mortar fire around Bakhmut, 30 miles (48km) south-west, where its interior ministry said a school, where 400 children were taught before the war, had been completely destroyed by artillery.
Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk are not strategic cities, say Ukrainian advisers, and Ukraine’s goal is to degrade the Russian military by fighting hard to for them. But they are the only remaining parts of the Luhansk oblast not under Russian control.

Russia changed its invasion plan in April after its botched attempt to seize the major cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa. The focus turned to Donbas, made up of the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts, the latter of which remains more under Ukrainian control.
The ministry of defence in Moscow said: “The Ukrainian group in the Donbas suffers significant losses in manpower, weapons and military equipment.” It said it had caused 480 casualties overnight in fighting in Donbas and elsewhere in the country.
Zelenskiy said in his overnight update that Russia was trying to “to attract additional resources in the Donbas” – arguing that Moscow had to turn to reinforcements because of the strength of the resistance.
Britain’s Ministry of Defence said in its morning update that Russia was attacking Sievierodonetsk and the Ukrainian pocket behind it “from three directions”. It added that “Ukrainian defences are holding”, saying: “It is unlikely that either side has gained significant ground in the last 24 hours.”
Both sides continue to take heavy casualties, although precise estimates are impossible to obtain. Ukrainian officials have said 100 or even 150 people a day are being killed in action, while Zelenskiy said overnight that “Russia has been paying almost 300 lives a day” since it launched the invasion on 24 February.







Fighting also continued around Mykolaiv as Ukraine persisted in trying to stage limited counterattacks towards the occupied city of Kherson. Russia said it had shot down two MiG-29 aircraft and a Mi-8 helicopter in the region, plus 11 drones.
The Russian-installed administration in the occupied part of the Zaporizhzhia region in southern Ukraine plans to stage a referendum later this year on joining Russia, according to Russian news agencies. Russian-installed officials in Kherson province further west have already announced similar plans.
Ukraine said Russia was trying to distribute passports in the occupied Kherson region, offering a payment of 10,000 roubles (£132) as an incentive. Kyiv’s centre for national resistance said the same sum was being offered in neighbouring Zaporizhzhia region for the collection of “personal data” – but that the “vast majority” of the population was refusing to comply with the occupation administration.

Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the onus was on Ukraine to solve the problem of resuming grain shipments – stalled by a Black Sea naval blockade run by Moscow’s navy – at a press conference on Wednesday with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu.

“We state daily that we’re ready to guarantee the safety of vessels leaving Ukrainian ports and heading for the Bosphorus gulf. To solve the problem, the only thing needed is for the Ukrainians to let vessels out of their ports, either by demining them or by marking out safe corridors,” he said.
Ukraine says it has no faith in the Russians and has no intention of trying to open its ports except as part of a wider international agreement. Meanwhile, a Russian news agency reported that 11 wagons of grain taken from Ukrainian silos in areas occupied by Moscow’s force were going to Crimea.
On Tuesday, Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, announced that a road corridor had opened between Russia and Crimea, running through the Ukrainian territory occupied since 24 February. The port of Mariupol, scene of the fiercest fighting earlier in the war, had now been de-mined and cargo ships were arriving."

Lavrov was in Turkey on Wednesday to discuss the establishment of secure corridors for Ukrainian grain exports.
But the news conference by Lavrov and his Turkish counterpart, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, was coming to an end without Muslim Umerov having been able to ask his question, despite repeated attempts.
So the journalist stood up and addressed Lavrov directly.

“I am from Ukrainian public television, I absolutely want to ask a question!” he said.
Lavrov appeared embarrassed by the unscripted question, after the news conference’s carefully worded exchanges.
“Apart from cereals, what other goods did you steal from Ukraine and who did you sell them to?” the journalist asked.
Lavrov, smiling, replied: “You Ukrainians are always worried about what you can steal and you think everyone thinks that way.
“Our goals there are clear, we want to save people from the pressure of the neo-Nazi regime. We are not obstructing the grain. In order for it to leave the ports, Mr Zelenskiy must give the order, that’s all,” he added.

Contacted later by Agence France-Presse, Umerov, who is based in Istanbul for Ukrainian public television, explained that he had raised his hand during the whole question-and-answer session but realised that the organisers “would not let me speak” so decided to interject loudly.
“I took the risk of disrupting the news conference because all of Ukraine is waiting for the answer to this question,” he said.
Amid a worsening global food crisis, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said this week there were “credible reports” that Russia was “pilfering” Ukraine’s grain exports to sell for profit. Blinken said the alleged theft was part of broader Russian actions during its war in Ukraine that have hit Ukraine’s ability to export its wheat crop.
On Friday last week, Vasyl Bodnar, Ukraine’s ambassador to Ankara, accused Russia of stealing and exporting Ukrainian grain, particularly to Turkey.
Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine, Lavrov, the target of western sanctions, has made visits abroad that have taken him notably to China, India, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and twice to Turkey. He was forced to cancel a trip to Serbia after neighbouring countries closed their airspace to his aircraft.

Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who were serving in the Ukrainian military, were detained in April while fighting in Mariupol. The Britons appeared in court in the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR).Aslin, 28, and Pinner, 48, are said to have admitted “training in order to carry out terrorist activities”. In footage shared by Ria Novosti, a Russian state news agency, on social media on Wednesday, an interpreter can be heard asking Aslin, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, if he would “plead guilty” to an offence, to which he replied: “Yes.” The charge carries a term of 15 to 20 years’ imprisonment with restriction of freedom for a term of one to two years or life imprisonment, according to Ria Novosti.   Related: ‘They’ve gone through hell’: fears for British prisoners of war in Ukraine   The video appeared to show the two Britons in the dock in the pro-Russian territory’s supreme court alongside a third man, reported to be Saaudun Brahim, a Moroccan national who was also captured. Pinner, from Watford and Bedfordshire, is also said to face a longer term and possibly the death penalty after allegedly admitting to “seizing power by force”. The men are understood to be the first Ukrainian soldiers to be tried by pro-Russian forces. It comes hours after Conservative MP Robert Jenrick said Aslin should be returned to Ukraine at the earliest opportunity, potentially through a prisoner exchange, and condemned the “trumped-up charges” faced by both Britons. The former housing secretary and Newark MP told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme: “This is a British citizen, but who also holds Ukrainian nationality, is married to a Ukrainian, joined the Ukrainian armed forces in the normal way prior to [Vladimir] Putin’s illegal invasion, and has been serving in the armed forces. “He was taken prisoner by Russian forces and in accordance with international law and the Geneva convention, he should be being held appropriately and returned to Ukraine at the earliest possible opportunity, possibly through a prisoner exchange. “Instead of that Putin’s regime have chosen to put him and another British national, Shaun Pinner, on trial on trumped up charges, no evidence whatsoever.  “This is, I’m afraid, a completely outrageous breach of international law and it should be condemned.”On Monday, Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, said the Foreign Office will “make all the representations” on Aslin’s behalf and his family also issued a statement calling for his release. The statement said: “We are currently working with the Ukrainian government and the Foreign Office to try and bring Aiden home. Aiden is a much-loved man and very much missed, and we hope that he will be released very soon.” Ukraine has sentenced three Russian soldiers to prison for war crimes tied to the Russian offensive that began on 24 February. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was sentenced to life in prison for killing a 62-year-old civilian in Ukraine’s north-eastern Sumy region early in the war. Two soldiers, Alexander Bobikin and Alexander Ivanov, were each sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for shelling attacks on population centres that “violated the laws and customs of war”."

Ukrainian insiders estimate that Russia now has 120 battalions inside Ukraine, but such has been the attrition so far, their strength is perhaps 40% or 50% of a normal full complement of about 800. Half that total force is concentrated in the eastern Donbas region – and a third, so 40, around Sievierodonetsk.
It demonstrates the level of concentration Russia needs to make progress, blasting the area with a mix of air, artillery, mortar and even rocket-propelled grenade strikes before advancing over the destruction that remains. All for a city that, while it may be in the frontline, is not militarily strategic.

Ukraine says its goal is simply to hold up the Russians, inflict losses on the larger invading army and reduce their morale. At one point over the weekend the defenders managed a short-lived counterattack, but this seems to have provoked an even more intense bombardment from the invaders.
A similar fight looms for neighbouring Lysychansk across the Siverskyi Donets River that Russian forces have had difficulty crossing. It lies on higher ground than Sievierodonetsk, and is the final city in the Luhansk region held by Ukraine. Ukraine holds more of the neighbouring Donetsk oblast, the other half of the Donbas. Kramatorsk, the most likely final target, is about 40 miles from Lysychansk.

 Related: Ukraine forces may have to pull back in Sievierodonetsk, say leaders in Donbas 

A key question is whether Ukraine can cope with the losses it is sustaining. Estimates vary, but Oleksiy Arestovych, a high-profile Ukrainian military analyst and presidential adviser, said “up to 150 troops a day were being killed and 800 wounded”.
That is higher than the 50-100 a day acknowledged by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and a high rate of wounded that could reflect poor access to battlefield medicine, or the difficulty of evacuation – or is perhaps an overestimation. But there is also likely to be a similar rate of casualties on the Russian side, amid indications the invading forces are approaching the point of exhaustion.
Olga Oliker, a director from the Crisis Group, an NGO, said that “both sides are competing to be the last army standing”, although she believes that Ukraine still has considerable numbers of soldiers available, having “something like doubled” its army size since the war began. So Kyiv can hang on for some while yet.
A potential Russian goal will be to try and secure the Donbas, before perhaps opting for a ceasefire, essentially to hang on to the Ukrainian territory it has gained. The issuing of Russian passports in areas such as Kherson to the south, and more ominously the forced deportations of Ukrainians deemed hostile, indicate its intention to stay.
It is hardly surprising that Zelenskiy said this week that stalemate was not an option for Ukraine, given what is happening in occupied areas. Yet he also conceded in the same interview that “we are inferior in terms of equipment and therefore we are not capable of advancing” unless large amounts of western weaponry arrived.







This may be lobbying but it is also true. Ukraine has only been able to make very limited gains in counterattacks south of Mykolaiv so far. Arestovych suggested Ukraine needed 60 multiple-launch rocket systems, when the US and UK are talking about perhaps a 10th of that, and as many as “600 tanks”.
These are large numbers but arguably the reality of what it would take for Ukraine to avoid a stalemate, where Russia runs out of momentum having nevertheless gained most of the south coast and another chunk of the east – and, almost certainly if Vladimir Putin remains in power, with future designs on more."

Russian forces have seized residential quarters of the key eastern city and are fighting to take control of an industrial zone on its outskirts and the nearby towns, the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said. Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies showed significant damage in Sievierodonetsk and nearby Rubizhne.   Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has said “nobody is going to surrender Sievierodonetsk”. He said that the regional centre of Luhansk was experiencing the most intense fighting, saying: “Fierce battles are taking place in Sievierodonetsk, our defenders are fighting for every inch of the city.”   The Russian ministry of defence claims that “the Ukrainian group in the Donbas suffers significant losses in manpower, weapons and military equipment”. Russia claims to have shot down two MiG-29 aircraft and a Mi-8 helicopter in the Mykolaiv region, and also 11 unmanned drones in the last 24 hours.   The UK Ministry of Defence has said it is unlikely that either side has gained significant ground in the last 24 hours.   800 civilians have taken refuge in a chemical factory in Sievierodonetsk, according to a lawyer for Dmytro Firtash, whose company owns the facility. “These 800 civilians include about 200 out of the plant’s 3,000 employees and approximately 600 inhabitants of the city of Sievierodonetsk,” Lanny Davis, a US lawyer, said in a statement published on the company website.   Russian-installed officials in the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region reportedly plan to stage a referendum later this year on joining Russia. A Kremlin-backed official, Vladimir Rogov, was quoted by the Russian state-owned news agency Tass as saying: “The people will determine the future of the Zaporizhzhia region. The wording of the questions will be presented in the near future. The vast majority of residents of our region want to return to their native harbour as soon as possible and become part of greater Russia.” Ukraine says any referendums held under Russian occupation would be illegal and their results fraudulent. Dozens of radiation detectors around Ukraine’s Chornobyl nuclear power plant have started transmitting radiation data for the first time since Russia invaded, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Radiation levels in the area surrounding Chornobyl are now back to normal after detectors came back online today, according to the UN nuclear watchdog.   Millions of people could die of hunger unless Russia lifts the blockade on Ukraine’s ports on the Black Sea, Italy’s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, has warned. Lebanon’s minister for foreign affairs, Abdallah Bou Habib, told a meeting of Mediterranean ministers that rises in the cost of fuel and basic foodstuffs were exacerbating the crisis in his country.   The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the onus was on Ukraine to solve the problem of resuming grain shipments. Lavrov said no action was required on the Russian side. “We state daily that we’re ready to guarantee the safety of vessels leaving Ukrainian ports and heading for the Bosphorus gulf. To solve the problem, the only thing needed is for the Ukrainians to let vessels out of their ports, either by de-mining them or by marking out safe corridors.”   The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he “simply cannot see the preconditions for ending the war” in an interview with the Financial Times. Victory meant restoring “all” of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea – annexed by Russia in 2014 – and separatist-held areas, he suggested. “We have to achieve a full de-occupation of our entire territory,” he said.   Ukraine is launching a “Book of Executioners”, a system to collate evidence of war crimes Kyiv says were committed during Russia’s occupation, Zelenskiy said yesterday. Ukraine has filed eight more war crimes cases to court in addition to the three sentences already handed down to Russian soldiers, according to its prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova.   Russia has handed over to Kyiv the bodies of 210 Ukrainian fighters, most of whom died defending the city of Mariupol from Russian forces at a vast steel works, the Ukrainian military confirmed.   Ukraine and Russia each handed over the bodies of 50 of their deceased soldiers in an exchange that included 37 Ukrainian soldiers killed at Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks, the Ukrainian ministry for reintegration has confirmed. The exchange took place on the front lines in the southeast Ukrainian region of Zaporizhzhia, the ministry said.   The Kremlin said any meeting between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine must be “productive and well prepared”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said western sanctions must be lifted in order for Russian grain to be delivered to international markets.   More than 1,000 Ukrainian service personnel and foreign mercenaries, who had surrendered in Mariupol, have been transferred to Russia for an investigation there, a law enforcement source told Russian state-owned news agency, Tass.   Norway has donated 22 self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine, including spare parts, ammunition and other gear, the Norwegian defence ministry said.   Laurence Boone, the chief economist at the Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has said the world economy was paying a “hefty price” for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. She said: “As Russia and Ukraine are large commodity exporters, the war has sent energy and food prices soaring, making life much harder for many people across the world.”   Russian proxy fighters in east Ukraine have said they are opening a trial against two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who were captured fighting alongside Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol. The two men, who are serving in the Ukrainian military, and Ibrahim Saadun, a captive from Morocco, were shown sitting in a courtroom cage reserved for defendants in a video released on pro-Russian social media channels on Tuesday.   The European Union needs to build warehouses and extend railway tracks across the Ukrainian border to help Kyiv in its attempts to move more grain out of the country to those who need it, says the country’s trade representative. Ukraine will not be able to export more than 2m tonnes of grain a month, around a third of prewar levels, as long as its main trade routes through its Black Sea ports remain blockaded by Russia, said Taras Kachka.   The World Bank has approved $1.49bn of additional financing for Ukraine to help pay wages for government and social workers, expanding the bank’s total pledged support for Kyiv to more than $4bn. The latest round of funding is supported by financing guarantees from Britain, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Latvia.   Russia is ramping up oil exports from its major eastern port of Kozmino as it aims to offset the impact of EU sanctions with the surging demand from Asian buyers. Sources told Reuters that Russia has already increased the amount of crude pumped to Kozmino on its main Asian oil route, the East Siberia Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline, by 70,000 barrels a day (bpd).

If the account is confirmed, Goldschmidt would be a rare high-profile religious leader to leave Russia due to opposition to the war. The Orthodox bishop, Patriarch Kirill, and other religious leaders in Russia have voiced support of the war. The Guardian has written to Goldschmidt and Chizhik-Goldschmidt for comment. “They are now in exile from the community they loved, built and raised their children in over 33 years,” Chizhik-Goldschmidt wrote, describing a journey that took her parents-in-law through Hungary and then eastern Europe, where she said they had helped fundraising efforts for Ukrainian refugees. He went on to Jerusalem, where his father had been in hospital. “The pain & fear in our family the last few months is beyond words,” she said. “The sounds of the Moscow Choral Synagogue ring in our ears … I’ll never forget our engagement there in ‘14, & taking our children there, Shavuos ‘18… Grateful our parents are safe; worried sick over many others …” Demographers estimate there are about 150,000 Jewish people in Russia. Goldschmidt was reelected on Tuesday to another seven-year term as the chief rabbi of Moscow and the leader of the Moscow Choral Synagogue, one of Russia’s most storied houses of worship. He had remained in his post while outside the country, delegating authority to a deputy in his absence. His reelection was supported by a number of senior Israeli rabbis, who had asked that “no change be made in the composition of the rabbinate and the tribunal without coordination with us”. Another conservative religious leader in Israel warned that “we have been witnessing a difficult reality when governments try to interfere in the tenure of rabbis”. There were also reports of government pressure to replace Goldschmidt in the elections. “The coup attempt failed,” a source in the Russian Jewish community told the Jerusalem Post.

Usmanov, as well as his sisters Saodat Narzieva and Gulbakhor Ismailova, each filed separate legal appeals in April in an attempt to overturn sanctions that have blocked them from travelling across the EU or making use of assets located in member states, including a $600m (£484m) yacht. The Guardian understands an interim decision on whether to suspend sanctions could be issued within the next two weeks, pending a final ruling that is likely to be made by the end of the year. That would give the oligarch and his relatives access to bank accounts and assets that have either been frozen or seized. The Uzbek-born Usmanov has been subject to an asset freeze and EU travel ban since late February, after Russia invaded Ukraine. The sanctions came after the bloc identified him as one of “Putin’s favourite oligarchs”. Similar sanctions have since been applied against the metals and telecoms magnate in the US and UK, where he was a major sponsor of Everton football club. The EU later extended sanctions to Ismailova and Narzieva, for being financially “associated” with their brother. The move resulted in the impounding of a $600m yacht – the largest in the world – after German federal police, who investigated a complex web of holding companies, claimed to have identified Ismailova as the only beneficial owner of the vessel.    The Dilbar, a luxury yacht impounded by the German authorities. Photograph: Yoruk Isik/Reuters   A spokesperson for Usmanov and his sisters said the yacht’s ownership “was never concealed” and that all the required documents related to the structure of ownership via a trust were provided to relevant authorities, including in the EU, US and Germany. The EU sanctions listing for Usmanov also said the oligarch had “transferred considerable assets to his sister Soadat Narzieva [sic] including a single payment or gift of $3m”. The sanctions notice added that Narzieva “held 27 Swiss bank accounts, holding hundreds of millions of dollars, which can be linked to her brother”. Questions over Narzieva’s links to those 27 Credit Suisse accounts were raised as part of an investigation by a consortium of media partners, including the Guardian and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, in March. The Russian Asset Tracker project drew on a number of leaks including Credit Suisse data. Documents showed a majority of the accounts were also linked to Usmanov’s media, metals and mining conglomerate, USM Group. Eighteen of those accounts are believed to have still been active in recent years. A spokesperson for Usmanov and Narzieva told the Guardian in mid-March, before publication, that the Credit Suisse data was “fake and incorrect”.    Illustration of Saodat Narzieva and her brother Alisher Usmanov with Vladimir Putin under a Credit Suisse sign. Illustration: Guardian Design   On the day of publication, representatives for Narzieva said she been given a small shareholding in USM by her brother. In early May, nearly six weeks after the investigation was published, Usmanov’s spokesperson contacted Guardian to say Narzieva had been listed as a beneficial owner on Credit Suisse accounts for a brief period in 2013-2014 and that she was named on bank data owing to “technical reasons”. According to documents from the Panama and Paradise Papers leaks, she appears to be one of six relatives and associates who were given a portion of Usmanov’s stake in USM in September 2013. The spokesperson said Narzieva’s holding was equal to 0.3% of the company. The businesses controlled by USM at the time included MegaFon, one of Russia’s largest mobile phone operators, and Mail.ru, a tech group now named VK that owned Russia’s equivalent to Facebook. Secondary shares in both companies were listed on the London Stock Exchange.    MegaFon branding is removed at Everton’s Goodison Park stadium in Liverpool. Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA   The spokesperson said that in August 2014, Usmanov bought back the shares he had distributed to Narzieva and other family members a year earlier. “Family members subsequently sold their shares and received a profit, which amounted to an insignificant portion of Mr Usmanov’s wealth,” the spokesperson said. They said Narzieva was paid $15m for her holding, and that she had received $2.1m in dividends, adding that her shareholding, which was held via a British Virgin Island’s offshore company called Optimum Group Holdings, was liquidated in 2018 and had no other business dealings with USM. “The sole reason why these ‘mysterious multibillion accounts’ were associated with her is that for a brief period, between 2013 and 2014 [when she held the shares], Mrs Narzieva was one of a number of minority shareholders [family] of USM Holding [and, by extension, a dozen or so entities that ultimately formed USM Holding],” the spokesperson said. “But she never had access to the accounts of these companies, nor did she have any signatory rights over any of them,” they added.

They added that Usmanov considered the sanctions against his sister to be an unfair, inhumane and unfounded example of retaliation against family. Documents related to the sanctions appeal have not been made public. Other Russian officials have also filed challenges to EU sanctions at the ECJ, including the oil billionaire and Putin ally Gennady Timchenko, and Igor Shuvalov, a former Russian deputy prime minister who heads the Russian development bank VEB. Timchenko is also applying for damages, an EU official confirmed."

However, the Turkish foreign affairs minister struck a more considered note, saying more talks between Moscow and Kyiv would be required to ensure the safety of any vessels carrying exports. Speaking alongside Lavrov in Ankara, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu described a United Nations plan to launch a sea corridor for Ukrainian grain exports as “reasonable” but added that Russia and Ukraine would have to accept any agreement.   Related: How do you get 20m tonnes of grain out of Ukraine?   “Various ideas have been put out for the export of Ukrainian grains to the market and most recently is the UN plan [including] a mechanism that can be created between the UN, Ukraine, Russia and Turkey,” Çavuşoğlu said. “We see it as reasonable.” The majority of Ukrainian grain exports have been halted since Russia launched a full invasion in late February and blockaded the country’s Black Sea ports, through which 90% of trade from the world’s fifth-largest grain exporter used to flow. The sudden export stoppage has raised concerns that the war in Ukraine will spark a global food crisis, and push millions of people into famine. The UN subsequently appealed to Russia and Ukraine, as well as Nato member Turkey – which has authority over maritime traffic entering and leaving the Black Sea through the Bosphorus strait – to agree a corridor. According to the UN, Russia and Ukraine supply about 40% of the wheat consumed in Africa, where prices have already risen by about 23%. Any Turkish-brokered grain corridor would probably involve cargo vessels leaving Odesa, which is in Ukrainian hands, and other Black Sea ports with a Turkish naval escort, before travelling towards Turkey and on to global markets. Lavrov, who has blamed western sanctions for the food crisis, said Ukraine needed to let commercial vessels leave its ports safely, in order to reach any agreement on a grain corridor.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  Turkey, which has good relations with Kyiv and Moscow, made a show early in the war of trying to act as a mediator between the two sides but ceasefire talks have since faded. Ankara has said it is ready to take on a role as part of an “observation mechanism” if any kind of grain export deal is reached. An agreement between Russia and Ukraine is a vital starting point for grain exports to resume but several other things would need to fall into place. Shipping industry insiders say Ukraine’s coastal waters would need to be de-mined with special insurance arranged and strict assurances given over the safety of vessels and crew before any shipowners would be willing to send a fleet to the Black Sea."

In an exclusive interview, Tymoshenko dismissed the suggestion that the Russian president was “crazy”. “He acts according to his own dark logic,” she said. “He’s driven by this idea of historic mission and wants to create an empire. That’s his hyper-goal. It comes from a deep inner desire and belief.” Tymoshenko, a leader of the 2004 Orange revolution and twice prime minister, had several one-on-one meetings with Putin. They held negotiations in 2009 after Putin, then prime minister, turned off the gas supply to Ukraine. Tymoshenko stood for president in 2010, 2014 and 2019, finishing second twice and then third. Close up, Putin was “always cautious” in what he said and always suspicious that he might be being taped, she said. “He is from a KGB school,” she said. Before Russia’s full-scale invasion in February, he made no secret of his belief that there was “no such nation as Ukraine, and no such people as Ukrainians”, she said. His ambitions went beyond seizing Ukrainian territory and toppling its pro-western, pro-Nato government, Tymoshenko suggested. His geopolitical aim was to take over Belarus, Georgia and Moldova as well, and to control central and eastern Europe including the Baltic states, just as Moscow did in Soviet times, she said.    Yulia Tymoshenko and Vladimir Putin in Yalta, Ukraine, in November 2009. Photograph: Aleksandr Prokopenko/EPA   Tymoshenko was in Kyiv on 24 February when Russia launched a multi-pronged attack in the early hours. She said peacetime political rivalries and grudges immediately vanished. That morning she went to the presidential administration together with other senior opposition figures and met Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom she ran against in 2019. “We hugged each other and shook hands. Everyone was shocked, pale and afraid. None of us planned to leave Kyiv,” she said. “Everyone knew we should stand until the last. We agreed to support our president and our army and to work for victory.” Zelenskiy’s decision to remain in the capital and to “overcome his fear” was important, she said. As Russian bombs fell, Tymoshenko took refuge in the basement of the modern office building belonging to her Batkivshchyna political party in Kyiv’s Podil district, which was hit several times by missiles. Asked if she was ready to shoot Russian soldiers, she said: “Yes. I have legal weapons. The Kremlin put me on a kill list, according to sources. We were prepared.” The Russian government had always considered her an enemy, Tymoshenko said. She pointed to her support for Ukraine’s membership of the EU and Nato. In the 2010 presidential election she stood against Viktor Yanukovych, who was backed by Moscow. She blamed her defeat on the outgoing president at the time, Viktor Yushchenko, a one-time Orange revolution ally. The following year Yanukovych had Tymoshenko jailed in a case widely seen as politically motivated. “Putin and Yanukovych imprisoned me. Yanukovych was never an independent player. He was always Putin’s puppet,” she said. She got out of prison in 2014 when Yanukovych fled to Moscow after the Maidan anti-corruption protests. Weeks later Putin annexed Crimea and instigated a separatist uprising in the east of Ukraine.    Protesters in Maidan Square, Kyiv, in February 2014. Photograph: Emeric Fohlen/NurPhoto/REX   Tymoshenko spoke in her downtown office decorated with the Ukrainian flag and photos showing her with western leaders including Margaret Thatcher. She praised the “unbelievable unity” of the “anti-Putin coalition” and singled out the UK and Boris Johnson for special mention, as well as the US, Canada and Poland. “We see Britain as a part of the broader Ukrainian family,” she said. Last weekend France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said it was important not to “humiliate” Putin – a phrase interpreted as meaning Ukraine should sacrifice some of its territory in exchange for a realpolitik deal with Moscow. Tymoshenko said France and Germany – criticised for slow-pedalling on arms deliveries – should not be ostracised as Europe grappled with its worst security crisis in decades. But she said Ukraine’s international partners had to understand that the only way to end the war was to crush Russian forces on the battlefield. Without naming anybody, she said they should not become “co-conspirators with evil”. She added: “There is no such thing as a peace agreement with Putin because it doesn’t lead to peace. It would lead to a new war several years later.” The stakes for her country were existential, she said. The Kremlin’s objective was to “depersonify” Ukraine, stripping it of its language and culture, and leaving it weak and “atomised”. The civilised world had a unique opportunity to stop Russia and to prevent it from spreading “war, corruption, blackmail, disinformation and unfreedom,” she said.   Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST  Russia had largely given up on the pretence that it was only targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure, Tymoshenko said. The murder of civilians – in cities in the Kyiv region such as Bucha and Irpin, as well as in other areas – was cruel and deliberate, she said, with Russian soldiers following Moscow’s instructions. “It’s an inseparable part of their genocide against the Ukrainian nation,” she said. “What happened in Mariupol was even worse than in Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel. I’m convinced we will be able to take back Mariupol and to uncover the scale of the horrible killings there. It was a tragedy, a human catastrophe of an unthinkable scale.” Considering her words, the veteran politician concluded: “This is a great battle for our territory and our freedom. It’s a historic chance for the free world to kill this evil.”"

The UK will grow by 3.6% in 2022 before posting zero growth in 2023, according to the Paris-based thinktank the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), with inflation expected to average 8.8% this year and fall only slightly to 7.4% in 2023. The predictions – contained in the OECD’s half-yearly economic outlook – represent a sharp downgrade from the estimated 4.7% growth this year and 2.1% next year made six months ago. Laurence Boone, the thinktank’s chief economist, said the UK was being hit by a combination of factors, including higher interest rates, higher taxes, reduced trade and more expensive energy.  The OECD said the UK was expected to go from the second-fastest-growing economy in the G7 group of industrial nations after Canada this year to the slowest-growing in 2023. Japan, Germany, Italy, France and the US make up the other members of the group. A UK Treasury spokesperson said: “Thanks to the support we provided during the pandemic, the UK had the fastest growth in the G7 last year, and our unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been in nearly 50 years. But we recognise many people will be concerned by these forecasts. “While we can’t insulate the UK from global pressures entirely, our economy is in a strong position to deal with these challenges. We have a plan for growth, and we are supporting people with the cost of living.” Boone said the world economy was paying a “hefty price” for Russia’s invasion. “A humanitarian crisis is unfolding before our eyes, leaving thousands dead, forcing millions of refugees to flee their homes and threatening an economic recovery that was under way after two years of the pandemic,” she said. “As Russia and Ukraine are large commodity exporters, the war has sent energy and food prices soaring, making life much harder for many people across the world.” Boone said the OECD had cut its global growth forecast for 2022 from 4.5% to 3%, while inflation in the organisation’s 38 wealthy-country members would average almost 9% – double the forecast in last December’s Economic Outlook. Growth in 2023 is expected to be 2.8%, down from the 3.2% forecast six months ago.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  “Elevated inflation across the globe is eroding households’ real disposable income and living standards, and in turn lowering consumption,” Boone said as she called for the burden of adjusting to a rising cost of living to be shared fairly between employers and employees and between profits and wages. “Uncertainty is deterring business investment and threatening to curb supply for years to come. At the same time, China’s zero-Covid policy continues to weigh on the global outlook, lowering domestic growth and disrupting global supply chains,” she added. The OECD is the second international body to cut its growth forecast in the past two days, with the World Bank warning in its global economic prospects of a return to 1970s-style stagflation – a combination of weak growth and high inflation."

Governments including the US, Germany, the UK and Canada are investing in new gas production, distribution and use as they seek to sanction Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, according to new research. The findings, from the Climate Action Tracker research initiative, show a dash for gas under way that will lock countries into fossil fuel use at a crucial time, when scientists have warned that a decisive turn towards lower-carbon alternatives within the next few years is the only way to stave off climate breakdown. Niklas Höhne, of NewClimate Institute, one of the partners behind the Climate Action Tracker, said: “We’re about to witness a ‘gold rush’ for new fossil gas production, pipelines and LNG [liquefied natural gas] facilities, locking us into another high-carbon decade.” The report highlighted the US, which has signed a deal to export additional LNG to the EU, through an increased effort on fracking. Germany and Italy have also signed deals with Qatar as a gas supplier, as has Egypt, the host of the world’s next climate summit, Cop27 in Sharm El-Sheikh this November. Canada also plans new LNG production, fast-tracking construction to meet export demand. Overall, fossil fuel production has increased in Canada, the US, Norway, Italy and Japan, according to Climate Action Tracker. The UK is also facing a massive expansion of oil and gas production in the North Sea, as the government has imposed a windfall tax on the industry that contains a loophole encouraging companies to invest in new production. Developing countries are getting in on the act, too. Nigeria is reviving gas pipeline projects that had been shelved, and Senegal and other countries are hoping to explore their gas reserves. Oil and gas companies around the world are enjoying a bonanza after the war in Ukraine sent energy prices – already rising as the world recovered from the economic shock of Covid-19 – to fresh highs. The dash for gas comes as scientists have warned it is “now or never” on the climate. Global greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to give the world a chance of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the target agreed at last year’s Cop26 climate summit. Some countries have argued that gas production has a role in the transition to a clean energy future, as gas produces less carbon dioxide than coal. But the International Energy Agency warned a year ago that no new oil and gas exploration could take place from this year on, if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C. Separate research has also found that moving directly to renewable energy from coal is cheaper than using gas as a “transition” fuel. Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, also a partner in the Climate Action Tracker, said the world was compounding the mistake made after the Covid-19 pandemic struck, when despite soaring green rhetoric, few countries made a decisive shift in favour of a low-carbon economic recovery. He warned: “Something has to change: we cannot go on responding to short-term shocks, be they pandemics or energy shocks from conflict, by taking steps that would increase emissions, ignoring the looming crisis of climate change.” Hare also pointed to the many alternative policies governments should use, such as improving energy efficiency, ramping up renewable energy, boosting public transport and imposing windfall taxes on the bumper profits of fossil fuel companies. These have been largely neglected in many countries, the CAT report warned, which have focused on short-term energy supply responses instead."

But when the head of the Kremlin-controlled, self-declared Luhansk People’s Republic announced a full military mobilisation of the region on 19 February, Sangwa, together with two friends and fellow students from DRC and Central African Republic, decided to join the local militia and take up arms against Ukraine. “I joined because the war came to our republic. What should I have done? I am a man and have to fight,” Sangwa said in broken Russian. “The whole world is fighting against Russia,” he added when asked why he had decided to join the militia. Sangwa moved to Russia two years ago to study in Rostov, a city close to the Ukrainian border, and then moved to Luhansk, which had been captured by separatists backed by the Russian army in 2014. There is a long tradition of Africans studying in Russia, beginning from when the Soviet Union started offering scholarships to African students in newly independent socialist and communist states in the post-colonial period. Between the late 1950s and 1990, about 400,000 Africans studied in the Soviet Union. While the numbers decreased significantly after the fall of communism, Vladimir Putin recently said more than 17,000 Africans were currently enrolled in Russian universities. Shortly after joining the Luhansk militia, Sangwa was sent into combat and spent two months fighting. During that time, many of his African friends assumed that he was dead and posted goodbye messages on his social media accounts. Three days after the war started, on 27 February, Sangwa’s photo was posted online by Find Your Own, a Telegram channel created by the Ukrainian internal affairs ministry to identify captured and killed soldiers. The post said Sangwa had been killed by Ukrainian forces alongside another African soldier. “The Ukrainian enemy found my military ID card and said I was dead. I am alive, as you can see,” Sangwa said. He is currently back patrolling the streets in Luhansk as a member of the militia.     Pro-Russia forces drive past a destroyed residential building in Popasna, Luhansk, in May. Photograph: Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters   There is no evidence that apart from Sangwa and his two friends, more African soldiers have been sent to Ukraine. But while Sangwa’s story is unusual, his pro-Moscow sentiments and opinions about who is responsible for the war are mainstream in large parts of Africa. “Certainly, the west likes to think that sanctions have isolated Russia globally,” said Paul Stronski, a senior fellow and specialist on Russia at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “And they did when it comes to the transatlantic community and wealthy Asian nations. But in the eyes of the rest of the world, and particularly the African continent, Russia isn’t that isolated.” For many years, Stronski said, Moscow has been cultivating ties with African leaders, and in 2019 Putin hosted the first Russian-African summit, attended by the leaders of 43 African nations. “Many on the African continent now believe the conflict is driven by Nato expansion, by reckless western policies,” Stronski said. According to Stronski, some of Africa’s support for Russia can be explained by anti-western sentiments stemming from the legacy of European colonialism. Russia has been accused of amplifying those grievances ​​through disinformation campaigns on the continent. “In Africa, the west has also been accused of double standards, caring more about Ukraine and its refugees than it does about other tragedies unfolding in Africa and across the world,” Stronski added. Some of Putin’s most enthusiastic supporters since the start of the war have been pan-Africanists – advocates of the doctrine of African unity and anti-imperialism. Putin just “wants to get his country back,” Kémi Séba, a prominent Franco-Beninese pan-Africanist, said in early March. “He doesn’t have the blood of slavery and colonisation on his hands. He is not my messiah, but I prefer him to all the western presidents.” Similarly, a leader of the Nigerian community in Moscow told the Guardian that most Nigerians there were sympathetic to Russia. “The issue is complicated, but the west pushed Russia to do this,” he said.    A pro-Russia rally in Bangui, Central African Republic, in March. Photograph: Carol Valade/AFP/Getty Images   Beyond issues of morality, Russia has gained a foothold in Africa through developing defensive alliances, supplying weapons to authoritarian leaders with no strings attached and presenting itself as an ally against armed insurgents. Several African leaders, most notably South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, have openly said they believe western efforts to expand Nato contributed to the war. Even though African nations are likely to be disproportionately affected by the impending global food crisis owing to their strong dependence on Russian and Ukrainian wheat, some African leaders have shifted the blame for food shortages and price rises on to the west, parroting Russia’s narratives. On Friday, during a meeting with Putin in Sochi, Senegal’s president, Macky Sall, the current chair of the African Union, blamed EU sanctions on Russian banks and products for worsening the problem, and steered away from criticising Russia’s actions, including its blockade of Ukrainian ports. Despite its political clout in parts of Africa, Moscow has not yet indicated an intention to recruit soldiers from the continent or other places to bolster its forces, even though reports have emerged that Russia is facing a shortage of infantry. Kremlin officials were quick to play down reports that several hundred local men in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, had gathered outside the Russian embassy in April hoping to fight in Ukraine. Nevertheless, pro-Kremlin voices have embraced Sangwa’s presence in Luhansk as a sign of the growing military ties between Russia and Africa.   Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST  On 31 May the Telegram channel WarGonzo, led by the popular Russian propagandist Semen Pegov, posted a video of Sangwa in full military gear patrolling in Luhansk. “It is not just our Wagner guys in Congo,” Pegov said, referring to the notorious, Kremlin-linked, private military group that has propped up authoritarian leaders in Mali, Central African Republic and Sangwa’s home country, DRC. “Now our Congo guys are also in Luhansk.” "

The former German chancellor also claimed that an oligarch-run and democratically immature Ukraine would have been less prepared for an invasion then than it is now. “I would feel very bad if I had said: ‘There’s no point talking to that man [Putin]”, Merkel said in an onstage interview at the Berliner Ensemble theatre on Tuesday night – her first public appearance since leaving office half a year ago. “It is a great tragedy that it didn’t work, but I don’t blame myself for trying,” she added in an unusually frank answer from a politician who rarely spoke freely while in office. Asked about whether she regretted opposing the US-led membership action plan for Ukraine and Georgia in 2008, Merkel said: “Ukraine was not the country that we know now. It was a Ukraine that was very split … even the reformist forces [Yulia] Tymoshenko and [Viktor] Yushchenko were very at odds. That means it was not a country whose democracy was inwardly strengthened.” She said Ukraine at the time was “ruled by oligarchs”. From the Russian president’s perspective, “it was a declaration of war”. While she didn’t share Putin’s perspective, Merkel said she “knew how he thought” and “didn’t want to provoke it further”. She claimed to have blocked Ukraine’s route to membership of the military alliance with the country’s best interests at heart. “You cannot become a member of Nato from one day to the next,” Merkel said. “It’s a process, and during this process I knew Putin would have done something to Ukraine that would not have been good for it.” The Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015 were signed by then Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko to reach a political settlement in east Ukraine, but have since been criticised for forcing concessions while the country was militarily on the back foot. Merkel defended the accords, saying they bought Ukraine time. “It calmed down the matter and bought Ukraine time to develop into the country that it has become now.” She praised president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for his wartime leadership, saying he represented a new Ukraine. The interview with Der Spiegel journalist Alexander Osang began with Merkel talking about how she had spent her first weeks out of office going for solitary walks by the Baltic Sea, wearing a hoodie so as not to be recognised by passersby, and listening to an audiobook of William Shakespeare’s Macbeth. But the conversation inevitably turned to the war in Ukraine, and whether Germany’s alleged leniency towards the Kremlin had emboldened Putin. Merkel said she felt the geopolitical problems created by the collapse of the Soviet Union had been present throughout her 16 years in power. “It wasn’t possible to properly end the cold war … the Russia question always remained.” Merkel said she had started to take seriously the possibility of a looming invasion in her last few weeks in office, when she attended the G20 summit in Rome while Olaf Scholz’s successor government was still in the process of being formed.   Related: Germany agonises over Merkel’s legacy: did she hand too much power to Putin?   “There were hints and we talked about it a lot,” the 67-year-old said. “I realised that Putin had finished with the Minsk process.” While Merkel condemned Russia’s war of aggression in clear terms, she also seemed to suggest some blame needed to be apportioned to the west. “What happened is a great mistake on Russia’s behalf … an objective break with all rules of international law that allow us to coexist in Europe in peace. If we started to go through one century after another arguing which territory belongs to whom, then we would be at war non-stop. “I don’t share the opinion of Mr Putin, to make that very clear. But we didn’t manage to create a security architecture that could have prevented this [war in Ukraine]. And we should think about that too.” She rejected the criticism that Germany under her leadership had fallen for an illusion that a militarily aggressive Russia could be democratised by expanding trade links with the west. “I didn’t believe that Putin could be changed through trade,” Merkel said. But she said her belief was that if political cooperation was impossible, it was sensible to at least have some economic connections with Moscow. Merkel’s defence of expanding economic ties with Russia seemed at odds with her claiming to have warned other politicians that Putin felt animosity towards the entire western model of democracy, and that he wanted to “destroy Europe”. The former leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) conceded that European countries had failed to spend sufficiently on their militaries, even though she rejected criticism that the German army had fallen into disarray under her watch. “What should we have enforced more strongly?” she asked rhetorically when reviewing the decisions of her last two terms in office. “It [the military] is the only language that Putin understands. He saw that we, and not just Germany but others too, no longer had the strike power of the cold war.”"

After a Ukrainian counterattack over the weekend, Russian soldiers were seeking to regain the initiative. They were trying to move forward to dislodge Ukrainian fighters from their last stronghold in an industrial zone. Between 10,000 and 11,000 civilians remain in the city. The regional governor, Serhiy Haidai said tough street battles were continuing with varying degrees of success. “The situation constantly changes, but the Ukrainians are repelling attacks,” he said. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk, a few kilometres south of Sievierodonetsk, was being “totally destroyed”, he added. “Russian shelling has intensified significantly over the past 24 hours. They are using scorched-earth tactics,” he said, adding that a school and market had been hit, and a college building flattened.  Interactive  The Kremlin is keen to declare victory in Sievierodonetsk, which would give it full control of Luhansk province. When Vladimir Putin began his invasion on 24 February, he pledged to “liberate” the parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts not already in separatist hands. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, on Tuesday said 97% of the latter region was under Kremlin control. He said his troops were pushing forward from Popasna, 30km south of Sievierodonetsk. They had taken control of Lyman, Sviatohirsk and 15 other towns, he said. Nevertheless, Moscow is making slow progress overall. Seven weeks after beginning a full-scale military operation in Donbas, it has been unable to capture the key cities of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk, or to encircle Ukraine’s eastern army, as it had hoped. In its latest intelligence briefing, the Ministry of Defence said Russia’s advance from Popasna had “stalled over the last week” and that it was preparing to move towards the city of Izium to the north-west. So far, though, it had not achieved a breakthrough or been able “to translate tactical gains to operational level success”, the ministry said. With neither side prevailing on the battlefield, there seems little prospect of negotiations. Most observers in Kyiv now expect the war to continue through the summer until at least the end of the year. In an interview with the Financial Times, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, said he “simply cannot see the preconditions for ending the war”. Victory meant restoring “all” of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea – annexed by Russia in 2014 – and separatist-held areas, he suggested. The president had harsh words for his French counterpart. On Saturday, Emmanuel Macron said “we are not going to humiliate Russia” – remarks seen in Kyiv as meaning Ukraine would have to accept the further loss of sovereign territory in exchange for a peace deal with Moscow. “Some people want to be leaders. In order to be a leader, you do not need to consider yourself one, but to behave as a leader,” Zelenskiy said. He added: “How can we achieve a ceasefire in the territory of Ukraine without listening to the position of [this] country, and without listening to [the] position of the leader of this country? This is very, very surprising. “We are not going to humiliate anyone,” Zelenskiy told the newspaper. “We are going to respond in kind.”  Interactive  On other frontlines, Russia continued to shell civilian areas. Two people were killed and three wounded in an attack on the Mykolaiv region, which borders Russian-occupied Kherson. The city is hit on a daily basis. Russian fire damaged administrative buildings, a stadium and a school. Ukrainian troops have made some gains in recent weeks on this southern frontline. It appeared on Tuesday that Russia was withdrawing some of its forces from the city of Melitopol in the Zaporizhzhia region and sending them to Kherson. The city – seized in February – is now completely cut off, with residents who have fled unable to contact relatives still living there. After a short pause, Russia is again bombarding Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, in the north-east. One person was killed and three injured in the latest Russian strike, its mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said. Moscow “does not leave Kharkiv alone and constantly keeps people in fear”, he added. Nearby villages recaptured by Ukraine last month are now under constant fire. Ukraine’s general staff reported on Tuesday that Russia continued to suffer significant losses of equipment. This included 1,390 tanks, 3,416 armoured vehicles, 694 artillery pieces, 207 multiple-launch rocket systems, 125 surface-to-air missiles, 177 helicopters, 212 airplanes, 553 drones and 13 naval vessels, it said."

US officials have been battling for control and seizure of the 106-metre vessel, which features a helipad, Jacuzzi, lobster tank and sundeck managed by up to 36 crew, after claiming in court filings that the vessel was controlled by a “straw owner” meant to obscure the true beneficiary of the vessel. Lawyers for the British Virgin Islands company which is registered as the corporate owner of the yacht, known as the Amadea, have denied Kerimov was linked to the vessel, and claimed instead that it belongs to a Russian businessman, the former Rosneft boss turned private oil tycoon Eduard Khudainatov.   Related: Mystery Russian superyacht sets sail for the US after Fiji court ruling   The European Union issued sanctions against Khudainatov last Friday, citing his ties to president Vladimir Putin and former deputy prime minister, Igor Sechin. However, the EU sanctions decision did not refer to his ownership of the Amadea, or a separate $700m vessel recently seized by Italian authorities that some reports claim is linked to the businessman. Khudainatov has not personally commented on the ownership of either vessel. The legal wrangling began shortly after the Amadea arrived in Fiji waters on 13 April, following an 18-day journey from Mexico. Fiji’s supreme court said in its judgment that the vessel sailed into Fiji water without a permit, “most probably to evade prosecution by the United States”. The court ruled it was in the public interest that the yacht “sail out of Fiji waters”, because having it docked in there was “costing the Fijian government dearly”. The Fiji government had been covering the costs of maintaining the vessel – which according to some estimates runs up to $1.1m each month – while the appeal by the vessel’s registered owner, Millemarin Investments, wound its way through the courts. Neither Kerimov nor Khudainatov could be reached for comment."

Russian forces have seized residential quarters of the key eastern city of Sievierodonetsk and are fighting to take control of an industrial zone on its outskirts and the nearby towns, Shoigu said. The Luhansk governor, Serhiy Haidai, conceded that Russian forces control the industrial outskirts of the city.   Ukraine accused the Russian army of abducting about 600 residents in the Kherson region in the south of the country and keeping them in “torture chambers”. Tamila Tacheva, the Ukrainian presidency’s permanent representative in Crimea, said about 300 people, “mainly journalists and activists”, are being held in Kherson city and the rest are in other settlements in the region.   Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said fighting has taken to the streets of Sievierodonetsk while admitting that Russian forces have the numerical advantage. In his latest national address, Zelenskiy insisted that Ukraine’s forces had “every chance” of fighting back and are “standing strong”.   The Ukraine president also said he believed Russian troops intend to capture the city of Zaporizhzhia, a large industrial hub in the south-east of the country, which would allow its military to advance closer to central areas. “There are more of them, they are more powerful, but we have every chance to fight on this direction,” he said.   According to Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces, Ukrainian helicopters reportedly struck at clusters of enemy forces in the Kherson region, and planes at ammunition depots in the Mykolayiv region. “The enemy lost more than 20 people and up to 10 units of military equipment,” the report added.   One person was killed and three injured after a Russian strike hit Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, according to its mayor, Ihor Terekhov. Russia “does not leave Kharkiv alone and constantly keeps people in fear”, Terekhov said on national television.   Russia has begun handing over bodies of Ukrainian fighters killed at the Azovstal steelworks, the fortress-like plant in the destroyed city of Mariupol where their last-ditch stand became a symbol of resistance against Moscow’s invasion. Dozens of bodies have been transferred to Kyiv, where DNA testing is under way to identify the remains, according to both a military leader and a spokesperson for the Azov battalion.   Russian officials in occupied Mariupol have shut down the southern port city for quarantine over a possible cholera outbreak, according to Ukrainian authorities. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, said the Russian-occupied city is bracing itself for an epidemic as dead bodies and litter are piling up in the city.   The leader of Ukraine’s pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, has confirmed the death of a Russian general, Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov, during the war in Ukraine. A reporter of state-run Rossiya 1 earlier said Kutuzov was killed while leading forces from the Russian-controlled east into battle. If confirmed, he would be at least the fourth Russian general to have been killed in combat since February, and Ukraine claims the number is higher. Some Russian fighters have gone public with appeals to Vladimir Putin for an investigation into battlefield conditions and whether their deployments to the front are even legal. Russia’s assault on Ukraine’s east has brought it some battlefield success but there is evidence that high-level casualties are growing and some units may be approaching exhaustion.   Ukraine’s first deputy minister of agrarian policy and food, Taras Vysotskyi, said it would take six months to clear the coast of Russian and Ukrainian mines. His remarks dealt a blow to a proposal under discussion where ships leaving Ukrainian ports would be given safe escort by Turkish naval vessels.   Russian lawmakers voted to take Moscow out of the jurisdiction of the European court of human rights. The Russian state Duma approved two bills, one removing the country from the court’s jurisdiction and a second setting 16 March as the cutoff point, with rulings against Russia made after that date not to be implemented. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, declared himself “very happy” at the UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s confidence vote win. Zelenskiy described Johnson’s narrow victory on Monday evening as “great news”. In a cabinet meeting today, Johnson said Zelenskiy must not be “pressured” into accepting a bad peace deal with Russia and that Britain would “remain at the forefront” of support for Kyiv.   The former Russian president and close ally of Vladimir Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, lashed out at those who “hate” Russia, calling them “degenerates” and vowing to “make them disappear”. Medvedev, who is now deputy head of the security council, did not say who “they” were but his remarks are an example of the increasingly aggressive language used by Russian officials.   Ukraine’s state nuclear company, Energoatom, has criticised a plan by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to send a delegation to a Russian-occupied nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia, southern Ukraine, saying it “did not invite” such a visit.   The UK Ministry of Defence’s daily assessment of the situation on the ground says: “Russia’s broader plan likely continues to be to cut off the Sieverodonetsk area from both the north and the south. Russia made gains on the southern, Popasna axis through May, but its progress in the area has stalled over the last week. Reports of heavy shelling near Izium suggests Russia is preparing to make a renewed effort on the northern axis.”   Sexual violence in Ukraine remains prevalent and underreported as Russia’s invasion is “turning into a human trafficking crisis” according to the UN. “Women and children fleeing the conflict are being targeted for trafficking and exploitation,” Pramila Patten, the UN special representative on sexual violence, told a UN security council on Monday. “Sexual violence is the most consistently and massively underreported violation.”   The Ukrainian navy said it has pushed back a fleet of Russian warships more than 100km from its Black Sea coast. The group of Russian vessels were “forced to change tactics” after carrying out a naval blockade on Ukraine’s coast for weeks, the navy command of Ukraine’s armed forces said on Facebook. It has not been possible to independently verify this information.   The defence ministry in Belarus has said its armed forces have begun conducting combat-readiness training exercises.   A court in Fiji has ruled Russian-owned superyacht Amadea be removed from the Pacific island nation by the US because it was a waste of money for Fiji to maintain the vessel amid legal wrangling over its seizure. The yacht is linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov.   On Monday the European Council president, Charles Michel, accused Russia of using food supplies as “a stealth missile against developing countries” and blamed the Kremlin for the looming global food crisis. Michel’s remarks prompted Moscow’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, to walk out of a security council meeting.   Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said there were credible reports that Russia was “pilfering” Ukraine’s grain exports to sell for its own profit. Blinken said the alleged theft was part of broader Russian actions to export Ukraine’s wheat crop and worsen a global food security crisis. “Now, Russia is hoarding its food exports as well,” he said. Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy said there could be as many as 75m tonnes of grain stuck in Ukraine by autumn. "

The star ballerina, who is half Ukrainian and half Spanish, fled Moscow and her position as first soloist with the Stanislavsky Theatre on 20 April. “It was becoming morally difficult for me to continue my life in Russia, because I was in close contact with my cousin in Mariupol, who is like a brother to me,” Fernandez says, speaking from her new home in Tbilisi, Georgia. “He was telling me all the bad stuff was happening there and then I would tell my friends in Moscow and they would say, ‘No, it’s fine, they’re not killing those guys, they’re saving them’. It got to the point I couldn’t discuss the war any more.” “With the information we were getting from the news, it was some random group of Ukrainians that were killing [civilians] and committing war crimes, not the Russian soldiers. And I was surrounded by people who believed all of this.”   Related: Empty galleries and fleeing artists: Russia’s cultural uncoupling from the west   The 24-year-old is one of several dancers, choreographers, artists and composers who have fled the country or resigned from Russia’s cultural institutions in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine.  In March, Olga Smirnova, one of Russia’s biggest ballet stars, made headlines around the world when she resigned from the Bolshoi Ballet less than three weeks after the war began. “I am against this war with every fibre of my soul,” she said, before fleeing Moscow and finding immediate refuge with the Dutch national ballet. Fernandez, who was born in Switzerland, had a cousin, two uncles and her maternal grandfather still living in the south-eastern Ukrainian city when Vladimir Putin’s war began. Her bedridden grandfather died one week before the invasion of Mariupol, which fell to Russian forces on 16 May.   Related: Makeshift graves and notes on doors: the struggle to find and bury Mariupol’s dead   “I’m glad he didn’t see any of this, and it would have been impossible to evacuate him,” Fernandez says of her grandfather. “My cousin and uncles were three weeks in a bunker without enough food or water so I believe it would have been very difficult for him to stay alive anyway.” When the bunker her family was sheltering in was shelled, it was a seven-hour wait before her parents and sister in Switzerland learned that they were not among the many casualties. Fernandez is now working as a principal dancer at the State Ballet of Georgia. On 16 and 17 July, she will join an international lineup of principal dancers and soloists from as far afield as Berlin and San Francisco, for the Sydney International Ballet Gala, debuting at West HQ’s Sydney Coliseum theatre. Fernandez has spent the past six weeks settling into her new role and recovering her health. The stress and worry of the past three months had affected her eyesight. She had become dangerously thin.    ‘I thought I might have to start over from the beginning if I moved to Europe’ … Fernandez. Photograph: Irina Yakovleva   As we speak, she is completing a 30-minute workout on an elliptical trainer at the headquarters of Georgian National Opera and Ballet Theater of Tbilisi. She remains unsure but tentatively optimistic about her future. As a child, Fernandez studied at the Dance Academy Zurich before moving to the Vaganova Ballet Academy in St Petersburg, earned the distinction of becoming the first Swiss-born dancer ever hired by the Mariinsky theatre. There, she danced many solo roles before taking up the role of first soloist with Moscow’s Stanislavsky Theatre. “I worked really hard to get to this position and I thought I might have to start over from the beginning if I moved to Europe,” she says. “I am trained in the classical Russian style – we don’t have that contemporary repertoire, so I have no modern experience, which is expected in companies in Europe. “I was lucky that I found the Georgian national company, which is also very classical in repertoire, so I’m not going back to the beginning after all.” In Sydney next month, Fernandez will perform two pas de deux, from Le Corsaire and La Bayadère, with her dance partner Brazilian soloist Victor Caixeta, who, like Smirnova, recently fled Russia for the Dutch national ballet. The Australian venue for the gala, the Sydney Coliseum theatre, has faced its own challenges. The 2,000-seat lyric theatre, built to make arts and culture more accessible to greater western Sydney, opened just before Covid-19 hit. Sitting sparkling new, but in the dark for much of the past two years, in the last six months the venue has hosted the touring spectacular The Little Prince, and concerts by Sydney Symphony, Keith Urban, Tina Arena, Human Nature and Jimmy Barnes.

The two men, who are serving in the Ukrainian military, and Ibrahim Saadun, a captive from Morocco, were shown sitting in a courtroom cage reserved for defendants in a video released on pro-Russian social media channels on Tuesday. Prosecutors from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, a proxy government in east Ukraine controlled by Russia, have said that the men face the death penalty for “terrorism” and for fighting as “mercenaries” against the Russian invasion. Aslin and his fellow defendants have said they were regular soldiers fighting in the Ukrainian military and should be treated as prisoners of war.   Related: Kremlin mulls Nuremberg-style trials based on second world war tribunals   If the images from the courtroom are confirmed, the men would be the first Ukrainian soldiers to be tried by pro-Russian forces in what observers say could be a series of show trials meant to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Do you know the information in your indictment?” an interpreter asked Aslin, 28, from Newark, Nottinghamshire. “Tak tochno,” he replied, a military response meaning “affirmative”. Shaun Pinner, 48, from Watford and Bedfordshire, also said he understood the charges against him. Russian officials have threatened to hold military tribunals they have called “Nuremberg 2.0”, meant to mirror war crimes trials being held in Kyiv for atrocities committed by invading Russian soldiers. Observers say the trials may be deliberately constructed to put maximum pressure on the west and to prompt prisoner exchanges for Russian soldiers captured and tried in Ukraine. In a statement, Aslin’s family asked for privacy from the media. “This is a very sensitive and emotional time for our family, and we would like to say thank you to all that have supported us,” they said. “We are currently working with the Ukrainian government and the Foreign Office to try and bring Aiden home. Aiden is a much-loved man and very much missed, and we hope that he will be released very soon.” Ukraine has sentenced three Russian soldiers to prison for war crimes tied to the Russian offensive that began on 24 February. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was sentenced to life in prison for killing a 62-year-old civilian in Ukraine’s north-eastern Sumy region early in the war. And two soldiers, Alexander Bobikin and Alexander Ivanov, were each sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for shelling attacks on population centres that “violated the laws and customs of war”.   Related: ‘They’ve gone through hell’: fears for British prisoners of war in Ukraine   Prosecutors said Aslin and his co-defendants were charged with four separate offences: committing a crime as part of a criminal group; forcible seizure of power or forcible retention of power; being a mercenary; and the promotion of training in terrorist activities. But the two men were serving in Ukraine’s marines while taking part in the defence of Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks. Aslin, who had previous volunteered with a Kurdish militia against Islamic State fighters, ran a popular Twitter account and had been pictured being sworn into the Ukrainian armed forces. Nonetheless, both men have been paraded before television cameras since they surrendered alongside hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers in May after months spent in a desperate defence of the Ukrainian steelworks.

When not at sea, the Amadea superyacht requires a crew of 24 deckhands and engineers to keep her shipshape. In written evidence to a court in Fiji, where the vessel has been the subject of a legal battle over which Russian oligarch she belongs to, her captain listed the costly, and perishable materials: marble, gilded metal fittings, sensitive carpets, silk, precious woods and leathers, teak decking, mirror polished stainless steel and a high gloss paint system. Without the right care, and the kind of temperature and humidity controls normally used to preserve valuable artworks, the captain said the Amadea would “rapidly deteriorate”, leaving “an unsaleable hull”. He put the cost of simply keeping her in dry dock at $1.1m per month. “There are a very, very limited number of buyers who can afford her upkeep, let alone her purchase price,” he explained.   Related: US wins legal battle to seize $325m superyacht docked in Fiji   The identity of that buyer will now be settled in a US court. Seized during a voyage in the South Pacific at the request of the US authorities, the Amadea has spent the last few weeks docked in Lautoka Wharf in Fiji, awaiting the outcome of a legal dispute between the Department of Justice in the US and the British Virgin Islands company in whose name she is registered. Fiji’s supreme court ruled on Tuesday morning that the vessel could be handed to the US authorities, and the Amadea is now headed for America. Lawyers acting for a previously low-profile Russian oil boss, Eduard Khudainatov, insist he is the owner. They say he is the settlor of a trust, established under English law, which ultimately holds the vessel through a twisting trail of offshore companies. American officials allege Khudainatov is merely a stand-in. They say the Amadea belongs to one of Russia’s richest men, the gold tycoon Suleiman Kerimov, who is currently subject to western sanctions. The case is significant because America has raised the question of whether Khudainatov may be fronting as the owner of another, even more valuable mega-yacht. The $700m Scheherazade, with its six decks and two helipads, was seized in Tuscany following the invasion of Ukraine. Khudainatov is reported to hold the yacht via another offshore structure, but he has not confirmed this, leaving its true ownership even less certain than the Amadea. The Italian police are investigating claims that the vessel may ultimately belong to Vladimir Putin, who like Kerimov is now blacklisted in Europe and the US. The combined value of both yachts is $1bn. In court documents, US authorities said the fact that Khudainatov “is being held out as the owner of the two largest superyachts on record, both linked to sanctioned individuals” suggested he was being used as a “clean, unsanctioned straw owner to conceal the true beneficial owners of these vessels”. The 61-year-old businessman’s links with Putin date back to his first presidential campaign, in 2000, which Khudainatov helped organise. A one-time pig breeder from Kazakhstan, he has also been described as a friend of former deputy prime minister Igor Sechin, who succeeded him as the boss of state-owned oil giant Rosneft in 2013. Khudainatov’s oil business has acquired significant stakes in companies involved in the energy sector, together with their extraction licences, from Rosneft, according to the EU sanctions listing. And Rosneft has paid $9.6bn to Khudainatov in exchange for a company that owns an oilfield in Taymyr, in Siberia, it said. His business has grown rapidly. While US authorities admitted that Khudainatov was “wealthy” they claimed that “there is no reason to believe he has the financial resources to purchase the Amadea and the Scheherazade, or is there any apparent reason why a single individual would own multiple superyachts of their size,” according to court filings. Until last week, Khudainatov had not been placed under sanctions in any jurisdiction. On Friday, however, the European Union added him to its blacklist. It cited the benefits he gained from running a sizeable Russian oil company, but did not mention his connection to the yachts. The EU’s restrictions against the Kazakhstani businessman have yet to be mirrored by the UK and US. “Russia’s elites, up to and including President Putin, rely on complex support networks to hide, move and maintain their wealth and luxury assets,” Brian Nelson, the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the US Treasury Department, said last week. “We will continue to enforce our sanctions and expose the corrupt systems by which President Putin and his elites enrich themselves,” he added. Lawyers acting on behalf of the Amadea’s corporate owner, Millemarin Investments, said the company was established in June 2021, just a month before it was recorded as the new owner of the vessel. Millemarin, in turn, is owned by another BVI registered firm, Invest International Finance, which counts a Swiss entity, Boltenko Trust, as its sole shareholder. The trust was run by Olga Boltenko, an international tax and wealth advisor who is qualified as a solicitor in England and Wales and has worked for top British law firms including Hogan Lovells and Withers. Boltenko said in a statement released on Tuesday that she and her firm had resigned and were no longer acting for the September Trust or Millemarin Investments. But last month when she was still acting for Khudainatov Boltenko said in court documents that her firm was the trustee of the September Trust, an irrevocable, discretionary trust established in December 2019 under English law, whose settlor (the individual whose assest were placed in the trust) is Khudainatov. In her evidence, she did not name the beneficiary of the trust. However, she stated that to the best of her knowledge, Kerimov “has never held any interest in any of the companies and/or trust identified”. The US justice department contends the Amadea has belonged to Kerimov since the autumn of 2021, transferred, it claimed, in a “backdoor Russian deal”. It cited as evidence interviews of crew members and yacht industry employees conducted by an FBI agent. Crew members said “measures were taken to ensure privacy” for the yacht’s guests, according the the filing. Each member of the family had been given codenames: Kerimov was G-0, his wife G-1. The crew were shown photos of Kerimov and his family, and claimed they had been holidaying on board as recently as February 2022, in St Barts and St Maarten in the Caribbean. They said during a four-month tour this year, the family had been the “only guests onboard”. Kerimov and Khudainatov could not be reached to comment. Investigations over the Amadea’s ultimate owner is now in the hands of the US authorities. As is the fate of one of the world’s most expensive pleasure crafts."

As Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, arrived in Ankara on Tuesday, Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said in a statement that his government was making progress with the UN, Russia and Ukraine on reopening ports under Russian blockade in the Black Sea. Ships leaving Ukrainian ports would be escorted by Turkish naval vessels under the proposal being discussed. The development appeared to offer some hope as the UN warned that the war in Ukraine – a world’s fourth biggest exporter of grain – was fuelling serious shortages of food around the world and pushing millions of people into famine. According to the UN, Russia and Ukraine supply about 40% of the wheat consumed in Africa, where prices have already risen by about 23%. However, Markiyan Dmytrasevych, an adviser to Ukraine’s minister of agrarian policy and food, said on Tuesday that even if Russia lifted its blockade, thousands of mines would remain floating around the port of Odesa, and elsewhere. Dmytrasevych said that currently Ukraine was able to export a maximum of 2m tonnes of grain a month – compared with the 6m tonnes before the war – and that it would take until the end of the year to clear the mines. “I think we reached the limit,” Dmytrasevych told participants at an International Grains Council conference. “The biggest amount we can export is about 2m tonnes a month.” It is estimated that more than 20m tonnes of grain are stuck in Ukraine’s silos around Odesa due to a blockade of the port by Russian vessels. The country has faced severe capacity constraints when trying to export its grain by road, rail and river through Ukraine’s Danube ports. Ukraine’s trade representative, Taras Kachka, said the EU needed to build warehouses and extend railway tracks across the Ukrainian border. Ukraine’s railway network has, like Russia’s, a slightly wider gauge, or distance between the two rails of a railway track, than its European neighbours such as Poland. As a result, grain transported by rail has to be unloaded and put on to different trains when it reaches the border. “We are already using to the maximum the current possibilities for supply and it still very low, that is below 2m tonnes per month. In order to increase it we need to construct additional entry points to the EU, the additional lines [of railway] to cross the border, deeper into both markets,” he told the Guardian. Kachka said Ukraine was already investing in extra grain storage facilities on its border with Poland, in the northern Volyn region and in the western Lviv region, and working on extending Ukrainian railway tracks into Poland, and vice versa, at several border crossings. Turkey has offered Ukraine help to de-mine the coastal area but the government in Kyiv has not only warned of the scale of the task but is concerned that it could leave Odesa, among other key ports, open to attack. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, president of Ukraine, said in an interview with the Financial Times that while he supported the Turkish initiative, he would need assurances that Russian vessels would not be allowed to use the safe corridors. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Tuesday that the Kremlin also had its own conditions, as he offered Moscow’s guarded support for the proposed safe corridors. “This will allow ships, once checked by our military to make sure they are not carrying any weapons, to enter the ports, load grain and with our help, proceed to international waters,” he said. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the Russian-occupied ports of Berdiansk and Mariupol had already resumed their operations. “The de-mining of Mariupol’s port has been completed,” Shoigu said during an appearance on Russian television. “It is functioning normally and has received its first cargo ships.” The Russian claims over the ports at Mariupol and Berdiansk could not be independently verified, and at a UN security council meeting on Monday evening in New York, the European Council president, Charles Michel, accused Russia of using food supplies as “a stealth missile against developing countries”. Michel said Russian forces had stolen grain from occupied Ukrainian territories “while shifting the blame to others,” calling this behaviour “cowardly” and “propaganda, pure and simple”. His comments prompted the Russian ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, to walk out. Victoria Prentis, the UK’s farming ministers told an International Grains Council (IGC) conference in London on Tuesday that she had heard the allegations of grain theft by Russia, describing them as very serious. Meanwhile, on a visit to Lithuania, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said his government was ready to increase its military presence in the Baltic region in response to the war in Ukraine. “We have agreed to strengthen the eastern flank of Nato by creating a new strong brigade here,” he said. Lithuania borders Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave where the Kremlin’s Baltic Sea fleet is based. A brigade is comprised of 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers. Scholz also promised to continue supplies of necessary weapons, and troops’ training to Ukraine. He dismissed claims that Germany was hesitating with supplies of heavy weaponry, including most modern howitzers. He said: “We have far-reaching sanctions now that will set back the Russian economy by decades. That means it will not be able to participate in global economic and technological progress. We know from reports that this means that Russia will not even be able to retain its military capacities at the same level.” Gitanas Nausėda, Lithuania’s president, welcomed Scholz’s comments, saying the Russian military threat would “remain a major source of threat to regional security”."

Zelenskiy described Johnson’s narrow victory on Monday evening as “great news”, in remarks via video link to an event hosted by the Financial Times on Tuesday. “I’m glad we haven’t lost a very important ally. This is great news,” he said.
Johnson had spoken directly to Zelenskiy before the vote on Monday as Britain confirmed it would send a number of M270 rocket launchers to Ukraine and as he was desperately lobbying for support among Conservative MPs in Westminster, who backed him by 59% to 41%.
Shortly after the result, Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, said he knew what Ukraine’s president “would be thinking tonight”. He said in a TV interview: “Zelenskiy will be punching the air because he knows his great ally Boris Johnson will be prime minister tomorrow morning.”
Mikhail Podolyak, an adviser to the president’s office, tweeted supportively within a couple of minutes of the result breaking at 11pm local time in Ukraine.
“Leadership is always a heavy burden,” Podolyak said, praising Johnson for being “one of the first who realised the menace of [Russia] and stood by Zelenskiy to protect the free world from barbaric invasion. The world needs such leaders.”

Few commentators believe British support for Ukraine would alter significantly under any other Conservative leader, but Johnson and Zelenskiy have struck up a rapport during the crisis.
In an overnight statement, Zelenskiy, while not commenting on the result, thanked the prime minister for “fully understanding our needs” and providing “the weapons we so desperately need to protect the lives of our people”.
Johnson is a popular figure among Ukrainian politicians, partly because the UK is perceived to have been quick to supply weapons, in particular contrast to Germany, starting with supplying hundreds of anti-tank weapons in January, a month before Russia launched its unprovoked invasion.

Kira Rudik, an MP who leads the liberal Golos party, said the prime minister was more popular than the US president, Joe Biden. She cited Johnson’s high-security visit to Kyiv, during which he conducted a walkabout with Zelenskiy under armed guard in deserted streets. Biden has not visited since the war began.

Ukrainian politicians were particularly pleased with an apology Johnson made in May during an address to the country’s parliament. The prime minister conceded that the west had failed to respond firmly enough to Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014 and the separatist takeover of parts of the eastern Donbas region.
“This was a super important thing for us,” Rudik said, because it was one of the first times a western leader had acknowledged Ukraine faced a persistent long-term threat from Moscow that was unlikely to dissipate even if the current war ends or a ceasefire is put in place."

But those gains have come at a high price for the Russian invasion force, with evidence that high-level casualties are growing and that some units may be approaching exhaustion as the war moves past its 100-day mark. As the conflict drags on, some fighters have gone public with appeals to Vladimir Putin for an investigation into battlefield conditions and whether their deployments to the front are even legal. In two videos, fighters from Russian-controlled east Ukraine complained about poor conditions and long terms of duty at the front leading to exhaustion. “Our personnel have faced hunger and cold,” said fighters from the Russian-controlled 113th regiment from Donetsk in one video posted online. “For a significant period, we were without any material, medical or food support.” The fighters added: “Given our continuous presence and the fact that amongst our personnel there are people with chronic medical issues, people with mental issues, many questions arise that are ignored by the higher-ups at headquarters.” And in an interview, a Russian soldier who had fought near Kyiv, Kharkiv, and was now in eastern Ukraine, complained of exhaustion, saying he had even contacted a lawyer and complained that he had not seen his wife for months. “I have been fighting in Ukraine since the start of the war, it has been over three months now,” Andrei, who serves with the 37th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade headquartered in Buryatia in Siberia, told the Guardian. “It is exhausting, my whole unit wants a break, but our leadership said they can’t replace us right now.”    Pro-Russian troops drive a tank in the Donetsk region last month. Photograph: Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters   His remarks are consistent with reports of Russian difficulties in rotating out its exhausted troops. Enlistment efforts have been hampered as Russia has not openly declared war against Ukraine. The Kremlin has continued to insist on calling it a “special military operation”. “The Russian military is well suited to short, high-intensity campaigns defined by a heavy use of artillery,” wrote Michael Kofman and Rob Lee in a new analysis of Russia’s armed capabilities. “By contrast, it is poorly designed for a sustained occupation, or a grinding war of attrition, that would require a large share of Russia’s ground forces, which is exactly the conflict it has found itself in. The Russian military doesn’t have the numbers available to easily adjust or to rotate forces if a substantial amount of combat power gets tied down in a war.” For the men on the ground, that has meant an exhausting tour of duty marked by bitter fighting against a battle-hardened enemy that is motivated to defend its homeland. “The three months of fighting already feel longer than the four years I spent serving in the army during peacetime,” said Andrei. “I have already contacted a lawyer online who told me that by law the general can keep us here until our contract runs out so there isn’t much we can do.” Those professional units may be some of Russia’s more fortunate, as others recruited from the Russian-controlled republics in Donetsk and Luhansk say they have been thrown into battle with little training at all. Videos have showed that some fighters have lacked basic kit such as protective vests and are armed with old rifles. “Our mobilisation was done unlawfully, without medical certification,” said another soldier who claimed to be serving in Donetsk’s 107th regiment, loyal to the Russian government. “Over 70% of those here were previously decommissioned because they physically can’t fight. Over 90% have never fought before and saw a Kalashnikov for the first time. We were thrown on to the frontlines.” Russian state television has claimed that those soldiers should be ready to fight for their homeland, but locals have described empty streets and men in hiding to avoid a zealous recruiting campaign in Russian-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine.

A reporter for state-run Rossiya-1 said that Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov was killed while leading forces from the Russian-controlled east into battle. If confirmed, he would be at least the fourth Russian general to have been killed in combat since February, and Ukraine claims the number is higher. “The general had led soldiers into attack, as if there are not enough colonels,” wrote Russian journalist Alexander Sladkov in a post on Telegram. Western officials have said that Russia’s mid and junior ranking officers have also taken heavy casualties “because they are held to an uncompromising level of responsibility for their units’ performance”. “Similarly, junior officers have had to lead the lowest level tactical actions, as the army lacks the cadre of highly trained and empowered noncommissioned officers who fulfil that role in western forces,” British intelligence claimed last week. Russia has also used paid fighters to bolster its forces since the start of the war. It was estimated to have deployed between 10,000 and 20,000 mercenaries, including Wagner Group fighters, in its offensive in Donbas, a European official said in April. Those units have also reported high-profile casualties. Vladimir Andanov, a veteran Wagner soldier from Buryatia, was reported to have been killed in fighting in east Ukraine late last week. His death was confirmed by regional media and Russian military organisations. He had previously fought in Syria and Donbas, where he had been accused of participation in extrajudicial killings. Last month, two alleged Wagner Group fighters from Belarus were accused of murdering civilians near Kyiv, making them the first international mercenaries to face war crimes charges in Ukraine."

The win has brought joy to at least one small business in a country under bombardment. The number of small wine producers in Ukraine started to grow after Russia’s first intervention in 2014. In early 2015, Ukraine’s currency devalued by two-thirds, making imported goods expensive and prompting a burst of Ukraine-made consumer goods such as clothes, food and furniture.    The winery employs at most 17 people during the harvest season. Photograph: PR   Beykush winery is near the town of Ochakiv, in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region. It is still under Ukrainian control but Russian forces have set their eyes on the area, which is home to a strategic naval base. This is the third year Beykush has submitted its wine. As exporting alcohol from Ukraine is expensive and difficult and visas for Ukrainians into the UK until recently near impossible, Tsybak and her team went to great lengths to get bottles to Decanter judges. Two years ago they sent some bottles with a Ukrainian diplomat flying to London. Last year, they drove their wine case by case to Spain and then shipped it to the UK. This year they sent it to Hungary. They moved six cases over the border, one at a time. But their friend in Hungary was then unable to take it to the UK. By that time, the war had started in Ukraine and so a friend stepped in to help. “A Ukrainian who lives in London offered to fly to Hungary with two suitcases. He filled them up with 30 bottles and took them to the UK,” said Tsybak. Tsybak has recently secured an importer in the UK. The wines the winery sent to western Ukraine are now in a van making its way across Europe. Russia now controls Ukraine’s eastern sealine and a senior Russian commander has said it wants to take the whole Black Sea coast. Its warships have blocked Ukrainian ports.

Photograph: Handout   “Our region is shelled regularly so we just work when we can,” said Tsybak. “There was a while when we didn’t have access to our warehouse because of the fighting. As soon as we got access, we put as much as we could in a lorry and shipped into western Ukraine.” Beykush employs at most 17 people at a time during harvest season. The owner, businessman Eugene Shneyderis, originally from the Mykolaiv region, developed a taste for wine on holiday with his family. In 2013 he decided to see what grapes would grow in Mykolaiv. The family bought seeds from across Europe and inside Ukraine and eventually developed their own grape. Fifty wines were awarded gold by expert judges flown into London. A total of 18,244 producers worldwide submitted their wines. The tasting at the Decanter awards is blind, so the judges had no idea they would be the bearers of rare good news for a war-struck producer.  On 4 March the organisation issued a statement condemning Russia’s invasion, cancelling the entries of Russian producers and waiving the fees for Ukrainian entrants. “We realise that the world’s winemakers have more that unites than divides them, but we feel we have to make a stand,” Decanter said. “All of us at Decanter and the DWWA are hoping and praying for a peaceful resolution to this situation, and we send our very best wishes to all those affected.” • This article was amended on 8 June 2022. This is not the first year that a Ukrainian wine has won gold at Decanter World Wines awards; Shabo wines in the Odesa region won two gold awards in 2021."

The rivulets, which used to occur naturally until industrial agriculture plugged the small rivers that fed them, are a busy through-route for billions of small fish, which winter in the sea then return to the lagoons to breed. This year, there will be no digging. The beaches are now littered with mines, laid by the Ukrainian army to ward off a Russian offensive. Researchers have had to abandon decades of work, and the consequences for the more than 5,000 herons that feed in the lagoons each spring could be disastrous. “For 30 years, we organised scientists to do restoration in this area, to save this steppe and support this exchange of water. Now there is no entrance from the Black Sea, no migration of these fish, and the egrets need to eat them,” says Ivan Rusev, the park’s head of research. “It really is a tragedy.”    A little egret, which may struggle to feed in the lagoons without the work of conservationists to restore habitats.      Photograph: Serhii Ryzhkov/Alamy   It is just one of innumerable environmental casualties in Ukraine, many of which will persist in a country already devastated by the human and economic toll of war for years after the conflict ends. With some of the most intense fighting occurring on the southern coast, experts warn that marine and wetland environments along the Black and Azov Seas face a particular threat. Oleksandr Krasnolutskyi, Ukraine’s deputy minister of environmental protection and natural resources, says: “Almost 400,000 hectares and 14 Ramsar sites [wetlands designated to be of international importance by Unesco] along the coastline and lower reaches of the Dnipro river are under threat.”  There are already estimated to be billions of dollars of damage, he says, adding that their concerns have a precedent: when Russia first invaded in 2014, annexing Crimea and supporting a separatist war in the Donbas, the Kremlin used another ecologically sensitive area – the Kryva Kosa spit, in the Meotyda national park – as a landing zone for troops, destroying the largest European nesting site for the endangered Pallas’s gull almost overnight. Rusev has counted more than 200 bombs hitting the lagoons, disturbing water birds such as avocets and Dalmatian pelicans during critical migration and nesting periods. “Normally, we have between 1,000 and 1,500 white pelicans, which migrate from Africa,” he says. “Now, we only have 300. They are very disturbed by the bombing.”    Dolphins found along the coast of the Black Sea had suffered burns from explosions and other injuries to organs used for orientation. They also showed signs of starvation. Photograph: Kosta Atanasov   Dead dolphins have also been washing up in huge numbers on Black Sea beaches, not just in Ukraine but also in Turkey and Bulgaria. Researchers suggest sound pollution is likely to be a factor in their deaths, including possible sonar interference from the Russian navy ships along the coast. Bomb craters also threaten coastal life. Invasive species take advantage of freshly exposed sand, while chemicals can alter the makeup of the soil in fragile dune ecosystems, seeping into lagoons and the sea.   Very few people really worry about this, but I am the voice of the voiceless nature. I will fight to the end  Ivan Rusev, Tuzly Lagoons national park    Doug Weir, research and policy director at the UK-based Conflict and Environment Observatory, said: “Generally, in commercial weapons, you find heavy metals and TNT, RDX, HMX [chemicals in explosives]. “Heavy metals are very persistent in the environment. Most of the explosives are toxic to some degree. And some – like TNT – break down on exposure to light into other toxic chemicals.” While the harm caused by these pollutants may not be immediately apparent, one of the most visible examples of damage to Ukraine’s coastline is the Kinburn Spit, a 25-mile (40km) stretch of sand in the Ramsar-designated Black Sea biosphere reserve. In early May, rockets caused fires – which burned for more than a week and were visible from space – over more than 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres).  The fires also highlighted a wider consequence of war: the absence of environmental governance. Protected environments are not only threatened by fighting but also by conservationists’ inability to access war-torn areas.  “Obviously the fire would have been brought under control and put out quicker under normal conditions,” Weir says. “Most protected environments are heavily managed sites, and they tend to be imbalanced ecosystems for whatever reason – be it pollution or overfishing. And that loss of oversight and support can have severe impacts.” Similarly, Rusev says he and his team have been unable to survey the extent of the harm to the Black Sea’s dolphins, because they cannot reach large stretches of Ukrainian coastline, and cannot say how many dolphins have been stranded.  He estimates up to 2,000 may have been affected. “It’s a tragedy because we have a very small population of three species of dolphin, so any individual is a rare individual,” Rusev says.    The Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, where large stores of sulfite are at risk of leaking. Photograph: Pictorial Press /Alamy   Remote monitoring also posed similar challenges around the Azovstal steel plant, Ukraine’s last stronghold in Mariupol, where large stores of sulfite could leak. “Because the Azov and Black Sea are enclosed, they’re particularly susceptible to pollution pressures,” Weir says. “On satellite images, it looks like the potentially sulfite-rich area has been increasing, but we can’t say for certain.” Ukraine is determined to seek accountability for all of this damage. Vira Porieva, who is coordinating a taskforce collecting evidence of war crimes against bodies of water, is part of a wider group preparing an environmental case against Russia. In theory, the international criminal court can prosecute intentional attacks that knowingly cause “widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment”.   Related:  Ukraine war deals ‘massive blow’ to nature as Belarus’s largest wildlife NGO shut down   Thanks to an international grant, Porieva’s team have collected and analysed water samples from the Melitopol and Berdyansk regions to evaluate the war’s impact on quality. “Thanks to brave national park inspectors, who stay in Russian-occupied regions, we can do this work,” she says. Preliminary results are expected in two months, but even with evidence, prosecuting environmental war crimes under the ICC’s definition is considered virtually impossible. In the Tuzly Lagoons, the shelling continues. But Rusev works tirelessly at as many of his usual duties as he can, recording the damage where he finds it. “Yesterday there were several bombs nearby – people are safe, but animals were disturbed again,” he says.  “Very few people really worry about this, but I am the voice of voiceless nature. I will fight to the end.”"

One huge metal structure alone contains a quarter of a million tonnes of grain, yet represents just over 1% of the estimated 20m tonnes trapped in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in late February. Hundreds more of these “grain elevators” are scattered across the world’s fifth-biggest wheat exporting country: next to roads, at railway terminals, and at ports. Yet still full of last year’s harvest, these towers are already almost at capacity. In just over a month the spring harvest gets under way, when farmers begin collecting the winter wheat, which will need to find its way to Ukraine’s grain silos. Meanwhile, inflation is soaring, countries such as India are blocking wheat exports, and the risk of famine is growing.   Given the vast quantities involved, the majority of Ukrainian grain has always been transported by sea   Pressure is building for an international agreement on a rescue mission for Ukraine’s grain, which is desperately needed to feed the world, and which Kyiv urgently wants to sell to get its hands on vital foreign currency. Ukraine produces as much as half the world’s sunflower seeds, a tenth of its wheat and up to a fifth of barley and rapeseed. As well as a huge diplomatic effort, rescuing Ukraine’s grain also represents a vexing logistical challenge. Given the vast quantities involved, the majority of Ukrainian grain has always been transported by sea rather than road or rail. Turkey – which has the authority over sea traffic entering and leaving the Black Sea – is thought to be leading conversations with Russia about proposals to allow grain ships from Ukraine through a naval corridor to the Bosphorus. However, several problems need to be solved to ensure the safe transport of Ukrainian crops, beyond international agreements, from ship and crew capacity to the availability of insurance. When Russia launched its full invasion of Ukraine, it blockaded the country’s Black Sea ports including Odesa, preventing any ships from leaving or entering harbours. In addition, the surrounding waters have been filled with floating mines. De-mining the waters would be required for any kind of grain corridor. Then there is the challenge of finding the armada of vessels to transport the grain. Agricultural goods are moved between continents in bulk cargo vessels, which can hold as much as 50,000 tonnes, poured into several large compartments in the ship’s hold. If an estimated 20m tonnes of grain were to be transported, as many as 400 suitable ships would be required. However, shipping analysts say vessel availability should not be a limiting factor, although it would require some time for these bulk carriers to reroute and sail to the Black Sea from their current locations. “Before the war, more than 90% of all Ukrainian agri-food export was done by sea,” said Mariia Didukh, director of the Ukrainian National Agrarian Forum, which represents the country’s largest food producing organisations. Export figures underline the scale of the challenge: before the war, between 5m and 6m tonnes of grain were exported each month from Ukraine’s seaports, according to the International Grains Council, an intergovernmental organisation that seeks to promote cooperation in the global grain trade.    In just over a month the spring harvest will get under way in Ukraine. Photograph: Khaled Elfiqi/EPA   According to Didukh, only a fifth of normal monthly export levels has been transported out of the country by alternate means during the first three months of the war, representing just 1.2m tonnes of grains, sunflower oil and all other agricultural exports. “We have been developing alternative routes for export including railway, trucks, and some Danube ports in Romania,” she said. “By railway or trucks it is more expensive, it is longer and very, very small capacities. It is unreal for us.” Rail and road are also fraught with logistical challenges. The Ukrainian railway network has, like Russia, a slightly wider gauge, or distance between the two rails of a railway track, than its European neighbours such as Poland or Romania. This means grain transported by rail has to be unloaded and put on a different train when it reaches Ukraine’s European borders. The Guardian understands that three Ukrainian ports are being considered for departures of grain ships: not only Odesa but also the neighbouring ports of Yuzhne to the west, and Chornomorsk to the east. A shipping company source working in Ukraine said much needs to be done to ensure the safety of any transport, once the sea close to the coast has been swept for mines, including the provision of adequate insurance to cover the vessel and the crew. According to the source, even Russian government assurances to ships using the naval corridor might not persuade all shipowners to undertake a mission. “There is a lot of money to be made and some companies are more relaxed about taking on more risk,” the source said.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  The availability of war insurance, to cover both ship and crew, will also be a determining factor in the success of any grain corridor. The influential London-based Joint War Committee designated Russian and Ukrainian waters in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov as “listed areas” in February, meaning that shipowners are required to notify insurance underwriters if they are travelling there. This also means that additional premiums are charged. Even if suitable “war insurance” could be arranged, some shipping industry representatives are not convinced a grain corridor can be arranged quickly. “I think it is an unlikely prospect for the time being. You have got to be sure that your ship is not going to be targeted,” said Guy Platten, the secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping. “So many things would have to put in place before any shipowner is going to take the charter, and would need so many assurances before ships would move up there.” He added that about 100 ships, and 2,000 crew with 20 different nationalities were “in the wrong place at the wrong time” when Russia invaded, and have been stuck in Ukraine’s ports ever since. It has taken time but now more than three-quarters of these seafarers have been evacuated to safety, although about 450 remain onboard.   Ukraine’s agriculture industry and food analysts estimate the world has 10 weeks to find a solution   “There are lots of steps that would have to happen before ships were to trade there again, and there are going to be huge premiums in place,” Platten said. “Every shipowner will look at the risk and the reward.” While international talks continue, the clock is ticking. Ukraine’s agriculture industry and food analysts estimate the world has 10 weeks to find a solution, before the spring harvest will need to take its place in the country’s grain silos. Discussions about time pressure are likely to dominate at the annual meeting of the International Grains Council, which counts Russia and Ukraine as members, when it meets in London on Tuesday. A failure to arrange a grain corridor could also have lasting repercussions for countries such as Egypt, who are reliant on Ukrainian imports.    Egypt relies on grain supplies from Ukraine. Photograph: Khaled Elfiqi/EPA   “The question will be for harvest ‘23,” said Arnaud Petit, the executive director of the International Grains Council. “If Ukrainian farmers see that the capacity of export from Ukraine is very limited, they will limit production for harvest ‘23, and that would mean that would mean we are looking at not only one year but two years of market disruptions, that would be the worst-case scenario.”"

Olga Volkona, a TV presenter, was preparing to interview a military expert. In a nearby room, reporters were posting content to Telegram, YouTube and Facebook. Others were preparing for the launch next week of an online newspaper. The channel, February Morning, has one ambitious and seemingly impossible goal: to topple Vladimir Putin. Unlike other media outlets operating in Ukraine, it is exclusively aimed at an audience living in Russia. Its 70 staff are Ukrainian and Russian. Some of them work in provincial Russian towns, as part of an undercover network. The channel’s founder, Ilya Ponomarev, used to be a member of Russia’s parliament. In 2014 he was the only deputy to vote against the annexation of Crimea. A vengeful Kremlin then chucked him out of the Duma and barred him when he was on a trip to the US from re-entering his own country. Based in Kyiv, he became a Ukrainian citizen in 2019. “I love this idea,” Ponomarev said, pointing to the white-blue-white flag that forms the channel’s live studio backdrop. It is the Russian tricolour “minus the red blood”, he said. It was also the flag of Veliky Novgorod, one of Russia’s oldest cities, famed for its medieval democracy until its takeover by Ivan the Terrible.    Anchor Olga Volkova going live on Outro Fevrale TV station studio in central Kyiv, Ukraine, which was founded by former Duma deputy Illia Ponomariov Photograph: Anastasia Taylor-Lind/The Guardian   The most effective way of ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is to bring down the regime in Moscow, Ponomarev said. With Putin in power, there is every prospect the conflict could drag on for years, even decades. “Our job at the end of the day is an uprising of the masses,” he said. “We need individuals to see they are not alone.” Ponomarev conceded it would be difficult to persuade Russians conditioned by years of state TV propaganda to turn on their government. But he said there were two groups who formed a promising constituency. One was younger urban liberals and supporters of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Many have recently emigrated. The other was Russia’s frustrated working class, fed up with corruption and misrule. Often leftwing and largely disorganised, they had not fled abroad and were more likely to carry out acts of civil disobedience, he said. Since February, activists have burned down several Russian military recruitment offices, tasked with sending soldiers to Ukraine.

Photograph: Anastasia Taylor-Lind/The Guardian   The former MP claimed “limited” credit for these mini-attacks, which have featured extensively on February Morning’s media outlet, Rospartizan. The channel gives tips on bomb making and how to thwart Russia’s FSB spy agency by turning off mobile phone location settings. These “small tricks” were taught in the early Putin era at left-faction summer camps, he said. Russia’s opposition is famous for its internal feuds and backbiting. Ponomarev has previously been critical of Navalny. He described him as an ally in the struggle to get rid of Putin but alleged that Navalny’s controlling tendencies made him unfit to be president. Ponomarev said his vision was of a decentralised bottom-up Russia where local communities make their own decisions.   Related: Defiant to the last, Moscow’s media star takes aim at Putin’s brutal clampdown    February Morning’s Ukrainian chief editor, Larisa Rybalchenko, said it would take time before she and her editorial colleagues change Russian society. “It will be a long journey. There is a lot of disinformation out there, especially about the war. But it’s essential for Russia and for Ukraine,” she said. Last week Russian troops seized her home town, Svitlodarsk, in the Donetsk region. Since the invasion, the Kremlin has launched an unprecedented media crackdown. It has closed down the country’s last independent sources of news, including the paper Novaya Gazeta, the radio station Echo Moskvy and the TV channel Rain. Numerous journalists have been branded “foreign agents”. Using the word “war” is a criminal offence; the Kremlin term is “special operation”. Ponomarev said he was looking for western sources of funding for his channel. But he said London and Washington were wary of promoting “regime change” in Russia, even though that is what they privately want. The Biden administration is providing Kyiv with $40bn in arms and humanitarian aid. It says it is not trying to remove Putin. Asked whether he was now a foreign agent in the eyes of the Kremlin, Ponomarev said: “I would be proud if they called me that. Terrorist, extremist, it’s an act of recognition.” He added: “Unfortunately they are really smart. They have ensured there are no visible political figures among leftists and nationalists. We need to offer a credible vision for Russia’s future.” The channel wants to build a second studio on its balcony, which overlooks central Kyiv and a sky of screeching summer swifts. The news operation costs $1m a year. Ponomarev said he covered running costs himself, from funds accumulated during a successful career as a Silicon Valley investor. His own political views were those of a “left-libertarian anarchist”, he said. The young rebels plotting in tiny groups against the mighty Russian state were similar to the social revolutionaries of more than a century ago, he said. They fought to bring down the tsar and to give land to the peasants. In February 1917 they succeeded in removing the government – only to see the Bolsheviks and Lenin take over the revolution and seize power. “Elites in Russia are dissatisfied. But right now they are not scared enough,” said Ponomarev. “They need to see the ghost of 1917.”"

Oleksiy Arestovych, a military adviser to the president’s chief of staff, told the Guardian that while he believed the rocket launchers were “a gamechanger weapon”, not enough had been committed to turn the tide in the war. “The fewer we get, the worse our situation will be. Our troops will continue to die and we will continue to lose ground,” Arestovych said, particularly if countries with dozens of systems only “decide to donate four or five”.   Related: UK to send long-range rocket artillery to Ukraine despite Russian threats   On Monday Britain said it would donate a handful of M270 tracked rocket launchers, carrying missiles with a range of about 50 miles, a few days after the US said it would donate four similar truck-based high mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars). Arestovych said Ukraine needed many times more multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), which have a range far greater than anything in the country’s existing arsenal. “If we get 60 of these systems then the Russians will lose all ability to advance anywhere, they will be stopped dead in their tracks. If we get 40 they will advance, albeit very slowly with heavy casualties; with 20 they will continue to advance with higher casualties than now,” he said. The US army has 363 Himars and 225 M270 rocket launchers, and the US Marines have a further 47, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, while the UK has 35 of its version of the M270s – indicating there could be capacity to supply more to Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly said it will intensify its offensive in Ukraine if the longer-range rockets are delivered. Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said on Monday: “The longer the range of weapons you supply, the farther away the line from where neo-Nazis [the Ukrainians] could threaten the Russian Federation will be pushed.” On Sunday Vladimir Putin said Moscow would strike “fresh targets” in Ukraine if the west stepped up its weapons deliveries. Early on Sunday morning Russia launched a cruise missile strike on a railway depot in an eastern suburb of Kyiv, the first time the capital had been struck in more than five weeks. The latest public lobbying from Ukraine came as a battle for control raged in the small eastern city of Sievierodonetsk, with Kyiv’s forces trying to mount a counterattack after Russia nearly succeeded in capturing it at the end of last week. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, where the city is situated, said on Monday morning that “the situation has worsened a little for us”, having reached a point where Ukrainian forces had “liberated almost half of the city”. Later on Monday Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, struck a more pessimistic note, telling journalists in Kyiv that while his country’s forces were holding out, “there are more of them [Russians] and they are stronger”. Ukraine’s military losses have been estimated by insiders at 150 deaths a day and 800 wounded. Haidai said shelling had increased tenfold in Sievierodonetsk and neighbouring Lysychansk, still held by Ukraine, and there were other reports of intense fighting involving machine gun, mortar and artillery fire and thousands of troops. Overnight it emerged that Zelenskiy had visited nearby frontlines on Sunday to raise soldiers’ morale. The president revealed he had taken a risky trip to Lysychansk and nearby Soledar that at one point took him a couple of kilometres from Russian positions. “We also brought you something from them,” Zelenskiy added in a selfie video released in the small hours. “It is important. We brought confidence. And strength. I wish them health. Low bow to their parents. I wish victory to all of us.”    Volodymyr Zelenskiy with service members on his visit to Bakhmut and Lysychansk districts. Photograph: Ukrainian presidential press service/AFP/Getty Images   Arestovych said Zelenskiy had wanted to “display support for the troops” because the fighting in the Donbas area was “pretty hard for us”. The president also wanted to repel “Russian disinformation” that he “sits in his bunker in Kyiv and couldn’t care less about the frontline”. Ukrainian strategists said they had tried to lure Russian forces into overextending themselves in Sievierodonetsk, in the hope of blunting the operational effectiveness of the invading force. Although 120 Russian battalions remain inside Ukraine, Kyiv believes they are operating at 40% or 50% strength at present. Russia, however, has been making slow but steady progress in the Donbas region, advancing at a rate of about 500 metres to 1km a day in recent weeks, largely by concentrating its efforts on an increasingly small portion of the frontline: in the area around Sievierodonetsk, where there is a bulge in Ukraine’s positions. Arestovych said Ukraine’s principal problem was that while it was able to inflict casualties on the Russians and blunt their advances in the Donbas and across a 800-mile (1,300km) frontline, it was far more difficult to push back the occupiers. Militaries typically need to secure a 3:1 battlefield advantage or more to have a prospect of victory. “We need four to five brigades of heavy weaponry to be able to conduct a proper counter-offensive and to make it successful. We have the manpower, we don’t have the armaments,” Arestovych said. “To be on an offensive is about five times harder than being on the defensive.” The adviser said his greatest fear was that the west would stop sending weapons to Ukraine, “because that will be going back to the original situation prior to the war, of long and static frontlines, this time three times more of our land having been captured than before”.

There was no word on the reported deaths from the Ukrainian side. In Russia, the governor of the Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, said the village of Tyotkino, near the border with Ukraine, had come under fire from the Ukrainian side that had targeted a bridge and some businesses on Monday morning."

Kaja Kallas also criticised the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for trying to provide Vladimir Putin with a diplomatic way out of the conflict, saying the only effect was to give the Russian leader the belief that he will not be isolated or face justice for his army’s war crimes. “We are at a point when sanctions start to hurt our side,” said Kallas, who has gained a growing reputation for standing up to Putin. “At first the sanctions were only difficult for Russia but now we are coming to a point when the sanctions are painful for our own countries, and now the question is how much pain are we willing to endure. It is different for different countries. The unity is very hard to keep. It is getting more and more difficult because of high inflation, and energy prices.” She added: “Gas might be expensive, but freedom is priceless. People living in the free world do not really understand that.” She said that as a teenager she had been liberated from a Russian totalitarian prison – Estonia was annexed by the USSR until 1991. “I know what it feels like and this is the experience of central and eastern countries,” she said. “But this is an experience that some western European countries do not have, so the values might go out of the window as soon as you feel the pain on your side.” Estonia has the highest inflation in the EU, and Kallas’s coalition government collapsed last Friday leading her to scramble to form a new government in alliance with social democrats. Kallas criticised Macron for talking to Putin, whom she accused of committing war crimes. “I do not see any point in talking to him if we want to get the message through that he is isolated and the message that he will not escape unpunished for this and will be held accountable for all the crimes committed,” she said. “I am very worried by the premature calls for a ceasefire or peace, since a ceasefire does not mean the atrocities will end in the occupied territories. We have already made this mistake three times, in Georgia, Donbas and Crimea, and we cannot make this mistake again.” She said by the end of the Soviet occupation of Estonia the proportion of Russians in the population had risen from 2% to 30%, and she feared the same fate in Russian-occupied Ukraine. Macron recently repeated his view that Putin must not be humiliated, underlining the divisions between those who say Putin must be defeated and be seen to be defeated, and those who say simply he must not win. Kallas said: “Putin can well save his face by going back to Russia because his forces are in a sovereign country.” She also said she was afraid there was not going to be a EU embargo on Russian gas any time soon, but she had proposed an alternative to Germany – that it stop paying Moscow for its Russian gas purchases, and instead put the money into an escrow account that goes towards reparations and the rebuilding of Ukraine. She said “this would send a clear signal to Russia that for every building you destroy, you are going to have to pay for this”. Kallas is due to meet the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Tuesday when she will stress to Berlin that the EU is making the right decisions, but at too slow a pace for Ukraine. Kallas, in London to see Boris Johnson and other UK ministers, said that if her plans to form a new coalition failed, her government was likely to be replaced by another coalition that included rightwing extremists who sympathise with Russia, oppose Ukrainian refugees and still do not recognise that Joe Biden was elected as US president legitimately. Kallas felt forced to collapse her coalition with the Centre party last Friday after weeks of rows over preschool education and welfare benefits, leaving the Centre party to look for allies on the far right to try to form a majority government. She said the far right in Estonia “use the same speaking points as Vladimir Putin, opposing Ukrainian refugees and claiming this is all war hysteria”.

86,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jun/06/ukraine-uk-justice-ministry-more-support-icc-war-crimes-investigation,2022-06-06T12:18:03Z,Ukraine: UK justice ministry offers more support for ICC war crimes investigation,"The UK Ministry of Justice has announced a second tranche of support for the international criminal court’s (ICC) investigations into war crimes in Ukraine, including the deployment of a specialist legal and police team. Karim Khan QC, the court’s chief prosecutor, was due in London on Monday to provide an update on the progress of the investigation, although his trip was later cancelled due to illness. The deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, will present further support to the independent investigation on top of the £1m of funding provided earlier this year. The package includes a police liaison officer based in The Hague to lead on information sharing between the UK and the ICC, and seven legal experts to support the ICC with expertise in international criminal law and the handling of evidence to be presented to court.   Related: Karim Khan: the ‘very modern British barrister’ heading ICC’s Russia inquiry   The UK will also provide two police officers with expertise in the collection of intelligence through publicly available data sources, ongoing defence analysis and monitoring of events in Ukraine, as well as war crimes investigation training to Ukrainian police on behalf of the ICC, in collaboration with Norwegian police. “The UK has responded swiftly to a request from the international criminal court for more police and lawyers to aid their investigation into Russian war crimes in Ukraine,” Raab said. “Russian forces should know that they will be held to account for their actions and the global community will work together to ensure justice is served.” The attorney general, Suella Braverman, added: “Following my appointment of war crimes expert Sir Howard Morrison as an independent adviser to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office, I am determined that British expertise continues to be available to our friends in Ukraine in their search for justice. “We will stand side by side as they uncover the truth and hold those responsible in Putin’s regime to account for their actions.” The ICC launched its war crimes investigation into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in March after an unprecedented number of countries backed the move and Boris Johnson called the military intervention “abhorrent”. The referral by 39 countries shaved several months off the process because it allowed Khan to bypass the need to seek the approval of the court in The Hague. The British lawyer previously said the push for an inquiry by so many countries “allows us to jump-start investigations” and came on top of “evidence of international concern over events on the ground in Ukraine”. “Individuals have rights to have their interests vindicated and for justice to prevail,” he said. “That can only take place if evidence is independently and impartially collected and assessed and then, in due course, decisions can be made regarding whether or not there’s criminal responsibility, and then the judges ultimately will decide.” The ICC investigation will look back as far as 21 November 2013, when Ukraine’s then president – Viktor Yanukovych – rejected closer integration with the EU, leading to huge protests that precipitated Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Earlier this month, Braverman visited Ukraine and led a delegation of war crimes experts to the region to support the work of the Ukrainian prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, the Ministry of Justice said. It added that officers from the Metropolitan police’s counterterrorism unit would “continue to provide forensic and technical capabilities, such as biometrics and examination of digital devices”, as evidence is gathered from potential witnesses in the UK. The Ministry of Justice is also accelerating conversations with City law firms and barristers to prepare for deployment at a later stage of the investigation."
87,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/06/ukrainian-partisan-attacks-surge-russia,2022-06-06T09:45:13Z,‘The occupier should never feel safe’: rise in partisan attacks in Ukraine,"Ukrainian partisans in occupied areas of the country are increasing attacks and sabotage efforts on Russian forces and their local collaborators, with organised underground efforts appearing to spread. Six Russian border guarders were reportedly killed last week when their position came under fire near the Zernovo border checkpoint in Ukraine’s north. Two days later an explosion struck close to the office of Yevgeny Balitsky, a pro-Kremlin Ukrainian official in Melitopol. The increase in partisan warfare, particularly in the country’s south around Kherson, follows warnings at the outset of Russia’s war against Ukraine that any area under occupation was likely to see the emergence of guerrilla warfare. The subject is one of the murkiest of the war in Ukraine. Both sides have an interest in exaggerating its prevalence: the Russians to justify crackdowns in areas they occupy and the Ukrainians to demoralise Russian troops. Also complicating the issue is assessing the extent to which attacks are being carried out by Ukrainian military sabotage groups or homegrown resistance groups. Partisans are usually defined as members of an armed group formed to fight secretly against an occupying force, for instance in Nazi-occupied Europe. The term holds more positive connotations than insurgent. The Melitopol incident, involving a car packed full of explosives, was significant enough to focus renewed attention on a phenomenon that has been occurring since almost the beginning of the war.   Related: Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 103 of the invasion   Some analysts believe they are seeing evidence that partisan activity in Ukraine is escalating. Among them is Alexander Motyl, a historian and Ukraine expert at Rutgers University. Writing for the defence-focused website 1945 last week, Motyl noted: “I gathered the data from Ukrainian websites that explicitly identified the perpetrators of these actions as partisans. “It is, of course, possible that Ukrainian special forces may have been involved in some of these actions; it is also likely that the data are incomplete, inasmuch as some actions probably went unreported. “Even so, the number of guerrilla actions is impressive and bespeaks a trend toward ever-greater partisan activity.” Commenting on the Melitopol explosion, pro-Kremlin authorities in the city explicitly blamed Ukrainian partisans. Russia’s Investigative Committee blamed it on “Ukrainian saboteurs”. The attack in Melitopol came just days after a reported assassination attempt on Andriy Shevchyk, a pro-Kremlin and self-proclaimed mayor of Enerhodar, in the Zaporizhzhia region, who was badly injured in an explosion. In other incidents, railway lines in Russian-occupied areas have been damaged while leaflets have circulated threatening Russian troops and collaborators. The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, suggested that Russian authorities in Luhansk oblast – which has been the scene of the heaviest recent fighting – were gearing up for an increase in partisan attacks in the area.  Interactive  “Russian authorities are likely anticipating Ukrainian partisan pressure in Luhansk,” it suggested in its 1 June update on the fighting. “The Main Ukrainian Intelligence Directorate (GUR) announced on 1 June the launch of the “Luhansk partisan” project to galvanize resistance to Russian attempts to consolidate control of Luhansk oblast. “A Russian Telegram channel reported that the Russian Internal Ministry is sending a special detachment of its employees on “leave” to the [self-styled separatist] Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR), which is a likely attempt to reinforce Russian administrative presence in the LNR in the face of growing internal and partisan discontent.” Some of the claimed incidents in recent months involving partisans are probably fanciful disinformation, in the same vein as the nonexistent fighter pilot ace “the Ghost of Kyiv” – who it turned out was a carefully constructed fiction. While claims Russian soldiers fed poisoned pies are impossible to verify, there have been credible reports of collaborators and Russian soldiers killed or disappeared. Some claims suggest the number of soldiers killed by partisans so far could be in the low hundreds. What is clear is that the plan for partisan warfare was long and well prepared. Ukrainian partisan forces started being trained after Russia’s intervention in 2014 but they became part of Ukraine’s state structures last summer, according to Serhii Kuzan, head of the Ukrainian Center for Security and Cooperation, a Ukrainian thinktank that specialises in military analysis. Partisan forces, along with Ukraine’s territorial army, were part of new self-defence measures introduced across the country, said Kuzan.   Related: ‘A difficult and painful question’: Ukraine ponders how to punish collaborators   While thousands had joined the territorial army, hundreds had also volunteered to be trained as Ukrainian partisans, said Kuzan. Both forces are made up of people from a given region. The Ukrainian partisan forces were trained to be an underground resistance movement in the event their region became occupied, said Kuzan. Their task is to build networks of informants, launch information campaigns against the occupiers, pass information back to the Ukrainian authorities, and to kill high-level political collaborators and the occupying commanders, said Kuzan. Ukrainian partisans were led and trained by Ukrainian special forces, who were responsible for carrying out the higher-level acts of subversion, said Kuzan. “The idea is for the occupier to always feel the presence of the partisans and for them never to feel safe,” said Kuzan. “Recently, the partisan forces in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions carried out a coordinated sticker and flyer campaign against the so-called Russian world.” As Ukrainian partisan fighters are legally part of Ukraine’s defence forces, the Ukrainian state is obliged to look after them. The families of most of the partisans were evacuated from areas that could be occupied before or just after the invasion, said Kuzan.   Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am  Ukrainian partisans operated only in occupied Ukraine and did not stray across borders because that would be seen as a pretence for escalation by Russia, said Kuzan. But it’s clear that some subversive activity is being carried out on the other side of the border. As well as the claimed attack on the border guards, Russian oil storage facilities, railway lines, and Russian ministry of defence buildings, near the Ukrainian border, appear to have been targeted since the war started in February. “We all understand that oil depots and military bases in Russia have been blowing up over the last few months,” said Kuzan. “But the Ukrainian official response is ‘someone was smoking in the wrong place and they must have done it themselves’. They joke about it and make it clear that it’s no one’s business.”"
88,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/06/ukraine-war-deepens-chinas-mistrust-of-the-west,2022-06-06T09:13:54Z,Ukraine war deepens China’s mistrust of the west,"More than 100 days into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s strategic assessment of the conflict is becoming clearer: it does not wish to be cast in the same light as Russia, but the war has deepened Beijing’s mistrust of the west. In Beijing’s view, the pessimism has been exacerbated by the US and its allies’ recent efforts, for example, to help Taiwan increase its international recognition. On Monday last week, Beijing made the second-largest incursion into Taiwan’s air defence zone this year with Taipei reporting 30 jets entering the area, including more than 20 fighters. China’s tone has also evolved from sitting on the fence to outright defensive. When the conflict first began in late February, Beijing tried to be “impartial”, but in the last few weeks, it deployed the language that directly confronted the US-led Nato and western sanctions, calling them “financial terrorism” and “economic weaponisation”. “The war in Ukraine has intensified the confrontation between the US and China,” said Prof Yan Xuetong, director of the institute of international studies at Tsinghua University in Beijing, in a recent talk. “It [also] further highlighted the differences between us [China] and France, Germany, Britain and Japan.” Yan also detected that the emerging bipolarisation in the new world order was not tilting in China’s favour. And his view was widely shared by Chinese scholars and public intellectuals, said Liu Yawei, senior adviser on China at the Atlanta-based Carter Centre. China’s leadership has sensed it, too. Early in May, the Guardian reported that shortly after the invasion began, Beijing had ordered a comprehensive “stress test” to study the implications of a possible Russia-style sanctioning by the west. Several key government agencies – from banking regulation to international trade – have been asked to come up with responses if the west imposed the same embargos on China.   Related: Beijing orders ‘stress test’ as fears of Russia-style sanctions mount   Domestically, debates over Ukraine have endured, in spite of censorship. “China not only cannot stand with Putin, but also should take concrete actions to prevent Putin’s possible adventures,” warned Hu Wei, vice-chairman of the Public Policy Research Center of the Counselor’s Office of the State Council in Beijing in March, in rare dissent against the official view. But the article was quickly taken down. While Beijing’s relationship with Moscow continues to evolve, despite their friendly public pledges such as “‘no limits’ partnership”, in a strategically anxious China today, voices such as Hu’s are often met with fierce criticism. Zhao Tong, a Beijing-based senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, observed: “Liberal voices within China have become less capable to counterbalance against the growing influence of hardline views that see China’s future as resting with working with other like-minded countries to more proactively push back against the US-led western order, norms, and values.” One of the reasons for this dynamic, according to Liu, was that opponents saw “strong evidence that even if China had supported the US in condemning Russia and sanctioning it, the fundamentals in the bilateral relationship would not change”. He pointed out that many saw last week’s speech by Antony Blinken, in which the secretary of state said Washington would “shape the strategic environment around Beijing”, as further evidence that the American state has determined to treat China as its ultimate challenger. And until recent weeks, public opinion seemed to be on Beijing’s side, too. According to a poll by the Carter Centre’s US-China Perception Monitor initiative, 75% of Chinese respondents agreed that supporting Russia was in China’s national interest, although roughly 60% of the surveyed also expected China to play a role in mediating an end to the war. The public’s overwhelming support for Beijing’s stance – which some called “pro-Russian neutrality” – has made an immediate change of course more difficult, even if senior officials were thinking about a possible adjustment at some point, Zhao said. The perception gap in Beijing is stark to many westerners. There is also a growing view among hawks that the conflict is a “proxy war” between Russia and the western powers. Additionally, Beijing thinks the US would ultimately glean the benefits from Ukraine’s misfortune – an assumption that has been heightened by the collapse of mutual trust in recent years. “Russia-Ukraine conflict is Putin’s ‘counter-strike’ against the US-led west’s plan to dismember Russia,” declared Qiu Wenping of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, a government thinktank, repeating Moscow’s talking points in a recent TV discussion. “China is in a position that is somewhat comparable to Russia’s … The US is clearly manipulating the Taiwan issue and constantly fanning the flames in order to dismember China by creating a Ukraine of the Orient.”"

Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited the beleaguered city of Lysychansk on Sunday, just a few kilometres south from Sievierodonetsk, the main battlefield in the east where Russia has concentrated its forces.
Ukrainian troops had a slight reversal of fortunes after managing to retake half of Sievierodonetsk, Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk province where the city is located, told national television.
Haidai did not go into details but said Ukrainian troops were still holding their positions in the city’s industrial zone. “The fiercest fighting is in Sievierodonetsk. Fast-moving fighting is happening right now,” he said.

The fight to push Russian forces back received a boost on Sunday when the UK government said it would supply long-range rocket artillery to Ukraine, despite a threat on Sunday from Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to bomb fresh targets if similar weapons from the US were delivered to Kyiv.
Zelenskiy also visited the Donbas city of Soledar in a rare outing by the Ukrainian president outside the capital Kyiv since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February that could be his closest yet to the frontline.
“I went with the head of [my] office to the east. We were in Lysychansk and Soledar,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address, adding he would not elaborate on the visit.
In two videos released later, Zelenskiy was shown talking to troops in confined, bunker-like structures, presenting some with awards and addressing others.
“What you all deserve is victory – that is the most important thing. But not at any cost,” Zelenskiy said in one of the videos.
Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk are in the Luhansk region and Soledar is in the Donetsk region. Both regions make up the broader Donbas region, Ukraine’s industrial heartland, which Russia claims is on a mission to “liberate”.
Earlier on Sunday, Zelenskiy said he had also visited frontline troops in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia, whose governor claims that 60% of the area is under Russian occupation.

The UK will send a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which can hit targets up to 50 miles (80km) away, in the hope they can disrupt the concentrated Russian artillery that has been pounding cities in eastern Ukraine.
Spain is also increasing its support for Ukraine, according to government sources cited by El País newspaper. Spain is to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle vehicles along with training for the equipment. Spain had previously sent only ammunition, individual protection equipment and light weapons to Ukraine.
The additional military support for Ukraine came after Nato began almost two weeks of naval exercises led by the US in the Baltic Sea on Sunday.
More than 7,000 sailors, airmen and marines from 16 countries will take part, including two aspiring to join the military alliance, Finland and Sweden, in the annual Baltops (Baltic operations) exercise that has been running since 1972.
Nato said with Sweden and Finland participating, it was “seizing the chance in an unpredictable world to enhance its joint force resilience and strength”.

Finland and Sweden have a long history of military non-alignment before their governments applied to join Nato in May, a direct result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Over the past years, Moscow has repeatedly warned Helsinki and Stockholm against joining the western military alliance and warned of retaliatory measures if they did.“It is important for us, the United States and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” the US general Mark Milley, the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, said on Saturday during a news conference aboard the large amphibious warship USS Kearsarge, which was moored in central Stockholm.
Milley, speaking to the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, stressed that the Baltic was a strategically important body of water and “one of the great seaways of the world”.
He said from Moscow’s perspective, Finland and Sweden joining Nato would be “very problematic” and leave Russia in a difficult military position as the Baltic’s coastline would be almost completely encircled by Nato members, except for Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad and the Russian city of St Petersburg and its surrounding areas.As Nato’s close partners, Finland and Sweden have participated in the naval drill since the mid-1990s. This year’s Baltops exercise is scheduled to end in the German port of Kiel on 17 June.

Every Friday, for nearly two years, Makichyan protested alone in Moscow’s Pushkin Square, hoping to draw Russian attention to the danger posed by climate change. Born in Armenia, but given Russian citizenship when he was 10, Makichyan graduated from a prestigious music conservatory and turned to activism after reading about climate change and Greta Thunberg’s weekly strikes. “I was representing Russia as a violinist on competitions, and I was organising Friday for Futures, so I had a feeling that I am a future of Russia,” he said. Now the Russian government wants to punish him by taking away his passport. In a court hearing this week, Russia will seek to revoke Makichyan’s citizenship, in a move that he and his lawyers call unprecedented, and a threat to millions of foreign-born Russians willing to speak out against the war. “Even though I was born in Armenia, I am part of Russian culture, I love Russia, I was fighting for Russia for years, I was risking my freedom for years,” said the activist in an interview over the phone on his 28th birthday last week. “And now I don’t know what to do.” In his first interview about the case, Makichyan, who left Russia with his wife, Polina, in late March, and is currently living in Germany, told the Guardian he felt that the Russian claim was revenge for his anti-war and climate activism. Most recently, he has lobbied European politicians for a fossil fuel ban that could deprive Vladimir Putin’s regime of its key source of revenues. Russia has regularly expelled foreign activists from the country. But stripping a Russian citizen of his nationality would be a rare move as the country sinks deeper into isolation and totalitarianism since launching its war in Ukraine. If Russia succeeds, Makichyan told the Guardian he would be left stateless.  “I was inspired by [Alexei] Navalny because he returned to Russia although it was very dangerous,” said Makichyan. “I was planning to go back to Russia with my wife to continue to fight against this war. But now most likely we cannot go back to Russia any more.” The impact of climate change is being felt more and more strongly in Russia, which has been hit by growing forest fires in Siberia and melting permafrost and growing desertification in Russia’s south. But it remains a niche concern for most of the country. Before the war, Russia’s tiny handful of eco-activists used to believe they could lobby the government for real policy change, even as the Kremlin failed to meet its obligations under the Paris agreement on greenhouse gas emissions and continued to profit from exports of fossil fuels. But the war has changed everything. According to Makichyan it has shown that it is impossible to negotiate with Putin. He adds that he could “not pretend like it’s normal and continue talking about 2050 when millions of people are suffering now”. “I was connecting the dots between the human rights crisis and climate crisis,” he said. “Of course this war was a red line for a lot of people. That’s why I am calling Putin a war criminal and a killer. Because before the war I was thinking that maybe it’s better not to be that harsh on him. But now I think it’s a moral obligation to tell things as they are.” The climate activist was arrested in Moscow in late February for speaking out against the war, and his wife had been arrested several times for staging protests. “I didn’t want to leave the country but my wife was saying that she wants to breathe free air and it was actually unbearable for us,” he said. “Because we were expecting searches almost every day. Likely we would have been arrested if we had stayed in Russia one or two more days.” At one point, he and his wife even swapped clothing for a Pussy Riot-style escape from a police stakeout at her parents’ flat. Polina dressed up as Makichyan, a floppy-haired, rail-thin activist who would still fit in on most college campuses. She walked straight past police before a friend drove her out of the neighbourhood. They decided to marry this winter so that if they were arrested, they would have the right to see each other in prison. Their wedding day, 24 February, turned out to be the same day that Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine. Makichyan wore a white shirt bearing the words “Fuck the war” in blood-red lettering. For years, he said, Russia has been using the topic of climate change to promote its own interests, like its nuclear energy programme, while “marginalising and ignoring” activists in Russia like Makichyan who were calling for significant cuts in emissions. “It was different for us to be climate activists because we were trying to fight for everything,” he said. “Climate is everything and there is no climate education in Russia so we were trying to build it up from the ground.”  Now outside Russia, he said they were shocked by the indifference that many Europeans were showing toward the war. “I think the west can do much better than they are doing now,” he said, saying that he had been in Germany for two months and politicians had declined to meet him. “They don’t understand how it is crucial now to act,” he said. “We need something real. Of course if we have embargo on Russian fossil fuels it will influence life in Europe, there will be some economical consequences. “But this war is something bigger, it’s not about economy, it’s about survival. If we won’t change Putin’s regime then I don’t know how we can have new climate negotiations.”"

Eight years later, with the next invasion by Russia, he and his family fled their home in Kyiv. The situation prompted Korovayny to track down others from Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine who also had to flee for a second time. “Is it harder to lose their home again? Or do they already have these survival skills?” he asked. “Did they have the full tank of gas and luggage ready? And where are those homes now?”    Daria Kurinna. Photograph: Serhii Korovayny   Daria Kurinna, Truskavets “I think it’s easier for me than for those that experience it for the first time. I know that life doesn’t end there. It will go on. War is a test that shows what you’re capable of and how much faith and willingness to fight you have in you,” says journalist Daria Kurinna. She jokes she can now pack the entire house in 30 minutes. “I immediately realised that I was going to leave Kyiv,” she said. “I didn’t want to put myself in harm’s way again”.

Photograph: Serhii Korovayny   Andriy Shchekun with son Olexiy, Lviv In 2014, Andriy Shchekun, an activist from Crimea, organised a resistance movement on the peninsula. He was soon captured and held for 11 days before he and other prisoners were exchanged for a high-ranking Russian official. He had been living in Kyiv and calling himself a forcibly deported Crimean citizen. This February, when the invasion began, he and his family immediately went to Lviv. Shchekun had to use multiple trains and buses to get there. However, he had every aspect of the route planned beforehand.     Serhii Kolesnikov. Photograph: Serhii Korovayny   Serhii Kolesnikov, Lviv Serhii Kolesnikov compares abandoning your life during war to a parachute jump. “When I first jumped, I was told that it was scary only for the first-timers. This is not true at all,” says the 32-year-old, who runs a media company. At the time of the occupation of Luhansk, Kolesnikov was 24. He had nothing to lose. Everything that happened was seen as an adventure and a challenge. Sleeping on the floor seemed sort of romantic then. Now, in Lviv with his family, it feels like a month of nights on a train. “We are renting an apartment here, but my house is in Kyiv.” Kolesnikov expected war for eight years. “I advised all my acquaintances not to buy any real estate. They looked at me like I was an idiot. It would be better, of course, if they were right, not me. I recently read a book about Holocaust survivors who advised their kids to only have the property that fits in a small bag. I understand them very well now.”    Diana Berg.

She wanted to turn Mariupol into the cultural capital of Donbas and created an art platform called TIU. Now she helps people in Mariupol to escape the occupied and destroyed city. “Just like other migrants, we put a lot of love into rebuilding our life in a new place. Our entire lives were left back at home, including close ones who did not have phone service. We were grateful for the Donetsk that we used to have. That’s why we put all our love into the new home in Mariupol. We had to furnish it from scratch, so we got cats and we bought string lights to put in our apartment overlooking the theatre. Now my loss of home hurts even deeper. Back then, we were still able to go to Donetsk on occasion, but as for Mariupol, there’s nowhere to return to.”     Ksenia and Tetiana Ivanov.

In Donetsk in 2014, they didn’t even consider “waiting the fighting out”. Their pro-Ukrainian parents quickly realised they didn’t want to live there any more and moved to Kyiv. But this time their parents refused to flee on principle. Tetiana says it is as painful to experience war now as it was the first time around, eight years ago. “You can’t ever be ready for such a tragedy even if you’ve experienced it before. You have dreams, make plans, build your life from scratch – and all this makes it even worse. Russians are once again taking these most precious things from us.”    Danylo Pavlov. Photograph: Serhii Korovayny   Danylo Pavlov Lviv Danylo Pavlov, a documentary photographer and photo editor at Reporters magazine, did not expect war in 2014. A month before it started, he spent all his savings on building materials. He dreamed of creating the ideal family space in his home in Donetsk. When the war began, he left the city with his wife and two young children, little to no luggage and no plan B. Like most acquaintances, they left for “for two weeks, tops”. At first, they went to relatives in Uzhhorod, and later to Kyiv after an invitation from a magazine. It took years to settle in a new place and buy things to do up a new apartment in Kyiv. As soon as he partly completed the repairs, war returned. “When we discussed the possible invasion at home, it piqued the children’s interest. I went too far with my stories and realised it when my son cried.” What hasn’t changed since 2014, Pavlov says, is the painful issue of the relationship between those fleeing the war to peaceful regions and those living there. “I did not expect Kyivites to face the same thing that the easterners faced previously. There are issues with regard to renting apartments, gossip about rude migrants and language issues – all of this had already happened to Donetsk residents when they came to Kyiv eight years ago. It hurts that people are not ready to accept each other. But I still feel like we are more united now than ever.”    Portrait of Lyubov Zavhorodnya in Drohobych, Ukraine Photograph: Serhii Korovayny   Lyubov Zavhorodnya, Drohobych Lyubov Zavhorodnya, 71, says that it is easy to tell whether a person is a refugee. “I came to the market, and a woman stall owner offered me shoes at a discount. She saw that I wore clothes the same size as her. The next day she brought me two trunks of clothes. She said that if I didn’t need them, I could give them to others. I was so grateful.” This time Zavhorodnya fled the war from Dnipro. Eight years ago, she fled Debaltseve. One day, she was waiting for the shelling to end in the basement of her home. “Our yard has always been green and bushy. There were so many tall trees. And when they came out of the basement after the shelling, it was so light that my eyes hurt. They fired so hard that not a single leaf on a tree was left.” Now Zavhorodnya does not know where her house is located geographically. She only knows that home is where her son, daughter-in-law and four-year-old granddaughter are.    Anastasiia, left, Natasha, centre, and Iryna Doroshenko. Photograph: Serhii Korovayny   Anastasiia, Natasha and Iryna Doroshenko, Drohobych “My daughter Natasha was 18 months old when we had to flee from the shelling in Luhansk. We went to relatives in Severodonetsk to wait until it was over,” says Anastasiia. Eight years later, war has found them there. They spent the first nine days in a bomb shelter. Anastasiia has achieved a lot in this time. She worked at a local university, completed higher education, got a job as an editor at a radio station and bought an apartment where she lived with her daughter and mother. But the feeling of anxious anticipation has never left. “In 2018, my father died; he couldn’t take all this. He was such a patriot. He was even buried with a flag. He has always told me to be alert. The Russian world, he said, will expand sooner or later. And I was always afraid of that.” Anastasiia is now in Drohobych, western Ukraine, thinking about what to do next.     Nastya Daeva. Photograph: Serhii Korovayny   Nastya Daeva, Kyiv “I’ve moved to so many places. This time it was devastating emotionally. I only reached the point in my life when anxiety went away and I felt happy for a week or two. Then Putin did this. I lost my home in Makiivka in 2014, when I was 18. It took me years to rebuild my life, to get into the prewar state I was in before 2014. It’s like one little building block after the other. First, you look for a new dwelling. Then you need to find a place to finish your BA, then MA. I’ve only been able to find friends and properly socialise after five years in Kyiv. Recently I became financially independent, rented a flat on my own. This time I didn’t even want to leave. How old will I be when I get my life back again – 35? 40? I have been waiting for eight years for Putin to go farther into the country. I kept thinking – tomorrow, tomorrow, he’ll do it. I won’t be able to finish my studies – he will come. I won’t have time to find a job – he will come. I did what I planned. So did he.”    Portrait of Artem Bakanov in Lviv, Ukraine Photograph: Serhii Korovayny   Artem Bakanov, Lviv It was easier for 29-year-old Artem Bakanov to leave Donetsk in 2014 than Kyiv now. Back then, he didn’t have much. It was difficult to find a place to stay in Odesa, where he moved with his girlfriend – people from Donbas often faced prejudice. The couple worked as waiters and tempered their spirits. They participated in pro-Ukrainian rallies. Then they moved to Kyiv, found work and made their first attempts to open a business. Finally, they felt the sky was the limit. Bakanov has managed to enter the restaurant business, develop his own company and taxi services as well as start a project to ship vehicles from the US. The possibility of an attack on Kyiv sounded ridiculous. “I tried to calm my wife down. I was telling her that everything was going to be OK. Everyone kept withdrawing cash from their accounts, and I kept reloading mine as normal. It took one morning to lose everything you’ve been working on for the last eight years.” After the next move – to Lviv – they asked themselves what was next. Bakanov’s partner decided to start a self-defence school; every day, volunteers from Kharkiv, Odesa, Kyiv and Lviv teach 120-150 people. Medical and military instructors offer their knowledge and help. They are building a shooting range so that any visitor can learn how to fire guns safely.     Artur Stadnik.

When there were battles for Donetsk, he was a student going through the work and travel programme in the US. He hasn’t returned to his parents’ home. As soon as he finished his studies in Kharkiv, he moved to the capital with his parents. “I could always sense their sadness in the background, but I was holding up well. Yes, the house was taken away from my family, but that couldn’t be repeated, not again. And then the Russians expanded their military presence, and I wasn’t so sure any more. I arranged my documents, had a medical screening at a draft board and, since December, have been packing and unpacking my things.” When asked where his home is, Stadnik answers: “Ukraine.”    Marina Shulzhenko and her daughter Masha.

In 2022, they were once again forced to move. This time to the village of Bohorodchany in western Ukraine. Shulzhenko says that both times it was hard to leave her house. “It feels like the war is following us. There’s nowhere to hide from it. Nowhere is safe. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. It would reach us even across the border. Fear and grief. That’s probably what all of us refugees feel. We became very attached to Bila Tserkva throughout these eight years.

Its foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, called the move “another closed channel of communication” in comments reported by Russian news agencies. Lavrov had been due to hold talks in Belgrade on Monday with the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, but Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro closed their airspace to the plane that would have carried Moscow’s top diplomat, according to Serbian newspaper Večernje Novosti.   Related: ‘You all deserve victory’: Zelenskiy visits Ukraine troops on eastern frontline   Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has already triggered an EU-wide airspace ban. “Our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation,” a senior foreign ministry source told Russia’s Interfax news agency. Later Lavrov described the move to block his plane as “unprecedented” and said he would invite his Serbian counterpart to visit him in Moscow instead. He told reporters: “If a visit by the Russian foreign minister to Serbia is seen in the west as something approaching a threat on a universal scale, then things in the west are clearly pretty bad.” Serbia’s interior minister, Aleksandar Vulin, said he deeply regretted “the obstruction” of the visit of Lavrov, whom he described as “a great and proven friend of Serbia”. “A world in which diplomats cannot seek peace is a world in which there is no peace. Those who prevented the arrival of Sergei Lavrov do not want peace, they dream of defeating Russia,” Vulin said in a statement. “Serbia is proud that it is not part of the anti-Russian hysteria, and the countries that are, will have time to be ashamed.” Vučić was re-elected for a second term in April but the war in Ukraine presents the president with a significant challenge, as Serbia is seemingly poised between its application to be a member of the EU and an instinctive alliance with Russia. Serbia and Russia have close historic, religious and cultural ties and Moscow has provided crucial support to Belgrade at the UN security council, blocking Kosovo’s independence. Serbia is totally dependent on Russian oil and gas and has not joined western sanctions against Moscow. In April Vučić accused Ukraine and an unnamed EU country of orchestrating a series of bomb hoax threats against Air Serbia planes. He did not provide evidence for the claim, which Ukraine called “baseless”. The president has been slow to condemn Russian aggression, which was initially reported in pro-government tabloids as a Ukrainian invasion of Russia. Vučić and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, agreed last month that Russia would continue supplying natural gas to Serbia, while other countries have been cut off for refusing to pay for Russian gas in roubles."

According to a release from his office, Zelenskiy visited command posts and frontline positions of Ukrainian troops in the area of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region and Lysychansk in the Luhansk region, just a few kilometres south from Sievierodonetsk, where Ukraine claims to be fighting back in one of the war’s biggest ground battles.   Russian forces continue to storm the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk and fired missiles at the nearby cities of Sloviansk, Lysychansk and Orikhove, Ukraine’s military has said. Russian troops fired at Ukrainian units defending Sievierodonetsk with mortars and artillery fire, damaging infrastructure in the towns of Metolkino, Borivske, Ustynivka and Toshkivka.   Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has reported today that the situation has worsened a little for Ukraine in Sievierodonetsk and that there is intense street fighting. He told national television “Our defenders managed to undertake a counterattack for a certain time; they liberated almost half of the city. But now the situation has worsened a little for us again.”   Haidai also said that “the number of shellings in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk increased tenfold. In the Luhansk region there are many cities with a situation comparable to Mariupol: Now the Russians are levelling Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk.”   Ukraine has concentrated enough forces to repel Russian attacks in Sievierodonetsk but neither side is preparing to withdraw, according to the city’s mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk.   Interactive   A total of 262 children have been killed and 467 injured since Russia invaded Ukraine, according to newly released figures from Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office.   Zelenskiy, said there could be as much as 75 million tonnes of grain stuck in Ukraine by this autumn, and that Kyiv wanted anti-ship weapons that could secure the safe passage of its exports.   Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has urged countries not to trust Vladimir Putin’s promises not to use trade routes to attack the southern port city of Odesa.   Oleksandr Senkevych, mayor of Mykolaiv, has reported on Telegram that there have been explosions in the city.   The headquarters of the territorial defence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has posted to Telegram to say that one person has been killed and five people have been injured in the last 24 hours by Ukrainian shelling into the occupied territory of Donetsk.   The Russian missile attack on Kyiv early on Sunday was likely an attempt to disrupt the supply of western military equipment to frontline Ukrainian units, according to British intelligence.   Britain is to supply long-range rocket artillery to Ukraine, despite a threat on Sunday from Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to bomb fresh targets if similar weapons from the US were delivered to Kyiv. The UK will send a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which can hit targets up to 50 miles away, in the hope they can disrupt the concentrated Russian artillery that has been pounding cities in eastern Ukraine.   Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow would respond to western deliveries of long-range weapons to Ukraine by pushing back Kyiv’s forces further from Russia’s borders.   Interactive   Anthony Albanese, Australia’s new prime minister, has confirmed Australia will attend the G20 meeting in Bali in November despite Russia’s controversial attendance at the summit.   Russia should not close the US embassy in Moscow despite the crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine because the world’s two biggest nuclear powers must continue to talk, the US ambassador to Moscow John J Sullivan was quoted as saying. The UK ministry of justice has announced a second tranche of support for the international criminal court’s (ICC) investigations into war crimes in Ukraine, including the deployment of a specialist legal and police team.   A Moscow court has fined US-backed broadcaster Radio Liberty/Radio Free Europe 20m roubles (£260,000/$325,214) over what it deems to be “fake” content about Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine   Nato kicked off a nearly two-week US-led naval exercise on the Baltic Sea on Sunday with more than 7,000 sailors, air personnel and marines from 16 nations, including Finland and Sweden – who aspire to join the military alliance. “It is important for us, the United States, and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said.   A Russian general, Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov, was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry.   Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s visit to Serbia has been cancelled after countries around Serbia closed their airspace to his aircraft, according to local media reports. A senior foreign ministry source told the Interfax news agency that Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had closed their airspace to the plane that would have carried Moscow’s top diplomat to Belgrade on Monday. “Our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation,” the source said. The Kremlin has described the move as a “hostile action”.   Spain is to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle tanks in a step up of its military support, according to government sources cited by newspaper El País. Spain will provide essential training to the Ukrainian military in how to use the tanks, according to the reports.   A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption.   Russia’s sanctions against Gazprom Germania and its subsidiaries could cost German taxpayers and gas users an extra €5bn (£4.27bn) a year to pay for replacement gas, the Welt am Sonntag weekly reported, citing industry representatives.

The UK will send a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which can hit targets up to 50 miles away, in the hope they can disrupt the concentrated Russian artillery that has been pounding cities in eastern Ukraine.
Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, argued the decision to ship the rocket launchers was justified because “as Russia’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine”. The move risks further provoking an already irritated Kremlin.
Before the British announcement, Putin told Rossiya state television that Russia would retaliate further if the US went through with the delivery of Himars rocket artillery that the White House promised last week.







“We will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting,” said the Russian leader, who has been closely involved with operational military decisions throughout the three months-plus of the war. He did not specify what those targets were.
In the small hours of Sunday morning, Russian cruise missiles struck a railway depot in the eastern Dniprovsky suburb of Kyiv. Ukraine said the strike hit a rail car repair works; Moscow said it had destroyed tanks sent by eastern European countries to Ukraine.
It was the first time anywhere in the capital has been hit for over five weeks. One person was hospitalised, and a plume of smoke rose and was visible from high points in the capital.
Five cruise missiles were launched from Tu-95 bombers, one of which was intercepted, Ukraine’s air force said, in an attack that represented a change of approach on the part of Russian forces. Kyiv was last hit on 28 April.
Russia’s ministry of defence claimed it was targeting an arsenal of T-72 tanks that had been delivered from eastern European countries, suggesting it now wants to target the supply of western arms. But Ukrainian officials said the statement was false.







Oleksandr Kamyshin, the chairman of the board of Ukrainian Railways, said: “There are no such tanks at the plant, as well as no military equipment. There are only cars that we repair. These carriages we need for export – these are, in particular, grain carriages.”
The UK, in conjunction with the US and other western nations, began the war by promising only to supply “defensive weaponry” to help Ukraine repel the Russian invasion. But as Russia has made gains in the east and the south of the country, western countries have gradually sent more lethal arms.
London said it had been cooperating closely with Washington. The British announcement comes a few days after the US said it would send four similar truck-mounted Himars systems. The US and UK systems are intended to be complementary. The ranges of both are far greater than any land weapons Ukraine currently has.
Like the US, the UK has sought assurances from Kyiv that the M270s would not be used to strike targets within Russia. A British defence source said the weapons will be used “to defend Ukraine, in Ukraine”. They added: “We have confidence that the weapons will be used appropriately.”

Britain did not say how many M270s it was sending, although the number is small and will be comparable to the US decision to send four Himars. Ukrainian troops will be trained on how to use the launchers in the UK, the MoD added, and Kyiv’s forces will be supplied with the appropriate rockets “at scale”.
However, Putin said he believed the west’s goal was to prolong the war in Ukraine, which has now gone on for over three months, after the Russian president launched an unprovoked invasion on 24 February.
“All this fuss around additional deliveries of weapons, in my opinion, has only one goal: to drag out the armed conflict as much as possible,” Putin added.

Ukraine’s nuclear energy company, Energoatom, also warned on Sunday that a Russian cruise missile had come dangerously close to the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant, in the south of the country, at about 5.30am, apparently heading for Kyiv.
It said the missile “flew critically low” over the site and that Russian forces “still do not understand that even the smallest fragment of a missile that can hit a working power unit can cause a nuclear catastrophe and radiation leak”.
Elsewhere, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said that Ukrainian forces had counterattacked in Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, “likely blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained” but offered no assessment of whether the effort was pushing the invaders back.
On Saturday, Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of Luhansk province, said his country’s forces had regained about 20% of the city in Donbas, which had been under days of attack from concentrated Russian shelling and airstrikes.
Haidai repeated that claim on Sunday, adding that eight Russians had been taken prisoner and that the occupiers had “lost a huge number of personnel”. A humanitarian headquarters in neighbouring Lysychansk had been struck with 30 shells overnight, the governor said.
Ukrainian forces were “successfully slowing down Russian operations” in Donbas and were making “effective local counterattacks in Sievierodonetsk”, said the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, overnight.
The research group, which closely monitors the fighting, said that Russia “may still be able to capture Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk” and that it appeared that “Ukrainian defences remain strong in this pivotal theatre”.

Britain’s Ministry of Defence said Russia was relying on “poorly equipped and trained” separatist forces from Luhansk to conduct the clearance of the city, a tactic it said had been previously employed by Moscow’s forces in Syria. “This approach likely indicates a desire to limit casualties suffered by regular Russian forces,” it added.
One Ukrainian presidential adviser urged European nations to respond with “more sanctions, more weapons” to the strike on Kyiv – and appeared to criticise the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who had said in an interview on Friday that Russia must not be humiliated in Ukraine so that a diplomatic solution could eventually be found.

A seagull flapped over the water and willow trees. “Life goes on, even in wartime,” Slava said. Wringing out his khaki T-shirt, he added: “In battle there is nowhere to wash.” Slava ran up a muddy embankment and showed off his armoured transporter. On the roof was a joystick-controlled machine gun. Shrapnel had dinted the vehicle’s right side. There was a crack in a porthole-like window. “A Russian rocket landed 20 metres from us. We were OK but two civilians got killed,” he said. A member of Ukraine’s Donbas battalion, Slava had been evacuating civilians from the beleaguered city of Lysychansk. A couple of kilometres farther north, Ukrainian soldiers were clinging on to the southern chunk of Sievierodonetsk, the last slab of territory in Luhansk province under Kyiv’s control.

On Friday Ukrainian forces mounted a counterattack, with fierce street-to-street fighting. “The Russians don’t have any reserves or motivation. A country of 140m and they lack infantry!” he said, adding: “Nobody wants to die for Vladimir Putin. He’s a bloodthirsty dog.” Putin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has not quite gone the way the Kremlin anticipated. In February Russian troops failed to encircle and seize the capital and retreated to Belarus. The Russian president’s latest war aim is more modest, if still dumbfounding in its ambition: to capture the parts of Donbas not already in separatist hands. For seven weeks now, Moscow’s vast firepower has been concentrated on an eastern theatre in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking industrial heartland. Its army is seeking to conquer Sievierodonetsk. The next targets are the cities of Slavyanask, a one-time spa resort, and the garrison town of Kramatorsk. A terrible battle draws near. Siting on a bench outside Slavyansk’s city hall, the deputy mayor Yuriy Pidlisnyi said he had told residents to flee. About 25,000 people out of its approximate 100,000 population had stubbornly ignored his advice, he said. Some were elderly and didn’t want to go. Others pleaded sick relatives or much-loved cats.    A damaged school in Slavyansk. Photograph: Anastasia Taylor-Lind   Conditions inside the city are getting steadily worse. There is no gas or water, and only intermittent electricity. With petrol expensive, many residents get around on bikes. Some who left have come back after running out of money. The local economy is trashed. Soldiers queue outside a market cafe to buy cost-price 60 Hryvnia [£1.80] kebabs. The frontline, meanwhile, creeps ever closer. The Russians started bombarding the city in late April, the deputy mayor said. They were now 12km away. “The’ve hit us with rockets, airstrikes and ballistic missiles,” he added. The enemy had shelled Svyatohorsk Lavra, north of Slavyansk, killing a nun and burning down the wooden All Saints monastery. The omens were grim. Might Slavyansk avoid the tragic fate of Mariupol and other Ukrainian urban areas which the Russians had flattened and then overrun? “I believe in our army. I hope there are enough forces,” Pidlisnyi said. “Russia has an imperial complex. Putin thinks he doesn’t have much time left.” In the distance was a loud thump. And then another. The noise came from outgoing Ukrainian artillery, Pidlisnyi said. “If it’s incoming you feel it in your legs. The ground vibrates.” He broke off to make a short phone call. One of his staff sounded the air raid siren, which blared across the city from his office roof.    Damaged apartment blocks. Photograph: Anastasia Taylor-Lind   In spring 2014 a Russian militia seized the administration building and occupied Slavyansk for three months. It was a time of terror and kidnappings. Pidlisnyi described the separatists as “drunks, drug addicts and the lumpenproletariat”. A minority in Slavyansk sympathised with Russia, he said, while ethnic Russians backed Ukraine. As the city’s fate hung in the balance, death rained down from the sky. Last week three people were killed and several injured when a night-time rocket slammed into Yaroslav the Wise street. The neighbourhood was a giddy mess. A burnt-out Lada sat in the road. The blast blew out balconies and splattered walls. Glass showered a communal garden. Worst-hit was apartment block number 10, where Vitaly Kolesnichneko was asleep with his wife, Neliya. “We live on the third floor. It was dark. There was a huge explosion. It blew off the bathroom door. I saw yellow and green smoke,” he recalled. He added: “I looked for my wife. She had gone very quiet. She said: ‘My legs, my legs.’” Vitaly, who walks with a stick, said he tried to drag his wife out. Rescue workers took her away. She died on her way to hospital in Kramatorsk. “We were married for one month short of 30 years,” he said, showing a photo of Neliya on his phone. A 21-year-old soldier living across the hall was killed, he said, and the nearby school damaged.    Residents outside damaged apartment blocks. Photograph: Anastasia Taylor-Lind   On the fifth floor at number 10 was another scene of heartbreak. Alyona Boivet and her husband, Viktor, left Slavyansk on 6 April, shortly after their register office marriage. They had not been back since. On Sunday Alona’s mother, Oksana, returned to the couple’s shattered apartment. Sobbing, she retrieved her daughter’s wedding dress and shoes. Her sister Tatiana comforted her while male family members tried to patch up a busted 2-metre-long frame. Through the open window you could see swifts, screeching across a sultry summer sky. “I want to live in my own country. It’s ours. We love Ukraine. We don’t want to be in Russia,” Tatiana said. “We hope God will look after us.” “The mayor’s office should send a commission to value the damage and help us but they haven’t,” another resident Elena Voitenko said. “And then Russia should pay for all of this. I am ethnic Russian but my homeland is Ukraine.” She added: “I didn’t ask them to come here. My daughter lives in the DNR [Donetsk People’s Republic] and is zombified. We can’t talk any more.”    Elena Voitenko (left) and Alla Petrivna outside their damaged apartment block. Photograph: Anastasia Taylor-Lind   On the road to the frontline, military traffic rolled past a landscape of green wheat fields and slag-heaps. There were armoured personnel carriers, fuel trucks, engineering units and civilian vehicles painted in military green. One convoy had broken down; a sergeant bashed a tank tread with a hammer. Soldiers waited in the afternoon sunshine. There was no sign of the gamechanging long-range multiple launcher systems promised by the US administration. The impression was of a medium-size army doing its valiant best against a mighty foe. “Now it’s a lot of rockets and artillery,” Maksym, a Ukrainian commander, said. “In 2014 the Russians didn’t want people to know them. It had to look like DNR.” Back at the Torets River, Slava said he came from Popasna, a town in Luhansk. He signed up to fight in 2014, joining a volunteer battalion that later became a part of the national guard. He re-enlisted in February. Russians forces recently swallowed up Popasna and were trying to join up with the Seversk, to the north, cutting Ukrainian supply lines. “Why did God punish me by making me be born here?” Slava asked wryly. “I liberated Popasna and Lysychansk eight years ago and took part in the biggest battles. And then the Russians came back to us again.” Russia was advancing on the same axis, just west of Slavyansk, where the Red army fought the Germans during the second world war, he pointed out. Could Ukraine win? And what might victory look like? “A difficult question. How can you talk about victory if 50,000 people lie dead. War is absolute madness,” he said."

Several explosions were heard around the eastern Kyiv suburbs of Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi early on Sunday morning, wounding one person. The strikes represented a change of tack on the part of the invading forces.
Russia’s ministry of defence said the strikes had destroyed T-72 tanks that had been provided to Ukraine by European countries that were being stored in the buildings of a car repair business, although the claim could not immediately be verified.
Oleksandr Kamyshin, the chair of the board of Ukrainian Railways, said the Russian claims were false. “There are no such tanks at the plant, as well as no military equipment. There are only cars that we repair. These carriages we need for export – these are, in particular, grain carriages,” he said. 
Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said “one victim was hospitalised” in the incident. Sergei Leshchenko, a member of the Ukrainian railway company’s supervisory board, added that its facilities had been struck.
They were the first bombing raids on any part of the capital since the end of April and appear to represent an attempt to strike supply lines from Kyiv to the east, where both sides are embroiled an intense battle for control of Donbas.
Perhaps signalling the new approach, Putin told Rossiya state television that Russia would hit fresh targets in Ukraine if the US delivered the longer-range rockets that it had promised to Kyiv last week.







If such missiles were supplied, “we will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting”, said Putin, who is believed to be closely involved in military decision-making. The Russian leader did not specify what would be struck, although logistics points would be amongst the most logical targets.
Russia has been irritated by the US decision to supply Ukraine with Himars truck-mounted multiple-launch rocket systems, with missiles that have a range of about 20 to 40 miles, greater than anything in Kyiv’s armoury.

 Related: Himars: what are the advanced rockets US is sending Ukraine?  

“All this fuss around additional deliveries of weapons, in my opinion, has only one goal: to drag out the armed conflict as much as possible,” Putin said in his TV interview.
Ukraine and the west believe the rockets could help Kyiv prevent Russian forces massing behind the frontlines for future attacks, but Putin argued it would not bring on any significant change to the military balance.
“We understand that this supply [of advance rocket systems] from the United States and some other countries is meant to make up for the losses of this military equipment,” Putin said. “This is nothing new. It doesn’t change anything in essence.”
Ukraine’s nuclear energy company Energoatom also warned that a Russian cruise missile had come dangerously close to the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant, in the south of the country, at about 5.30am, apparently heading for Kyiv.
It said the missile “flew critically low” over the site and that Russian forces “still do not understand that even the smallest fragment of a missile that can hit a working power unit can cause a nuclear catastrophe and radiation leak”.
The last time Kyiv was hit was on 28 April, when a Russian missile killed a producer for the US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Since then Moscow has ignored the capital as it tries to push Ukraine out of Donbas.
Britain’s Ministry of Defence said that Ukrainian forces had counterattacked in Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, “likely blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained” – but offered no assessment whether the effort was pushing the invaders back.

On Saturday, Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of Luhansk province, said his country’s forces had regained about 20% of the Donbas city, which had been under days of sustained attack by concentrated Russian shelling and airstrikes.
Haidai repeated that claim on Sunday, adding that eight Russians had been taken prisoner and that the occupiers had “lost a huge number of personnel”. A humanitarian headquarters in neighbouring Lysychansk had been struck with 30 shells overnight, the governor said.







Ukrainian forces were “successfully slowing down Russian operations” in Donbas and were making “effective local counterattacks in Sievierodonetsk”, said the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, overnight.
The research group, which closely monitors the fighting, said that Russia “may still be able to capture Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk” and that it appeared that “Ukrainian defences remain strong in this pivotal theatre”.
Britain’s Ministry of Defence said Russia was relying on “poorly equipped and trained” separatist forces from Luhansk to conduct the clearance of the city, a tactic it said had been previously employed by Moscow’s forces in Syria. “This approach likely indicates a desire to limit casualties suffered by regular Russian forces,” it added.
One Ukrainian presidential adviser urged European nations to respond with “more sanctions, more weapons” to the missile attacks – and appeared to criticise the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who had said in an interview on Friday that Russia must not be humiliated in Ukraine so that a diplomatic solution could eventually be found.
Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the President’s Office, tweeted: “While someone asks not to humiliate Russia, the Kremlin resorts to new insidious attacks. Today’s missile strikes at Kyiv have only one goal – kill as many Ukrainians as possible.”"

Watching here in St Davids, Pembrokeshire, even I, with a substantial quotient of Welsh DNA, will be wearing my official Ukraine yellow football shirt with “Malinovskyi 8” on the back.   Related: Soldiers send flag to Ukraine squad before World Cup playoff against Wales   The game could not be more poignantly, or cogently timed: just 10 years ago this week, a hugely successful football tournament kicked off, hosted jointly by Poland and Ukraine. Euro 2012 was seamlessly set astride the eastern border of the European Union, the frontier across which millions of refugees have now fled their native land over the past 100 days. Now, those 10 short years feel like an unthinkable lifetime. Not everyone will remember Euro 2012 fondly. Some of the ultra fans that follow Ukrainian – and Polish – clubs are among the most infamously racist crews in football. For that reason, the families of England players Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain stayed home. But I don’t remember anything in summer 2012 to resemble the vicious racism with which England’s Under-21 team was assailed in Serbia that October. It was football and fun – the kind of prolonged, dotty international street party for which we love the game at its best. With business to see to in eastern Europe that summer, I breezed into Ukraine with a friend from Warsaw for three matches. There is little to mutually embitter fans of Denmark and the Netherlands – or the good citizens of Kharkiv and the fans of its team, Metalist Kharkiv – so that when the two north European nations met to play there on 9 June 2012, the local fans were ready to greet both for a boulevard-and-bar jamboree. I registered a band of Metalist ultras called Sect 82 who, after Denmark’s 1-0 win that night, pitched up at the Patrick Irish pub in town – its walls adorned with beer mats from all over the world. They were part of the bartering of Ukrainian and club scarves for foam-rubber Viking helmets and “Hup Holland Hup” sunhats, learning songs in tricky languages over Obolon premium beer.    Wales will be led by Gareth Bale in the play-off, with almost every fan in the world supporting Ukraine. Photograph: Rebecca Naden/Reuters   Ukraine v Sweden in Kyiv was the host nation’s opening game on 11 June, and a battle between titans: Ukraine’s national hero Andriy Shevchenko, who had returned to play for the home Dynamo Kyiv team after sojourns at Milan and Chelsea, and Sweden’s Zlatan Ibrahimović, who had just left Milan for Paris Saint-Germain. The former scored twice, the latter only once, and Ukraine’s 2-1 victory launched euphorically hopeful festivities into a warm night, happily conjoined by defeated but devil-may-care Swedes, who converged on the central Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), with several attempts to climb its central column, an Obolon over the eight. The ride from Kyiv to Donetsk – a city founded by a Welsh steel magnate at the invitation of imperial Russia – for Ukraine’s game against England was easy and pleasant, aboard a newly installed Hyundai train along on a refurbished high-speed line. The only discomfort then was the eyeballing between England fans (who had played their previous game in Kyiv) and home supporters.   Related: Wales v the world: emotional Ukraine final could make any fan’s heart skip a beat | Elis James   On the afternoon of the game, 19 June, England fans prowled around under the watchful eye of Shakhtar Donetsk supporters and their compatriots. But there were even a few tentative rounds of drinks together – not usually part of England fans’ away protocol – at Bar Svinya (Bar Pig), where visiting fans wanted to behold the wild boar kept there. Inside Shaktar’s rebuilt stadium, Wayne Rooney scored the only goal of the game, ensuring England qualified for the knockout rounds but eliminating the hosts. The home supporters were rightly outraged by the disallowing of a Marko Dević equaliser, the ball scooped from inside the goal by John Terry (a pre-goalline technology “where’s VAR when you needed it” moment). It is hard to believe now that this is the same country. A year after the Ukraine-Sweden game, Maidan Nezalezhnosti became synonymous with “Euromaiden” demonstrations against the then pro-Russian government’s refusal to endorse free trade with the EU, and within another four months, the Maidan uprising against the government. If Ukraine’s football ultras had not been political to start with, politics found them: they became forces in response to the Russian separatist rebellion in the Donbas region, and Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The now popular chant “Putin khuylo! La-la-la” (Putin is a dickhead) began among Metalist supporters.    Andriy Shevchenko of Ukraine during Euro 2012. Photograph: Yuri Kochetkov/EPA   The customary truce between fans of clubs who loathe each other so as to support the national team in 2012 was reforged in 2014, but now in defence of the nation. This included supporters in the Russian-speaking east: the presence of pro-Ukrainian Shakhtar ultras visiting Odesa for a game on 2 May 2014, and their role in clashes with pro-Russian activists that day, was part of a carnage in which 48 people died. That railway line between Kyiv and Donetsk, specially modernised for the Euros, is now severed by ferocious frontline fighting. Donetsk has been part of Russian-separatist territory since 2014, when Shakhtar, then champions, were “exiled” to Lviv, later Kharkiv, then Kyiv. Metalist Kharkiv’s Sect 82 ultras became the Azov militia – initially with far-right loyalties – in armed combat against the Russian-backed uprising, and were latterly the vanguard of the heroic, doomed defence of Mariupol. Russia played their games during Euro 2012 in Poland, and there were skirmishes before the two countries faced one another in a qualifying match – nothing serious. And six years after those heady days when Spain lifted the trophy in Kyiv, an equally successful international football competition, the 2018 World Cup – won by France’s perfect team – was hosted by and staged in … er … Russia."
98,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/05/newspaper-owner-lee-zion-minnesota-ukraine-war,2022-06-05T10:15:03Z,‘How could I sit at my desk as Ukrainian children die?’: small-town newspaperman heads to war,"Lee Zion is preparing to head to Ukraine this summer. “I have gotten all my shots. I have started putting personal possessions into storage, giving other things away. I’ve adopted out two cats,” he said. “And minor things – I’m trying to learn the language. I can at least communicate some basic needs. Like ‘me want cookie,’” he said. For four years, Zion has worked seven days a week at a small-town Minnesota newspaper. But now, disgusted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he plans to fly to Europe and help the Ukrainians in any way he can. First, though, he has to find a new boss for the Lafayette Nicollet Ledger. It’s not an easy role for whoever takes it on: Zion works more than 80 hours a week, he told the Guardian, as “owner, editor, reporter, photographer, layout guy and the person who takes all the garbage to the recycling center”. Zion tried selling the paper without much luck, so he’s trying another route: giving it away. “You can own a weekly newspaper – FOR FREE,” he wrote in an advertisement, saying he wanted to leave the paper “in good hands”. Though the paper is “financially solvent”, Zion wrote, “the next owner must show that he or she has the knowledge, experience and the drive to take on the challenge”. Robert Lawson, 37, a local resident and former editor of another area newspaper, replied. “It was just kind of perfect,” he said of the opportunity.   Related: Proprietor offers Minnesota paper free to new owner so he can fight in Ukraine   Lawson plans to keep the paper on its current trajectory, focused on local news – recent headlines cover Memorial Day events and graduation ceremonies, with church schedules and a community calendar – while expanding its online presence. “My big plans are basically: see what we can do to enhance content and what we can do to enhance community involvement,” he told the Guardian. Zion, 54, has worked in the newspaper business for decades, starting as a reporter and working his way up to editor and now owner. Originally from Brooklyn, he was drawn to the Ledger after seeing an advertisement seeking a new owner for the Minnesota outlet. “I was looking for a new job because I was gruesomely mistreated at the previous paper I was working at,” he said. “I jumped at the chance.” He bought it for $35,000 in 2018; now he’s repeating the process from the other side. One element of his predecessor’s work Lawson may not pursue is his editorials, which have occasionally landed him in hot water. In 2019, Zion wrote a piece on declining fertility rates in which he suggested a remedy: women could “have sex with me”. It also suggested increasing immigration, noting that this might bother some people because it could “make America less white”, referencing Donald Trump’s “Make America great again” slogan. “I did exactly what Jonathan Swift did. I took an issue that had racial overtones and was connected with a birth. That is to say A Modest Proposal,” he said, referring to the 18th-century satirical essay suggesting impoverished Irish people sell their children to rich people as food. “And then I proposed a commonsense solution, just as Jonathan Swift was doing.” But many in the community were not amused. “There was a huge outcry. Some people really, really loved that piece. And others hated it. Hated it with a passion,” Zion said. Subscriptions were cancelled and advertisements dropped. “We are asking that Mr Zion make Lafayette, and the surrounding communities, less creepy again by packing up your wares and opening shop someplace else,” said a reader on Facebook, as Southern Minnesota News reported. “One of them said, I will never advertise in this paper, so long as Lee Zion is in charge,” Zion said. “Now that I’m done, a new person can probably win this guy back.” Another controversy came after officials used a nearby Courtland city council meeting to criticize a flood of maintenance-related complaints from the public, Zion said. The post-meeting headline: “Cortland residents, you complain too much. And by the way, your water rates are going up.” The mayor “told me that he would never advertise in the paper ever again”, Zion said. “But eventually he forgave me.” While Lawson prepares to take over, Zion is investigating different organizations that might be able to help him find a way to be useful, militarily or otherwise, in Ukraine. “How could I sit comfortably at my desk while Ukrainian children die?” he asked. “If they want me as a teacher, I’ll be a teacher. If they want me as a guy driving a truck, delivering supplies, I will deliver supplies. If they need help with cleanup efforts in Bucha and other cities, I will assist with the cleanup,” he said. He’ll stay, he said, “for as long as they’ll have me. And who knows? There’s a Jewish community in Ukraine. I could find a home among the Jewish community.” He hopes his plans inspire others to take similar action. “Although this is an important story, I am not the most important part of the story,” Zion said. His aim in speaking up is “that people reading this article would feel strongly about it. And they’d say: hey, if this guy can go to Ukraine, why can’t I?” As for Zion himself, “with luck, I’ll be on a plane by July 15.”"

Vladimir Putin can aim missiles at Ukrainians from across the border whenever he wants – but Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s troops can’t shoot back at their tormentors. Strange, too, that the UN is seeking Russia’s agreement for convoys to escort grain from Odesa and other Ukrainian ports. It’s Putin who is preventing 22 million tonnes of grain reaching the Middle East and Africa, where millions face famine. Don’t ask permission. Send a multinational force to smash his illegal blockade. The US and UK have made a big fuss in the past about preserving freedom of navigation in international waters, including the Black Sea. Puzzlingly, they in effect ceded these waters on 24 February to Russia, whose navy bombards and besieges Ukraine’s cities and ports at will. Wise heads point to Turkey’s guardianship of an obscure 1936 convention restricting wartime passage through the Bosphorus. A fig for that! Recep Tayyip Erdoğan should help his western partners. It’s high time Turkey’s ageing bully minded his responsibilities, which include welcoming Nato applicants Finland and Sweden. Nato’s reluctance to seize the initiative, rather than passively reacting to Russian actions, is unfathomable, too. Proposals for a no-fly zone and safe havens in western Ukraine are repeatedly rejected as too risky. So dare to try something else! Nato has the muscle and means. It could do much more to stop the systematic killing of civilians and push Russia back, as previously argued here. Left to fight alone, Zelenskiy pleads for heavy weapons but his pleas still often go unmet or responses are delayed. “We need to get serious about supplying [Ukraine’s] army so that it can do what the world is asking it to do: fight a world superpower alone on the battlefield,” says US Gen Philip Breedlove, formerly Nato commander in Europe. He’s right. It’s no good relying on sanctions, as the EU proved again last week. Its decision to let Hungary’s mini-Putin, Viktor Orbán, water down an oil embargo was weird. Yet Germany’s Olaf Scholz and fellow euro-wobblers are content. Duty done on oil, they will now more stubbornly resist what their bankers and businessmen most fear: sanctions on gas. Hardest of all to understand, perhaps, is why some western governments persist in attempting business as usual with Putin, who they know, for certain, is overseeing atrocities and war crimes. Scholz and France’s Emmanuel Macron hold regular phone chats with him. It’s said they are realists seeking peace. No. They are dupes, normalising mass murder. Sophisticated diplomats explain that it’s necessary to maintain channels of communication. Fearful of a destabilising Russian meltdown, they want to give Putin a “way out”. But they don’t get it. “Messianic” Putin’s just not listening.    Joe Biden said Russia must ‘pay a heavy price’ for its actions. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters   Another puzzle: why is Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s shameless spewing of disinformation tolerated around the world? Why do Russia’s ambassadors get free airtime to spin their lies? It’s time they were all sent packing, western envoys in Moscow recalled, and $300bn in frozen Russian central bank assets repurposed to rebuild Ukraine. One reason such impunity endures is that China and India, though sworn to uphold the UN charter and international law, prefer instead to profit from Ukraine’s agony by buying cut-price Russian energy. Developing countries, meanwhile, cast themselves as innocent victims of a far-off conflict that has nothing to do with them. A global consensus on Ukraine is sadly lacking. But, ultimately, it’s the western allies’ own policy contradictions and timidity that most undermine Kyiv at a critical moment, 100 days into the war. Half-measures are their default position. They won’t go the whole hog. Intimidated by Putin’s nuclear hints, fearful of escalation, and alarmed at rising domestic costs, western leaders are scared, deep down, that Ukraine may win. At the same time, they are committed – politically, morally, rhetorically – to ensuring it does not lose.   Where does it leave the west? Afraid, in equal measure, of victory and defeat, and hoping for some form of shabby compromise   The resulting confusion, representing the worst of both worlds, is personified by Biden. Ostensibly clarifying US war aims last week, he insisted Russia that must “pay a heavy price”. If it went unpunished, it would “open the door to aggression elsewhere, with catastrophic consequences the world over”. Yet even as he raised the stakes, Biden avoided any mention of Ukrainian victory. There was nothing about winning. Instead, he spoke vaguely of future negotiations while offering personal assurances to Putin. The US did not seek his overthrow, he said. Nor would Nato attack unless attacked. Contradicting recent Pentagon statements, Biden insisted: “We do not want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia.” He ignored hawkish UK foreign secretary Liz Truss’s maximalist demand for a full Russian retreat from Crimea and all of Donbas. Biden’s too-modest war aims are a manifesto for the muddled middle. Where does this leave Ukraine? Still solitary, still lacking essential modern weapons, and still fighting for its life with one hand tied behind its back – by its closest friends. And where does it leave the west? Afraid, in equal measure, of victory and defeat, and hoping, fingers crossed, for some form of shabby compromise – if Ukraine can avoid capitulation and if Putin ultimately condescends to accept territory and immunity in return for halting the horror. This weak-kneed approach guarantees only one thing: the war will run and run. Diplomacy is stalled. Sanctions are having limited effect and, in terms of energy prices, are harming Europe more than Russia. Only increased direct and indirect Nato military pressure can shift this dynamic. Campaigning in 2020, Biden pledged an end to what he called America’s “forever wars”. Now, tremulously pulling their punches, he and other western leaders condemn Ukrainians to exactly that."

Air raid sirens had gone off earlier across much of Ukraine, including in the Kyiv region. Ukrainian forces have been managing to push back against Russian troops in fierce fighting in Sievierodonetsk despite Moscow “throwing all its power” into capturing the key eastern city, Ukrainian officials said on Saturday. In an interview aired online, the Luhansk regional governor, Sergiy Gaiday, said the Russian army has taken control over most of Sievierodonetsk, but that Ukrainian forces were still pushing them back. According to the Russian army, however, some Ukrainian military units have been withdrawing from Sievierodonetsk. “Some units of the Ukrainian army, having suffered critical losses during fighting for Sievierodonetsk, are pulling out towards Lysychansk”, Sievierodonetsk’s twin city, which sits just across a river, the defence ministry said in a statement. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said Moscow’s anti-aircraft forces have shot down dozens of Ukrainian weapons and are “cracking them like nuts”, in an interview that aired on Saturday. According to Reuters, Russian news agency RIA, which first cited the comments, quoted Putin as responding to a question about US-supplied arms by saying Russia was coping easily and had already destroyed the weapons by the dozen.   Interactive   Kyiv has rebuked the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for saying it was important not to “humiliate Russia”. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted in response: “Calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it. Because it is Russia that humiliates itself. We all better focus on how to put Russia in its place. This will bring peace and save lives.” Western sanctions would not have an effect on Russia’s oil exports, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Lavrov also predicted a significant increase in profits from energy shipments this year, Russian news agency Tass reported. A EU decision to extend sanctions against Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko to his wife is “irrational” because she has never held Russian citizenship or resided in Russia, a representative for the couple said. The EU sanctioned Melnichenko’s wife on Friday as part of a sixth round of sanctions against Russia for waging a war against Ukraine. The Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, said that while it was impossible to predict when the war would end, “my optimistic prognosis is that it is realistic to achieve this as early as this year”, Reuters quoted the defence ministry as saying. Negotiations with Russia will only resume after new weapons arrive from the west and Ukraine’s position is “strengthened”, said David Arakhamia, a member of Ukraine’s negotiation group with Russia. Another negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said there was no point in talks with Russia until Moscow’s forces are pushed back as far as possible towards Ukraine’s borders. Ukraine’s intelligence services are in communication with hundreds of captured Azovstal steelworks fighters and Kyiv is doing all it can to ensure their release, according to Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrskiy. Ukraine wants the fighters to be returned in a prisoner swap. However, some Russian officials have said forces could be tried or executed. The US expressed support for international investigations into war crimes committed in Ukraine, the US embassy in Kyiv announced. “Those responsible for war crimes – including direct perpetrators and those who ordered them – must face justice,” the embassy tweeted on Saturday. A famous monastery in eastern Ukraine, Svyatohirsk Lavra, caught fire after it was hit by Russian shelling. The monastery is affiliated with the Moscow Patriarchate, which is run by Putin’s ally Patriarch Kirill. There were reports that four monks were killed as a result of the attack . The Ukrainian first lady, Olena Zelenska, and other officials commemorated 261 children killed by the Russian war against Ukraine by hanging bells near St Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv. The bells symbolise the voices of killed children, Euromaidan Press reported. "

These are not for her own granddaughter, but a three-year-old girl she has never met, who is arriving from Kharkiv in Ukraine. Three-year-old Daneliia, along with her parents Vlodymyr and Julia, is the second Ukrainian refugee family Jenni and her husband, Mark Chapple, are helping settle in Quirindi on the north-west slopes of New South Wales. They initially meet new arrivals online before they arrive in the country, ascertaining their needs – from what size clothing each person wears, to whether they take any medication.    Jenni and Mark Chapple have taken in two Ukrainian families who have fled their country after Russia’s invasion. Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian   But the Chapples are thinking about the big picture too. They want to help Ukrainian refugees get work and make a life for themselves in northwestern NSW, where the cost of living is cheaper and workers are desperately needed across all industries. Their aim is to see 40 to 60 Ukrainian refugees living independently around Quirindi, the Liverpool Plains, Tamworth and Gunnedah by the year’s end, arriving via Newcastle and the Hunter regions. The Chapples’ proposal for a pathway to assist Ukrainians settle in regional NSW – the CH2 project – is named after the first couple the Chapples sponsored, who are working with them on the initiative. Yuri and Inna Chuchenko say Mark and Jenni have done more than help them. “They save us. They now like our mother and father,” Yuri Chuchenko says. The couple were working in Thailand and expecting their first baby when Russia invaded Ukraine.    Yuri, Inna, Jenni, Mark, Julia, Daneliia and Vlodymyr. The Chapples have taken in two Ukrainian couples. Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian   Mark, who had worked in Ukraine in agricultural insurance, was sending offers of help to all his Ukrainian contacts, including friends of friends, like the Chuchenkos. While former prime minister Scott Morrison said it would be wrong to assume Ukrainians would not want to return home after the war, Yuri Chuchenko says “in Ukraine, there is no way back.” Yuri, from the Donbas region occupied eight years ago, says, “I can say that I lost everything twice. The first time I lost my home town in 2014. And now [my country] in 2022.” Inna, whose family is from Nikolaev in the country’s south, says her grandmother had to shelter for three weeks in her apartment’s bathroom without water or electricity. Yuri says, “we want to stay in this country. We want to become citizens of this country, because unfortunately we don’t have a home any more.”    Julia and Daneliia share a giggle in Ukrainian. Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian   ‘Crying out for workers’ The Australian government’s temporary humanitarian visa is granted for a three-year period, during which the holder can work, study and access Medicare, and potentially participate in free English language tuition. Since 23 February, the Department of Home Affairs has granted more than 7,800 – mostly temporary – visas to Ukrainians in Ukraine and hundreds more to Ukrainians elsewhere. More than 3,000 have since arrived in Australia. About 40% have entered NSW, with just under 30% arriving in Victoria and 15% in Queensland. A spokesperson for the department said it is, “progressing visa applications from Ukrainian nationals as a priority, particularly for those with a connection to Australia.” Mark says that while the majority of refugees are coming to the cities, the high cost of living in Sydney and Melbourne could make the experience stressful rather than successful, especially when government support ends. “We know that the regional centres are crying out for workers. I’ve had three offers today,” he says, referring to requests for Ukrainian workers. According to Jenni, the inability to get the labour needed in regional areas means employers are happy to support the Ukrainian refugees with a job and accommodation.    Yuri and Jenni prepare dinner. The menu, like their household, is a composite of Australian and Slavic culture – shepherd’s pie and chicken stroganoff. Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian   A central part of the transition will be to connect refugees with host families until permanent accommodation is found. Jenni says five families have already volunteered, with offers to support refugees with temporary accommodation for a couple of weeks as well as more long-term arrangements. Building communities The interest from Ukrainian refugees has been strong. Since Mark posted about the project online at the beginning of May, the Chapples are receiving 12 inquiries a day. Jenni says the Ukrainians who have contacted them offer a wide range of skills, including those areas where professionals are most desperately needed. “We’ve got pharmacists that are looking for work. We’ve got doctors looking for work. Now how often do we hear of regional areas saying we need more doctors out here? So there’s there’s been some promising conversations around those specialty jobs as well,” she says. The project would also provide immediate support, including assistance with visa applications, clothing and health. However, Mark says, “our basis for wanting to make this work is longevity.”    Vlodymyr and Julia at home with the Chappels.

Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian   In addition to helping the refugees find well-paid jobs that will allow them to become independent, the project aims to help them become part of regional communities and facilitate cultural exchange. According to Mark, one of the reasons refugees have gathered in cities is because that is where they can keep in touch with fellow Ukrainian expatriates. “We don’t want to send two families to Gunnedah, for example, we want to send 20 families so that they can also have their own culture … so that they feel that they’ve got another family of Ukrainians two streets away,” he says. The Chapples want Ukrainians to be able to teach regional communities about their culture at the same time as the project helps Ukrainians understand Australian – especially Indigenous – culture.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter     The project aims to provide community hubs for training and immediate support services, as well as working closely with local education facilities, and community groups to integrate Ukrainian refugees. Jenni says the Ukrainian people bring an incredible community-mindedness, strong work ethic as well as amazing food. Yuri, a past contestant on Ukrainian MasterChef, has not only been cooking delicious meals for the Chapples but will also participate in a cultural cooking festival, the Newcastle Unity in Diversity festival, held at the end of June. ‘This is a paradise’ The Chapples have already contacted local governments for support and want to work with the state and federal governments. They have held meetings with the Liverpool Plains and Gunnedah shire councils to gain support for the project and discuss the opportunities for Ukrainian refugees in the regions that may be of mutual benefit. Councillor Donna Lawson at the Liverpool Plains Shire Council says, “for the Liverpool Plains, we can benefit from a population injection of people who offer a wide variety of skills, many of whom have run successful companies before the war”. “We offer a safe and friendly community that may also provide an easier and more relaxed transition to living in Australia than the city,” she says.    The household sits down for a meal of shepherd’s pie and chicken stroganoff. Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian      Yuri makes a household favourite, ‘Chuchenko balls’. Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian   Jenni says the ups and downs of families adjusting to their new life are evident. “They’re hearing the news daily. When Kharkiv and Kyiv were being hard hit, you could see their faces, from about lunchtime onwards, their moods would change, they would be getting information through from home, families having to relocate to a safe space, all of those things,” she says. Jenni stresses the project will support the mental health of refugees, to address any trauma arising from the war. Having communication lines for all medical support, but especially mental health support, is a crucial part of the Chapples’ project. According to Mark, “regional towns are very well renowned for helping others. There’s no doubt in my mind, we can make it work.” “It was said to Yurii on his first trip to Quirindi, ‘why would you want to come and live in a town of 3,000 people?’.” “And he said, ‘well, why wouldn’t I want to come? This is a paradise’.” “And for their eyes it is paradise.”  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community "

Five minutes later our first vehicle broke down.” Their destination was a zoo in the port city of Odesa, an eight-hour drive through the war-torn country, where nine lions were rapidly running out of food. Ukraine is home to a large number of exotic animals held in private zoos or as amusements in hotels and tourist venues. The Russian invasion, which has displaced more than 14 million people, of which seven million have fled Ukraine as refugees, also prompted an influx of animal rights organisations determined to rescue animals that had been left behind.   Related: ‘We had too much to do to be scared’: the couple who fled Irpin with 19 dogs   But few wildlife rescuers have the ability to remove and rehome a pride of lions. De Lange has lived in Ukraine since 2014, rescuing bears, wolves and lions from unsafe conditions through the organisation Warriors of Wildlife. He spoke to the Guardian from a cafe in Bucharest, the day after finishing the 72-hour journey to retrieve the lions and settle them safely in a Romanian zoo.    Lionel de Lange, left, with the team of lion rescuers in Odesa.  Photograph: Nathan Lainé/Magnus News   The nine lions from Odesa took his tally of big cats brought across the border to 38. Even with his experience in planning animal extractions, things can easily go wrong. Before the truck broke down, De Lange had to change his planned route to avoid Russian bombing. He decided to travel through Moldova, requiring a new set of paperwork under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) to approve cross-border travel, and a new round of negotiations with both Moldova and Ukraine to provide a police escort. “That wasn’t to protect us against Russians,” De Lange says. The police were on hand to shoot the lions in case of an accident. “Just in case something does go wrong you have got to have someone on standby that can deal with sedation, to have firearms available, if there’s an accident, if a box falls off after you’ve been in an accident and it splits open … because the authorities when we’re at the border post ask us all these questions as to how safe it is and what we’re doing. With one lion they don’t really bother, and I’ve done it before, but nine lions it made everyone really wary.” The rescue crew, a collection of British army veterans and a veterinarian, arrived in Odesa at 4pm last Monday, too late to begin the seven-hour long sedation and loading process. The zoo owner paid for them to spend the night in a five-star seaside hotel, where the lights were turned out at 9pm so that Russian missiles could not target them. “That was probably the weirdest part,” De Lange says. “We enjoyed our meals by the glow of our telephones.”    British vet Gemma Campling sedates a lion before its removal from Odesa.  Photograph: Nathan Lainé/Magnus News   The next morning the lions were sedated, given a health check and vaccinated before being lifted pallbearer-style into travelling crates, where they were woken up before the journey began. Four were loaded into a Ford Transit van driven by De Lange, another four were placed on the back of an ex-military truck, and one was in the back of a converted ambulance.   Related: The volunteers saving animals in Ukraine – photo essay   All made the journey safely, save some bumps and bruises from the travel crates. “It’s stressful from the first moment you see them when you realise ‘I am going to knock them down’,” De Lange says. “You’re dealing with wild animals who are completely unpredictable, and then you are adding in the element of travelling … you might get attacked if the Russians decide to target that area on that time of the morning or the day, so there are so many things you are thinking about constantly.” The most difficult part of the operation, De Lange says, was finding a zoo in Romania that would take nine lions, the largest of which weighed 230kg, until a more permanent home could be organised. The city of Târgu Mureș agreed to host the lions until 1 September, by which time De Lange hopes to have secured them a permanent home in a sanctuary in the US. “All the other stuff was easy – getting vehicles, doing the trip, even though it was a little bit nerve-racking at time and we didn’t know if we were going to be in the middle of a missile strike or not. It was finding a temporary home for nine cats [that was difficult].” The rescue was funded by Animals Australia, which raised money to cover vehicle hire. It is the second lion rescue the organisation has funded since the war began on 24 February."

Being patriotic isn’t something that Labour has always looked comfortable with, but progressive politics has been at its most successful and transformational when it captures the best of British values, nurtures our world-famous institutions and instils a belief that our best days lie ahead of us, not just in the past. A quick survey across British politics today tells us that it’s not the Conservatives that enshrine these patriotic principles but Labour. First, our British values, which we hold dear and are known for around the world: diplomacy, rule of law, decency and integrity. Our country has always led the way as a measured and decent example to the world, but our government has called this into question. In contrast, Keir Starmer’s public pledge to resign were he to receive a fine, was a typically British thing to do. The prime minister has repeatedly shown he is unable to uphold those values, and the reaction of the public at St Paul’s showed they know it too. Division, hatred and culture wars might work elsewhere but it’s not who Britons are, and Labour won’t rise to these false divides. The vast majority of decent Britons believe in live and let live, love and let love. In the words of my good friend Jo Cox, we have much more that unites us than that which divides us. Tolerance, openness and generosity are core British beliefs. This year, we also mark the anniversaries of some of our great British cultural and sporting institutions known around the world and which underpin some of our greatest exports, from the BBC to Channel 4, the Premier League, FA Cup and Wimbledon. British music, actors, art, TV and film are known and loved abroad as well as at home. The jubilee is an example of our famous culture and pageantry on show, attracting international tourists. Labour will cherish these institutions and understands the fragile ecosystem they sit in and the massive opportunities for British jobs and British-made content they produce. Yes, the digital and streaming revolution is upon us, but short-term “red meat” policies, like selling off Channel 4 as the government has proposed, will only diminish our global reputation, cost jobs and value, and will deny British viewers those moments of togetherness. Rampaging cultural vandalism is not patriotic. Our beloved NHS and world-renowned education system need long-term investment, utilising the latest technologies and research, and training the next generation of doctors and teachers, rather than a vision for public services that owes more to a bygone era than a state-of-the-art envy of the world. But patriotism is also a belief, confidence and determination that our country’s future can be better than our past, and a promise to British people that the next generation will do better than the last. Labour will defend and protect our values, traditions and institutions, but also ensure that we, like the Queen and the monarchy, move with the times and keep Britain at the cutting edge of innovation. In order to succeed in the rapidly changing world, moving to a net zero and digital future, we need an audacious plan to take the lead in the industries of the future so we can sell goods and services that deliver the carbon-neutral world everyone needs and provide good jobs in every part of the country. Labour’s bold climate investment pledge is just that. The new spirit of national resilience and security in our supplies, made more urgent by Covid and the war in Ukraine, sits at the heart of our “buy, make and sell British” plans. If 10 years ago we had invested in our own capacity for 5G technology, say, we would not find ourselves at the mercy of Huawei and the Chinese Communist party today. If the Tories hadn’t effectively banned onshore wind in the UK, we would produce more additional energy than we import from Russia. Dealing with the cost of living crisis, as the government has latterly accepted, means stepping in to protect our people and the economy while being unafraid to tax excess profits. That’s what patriotic politics and economics in today’s global high winds look like – not going back to imperial measures, or throwing out of the window all our high standards and expertise, and putting up for sale our greatest wares and future infrastructure. When it comes to upholding British values, securing the future of our world-leading institutions, and the promise for the next generation, it’s the Labour party which puts Britain first."

Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were giving up recent gains in the city, as reports also emerged of foreign fighters joining the battle for the easternmost city held by Kyiv in the fiercely contested Donbas. The governor told Ukrainian television that Russia had “previously managed to capture most of the city” – but added in a tweet that the military had pushed them back by 20%. “They are really suffering huge losses,” he said. The claims are hard to verify amid the heavy fighting. The Russians have concentrated their forces on trying to surround and capture the city in the past two weeks, advancing at a rate of 500 metres to a kilometre a day.  Interactive Ukrainian forces have staged a counterattack on Sievierodonetsk.  Ukrainians fighting on the eastern frontline estimated that their forces controlled “around 30%” of Sievierodonetsk on Saturday, greater than some rough estimates from late last week. They said Russian forces were running out of infantry troops and were unable to push forward. Slava Vladimirovich, a Ukrainian soldier with the Donbas battalion, said the Russian army was pounding the neighbouring city of Lysychansk. Two civilians died in a Russian artillery attack, he said. Thousands of civilians were still in the city, but many seemed reluctant to leave. “We were supposed to evacuate ten people. Only three turned up. Poor people are afraid of losing what little they have. There is no water in the city and long queues of civilians waiting at distribution points.” Foreign fighters from countries including Australia, Georgia, France and Brazil were also being deployed by Ukraine in Sievierodonetsk, according to a video report circulating widely. It features an interview with a masked soldier, who said he was from Australia, saying he had “stepped up” to join the fighting. A second soldier, speaking English with an American accent, said he was “a 22-year-old kid” from Georgia and promised to help push Russians back. “We’re on the right side of the history,” he added.    Residents are evacuated from Slavyansk on 4 June. Photograph: Bernat Armangué/AP   But the risks to foreign fighters in a brutal and deadly conflict remain considerable. Ukraine’s International Legion acknowledged on Saturday that four people from the Netherlands, Australia, Germany and France had been killed. It named them as Ronald Vogelaar, Michael O’Neill, Björn Benjamin Clavis and Wilfried Blériot. Vogelaar, 55, was previously reported by Dutch media to have been killed by artillery fire near Kharkiv last month; while O’Neill, 47, was said to be a humanitarian worker when it was reported he had been killed in late May. Blériot, 32, meanwhile, had appeared in a film early in March, where he told the Argentinian publication Clarin that he was “ready to die” as he headed out from Poland. He said he had spent “a year in the French army” and cried when he talked about his two young children. Russia wants to capture Sievierodonetsk, which had a population of 100,000 before the war, and Lysychansk, which is across the river, to complete the capture of the Luhansk oblast, one of the two Donbas regions claimed by Russia. From there they hope to capture the Ukrainian cities of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk in the neighbouring Donetsk oblast. Loud explosions could be heard from the centre of Slavyansk on Saturday, from Russian artillery in the distance and from answering Ukrainian fire. The city’s air raid siren went off repeatedly. Some people were out and about on the streets of Slavyansk buying food. The city is without gas and water and has intermittent electricity. Many residents have left, but some have remained behind and another group has returned to frontline Donbas towns after fleeing and then running out of money. A wooden Russian Orthodox church, close to the Sviatohirsk monastery, around 12 miles north of Slavyansk, was pictured burning as a result of the fighting. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said four people were killed and four wounded following a Russian attack. Three hundred people, including 60 children, were said by Zelenskiy to be sheltering in the monastery complex. British defence intelligence said that Russia had been able combine “airstrikes and massed artillery fire to bring its overwhelming firepower to bear” and so support “its creeping advance”.    A woman pushes a baby buggy near a building damaged during a Russian attack in Slavyansk on 4 June. Photograph: Bernat Armangué/AP   But the British said it had come at a cost. The use of “unguided munitions has led to the widespread destruction of built-up areas in the Donbas”. Film released by Haidai, the Luhansk governor, early on Saturday showed apartment blocks damaged and on fire, while shelling was audible near by. Haidai acknowledged that the situation for the Ukrainians in Sievierodonetsk remained difficult, but said he believed the defenders could now hold out for another fortnight. A Russian victory in that timescale was “not realistic”, he added. After that, the governor said, he hoped that newly promised western Himars – multiple-launch rocket systems – could tip the balance in Kyiv’s favour, by allowing Ukraine to target the Russians at a greater distance than before. “As soon as we have enough western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,” the governor added. The Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, said on Friday that he had been told by Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, that Russia would now “accelerate” the invasion. New tactics that “will make it possible to significantly increase the effectiveness of offensive manoeuvres” had been identified, Kadyrov added. But in an overnight assessment, the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank closely following the conflict, said it was sceptical about the claims made. On speeding the rate of advance, the institute said it believed “Russian forces are unlikely to be able to do so”. Russian authorities began issuing passports in Kherson and Melitopol on Friday, according to the institute. Ukraine’s military said that the Russian occupiers faced growing resistance in the southern region, which had forced Moscow to reinforce its troops there."

The French president said his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, had made a “historic and fundamental” error in invading Ukraine, but that nevertheless a wider escalation in hostilities had to be avoided. Giving an interview to a group of regional newspapers in his home country, Macron said: “We must not humiliate Russia so that the day the fighting stops, we can build a way out through diplomatic channels.” The role of France was to be that of “a mediating power”, the president added, saying he had put “time and energy” into ensuring the conflict did not escalate into a wider war, including negotiating with the Russian president.   Related: Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine says Russian forces suffering ‘huge losses’ as it fights back in Sievierodonetsk – live   “I have lost count of the conversations I have had with Vladimir Putin since December,” Macron said. They amounted to 100 hours’ worth, he added, which were “at the request of” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Macron has consistently sought to engage directly with Putin and has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in the conflict, including on an 80-minute phone call at the end of last month with the Russian leader and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. That has led to periodic accusations that the French leader wants Ukraine to make concessions to secure a peace agreement, although the Élysée Palace says any peace agreement must be negotiated between Putin and Zelenskiy, showing “due respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”. None of the discussions, however, appear to have borne fruit. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine passed the 100-day mark on Friday, with little sign of the war ending amid heavy fighting in the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk. Macron said he believed Putin had “isolated himself” and did not know what to do next. “Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,” the French president added. Elsewhere, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said overnight he had spoken to Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, in his efforts to deal with Ankara’s resistance to Finland and Sweden joining the military alliance. Stoltenberg said he had “a constructive phone call” with Erdoğan and welcomed Turkey’s efforts to reach a maritime agreement between Russia and Ukraine to allow for the resumption of food exports from Ukraine’s blockaded ports. Turkey is threatening to block the accession of Finland and Sweden, who have sought to join Nato in the aftermath of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, accusing the two countries of supporting Kurdish figures Ankara says are terrorists. Erdoğan’s office said the president had emphasised that Sweden and Finland should “make it clear that they have stopped supporting terrorism”, lift defence export restrictions placed on Turkey, and be “ready to show alliance solidarity”.  The two Nordic countries had imposed curbs after Turkey launched a military operation to take control of areas in Syria previously held by the country’s Kurdish minority. Stoltenberg tweeted late on Friday that he discussed with Marin “the need to address Turkey’s concerns and move forward” to ensure the Finnish and Swedish membership applications were approved."

But when Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, it was the final push for him to switch fully to Ukrainian. “Unfortunately, I grew up speaking Russian, but it’s not pleasant to speak the same language as the army that is destroying whole areas of our country,” said Zinkivskyi, a 35-year-old street artist widely known to Kharkiv residents, who usually refer to him by his first name. The switch of language is part of a broader journey towards a more pronounced Ukrainian identity for Zinkivskyi, something shared by many in the largely Russian-speaking areas of east and south Ukraine. It is a process which has become more pronounced in the past three months, but it has been brewing for some years. As a young artist, Zinkivskyi had a longstanding dream: an exhibition in Moscow. Kharkiv is just a few dozen miles from the border with Russia and has long been almost entirely Russian-speaking. Culturally, Moscow felt like the centre of the universe. But when Zinkivskyi finally made it to a gallery there in 2012, he was horrified. “They were obnoxious and patronising about Kharkiv and Ukraine, and frankly I thought: fuck them,” he said. He returned to Kharkiv and became more focused on the Ukrainian art scene. After the annexation of Crimea, in 2014, Zinkivskyi started trying to speak some Ukrainian with a few friends. Now he has fully switched, and for the first time is also introducing political and patriotic themes into his art. The language issue is something that comes up again and again in Kharkiv. Oleksandra Panchenko, a 22-year-old interior designer, said that since 2014 she had been trying hard to improve her Ukrainian, but conceded that she still often speaks Russian with friends. However, she is adamant that by the time she has children, she will be fluent enough to speak only Ukrainian at home. “I grew up in a Russian-language family, my kids will grow up in a Ukrainian-language family,” she said. Back in 2014, there were separatist rumblings in Kharkiv, with some people looking to the swift annexation of Crimea and wondering if all of eastern Ukraine might not be better off inside Russia. But eight years of observing the miserable conditions in the Russian proxy states of Donetsk and Luhansk dampened those feelings, and Russia’s invasion has almost entirely extinguished them.    One of Gamlet’s murals in the centre of Kharkiv, with the title ‘I work as nobody’. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Observer   Panchenko, who has painted her nails blue and yellow and describes herself as a staunch patriot, made a guess at the political allegiances of Kharkiv residents before the war, based on her broad circle of acquaintances. About 10% of the city used to be what are disparagingly known as vatniki – aggressively pro-Russian – she said. She described 30% as being like her, “Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine”, and 50% were “neutral – they felt Ukrainian but not that strongly”. Russia’s war on Ukraine has pushed people in this neutral category more firmly into the patriotic camp, creating a much broader and more passionate pro-Ukrainian base than ever existed previously, particularly in the east of the country. “There were a lot of neutral people here, but as soon as it came to the war, a lot of them decided to fight,” said Vsevolod Kozhemyako, a businessman who runs an agricultural company and once featured on the Forbes list of the 100 richest Ukrainians. Kozhemyako was skiing in Europe when the war began, and left his family to return to Ukraine and set up a volunteer battalion. His unit has been based close to the frontline outside Kharkiv, in settlements that have come under relentless Russian fire. Three out of four of Kozhemyako’s grandparents were Russian, and during the Soviet era his passport listed his nationality as Russian. However, he said that ever since the Orange Revolution of 2004 he had been a strong Ukrainian patriot and rejected the influence of Russia in Ukraine. “Russians and Ukrainians are absolutely different. I am Russian-speaking, I think in Russian and I have three-quarter Russian blood, but the part of Ukrainian blood in me made its mark,” he said in an interview in Kharkiv city centre, where he now allows himself the occasional day away from his unit. Kozhemyako and Zinkivskyi are old acquaintances, and when the artist told the businessman he wanted to sign up, Kozhemyako welcomed him to the battalion, but told him he should fight with a paintbrush and not a gun. Since then, Zinkivskyi has been busy painting slogans on buildings damaged by Russian missiles. He also crossed out the street signs on Pushkin Street and renamed it English Street, which he says is recognition of British military support for Ukraine. “Gamlet is very patriotic and his works are quite philosophical,” said Kozhemyako. “They make people think in the direction of a new Ukraine. This is very important, especially now.” The geographical and cultural variations inside Ukraine were one of the reasons why Putin and other Russian leaders tried to claim the country was an artificial construct. Instead, they now find their bloody invasion has done more than anything to bring the different parts of Ukraine together under a common identity, in opposition to Moscow. The Russian invasion has simultaneously given those who might be neutral in their allegiances a stark choice about what kind of country they want to identify with, and provided a rallying point that allows for a broad and inclusive idea of what it means to be a Ukrainian patriot.

Photograph: Serhii Nuzhnenko/Reuters   In the early days of the war, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, passed a decree banning the activities of a number of pro-Russian parties, and the country’s most notorious pro-Russian politician, Viktor Medvedchuk, was arrested. Medvedchuk, whose daughter is Putin’s goddaughter, has long been seen as Putin’s man in Kyiv. But even some of his close associates have rebranded themselves as patriots in the wake of the invasion. Yuriy Zagorodny, a member of parliament, had been at Medvedchuk’s side since they both worked in the administration of former president Leonid Kuchma in the early 2000s. However, he said, he made a decision in the early days of the war that his relationship with Medvedchuk was over. “Ukraine is my homeland, Russia is an aggressor and Putin is the main criminal of the 21st century,” he said in an interview in Kyiv, employing dramatically different rhetoric to what he had used during a previous interview in mid-February. Zagorodny said he had joined the territorial defence unit in his home town, south of Kyiv, in the first days of the war. He had spent some nights on a checkpoint and other days overseeing the construction of trenches. He said he had spent hours checking the documents of drivers of passing cars; then when he had to travel to Kyiv for parliamentary sittings, he was stopped at another checkpoint, where the men pulled him out of the car and subjected him to verbal abuse when they saw he was an MP from Medvedchuk’s party. He assured the men he was a firm patriot. “I do have a feeling of guilt, but what we wanted was peaceful coexistence between the countries. Of course, now, that’s all over,” said Zagorodny. “Changing shoes in mid-air” is the Ukrainian expression for this kind of rapid transformation in views to fit in with the prevailing climate, but for all that there may be cynical self-preservation at work, there is also a sense that people have had to make a choice: either come down on the side of a Ukraine that is fighting for the right to exist, or on that of a Russia that launches missiles and bombs on sleeping cities, and where freedom of expression is no longer legal. For many, it is an easy choice, and by launching the attack on Ukraine in the way he did, Putin has deprived Russia of many of its natural supporters in the country.   Related: ‘Ukrainian has become a symbol’: interest in language spikes amid Russia invasion   “My 11-year old nephew talks about ‘Putler’ – a mix of Putin and Hitler. He will spend his whole life hating Russia, and his children will too. Maybe in several generations that will change, but not sooner than that,” said Zagorodny. In the port of Odesa, the mayor, Hennadiy Trukhanov, widely seen as pro-Russian, released an angry video in the early days of the war in response to the Kremlin’s claims that it was defending Russian speakers in the country. “Who the fuck are you planning to defend here?” he asked. In the central city of Kryvyi Rih, the mayor, Oleksandr Vilkul, previously seen as pro-Russian, has also rebranded himself as a patriot and taken up defence of the city. As well as strengthening the sense of Ukrainian identity among politicians and the general population in the south and east of the country, the war has also helped increase respect for these areas in the patriotic strongholds of western and central Ukraine, where some doubted the loyalty of parts of the east, particularly after 2014. Kozhemyako said any doubts about these regions should now be considered settled: “A lot of people in western Ukraine saw how Kharkiv fights,” he said."

Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk oblast, told Ukrainian television that Russian forces were forfeiting recent gains in the city, the easternmost held by Kyiv in the Donbas region, where fighting has been concentrated. The governor said Russia had “previously managed to capture most of the city” – but added in a tweet that the military had pushed them back by 20%. “They are really suffering huge losses,” he said. Such claims are hard to verify amid the heavy fighting, which had seen the Russian invaders concentrate their forces on trying to surround and capture the city in the past two weeks, advancing at a rate of 500m to 1km a day. British defence intelligence said on Saturday that Russia had been able combine “airstrikes and massed artillery fires to bring its overwhelming firepower to bear” and so support “its creeping advance”. But the British said it had come at a cost. The use of “unguided munitions has led to the widespread destruction of built-up areas in the Donbas”. Film released by Haidai early on Saturday showed apartment blocks damaged and on fire, while shelling was heard nearby. Haidai acknowledged that the situation for the Ukrainians in Sievierodonetsk remained difficult, but said he believed the defenders could now hold out for another fortnight. A Russian victory in that timescale was “not realistic”, he added. After that, the governor said, he hoped that newly promised western Himars multiple launch rocket systems could tip the balance in Kyiv’s favour, by allowing Ukraine to target them at a greater distance that before.  Interactive  “But as soon as we have enough western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,” the governor added. Foreign fighters from countries such as Australia, Georgia, France and Brazil were also being deployed by Ukraine in Sievierodonetsk, according to a video report released on Friday. It features an interview with a masked soldier speaking clearly with an Australian accent, saying he had “stepped up” to join the fighting. The Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, said on Friday he had been told by Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, that Russia would now “accelerate” the invasion. New tactics that “will make it possible to significantly increase the effectiveness of offensive manoeuvres” had been identified, Kadyrov added. But in an overnight assessment, the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank closely following the conflict, said it was sceptical about the claims made. On speeding the rate of advance, the institute said it believed “Russian forces are unlikely to be able to do so”. In Ukraine’s southern Odesa region on Saturday morning, a missile hit an agricultural storage unit, wounding two people, the regional administration’s spokesperson wrote on Telegram. Ukraine said it had also shot down four other cruise missiles launched from a submarine in the Black Sea – while Russia’s defence ministry said its forces shot down a Ukrainian military transport plane near Odesa. Two people died and at least two were injured in Russian shelling of civilian infrastructure in the north-eastern Kharkiv region on Friday, Ukraine’s Interfax reported, citing emergency services. Russian authorities began issuing passports in Kherson and Melitopol on Friday, according to the Institute for the Study of War, while Ukraine’s military said the occupiers faced growing resistance in the southern region, which had forced Moscow to reinforce its troops there."

However, as crowds flocked to central London to toast the Queen on the jubilee bank holiday weekend, some would have been staggered if they ordered a round of drinks in one pub, after it emerged the the average price of a pint has topped £8 for the first time. The average price of a pint has risen by more than 70% since the financial crisis nearly 15 years ago, from £2.30 in 2008 to £3.95, according to research by the consultancy CGA . In one pub in London, which CGA did not name, the average price of a pint was £8.06 – the most expensive it has ever recorded, in its survey of more than 5,550 random bars and pubs. The cheapest was in Lancashire and cost £1.79. If prices had solely followed inflation between January 2008 and April 2022, the cost of a pint would have been £3.35, the Financial Times reported. Since 2020, CGA’s figures show that the cost of an average pint has risen by more than 7%. Further increases are expected. The price hikes have been driven by a combination of factors, including inflation and the war in Ukraine. The country was the world’s fourth largest producer of barley, a key ingredient in beer. Analysts Bernstein warned that costs of malting barley could reach 70%. In the UK, inflation recently reached 9%, with the governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey warning that it will hit a four-decade high later this year. These issues add to existing problems for pubs after a turbulent period during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since reopening in 2021, they have had higher food and drink supply prices, exacerbated by delays to cross-channel deliveries since Brexit, and a shortage of staff as customers returned. This led landlords to offer higher wages to attract and retain workers, but further ate into their profit margins. Suffolk brewer and pub company Adnams warned in March that barley prices meant they were likely to increase prices for customers. Wolverhampton-based Marstons increased prices by 8% in March, and customers in Greene King pubs are now paying 5% more on average per pint.   Related: Pints for the platinum jubilee | Fiona Beckett on drink   Clive Watson, the chair of City Pub Group, which operates 41 pubs in London and the south, told the FT that ingredient costs were up 10%, “wage inflation is probably 7% and electricity inflation is 100%, so that blended cost price probably puts the price of a pint of beer up 12% to 13%”. CPG raised its prices by 5-6% in December, but said it would hold back on further increases to encourage people to go to the pub. A trend followed by others after 18 months of stop-start closures during the Covid pandemic."
109,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/04/ukraine-campaign-de-russify-odesa,2022-06-04T04:00:26Z,‘We need the truth’: the campaign to ‘de-Russify’ Odesa,"Standing in front of a statue of a gruff-looking Soviet general, Peter Obukhov explained his plan to purge Russian names from the city of Odesa. “The things written here are unacceptable. You can see the word ‘Kremlin’. And there’s Lenin’s face as well,” he said, pointing to an inscription beneath the monument to Rodion Malinovsky. Obukhov is a deputy in Odesa’s city parliament. He said he did not want to pull down Malinovsky’s statue, a fate that has befallen Lenin sculptures all across Ukraine. The Soviet defence minister was born in Odesa and liberated the city from the Nazis during the second world war. “I would rewrite the sign and get rid of the communist symbols. We need the truth,” Obukhov said. He has proposed a campaign of “de-Russification” once Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine comes to an end. Nobody quite know when that might be. In the meantime, Obukhov has drawn up a list of historical figures who have given their names to streets in Odesa, a Russian-speaking port. Some are from its imperial past, others date from the USSR.    Peter Obukhov: ‘I would rewrite the sign and get rid of the communist symbols. We need the truth.’ Photograph: Luke Harding   Acceptable names are marked in green. These include anyone with a connection to Odesa. Alexander Pushkin is on the list, despite supporting Russia’s 1831 war against Poland. The poet wrote some of his masterpiece Eugene Onegin in the city, where he lived for 11 months. Catherine the Great, Odesa’s founder, makes the cut, together with the writers Nikolai Gogol and Ivan Bunin. Catherine’s celebrated general Alexander Suvorov, however, is on a red list of names. Obukhov described Suvorov as a “symbol of Russian imperial militancy” and wants to rename the Odesa district named after him. The deputy proposes purging Russian locations (Baikal, Omsk, Rostov) and binning Dmitry Donskoy, a 14th-century Moscow prince. In a poll of Odesa residents, 44% supported de-Russification, 36% were opposed, and 7% voted to bring back communist-era names. This minority was largely made up of pensioners, Obukhov said, nostalgic for the Soviet Union. The city got rid of Soviet Army Boulevard and Karl Liebknecht Street – now Bunin Street – soon after Ukraine became independent in 1991. Trundling through Odesa on an electrical sightseeing car, tour guide Larisa Otkalenko said she probably supported the name changes. “You can’t print what I think about Putin because it’s rude. What I can say is his view of history is completely untrue. It’s bunk,” she said. “Yes, Odesa is a Russian-speaking city. But it’s also multinational and cosmopolitan.”    Larissa Otkalenko: ‘You can’t print what I think about Putin because it’s rude.’ Photograph: Handout   Otkalenko said the territory originally belonged to the Ottoman Turks. The commander who seized their Black Sea fortress, José de Ribas, was a Spaniard serving in the Russian military. The city’s first governor, the Duke of Richelieu, was a French aristocrat. It was Richelieu who seeded the acacia trees that line Odesa’s boulevards. A Flemish engineer, Franz de Volán, drew up the city’s street grid. Other foreigners who lived and settled in Odesa included Greeks, Poles and Italians, Otkalenko said. Odesa was once the third biggest Jewish city in the world, after New York and Warsaw, she added. Most perished between 1941-44 during the Nazi occupation. “We don’t need Russia to save us. We can take care of ourselves,” Otkalenko said, adding: “Our beautiful city was known as little Paris.”  Interactive  One of her customers, however, was not convinced by the plan. Natasha Smirnova, a local Odesa resident, had taken her 10-year-old daughter, Anja, on the sightseeing tour, which goes past the city’s Primorsky Boulevard, overlooking Odesa’s harbour. Smirnova said she was opposed to changing the name of the seaside Suvorovskiy district, where she lives. “The past is messy,” she said. “But it’s ours. Street names are a part of that.” Smirnova said her mother was Ukrainian and her father Russian. Her great-grandfather had perished in a Nazi concentration camp. She said she was proud of Odesa’s Russian roots. At the same time she said she detested Putin’s invasion and his attempt to annex Ukraine and to make it part of a new Russian imperium. As she spoke, the electric car went past Odesa’s ornate French rococo opera theatre, now sandbagged. Ukraine has already twice dismantled Soviet-era state symbols. In the 1990s many Lenin statues were removed, including those in Odesa. Kyiv’s parliament embarked on a further round of “decommunisation” in 2014 after the Maidan uprising against the country’s pro-Moscow president, Viktor Yanukovych, and Putin’s annexation of Crimea and his war in the eastern Donbas region. In Russian-occupied areas this process is going into reverse. In April Russian troops erected a new statue of Lenin outside the main administration building in the southern city of Henichesk, in Kherson province. They have torn down blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags from municipal buildings and hung Russian and Soviet ones in their place. This “re-Russification” is part of Putin’s attempt to erase Ukraine, Kyiv says. Otkalenko’s tour ended opposite an art nouveau mansion on Derybasivska Street, Odesa’s pedestrian boulevard, named after De Ribas. “History is the servant of all ages and epochs,” she said."

Russian forces were already on the outskirts of the city, in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. Mayor Gennady Matsegora released a video address explaining that he had accepted a Russian offer. “I took the decision to take part in negotiations to avoid loss of life,” he said. Matsegora handed over the city to Russian control without a fight. Later, he allegedly provided Russian soldiers with transportation, housing, fuel and food. Now he is one of hundreds of Ukrainian citizens accused of collaborating with the invading army, and could face up to 15 years in prison. Kupyansk is still under Russian occupation, so Matsegora has not been arrested, but in places where the Russians have been pushed back, Ukrainian authorities have already made arrests of those suspected of collaboration. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said at the beginning of May that there were more than 700 treason cases open against Ukrainian citizens, and another 700 cases of collaboration. In the besieged Kharkiv region alone, prosecutors said they had now opened 50 cases, including against seven police officers, five mayors and a judge. They all stand accused of paving the way for Moscow to occupy villages and kill dozens of people.    War crimes prosecutors at work during an exhumation in Mala Rohan, Kharkiv. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian   “Out of those 50 people, half have been arrested. The others, unfortunately, remain in the occupied territories and haven’t been arrested yet,” said Oleksandr Filchakov, the chief prosecutor for the Kharkiv region. The governor of the region, Oleh Synehubov, said there were various forms of collaboration, such as handing over information. “It can include giving the Russians lists of those locals who are in the military, the families of military people, or the people who are veterans of the [Donbas] war,” he said. Filchakov claimed there were cases of collaborators handing the Russians lists of wealthy local people. “They explained to the occupiers where they live and what kind of riches they possess. So later the Russian soldiers came to those houses together with the collaborators and were stealing their possessions.”    Oleksandr Filchakov, Kharkiv region’s chief prosecutor. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian   In the village of Pivdenne, the chair of the council was arrested for attempted collaboration. Prosecutors said they found evidence that he had been in touch with Russian agents. “He was making preparations for the occupation. But the Russians never arrived there and we arrested him a few days after the invasion,” said Maksym Klymovets, a district prosecutor in the Kharkiv region. For the Ukrainian authorities, it is important to show that punishment for those who helped the Russian invasion will be swift and stern. But at the same time, the process comes with lots of tricky questions. These include whether Ukraine’s prosecutors and judges, who for years have battled accusations of corruption and nepotism, can be trusted not to abuse the process. Numerous high-ranking officials may also be asked questions about negligence at the beginning of the invasion, or even treason.    Scene of destruction from north Kharkiv city. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian   On Sunday the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, showed that accusations of negligence or worse could extend right to the top of government structures when he fired the head of the SBU security service in Kharkiv during a visit to the city. Zelenskiy accused the man of “thinking only about himself” instead of helping to defend the city during the initial days of the war. “The law enforcement organs will look into what his motives were,” Zelenskiy said. Another problem is how to grade different forms of collaboration and make sure punishments are appropriate. “There are people who were looking forward to jump into the other army, there are people who collaborated because they wanted to save their lives, and there are also people who were forced to collaborate at gunpoint,” said Ilko Bozhko, a Ukrainian military official from the east operational command. Ukrainian prosecutors face a particularly tricky task in the occupied areas of southern Ukraine, which were taken by the Russians at the start of the war. There, Russian officials are busy attempting to impose Russian rule over everyday life, such as by moving Ukrainian schools to the Russian curriculum.    War crimes prosecutor at work among crime scene tape. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian   If Ukraine regains control of these territories, there could be thousands of people who have committed acts that fall under the technical definition of collaboration, such as teachers who continued to work under the new curriculum. But many feel prosecutors should be lenient when it comes to such cases. “This is a very difficult and painful question,” said Sergii Gorbachov, the education ombudsman of Ukraine. “It’s very difficult to decide where the line is. I don’t think you can demand heroism from unarmed civilian people. The most important thing is not to voluntarily collaborate. When we get the occupiers off all our land, I expect big problems over how we decide on this question.” Volodymyr Ariev, an MP with the European Solidarity party headed by Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko, said he hoped parliament would draft a new law on collaboration that would allow for swift and effective punishment but also prevent abuse and rank cases in order of seriousness. “We need to be able to ascertain the level of collaboration and also the level of damage caused, and to be able to differentiate in different cases,” he said. “Some people should go to jail, but some should just be fined or banned from public service.”   Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST "

Leading US general Mark Milley met Finnish president Sauli Niinisto on Friday to pledge US support for Finland’s and Sweden’s Nato membership bids, which Turkey is blocking. Milley told reporters it was clear that if the two countries’ applications were approved “they will bring a significant increase in the military capability of Nato”, Agence France-Presse reported. After Helsinki, Milley was expected to visit neighbouring Sweden on Saturday. A driver transporting two Reuters journalists in eastern Ukraine was killed and the two reporters lightly wounded on Friday, a company spokesperson said. They had come under fire while en route to Severodonetsk. “They were travelling in a vehicle provided by the Russian-backed separatists and driven by an individual assigned by the separatists,” the international news agency said. Vladimir Putin says exporting grain from Ukraine is “no problem”, after Moscow’s invasion raised fears of a global food crisis. The Russian president said in a televised interview on Friday that exporting could be done via Ukrainian ports, via others under Russian control, or even via central Europe. Putin accused the west of “bluster” by claiming Moscow was preventing the grain exports from Ukraine. The African Union head and Senegalese president, Macky Sall, said he was “reassured” after meeting with Putin regarding global food shortages caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Other issues discussed between the two leaders included grain supplies that are stuck in Ukrainian ports. Ukraine’s ambassador to Ankara, Vasyl Bodna, accused Russia of “stealing” and sending Ukrainian grain abroad. “Russia shamelessly steals Ukrainian grain and sends it overseas from Crimea, including to Turkey,” Bodna said in a tweet on Friday. 14 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes, the majority women and children, the UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, Amin Awad, said on Friday. In a statement released on the 100th day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Awad spoke of displaced Ukrainians, describing the “scale and speed of [their] displacement not witnessed in history”. Moscow will help restore and rebuild Luhansk and Donetsk, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced on Friday after a visit to Luhansk. About 1,500 specialists from various departments of the Moscow municipal economy complex and 500 pieces of equipment had arrived in Luhansk, the mayor said. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said that Ukraine must meet all the necessary standards and conditions for accession. She went on to call on the EU to help Ukraine achieve its goals. “Victory shall be ours,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video featuring the same key ministers and advisers who appeared with him in a defiant broadcast on 24 February, the day Putin launched his assault. “The armed forces of Ukraine are here,” Zelenskiy added. “Most importantly, our people, the people of our country, are here. We have been defending Ukraine for 100 days already … Glory to Ukraine.”  French president Emmanuel Macron says Putin has committed a “historic and fundamental error” by invading Ukraine and is now “isolated”. “I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,” Macron said in an interview with French regional media on Friday. He said he did not “rule out” a visit to Kyiv. Switzerland’s government has rejected a request by Denmark to send nearly two-dozen Swiss-made armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine. Switzerland’s executive federal council confirmed the decision on Friday after Denmark requested Switzerland transfer 22 Swiss-made Piranha III wheeled armoured personnel carriers, which Denmark had obtained and stored in Germany, to Ukraine.

Catch up with the must-read news and analysis,"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. 100 days of a war that is reshaping Europe Michael Safi and Courtney Yusuf charted the war, starting from the final hours of the decades-long peace enjoyed by Europe’s major powers. On 23 February, Volodomyr Ksienich, a 22-year-old student organiser, spent the night with friends. They talked about the war, of course. “Nobody really believed it would happen,” he says. Many analysts concurred. The Russian forces massing on the border were too few to occupy the country, they argued. State media had done little to prepare the Russian public for war. An invasion would trigger economic penalties so ruinous to the Russian economy that no leader would dare risk it. All of this was true, and they were wrong. Seán Clarke, Pablo Gutiérrez and Monika Cvorak tracked the bloody war of attrition that has since devastated Ukraine, killed thousands and displaced millions. Their graphic guide charts the crisis in four phases: Russia’s initial invasion, the hampered advance into Kyiv, the retreat and reorientation of its forces, and the assault now under way in Ukraine’s east. The progression of Russian control is recorded and superimposed across a map of Ukraine as the conflict progresses, as collated by the Institute for the Study of War and the American Enterprise Institute’s critical threats project.

Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images   The fight for Sievierodonetsk  Russia’s forces appear to be taking control of the strategically important city of Sievierodonetsk in Ukraine’s east, as more western allies promise additional missile systems and arms to Kyiv. Jon Henley reported that 80% of the city is now in Russian hands. Capturing Sievierodonetsk would give the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, control of all of Luhansk – the region that, with Donetsk, makes up Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland – consolidating a shift in battlefield momentum after his forces were pushed back from Kyiv and northern Ukraine. In scenes eerily similar to Mariupol and its Azovstal steelworks, about 800 people, including children, were reported to be hiding beneath a chemical factory in the city amid the fighting. Peter Beaumont and the Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, reported on the high levels of attrition on the Ukrainian side, whose defenders have been pounded by Russian shelling. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the US Newsmax TV channel: “The situation is very difficult – we’re losing 60 to 100 soldiers per day as killed in action and something around 500 people as wounded in action.”  Gone for now are the Russian attempts at wider encirclements of Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, which included a failed river crossing in early May. Instead, units are focused on smaller encirclements – or “cauldrons” – and sheer concentration at Sievierodonetsk. The expected loss of Sievierdonetsk, however, “is unlikely to be the crux” of Russia’s Donbas campaign, a western official said this week, adding that the war that could now grind on “to the end of the year” given the slow rate of Moscow’s advance. The struggle to find and bury Mariupol’s dead Isobel Koshiw reports on the tens of thousands of people trying to identify their loved ones in Mariupol after the besieged port city finally capitulated to Russian forces last month. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the city’s mayor, estimated that 22,000 died in the two months of fighting. However, one person among several coordinating burials in the city, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believed the total was closer to 50,000. With the temperatures rising as summer approaches, the odour of dead bodies wafts down certain streets. There are bodies still trapped under rubble or in flats or buried in shallow makeshift or mass graves – a number of which appear to have been poorly marked or even unmarked.

As Luke Harding reported from Mykolaiv, such a deployment from the west has the potential to change the outcome of the war. Roman Kostenko, a member of Ukraine’s parliament and a special forces commander, told the Guardian: “If our partners give us heavy artillery and advanced systems like MRLS [multiple-launch rocket systems], we can win and take back occupied territory.” However, world affairs editor Julian Borger noted that the deal was for just four systems and came with strings attached and was still weeks away from being operational. He wrote: “Biden has made clear that he will not allow a catastrophic failure of Ukrainian defences, but it is just as evident he has concerns about the implications of catastrophic success, a rout of Russian forces with the decisive help of western weapons, bringing with it the danger of a defeated Putin lashing out.”    Ukrainians in front of a national flag after an airstrike in Lviv, western Ukraine.

But few of the tourists who spotted its sleek black hull would have appreciated that it was quite a find, reported Jon Ungoed-Thomas and Gemma Handy. Vessels with ties to Russian oligarchs hit by sanctions are no longer reporting their position to an automatic global locator, and the Alfa Nero – linked to the Russian billionaire Andrey Guryev – is one of them. At least six superyachts linked to UK-sanctioned oligarchs have “gone dark” on ocean tracking systems as the global hunt for the assets of Russia’s super-rich intensifies, an investigation by the Observer revealed. One crew member on a superyacht linked to a Russian oligarch sanctioned by the UK said: “We were told to turn off the AIS [automatic identification system].

“Victory shall be ours,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video featuring the same key ministers and advisers who appeared with him in a defiant broadcast on 24 February, the day his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, launched his unprovoked assault.
“Our team is much bigger,” Zelenskiy declared on Friday. “The armed forces of Ukraine are here. Most importantly, our people, the people of our country, are here. We have been defending Ukraine for 100 days already … Glory to Ukraine.”







In Moscow, the Kremlin’s official spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, insisted that “certain results have been achieved” by Russia’s “military operation”, pointing to what he called the “liberation” of some areas from the “pro-Nazi armed forces of Ukraine”.
Tens of thousands have been killed, millions sent fleeing and whole towns reduced to rubble since the start of the invasion, with Russia’s forces – repelled from around the capital, Kyiv, by fierce Ukrainian resistance – now focused on capturing the east.
Moscow has seized about a fifth of Ukrainian territory, tripling the land under its occupation since 2014 when it seized Crimea and parts of Donbas, where some of the fiercest fighting is centred on the industrial city of Sieverodonetsk.
“This war has and will have no winner,” said Amin Awad, the UN’s assistant secretary-general and crisis coordinator for Ukraine. “Rather, we have witnessed for 100 days what is lost: lives, homes, jobs and prospects.”

Zelenskiy’s office said fierce fighting continued in the city centre on Friday, with the invading forces “shelling civilian infrastructure and Ukrainian military”. The Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Gaidai, said Russian troops were “levelling everything”.
Accusing Moscow’s forces of destroying hospitals, schools and roads, he said the resistance was confined now to about a fifth of the city, with Ukrainian troops still holding a sprawling steel and chemical works in an industrial zone, Gaidai said.
The situation in Lysychansk, Severodonetsk’s twin city across the river Donets, also looked bad, with about 60% of infrastructure and housing destroyed and internet, mobile phone and gas services all out of operation, Oleksandr Zaika, head of the city’s military-civil administration, said.
Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleskiy Reznikov, said Ukrainian forces had some success in Sievierodonetsk overnight, adding that artillery crews were already training on new Himars and MLRS rocket systems pledged earlier this week by the US and Britain.
Washington had said this week it expected around three weeks of training would be needed before Ukraine can begin using the rockets, which could target Russian rear supply lines and help negate Russia’s artillery fire-power advantage at the front.
Russia’s recent massive assault in the east has been one of the deadliest phases of the war for both sides, with Moscow making slow but steady progress, squeezing the defenders inside a pocket in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that make up Donbas.

Amid rising fears of a global food crisis, the head of the African Union, Senegalese president, Macky Sall, met Putin in the Black Sea port of Sochi to raise concerns about the war’s consequences for the continent.
Russia and Ukraine account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies, while Russia is also a big fertiliser exporter, and Ukraine is a major exporter of corn and sunflower oil. Ukrainian exports have been halted by a Russian blockade of the country’s ports, while western sanctions have cut off access to Russian output.
Sall asked Putin to “be aware that our countries, even if they are far from the theatre, are victims on an economic level” of the conflict. “That is really creating serious threats to the food security of the continent,” Sall said.
Putin did not mention grain supplies to reporters but said Russia was “always on Africa’s side” and was now keen to improve cooperation. “We place great importance on our relations with African counties,” he said.
Turkey said it expected progress on a plan to unlock grain exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports when Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, visits the country next week. Both Moscow and Kyiv want a solution to the crisis, a Turkish official said.

Though hurdles remain – such as payment mechanisms for the agricultural products, and mines floating in the Black Sea – the official said Moscow could “take further positive steps” after it said on Thursday it was open to the plan.
Turkey has already said it is ready to take on a role within an “observation mechanism” if a deal is reached, potentially involving a Turkish naval escort for tankers leaving Ukraine. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, hosts his Russian counterpart for talks on the plan on 8 June.
Belarus was ready to allow the transit of Ukraine’s grain to Baltic Sea ports if it is also allowed to ship Belarusian goods from those ports, the country’s leader, Alexander Lukashenko, was quoted as saying. Exports from Ukraine via Belarus have been one of the options in discussions led by the UN.

In a phone call with UN secretary-general António Guterres on Friday, Lukashenko said Belarus was ready to free up needed capacity on its railway for Ukraine’s grain, and proposed organising talks between Belarus, Ukraine and other countries ready to provide access to their ports.
On the defence and security front, Turkey said progress on Finland and Sweden’s applications to join Nato – which Ankara is blocking – before an alliance summit in Madrid later this month would depend on their response to Turkey’s demands.
Turkey accuses the two Nordic countries of supporting and harbouring Kurdish militants and other groups it deems terrorists, and says it has not yet received a satisfactory response from Stockholm or Helsinki.
“Nato is not a tourism or economic alliance; it is a security alliance, which means that it must provide security to all its members equally and fairly,” said Ibrahim Kalin, spokesperson and chief foreign policy adviser to Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan."

Some were fast asleep. There had been rumours of a Russian invasion for weeks, and the previous evening US and Ukrainian intelligence received information that pointed to an invasion that night with almost certainty. Yet there was little in the way of last-minute efforts to fortify towns close to the border, or to warn citizens to brace for the inevitable. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was at home with his wife and children. Numerous officials in charge of key regions close to the border, and mayors of cities containing strategic military targets, have told the Guardian in interviews over recent weeks that they were in bed and woke up in shock at the sound of booms, rather than having spent the final hours of peace coordinating the defence of their towns. It is possible it would not have made a difference anyway, but as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reaches the 100-day mark some are starting to look back at the period in the buildup to the war and ask if more could have been done. There is widespread acknowledgment, even among Zelenskiy’s fiercest political opponents, that his wartime leadership has been defiant and inspirational. But along with the praise there are also questions about those weeks before the war, in January and February. Why did Zelenskiy remain sceptical of the increasingly alarming warnings from US intelligence that Vladimir Putin was planning a full-scale invasion? Could he have done more to prepare the country? Would it have had much effect? “We don’t want to initiate an investigation for a while, but we cannot avoid it in the future,” said Volodymyr Ariev, an MP with the European Solidarity party of the former president Petro Poroshenko. He said his party had been pushing for weeks in the run-up to the invasion for the government to take the threat of war more seriously.    Volodymyr Zelenskiy giving an address from Kyiv on 24 February. Photograph: Reuters   For much of January and February, the Americans were claiming privately and publicly that their intelligence showed there was a very high likelihood that Russia’s military buildup was not a bluff. Zelenskiy, meanwhile, was impressing on the Americans that he had to balance preparations for war with concerns for the economy, and telling Ukrainians not to panic. “If everyone thinks there will be war tomorrow, the economy will be in real trouble,” a high-ranking government official said at the time. In the first weeks of the year, Ukraine’s long-planned “territorial defence” structures were formalised, and many Ukrainians began to search for their nearest bomb shelter, as the talk of war hung in the air. But few people genuinely believed the threat was real, and many millions of Ukrainians did not make even elementary preparations for the onset of full-scale conflict and weeks of life in bomb shelters or basements. For some, this lack of planning would have terrible consequences when the war did come. Many people were reassured by the calming messaging coming from senior Ukrainian officials. In late January Zelenskiy called the frequent US warnings of possible war a “mistake”. On 6 February his adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the chances of resolving the crisis through negotiations were “substantially higher” than the threat of attack. Ukrainian officials became increasingly frustrated with Washington’s public warnings of invasion. When US defence officials briefed media outlets that Russia had moved supplies of blood close to the border, seen as a sign of imminent military action, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, categorically denied the report. “The purpose of such information is to spread panic and fear in our society,” she told the Guardian at the time. But as February went on, US officials became more and more convinced that the Ukrainians – and some European allies – were not taking the threat seriously enough. There were frequent phone conversations between various senior officials in Washington and their counterparts in Kyiv.    A traffic jam in Kyiv on 24 February. Photograph: Sergey Dolzhenko/EPA   On 11 February the US embassy in Kyiv called in diplomats from a large number of embassies in the city. The visitors were brought to a secure part of the embassy, small groups at a time, and handed sheets of paper on which was printed information about the likelihood and severity of Russian military action, according to three people with knowledge of the meetings. They were allowed to take notes but not to take the papers away. Soon after, the remaining US diplomats in Kyiv were evacuated to Lviv. “It isn’t just time to leave Ukraine, it is past time to leave Ukraine,” a senior US administration official said. Several other embassies followed the Americans west. Ukrainian intelligence was also receiving its own information, and around 17 February it got word about a number of Russian military orders that had been signed off that suggested something major was brewing. But still there was disbelief that this could mean the Americans had been right all along. “Most people believed it would be limited to something in the Donbas and the Russians would not try the full-scale operation,” said a source close to the Ukrainian intelligence services.   Related: Devastation and defiance in Ukraine: 100 days of a war that is reshaping Europe   Some people in the services were much more worried than others. “You could tell from what people were saying to you, and how worried they were, which foreign intelligence services they had contacts in,” said the source. When the invasion did come, Zelenskiy and his team ignored offers from western countries to evacuate, and provided spirited leadership that helped kickstart the fierce Ukrainian defence efforts. For now, this bravery and determination, as well as the need for unity during wartime, has prevented any backlash over possible mistakes in the buildup. Serhiy Taruta, a businessman and MP who in 2014 was the Kyiv-appointed governor of the Donetsk region, said it was too early to raise issues about the buildup, but later a discussion would be necessary. “Of course there are a lot of questions, the Russians were already drawing the letter Z on their equipment and everyone was saying something is coming, and our guys here were saying ‘don’t worry’. But that’s for after the war. Now is the time for the consolidation of society,” he said in an interview.   Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST  In retrospect, perhaps the best argument for why many in the Ukrainian elite did not believe the US intelligence could be accurate can be found in the dismal failure of Russia’s attempt to take the major cities of Kyiv and Kharkiv. “It just didn’t compute,” said the source close to the intelligence services. “A takeover of Kyiv and the whole country in a few days? We thought it would be a disaster for Russia. And it was. We didn’t think Putin could be that stupid.”"
115,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/03/the-regenerative-farm-working-to-improve-soil-without-fertilisers,2022-06-03T07:00:02Z,The regenerative farm working to improve soil without fertilisers ,"Lettuces are sprouting, the wildflowers are in bloom and a buzzard is circling above the meadow on a sunny spring day at Huxhams Cross Farm near the village of Dartington in Devon. From the top of a hill, Marina O’Connell can survey most of the 15 hectares (37 acres) she has dedicated the past six years to transforming. When she took over running the farm in 2015, she recalls, the farm contractor called this a “miserable bit of land”. Now the fields and hedgerows buzz with wildlife, and young farm workers chat as they sow carrot seeds and plant out early spinach. Further downhill, chickens peck about near polytunnels full of vegetables and soft fruit. This idyllic spot has been completely redesigned, and indeed reborn, since it was bought by the charitable community benefit society the Biodynamic Land Trust, with the goal of creating a sustainable and “regenerative” agricultural system. Regenerative farming usually refers to an approach that involves improving the health of soil and water, while reducing tilling, growing a diverse range of plants and produce, and keeping organic matter in the soil to help crops grow. While such farms are still few and far between, more and more food producers are considering whether it is an idea whose time has come, as many of them are buffeted by cost headwinds, loss of subsidies and soaring costs. The “three Fs” – fertiliser, animal feed and fuel – have all surged in price since Russia invaded Ukraine. Unlike regenerative farming, other modern farming systems rely on synthetic fertiliser to restore nutrients and pesticides to rid plants of pests and disease. Farmers will soon pay much more for these inputs amid the biggest shake-up in agriculture in a generation, as the EU farm subsidy scheme – known as the common agricultural policy – is replaced post-Brexit.    The soil at Huxhams Cross. It took two years to restore the soil biome at the farm through regenerative methods. Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer   The government’s new environmental land management schemes will focus more on the impact of agriculture, as farmers are increasingly encouraged to consider the climate, biodiversity and their stewardship of nature. “We’ve got climate change in real time now and I think farmers are also aware the weather is changing,” says O’Connell. “The increase in nitrogen fertilisers has just woken up everybody to the urgency of it. So what was a transition that was going to happen over maybe 10 years, has suddenly been accelerated.” Before 2015, Huxhams Cross was nominally part of a dairy farm owned by the Dartington Hall Trust; barley was grown on half of the fields for feeding cattle, while the wetland meadows were effectively abandoned. The new owners called on O’Connell, involved in sustainable farming since the 1980s, with the challenge to create a financially independent farm, and nurse the land back to health. She and her family moved from Essex to pursue the project. “It had been farmed using chemicals and the soil was essentially dead,” O’Connell says. “We spent two years repairing the soil biome,” she adds, the ecosystem of plants, animals and microbes living below the surface. As an illustration, O’Connell proffers two plastic food containers. One contains a pale, hard, desiccated ball of earth that she collected on arrival at the farm, while another is filled with the soil now: aerated, dark brown and made up of different size particles. One of the first jobs for O’Connell and her team was planning the workflow on the future farm, and the crop layout, planting rows of trees across the sloping land and installing a rainwater-harvesting system.    Lettuces grow at Huxhams Cross. Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer   They planted legumes and clovers, which fix nitrogen in the earth, to start restoring the soil. These “green manures” are grown for a couple of years before crops can be sown, ideally grazed by animals who add their own droppings. At Huxhams Cross, the henhouses are wheeled across the field each week, while the farm’s two cows, Daffodil and Daisy, act as “giant lawnmowers”. Such a time-consuming process might disappoint farmers looking for a quick fix to free themselves from rocketing fertiliser costs. “It’s really a two-year transition phase in my experience,” O’Connell explains. “It’s got to be planned for. If you’ve got a large farm, you would probably want to make a transition one block at a time rather than the whole, because it would cause a cashflow problem.” This is one criticism of regenerative farming, which O’Connell concedes: on farms where fields are left empty for perhaps one year in three, the yield is lower than those farmed in more industrial ways with crops fed by synthetic fertilisers. If all food was produced in this way, critics say, people could go hungry.   Related: Hi-tech fixes aren’t the only way to save our soil | Letter   Indeed, the global risk of food shortages has once again reared its ugly head, particularly after Russia’s invasion of key agricultural producer Ukraine. The dangers of a rushed agricultural transition have been highlighted in recent months in Sri Lanka, after last year’s sudden and unexpected ban on all chemical fertilisers by the country’s president, leading to warnings from farmers of financial ruin and reliance on foreign food imports. “If you switch from one system to another suddenly, it is going to create problems,” says Jules Pretty, professor of environment and society at the University of Essex. Despite this, he is convinced that regenerative farming should be taken seriously: “Taking a mix of old principles, having a diverse and compelling system with lots of elements and modern design components to make it work.”    Regenerative farm workers at Huxhams Cross in Dartington, Devon. Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer   The fruit, vegetables, eggs and wheat grown at Huxham Cross now fill the plates of 300 families each week, and are mostly sold locally at Totnes farmers’ market. The farm is financially self-sufficient; the food production is profitable and employs six people along with three apprentices, while its finances are bolstered by a wellbeing centre, providing therapy to children, run by O’Connell’s psychologist husband. Advocates of regenerative farming believe such systems could feed the UK without problems if people were to eat a diet containing more fruit and vegetables, and less meat, especially from cows fed on grain rather than grass. The National Farmers’ Union has the ambition of reaching net zero food production by 2040, and said its members are working to do more to work the land in a climate-friendly way. As it stands, Pretty says, there are only an estimated 2,000 farmers practising the technique in the UK. Back at Huxhams Cross, O’Connell is taking stock of all they have achieved in the first five years. “We are what they call carbon negative, so we sequester five tonnes of carbon per year, over and above what we use. Our biodiversity levels have gone up, we’ve got 400% more worms, 30% more bird species.” And the word seems to be getting out: O’Connell now runs courses on regenerative farming methods and proudly tells how one local dairy farmer in his 50s has just made the switch. “A lot of it is just about having the confidence to understand how it works and to make the leap.”"
116,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/03/ukraine-peace-bogus-russian-deal-surrendering-territory-russia-terrible,2022-06-03T07:00:02Z,"Ukraine is desperate for peace, but we won’t sign up to a bogus Russian deal | Andriy Zagorodnyuk ","We Ukrainians want peace more than anyone in the world. For about 100 days, we have been fighting Russian forces on the ground, in the sky, on the sea, and in cyber and information spaces. Defence experts originally gave us little hope of success. They changed their position when we showed our ability to resist. Now we need to demonstrate the strength to hold our course and resist the temptations of a false resolution. In this existential battle for our future, ostensibly friendly or consoling pundits and politicians persistently suggest we should surrender to achieve peace more quickly. Of course, we do not want a war to take longer than necessary, but we will not get trapped into a bogus deal which will only make things worse. Among those who advised a quick fix was the former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, who suggested we should cede territory in exchange for ending the war. His intervention was appalling and, for a well-known strategic thinker, he was amazingly non-strategic. Conceding territory will not end the war. It will reinforce it. Russia has not abandoned its primary objective of getting rid of Ukraine, wiping us off the map. Any concessions would reward and legitimise its strategy. Far from stopping Russia’s pursuit of its broader military goals, it would feel emboldened.  Responding to force with territorial concessions would also have tragic global consequences. It would open the door to similar cases around the world. We do not want to live in a world where brute force decides which country we live in and which regime we belong to. We do not want to live in a world where only large countries can be truly sovereign. Receiving that suggestion from a renowned expert was very surprising. However, the idea was immediately picked up by the Russians, who cynically blamed Ukraine for a desire to continue an unnecessary war. Some media commentators also started to debate the need for a compromise to secure peace. This is manipulative and wrong. Imagine the harrowing scenario of your home being invaded by a street gang which then occupied part of your house. What peaceful compromise is possible? None. You would expect the police to deal with it. Suggesting that compromising with a criminal act leads to peace is ridiculous. It is similarly absurd in the case of the Russian invasion. Many armed conflicts do end with a compromise, but it would be illogical to assume all of them should. The only reason for this invasion was Putin’s obsession with subjugating Ukraine. What compromise is possible when your adversary’s goal is that you should not exist? The unspeakably brutal way in which Russians treat our occupied towns and villages is known throughout the world. True peace can only be secured when the invader leaves our country.  As the old saying has it, the night is darkest just before the dawn. Russia is now applying maximum available force, but the evidence of 1960s tanks being dusted off for battle, use of conscripts and the patching up of new military units without collective training demonstrate that it has exhausted its options. That is why Russia is pushing the idea of a compromise. It needs a pause to show gains to the Russian public and to give itself time to recover before moving on further with its attempt to subjugate Ukraine. Ukraine’s forces are more efficient than Russia’s. With more equipment and ammunition, pushing Russia back and out of the country is a realistic prospect. The flow of western help is only beginning and will increase. Putin’s desperate attempts to intercept the supplies from the west by bombing rail lines and fuel depots are strikingly similar to Hitler’s attempts to attack allied convoys in the Atlantic. But they are failing to affect the overall situation, and equipment is successfully getting to the frontline. US weapons from the unprecedented $40bn aid package, which we expect will include much-needed multiple rocket launch systems, will start arriving soon. The free world has decided to stop accepting Russia’s bullying behaviour, but it must be consistent in its application of that approach. For many years, western leaders tolerated Russian aggression: invading Georgia; invading Ukraine; occupying Crimea; occupying the Black Sea; carrying out targeted assassinations in the UK; carrying out cyber-attacks; allegedly meddling with elections; abusing human rights. Every time it was said: “It is Russia. It has always been like that.”   Related: Ukraine must negotiate from a position of strength. But the world’s attention is fading | Peter Pomerantsev   It is time to stop accepting such injustices. How often have people been told to tolerate something because “it has always been like this”? Racial discrimination, sexual abuse, domestic violence, corruption, social inequality and organised crime have been endemic in societies. The only time things have changed is when people have challenged the old ways and refused to accept them any more. We cannot allow past approaches to dominate the way we live now. Kissinger may have played a significant role in creating the world as it was – a less than perfect world, I must say. But no longer we will accept an unjust and unfair past defining our future.

Since Russia’s invasion, many in Europe, including Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, have spoken in favour of putting Ukraine on a speedy path to EU accession by granting it candidate status. However there are still doubts in Berlin, Paris and other capitals over whether it is possible to begin the formal process already, before a leaders’ summit later this month that is expected to decide on the issue. “It will be very hard to say no, but it will be even harder to say yes,” said one European diplomat briefed on the discussions. Ultimately, the decision is likely to come down to personal discussion between European leaders at the summit, with the positions of France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Olaf Scholz seen as crucial. Some people have floated alternatives, such as giving Ukraine a commitment to candidate status later, or admitting it to a broader and looser framework of countries without granting full membership.   Related: Will the EU start to take Ukraine’s membership seriously?   Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister with responsibility for European integration, said either of these outcomes would be extremely disappointing. “If European leaders keep going in the same way they were before 24 February, in terms of speed, ambiguity and a lack of willingness to irritate Putin, this would be a major failure of Europe as a project,” she said, in a telephone interview from Paris, which she was visiting as part of a European tour to shore up support for candidate status. “Ukraine wants a legal commitment and not a political promise,” she added, citing the 1994 Budapest memorandum – under which Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons – and the 2008 promise of future membership in Nato as pledges the west had not fulfilled, which had made Ukraine weaker politically. “There have been three wars since 2008, so we call on leaders to refrain from more political promises, and instead to start the legal decisions which would pave the way for a European track for Ukraine and ensure we are members of the European family,” she said. A month ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine should be granted candidate status “right now, in the condition of war, within the framework of a special shortened procedure for obtaining EU membership”. He was backed by von der Leyen, who in April had visited Kyiv and handed Zelenskiy a questionnaire that forms the first stage of the EU candidacy process. Von der Leyen had told the Ukrainian president: “Dear Volodymyr, my message today is clear: Ukraine belongs in the European family. We have heard your request, loud and clear. And today, we are here to give you a first, positive answer.”  Candidate status is just the first step in a long process of obtaining full membership, but even that decision is under question, with France, Germany the Netherlands and the Nordic nations among sceptics. Macron has said it could take 20 years for Ukraine to become an EU member. One argument made in conversations with Ukrainian officials is that it would be unfair on some of the western Balkan nations, who have been “in the queue” for longer, to fast-track Ukraine’s application. Others cite issues around the rule of law with Hungary and Poland. One European diplomat said: “It’s clear already that EU decision-making is not working well, and we see Hungary holding the other 26 members hostage. We need to reform our internal processes first before we start talking about other members.” Alyona Getmanchuk, the founder and director of New Europe Center, a Kyiv-based thinktank, said she had heard another reason for scepticism, particularly in Germany, on a recent visit to lobby for candidate status. “We heard informally that there is a fear of provoking Putin. We heard that especially in Germany: that by granting Ukraine candidacy, it could provoke Putin more and there would be more escalation.”  Recent polls suggest that support for EU membership among Ukrainians has soared to 91% since the start of the invasion, with a strong majority backing it even in the east and south of Ukraine, which traditionally has been more sceptical. Getmanchuk noted that for the first time, most people in European countries supported Ukrainian membership. “If this decision is not taken in June it could be more difficult to take it later, when there will be more disappointment in European societies as gas prices rise and so on,” she said."

Seven million people have fled Ukraine for other European countries since Russia invaded on 24 February, according to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR). The Home Office put the number of Ukrainians who had arrived in the UK as of 29 May at 65,700 – equivalent to about 10 refugees per 10,000 population. As of 11 May, 720,000 Ukrainian refugees had arrived in Germany, which has a population of similar size to the UK’s, working out at 87 per 10,000 population. France is the only European country with a roughly equivalent per capita figure to the UK’s, with just over 57,500 arrivals as of 25 May, or nine refugees per 10,000 population – although figures from individual prefectures indicate that 93,000 have now arrived in the country, significantly more than the most recently available official figure. Some much smaller countries by population, including Austria, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, have admitted many more refugees in both absolute and relative terms, according to their governments. Bulgaria, for example, was the initial destination for more than 290,000 people fleeing the war, equating to 423 per 10,000 population.  Interactive  The countries bordering Ukraine have, as would be expected, admitted many more still: UNHCR data shows that a combined 5 million refugees have entered Poland, Romania and Hungary. Poland has admitted the highest rate of Ukrainian refugees of any EU country, taking in 957 refugees per 10,000 population. While it is the case that many refugees move on to other countries, and some return to Ukraine – an Austrian official indicated that as many as 80% of arrivals had not stayed – the figures highlight the restrictiveness of the UK’s schemes, applicants to which are directed to wait for visas to be granted before they travel. The UK’s visa schemes have been widely criticised for the lengthy delays experienced by many applicants. Hundreds of Ukrainian families have chosen to withdraw their applications to come to the UK because of these delays, according to a recent Observer report. Refugee charities have said the sponsorship scheme, called Homes for Ukraine, could be exploited by predatory hosts, though the government insists that all hosts are subject to “security and criminal checks”. While the Guardian research only considers figures for refugees arriving in each country, the UK also fares poorly in comparison with countries that publish only the number of applications for protection or asylum. Denmark and Finland, for example, have received roughly twice as many applications as the UK visa schemes per capita.   Related: The Guardian view on Ukraine’s refugees: Britain’s grudging welcome | Editorial   The UK government’s two Ukraine visa schemes – one for Ukrainians with family in the UK, the other a sponsorship-based scheme – were launched in March. The website for the schemes shows that 144,000 applications had been received as of 30 May, and 120,000 visas issued. However, just over half that figure – 65,700 refugees – had arrived in the UK as of 29 May. A Home Office spokesperson said: “65,700 Ukrainians have now arrived safely in the UK through our two new Ukraine visa schemes and others have arrived here on other types of visas which are not shown in these figures. Together, our uncapped Ukraine family scheme and Homes for Ukraine routes are amongst the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history. 120,200 visas have now been issued, showing the work we’ve done to speed up the process is working and improving daily.” They added that European countries may record refugee arrivals differently and that the figures were therefore difficult to compare directly.  The extent to which Ukrainians have been uprooted by the conflict is catastrophic: the 6.8 million people who have fled the country, combined with the 8 million people displaced internally, constitutes more than a third – 36% – of Ukraine’s total population prior to the Russian invasion. The Guardian figures represent the numbers of Ukrainian refugees arriving in the country or, where these were unavailable, the numbers who have registered as refugees or are otherwise recognised by the government as being in the country. It excludes countries that have only published figures for the number of applications by Ukrainian refugees for protection or asylum – as is the case for Denmark and Finland – and Spain, for which the only published figures date from April.

The last day of an era in Europe. On the evening of 23 February, the world braced. Over Ukraine’s border, thousands of Russian troops had received their orders. A president in Kyiv and another in Moscow prepared the most significant addresses of their lives. In western capitals, officials worked to ward off what now seemed inevitable: the end of three decades of peace between Europe’s major powers.    Volodymyr Ksienich: ‘Nobody really believed it would happen.’ Photograph: Handout   And the end of an idea. That trade and prosperity could dissolve old European rivalries. That access to iPhones, Instagram and Ikea furniture could cool the chauvinist impulses that had fuelled centuries of bloody history. In spite of unusually specific warnings from the US government of an imminent invasion, and the buildup of forces in Russia and Belarus, Ukrainians were not panicking. There were no queues at the western borders. The cafes and bars of Kyiv had been packed the previous Saturday evening. People continued making plans for holidays, dates, and swimming lessons for their children. Volodymyr Ksienich, 22, a student organiser, spent the night with friends. They talked about the war, of course. “Nobody really believed it would happen,” he says. Many analysts concurred. The Russian forces massing on the border were too few to occupy the country, they argued. State media had done little to prepare the Russian public for war. An invasion would trigger economic penalties so ruinous to the Russian economy that no leader would dare risk it. All of this was true, and they were wrong. * * * Day 1: Thursday 24 February Russian invasion begins    Firefighters at work in the eastern Ukraine town of Chuhuiv after Russian bombing on the first day of the invasion. Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images   The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, goes on TV in the early hours of Thursday with dire news. Dressed in a suit, his face still boyish and uncreased, Zelenskiy informs the country that after weeks of brinkmanship, Vladimir Putin has authorised military action against Ukraine. All of Europe is on the edge of a war that could “burn everything”, he says. At 5.30am, Russian state media begins broadcasting a presidential address. Incensed by what he characterises as the creation of an “anti-Russia” on his borders, Putin announces a “special military operation” aimed at the “demilitarisation and denazification” of Ukraine. As he is speaking and in the hours after, explosions are reported in Kyiv, Kramatorsk, Kharkiv, Odesa, Mariupol and other cities.    Volodymyr Zelenskiy holds a briefing on 24 February. The Ukrainian president warned that the war could ‘burn everything’. Photograph: Ukraine Presidency/AFP/Getty Images   Ksienich is woken sharply by his father. “Did you hear that?” he asks him. “I think it’s bombs exploding. I think Russia’s started the war.” The family gather their belongings and head to his grandparent’s country home on Kyiv’s outskirts. It is on the drive, when Ksienich stops to refuel his car, that he feels himself cross a dividing line between life before the war and after. “I got out of my car and I heard bursts a couple of hundred metres from me,” he says. It is all still novel: the noise, the shaking ground, the impulse to flee and seek cover. He will grow weary of these sensations in the weeks to come, but the memory of this moment will still pierce through. “It was the first explosion I can remember.” Over the course of a chaotic day, Russian troops and military vehicles are reported to have come within 18 miles of the capital; to have swept through Chornobyl and taken workers there hostage; to have pushed into eastern towns such as Sumy; and to have rained missiles on port cities across the Black Sea. Russian hit squads are searching for the Ukrainian president and gunfire is heard near the presidential compound. There is a feeling of doom in Kyiv and around the world. By sunset, Ksienich’s family have gathered at the country house. Tomorrow they will need to decide whether to stay or go west. But first, they must survive the night. “We had a long discussion before going to bed, me and my relatives,” he recalls. “The Russian army could be trying to invade the place where we were staying. So we decided that some of us will sleep, some of us will not.” Ksienich is part of the shift that sleeps first. He has a fitful spell in bed, ruminating. “You understand that something terrible is happening in your country,” he says. After four hours, he gets up and takes his place on guard duty. * * * Day 2: Friday 25 February ‘The president is here’    Volodymyr Zelenskiy resurfaces alongside senior officials in a Facebook video shot on the streets of Kyiv. Photograph: Volodymyr Zelenskiy/Facebook/AFP/Getty Images   Kyiv is being attacked from three directions. Blasts are being reported across the city. Gun battles are raging in its northern suburbs as Russian forces close in. Ukraine’s defence ministry urges those who have not fled to make molotov cocktails and prepare to use them. Mario Draghi, the Italian prime minister, tells parliament that Zelenskiy has missed a scheduled call that morning, pausing as his voice falters. The chamber fills the silence with spontaneous applause. Europe is uniting in revulsion and solidarity, imposing new sanctions, debating whether to excise Moscow from the Swift payments system. Russia is expelled from the Eurovision song contest. A few dozen miles from the city, Ksienich and his family decide to stay. “We decided we needed to try to protect ourselves, then to protect our family, then to protect the whole country, if it’s possible,” he says. The family get to work building makeshift barricades around their neighbourhood to slow oncoming tanks or armoured vehicles. They make contact with other men in the area and form a local defence unit. Ksienich is handed a Kalashnikov rifle several decades older than he is. Forty-eight hours ago he was a data analyst, but now he is learning to fight like an insurgent. “They told us what to do when a column is right near you,” he says. “What to do when you see a tank.” In the few quiet moments, he feels a moral vertigo. “You need to switch from a life where you are trying to solve all your conflicts verbally, by talking … But now you have ammo and a gun.” That night, during a pause in the shelling, the Ukrainian president resurfaces. He posts a 32-second video, shot on the streets of Kyiv himself. “Good evening, everyone,” he says, dressed in fatigues and surrounded by four other officials. He cycles the camera to each face – “The leader of the party is here. The head of the presidential administration is here” – and finally settles on his own. “The president is here.” * * * Day 3: Saturday 26 February Tens of thousands of Ukrainians rush to enlist    Ukrainians enlist in the territorial defence forces in Kyiv. Photograph: Mikhail Palinchak/EPA   Kyrylo Demchenko, a history student from Dnipro, joins the rush of young men signing contracts to enlist in the Ukrainian army. He is immediately handed a gun and sent to a highway at the edge of the capital. Hours after he arrives, Demchenko, 20, and his unit spot Russian soldiers and open fire. He survives, but has little memory of the exchange, only fleeting images. “It is so terrible, so cruel,” he says. “I remember the music of the war – the bomb attacks, the shooting of the guns. I remember the tracer bullets, lighting up when they fly. I remember the anti-aircraft missiles. I remember short, separate details. “It’s like a terrible story from a previous life.” * * * Day 4: Sunday 27 February West unites in response to invasion    A pro-Ukraine demonstration in Trafalgar Square, London, on 27 February. Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images   It is 3am, in a forest on the outskirts of Kyiv. Ksienich and a small unit of volunteers sit in silence, waiting for the telltale crack of a tree branch under a boot, or the rumble of a helicopter. Russian battalions are 5 or 6 kilometres away, he says, but the mood on the ground is buoyant. “The first day many people were depressed, we didn’t know how our army would do,” he says. “After two or three days we have understood our army is very well prepared … We are planning to get rid of all the Russian occupants and get back Crimea and the occupied territories.” Roads to the west of the country are choked with traffic and more than 300,000 Ukrainians have already fled the country. They are virtually all women and children; martial law has been instituted and men between 18 and 60 are banned from leaving. Across the country, families, friends and lovers are being divided, some for ever.    The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, receives a standing ovation after a speech to the Bundestag in which he announced a €100bn boost to the armed forces. Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/Getty Images   Old maxims of European security are crumbling every hour. Germany is sending anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles to Ukraine, breaking a postwar taboo against exporting arms to conflict zones. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz announces the creation of a €100bn (£85bn) fund to boost the country’s armed forces. He calls it “Germany’s historical responsibility” to ensure that Putin “does not turn the clocks back”. Four days in, Ukraine appears to have absorbed the initial Russian blow. Zelenskiy is still alive and in control of the government. Russian forces are uncoordinated, unable to take control of the airspace and running out of fuel and food. Hostomel airport, outside Kyiv, is the site of fierce fighting, preventing Russia from using it as a bridgehead into the capital. In Bucha, a commuter town near Kyiv, an invading Russian column is devastated by Ukrainian artillery and retreats. But the soldiers return after a few hours, occupy local homes and dig in. Putin’s plan appears not to have account for a decisive factor: that Ukrainian society would resist. That young, untrained people like Ksienich would take up guns, spend nights in a forest and risk death to defend their homes. * * * Day 9: Friday 4 March Combat reaches Europe’s largest nuclear plant    The IAEA director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, speaks in Vienna about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which was hit by Russian shells and caught fire. Photograph: Lisa Leutner/AP   Fighting in Ukraine’s east has reached the town of Zaporizhzhia, home to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. To the horror of world leaders and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a building inside the facility is hit by Russian shells and is set ablaze. Miraculously, the damage does not extend to the reactors, avoiding a catastrophic nuclear release, though exchanges of gunfire and artillery around the site continue. “This is unprecedented,” says the IAEA’s director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi. “Completely uncharted waters.” The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, tells the security council the world has “narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe”. In Mariupol, another disaster is taking shape. Hundreds of civilians have already died in shelling since the beginning of the war. The city is surrounded and its mayor, Vadym Boichenko, announces remaining residents no longer have heat, running water or electricity. * * * Day 15: Thursday 10 March UK sanctions Abramovich, signalling end of ‘Londongrad’ era    The media gather outside Stamford Bridge, west London, on 10 March after the UK imposed sanctions on Chelsea FC’s owner, Roman Abramovich. Photograph: Neil Hall/EPA   Roman Abramovich, one of the world’s richest men, whose ownership of Chelsea football club has revolutionised the English Premier League, has his assets frozen and is banned from travelling to Britain. The sanctions against the oligarch – whose ties to Putin have been the subject of warnings for years – signal what campaigners hope is the end of London’s three-decade embrace of dirty Russian money. The number of Ukrainians who have fled their country passes 2 million, in the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war. * * * Day 17: Saturday 12 March Kyiv braces for invasion    Ukrainian soldiers on guard in Irpin, just outside Kyiv, as the capital braced for invasion on 12 March. Photograph: Sergei Supinsky/AFP/Getty Images   Russia’s attempt to push its forces towards Kyiv has hit a snag. Ukrainian forces have blown up bridges and flooded plains, forcing the bulk of columns on to a few narrow roads. The result has been a predictable traffic jam. But after a few days, forces appear to be regrouping for an assault on the capital. Kyiv is awash with anti-tank weapons, barricades and armed men. Ksienich has survived, and is stunned at the transformation of his home city, preparing for a battle “that could be compared to the battle for Kyiv in the second world war”. Ukraine is receiving equipment donated from around the world, including sniper scopes manufactured by the glass and crystals firm Swarovski. “It costs thousands of dollars,” he marvels. In a city bracing for war, there are still open cafes, barbers and other pockets of normal life. “It is even possible to eat yoghurt or ice-cream somewhere in the city,” Ksienich says. Moscow is making faster progress in Ukraine’s south. The strategic port of Kherson has become the first major city to fall to Russia. About 2,000 people are estimated to have attended a protest in the city against the occupation. Russian troops fire warning shots to disperse them, “but people are not afraid”, two anonymous diarists write. “But among the crowd, men in dark clothes are wandering, with hoods, hiding their faces, recording.” * * * Day 24: Saturday 19 March Mariupol theatre refuge struck by Russian missile    A satellite image of the bombed Mariupol theatre, where at least 600 civilians are estimated to have been killed by Russian bombs while they were sheltering there. Photograph: Maxar Technologies/Reuters   Russia says it is “tightening the noose” in Mariupol. After relentless shelling that has destroyed more than 80% of residential buildings in the city, according to an estimate by its mayor, Russian forces have reached the centre and fighting has broken out around the Azovstal steelworks, a labyrinthine, Stalin-era facility that stretches for 10 sq km (4 sq miles), where hundreds of civilians are taking shelter. A few days earlier, Russia bombed a theatre where an estimated 1,300 civilians were taking shelter. The Russian word “ДЕТИ” – “children” – had been marked out in large letters outside the building, in a fruitless appeal to the humanity of the attackers. An Associated Press investigation later estimates that at least 600 people were killed in the strike. * * * Day 26: Monday 21 March Russian campaign in chaos as global food prices soar    A Ukrainian soldier in the ruined Retroville shopping centre in Kyiv after a Russian attack on the north-west of the capital on 21 March. Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images   Just after midnight a Russian tabloid, Komsomolskaya Pravda, publishes a report claiming 9,861 Russian troops have been killed so far and 16,153 have been wounded. The breathtaking three-week toll is approaching the number of Russian servicemen killed in Afghanistan during the Soviet Union’s decade-long failed occupation. By the end of the day, the figures have been removed from the story (the newspaper claims it was hacked) but its scale echoes what observers are seeing on the ground. The Russian campaign is indecisive, bogged down and pursuing too many targets at once. There is “no real centre of gravity, five to six different axes of advance”, says Michael Kofman, a specialist in the Russian armed forces. “The military is trying to stretch itself thin, they’re stuck in urban fighting around Kyiv in the north, they can’t make much press in the east around Kharkiv or Sumy.” Even in the south, where Russia’s forces are most numerous and making the most progress, they are trying to advance in two opposite directions, towards Mariupol in the east and west towards Odesa. “Which makes no sense whatsoever,” Kofman says. “None.”    A baker in the city of Arish, Egypt.

Egypt, which imports 80% of its grain from Russia and Ukraine, fixes the cost of bread in response to a surge in prices. The soaring cost of fuel compounds a severe currency crisis in Sri Lanka. The price of cooking oils, cereals and meats are on their way to the highest levels recorded by the United Nations since it started tracking in 1990. * * * Day 36: Thursday 31 March Russia announces ‘radical reduction’ in military activity    A Ukrainian serviceman helps a child from a displaced family to cross a river on the outskirts of Kyiv. Photograph: Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images   Kyiv is quieter than it has been in weeks. “We don’t hear anything about [Russia] trying to capture the city any more,” Ksienich says. Days before, Russian negotiators at peace talks in Turkey made the surprise announcement that their forces would “radically reduce military activity” around Kyiv and another embattled city, Cherniyiv. The Ukrainian government is sceptical, but shelling in the capital has eased over the past week. Streets are busier and shops are reopening. “There are huge sales on everything because businesses aren’t sure if [their stock] in warehouses will be safe, because Russia is bombing warehouses full of food, clothes, oil,” Ksienich says. There is a feeling of relief in the city but also a building sense of dread at the rumours starting to emerge as Russian forces pull back. “Some friends of mine [are] in Irpin, a city near Kyiv that was captured,” Ksienich says. “Our army is there and many civilians tell scary things about how the Russians behaved there … They were just shooting civilians, driving tanks over them.” * * * Day 38: Saturday 2 April War crimes discovered in Bucha and recently liberated towns    Bodies on a street in Bucha, north-west of Kyiv, one of several places where war crimes were discovered after Russian forces withdrew. Photograph: Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images   At 2.33pm London time, an alert is posted on the wire of the news service Agence France-Presse. It reads: “At least 20 bodies seen in one street in town near Kyiv.” It is accompanied by photographs and video footage documenting the streets of Bucha, a satellite city on the outskirts of the capital. They are scenes from hell: crushed neighbourhoods, bound corpses strewn in the roads and bodies hastily buried in the front yards of their homes. In a cellar, authorities find the body of a woman dressed in a fur coat and nothing else, and torn condom wrappers on the floor above. The discoveries immediately draw comparisons to the killings at Srebrenica or the My Lai massacre. “What Putin has done in Ukraine doesn’t look far short of genocide to me,” says the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson. Over the coming days, journalists reach further-flung villages and find similar horrors. In Trostianets, near the Russian border, there is evidence of summary executions and torture. In the village of Staryi Bykiv, 50 miles east of Kyiv, Russian soldiers killed at least nine civilians. From homes in Novyi Bykiv, a settlement just across a river, they looted items including jewellery, a scooter, computers and from one house, a novelty cushion, in an orgy of looting so widespread across areas occupied by the Russians that it appears to be a systematic part of military culture.    Vokzalna, Bucha, Ukraine. Photograph: Daniel Boffey/The Guardian   Obscured by the grisly discoveries is a significant deadline: Friday was the end of the one-year term of tens of thousand of Russian conscripts, who are permitted to leave the army, despite rumours the Kremlin might seek ways to keep them in its ranks and bolster the invasion force. It sets the future shape of the war: Russia will not have the numbers to encircle and cut off Ukrainian troops in Donbas. Any future Russian gains in the east will come through grinding attrition. “They will have to fight for every square inch of territory,” Kofman says. * * * Day 43: Wednesday 7 April Rouble surges back to pre-invasion levels    An aerial view shows body bags in a trench (C, down) of a mass grave in the garden surrounding the St Andrew church in Bucha, on 7 April. Photograph: Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images   Russia’s currency, the rouble, hits 80 to the dollar, roughly its rate before it invaded Ukraine, an astounding rebound from the records lows of the early weeks of the war. The rouble’s resilience, despite suffocating sanctions and an exodus of foreign businesses, is based on short-term financial engineering, a surge in oil and gas prices caused by the invasion – and Europe’s inability to quickly find alternative supplies.

Photograph: Camille Bas-Wohlert/AFP/Getty Images   Germany, whose economic model is built in part on cheap Russian gas, is weathering diplomatic pressure to impose an outright ban on imports, calls that have grown more urgent since the discovery of war crimes in Bucha and elsewhere. Germans are being urged to do their part by turning down thermostats and driving less, but business leaders such as Martin Brudermüller, the chief executive of BASF, one of Germany’s biggest chemical companies, is warning against drastic cuts. “Do we want to destroy the entire economy with our eyes open?” he asks. * * * Day 54: Monday 18 April Russia launches eastern offensive    A frame grab from an undated handout drone video first published by DPR militia commander Alexander Khodakovsky and made available by the Mariupol city council shows smoke rising from the Azovstal steel plant during airstrikes in Mariupol, eastern Ukraine. Photograph: Mariupol City Council Handout/EPA   As Zelenskiy warns that Russia has commenced its campaign to seize all of the eastern Donbas region, at Mariupol’s sprawling Azovstal plant the few thousand remaining defenders and civilians – running out of food, water and medicine – are given a midday deadline to surrender. Those who do are “guaranteed to keep their lives”, the Russians say. They reject it. Kyiv has surprised the world and repelled the invaders, but success is bittersweet. So many have been killed or are still fighting, Ksienich says, while people in the capital begin to resume normal lives. “You see a guy in a military uniform with a gun, who is ready to defend our country. And then you see a guy coming from a bar who’s drunk … People are relaxing but I don’t think it’s right.” Early in the war, he felt confident Ukraine would expel Russian forces from Kyiv, Crimea and Donbas. Now he is more circumspect. “I hope we at least get our borders before the invasion started,” he says. * * * Day 61: Monday 25 April US appears to widen war aims    Russian military vehicles move on a highway in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces near Mariupol, 18 April.

He recites the administration’s standard line about helping Ukraine to defend its sovereignty. But this time, he adds something new and further-reaching. “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin says. “It has already lost a lot of military capability. And a lot of its troops, quite frankly. And we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability.” * * * Day 77: Wednesday 11 May Puppet rulers of Kherson float annexation    A protest in Kherson, Ukraine, against the Russian invasion.

Across the occupied region, Russia has reportedly disappeared mayors, journalists and artists as it seeks to tighten its grip. In some areas it will soon introduce the rouble as an official currency and offer fast-tracked Russian passports to residents. * * * Day 83: Tuesday 17 May Mariupol falls as Sweden and Finland apply to join Nato    Russian military vehicles escorting buses carrying Ukrainian troops after the fall of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol on 17 May.

Hours after Ukraine’s military command announces it is no longer defending the Azovstal plant, and the remaining fighters are bussed towards an uncertain future in Russia, the prime ministers of Sweden and Finland confirm they will jointly submit applications to become members of the group. If they succeed, the length of Nato’s border with Russia will double overnight.    Ukrainian troops being evacuated from the Azovstal plant. They were facing an uncertain future in Russia.

Photograph: Senate Television/AP   The US and its Nato allies have walked a careful line so far, seeking to funnel weapons and aid to Ukraine without provoking Russia into widening the war beyond its borders. In recent weeks, sensing an opportunity to trap Russia in a quagmire, western powers are pushing that line further. The Biden administration passes a massive $40bn (£32bn) package of military and economic aid for Ukraine, and is shipping out long-range howitzers, armoured vehicles and kamikaze drones, a step up from the anti-tank missiles and small arms it sent earlier. It is now trumpeting its role training Ukrainian soldiers in how to use these weapons systems – and in providing intelligence that has helped killed a dozen Russian generals. With fighting now largely confined to the east, more than 1 million Ukrainian refugees have returned home, the government says. More than 5 million remain abroad in the largest displacement crisis of the 21st century. * * * Day 97: Tuesday 31 May Russia gaining ground in eastern war of attrition    A police officer checking a school as residents were evacuated from Marinka in the Donetsk region on 31 May. Photograph: Reuters   Russia is learning the lessons of its disastrous invasion. It has broken into Sievierodonetsk, the last major population centre in Luhansk province outside its control, by concentrating forces that earlier in the war it had spread thinly. Elsewhere in the east and south, it is digging in, fortifying its positions. The heavy fighting in the eastern regions, where Russia can more easily supply its troops, is taking a heavy toll on Ukraine’s defenders. Zelenskiy says 50 to 100 soldiers could be dying each day, in a rare estimate of combat casualties. Whatever triumphalism existed after Russia retreated from around Kyiv has evaporated. The country’s ports are being strangled by a blockade. Cities such as Kharkiv are still within reach of Russian artillery. Territory is expected to change hands back and forth over the next months as both militaries near exhaustion, pause to resupply and launch counter-offensives. It spells a war with no end in sight. Ksienich spends his days ferrying tools and summer clothes to friends fighting in the east. In the spare hours, he works his old job in Warsaw remotely. He makes his life in a void between war and peace. Even if the fighting ends soon, it will have changed his trajectory. He has given up his job overseas, and plans to do a degree in business. “I’m enrolling in how to run government and politics,” he says. “I want to come back to Ukraine [and] help my country.” Day 100: Friday 3 June Invasion midwifes a new nation Demchenko, the young historian, has become the sergeant of a logistics unit stationed near Kharkiv. He and his men sleep in muddy trenches and, when they are lucky, on the floor of farmhouses. He shrugs off the danger and discomfort. “When the missile or bullet is near to you, or a Russian artillery shot lands near to you, you understand your situation right now is not as good as it can be. I’m not with a glass of juice near the sea or in my favourite Carpathian mountains.” These difficult days are charged with a potent force, he says, a forging process he had only studied before in books. “Our company was [merged] with people from different socio-economic groups, from different cities, and all of them are very different. They have different educations, different professions, and right now we are together. “It’s amazing to see how different people make this new social construction, how they discuss each other, how they are thinking about their future together … This is like the birth of a new nation.” One hundred days since the invasion, Putin’s army has lost some battles and won others. But the Russian president’s rash invasion has become a strategic catastrophe. Ukraine is embattled but united. It has become the very “anti-Russia” the war was supposed to extinguish.  Interactive "

Flanked by some of his closest allies, including Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, and presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, Zelenskiy said: “The leaders of parliamentary factions are here. The president’s chief of staff is here. Prime minister of Ukraine Shmyhal is here. Podolyak is here. The president is here. The armed forces of Ukraine are here. Most importantly, our people, the people of our country, are here. We have been defending Ukraine for 100 days. Victory shall be ours.”   Russian forces currently occupy about 20% of Ukraine’s territory, Zelenskiy said yesterday in a video address to the Luxembourg parliament. The frontlines of battle stretch across more than 1,000km (620 miles), the Ukrainian president said, adding that 100 Ukrainians were dying daily in eastern Ukraine, and another 450-500 people were wounded.   Ukraine has had “some success” in the battles in Sievierodonetsk but it is too early to tell, according to Zelenskiy. “The situation there is the hardest now, just as in the cities and communities nearby – Lysychansk, Bakhmut and others. Many cities are facing a powerful Russian attack,” he said in his latest national address.   About 60% of the infrastructure and residential buildings in Lysychansk, one of only two cities in the east still under at least partial Ukrainian control, have been destroyed from attacks, according to a local official. Oleksandr Zaika, head of the Lysychansk City military-civil administration, said 20,000 people were left in the city, down from a pre-war population of 97,000.   The scale of destruction in Ukraine “defies comprehension”, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement to mark the 100th day of the conflict. Thousands of people “are living with the anguish of not knowing what happened to their loved ones”, ICRC’s director general, Robert Mardini, said.   About 800 people, including children, are hiding underneath the Azot chemical factory in Sievierodonetsk, according to Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region. The UK’s ministry of defence said Russia had taken control of most of Sieverodonetsk, a key eastern Ukrainian city that has come under intense Russian shelling.   Russia is now achieving tactical success in Donbas and controls more than 90% of Luhansk, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence report released early this morning.   Civilians are being urged to flee the eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk as Russia bombing intensifies. With no water or electricity, 100 people heeded the mayor’s call on Thursday to evacuate.   Ukrainian presidential adviser Podolyak has said Ukraine does not intend to use US-supplied weapons to attack Russian territory, and said it is disinformation from Russia to suggest they would. He said “Our partners know where their weapons are used.”   Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov has said he believed the Kremlin was trying to move the war into a “protracted phase” by building layered defences in occupied regions in the south of the country, primarily in Kherson.   Pro-Russian officials in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine said a decree had been issued to “nationalise” state assets in the south-eastern region. The deputy head of the Moscow-imposed administration, Andrei Trofimov, said the nationalisation would affect land, natural resources, and facilities in strategic sectors of the economy, as well as property owned by Ukraine as of 24 February.   Ukraine’s parliamentary speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk has pleaded with Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz during a visit to Berlin to supply Kyiv with state-of-the-art weapons systems to help it resist Russia’s advance in the east of the country.   Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, has said the EU stands with Ukraine as she marked 100 days since Russia’s latest invasion of the country. She said she would discuss “the EU’s current & future support to the country” with French president Emmanuel Macron later today.   Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko said in an interview with a local newspaper that his country was ready to discuss possible transit of Ukraine’s grain via Belarus.   Interactive   Kyiv’s ambassador to Ankara has said Turkey is among the countries that is buying grain that Russia stole from Ukraine.   Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance was in touch with Turkey to find a “united way” forward to address Ankara’s concerns over Sweden and Finland’s bid to join. Stoltenberg’s latest remarks come after he told reporters yesterday that he would convene senior officials from Finland, Sweden and Turkey in Brussels in the coming days to discuss the issue.   Ukraine has granted citizenship to prominent Russian journalist Alexander Nevzorov, who fled Russia in March with his wife after denouncing the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has been seeking the arrest of Nevzorov, accusing him of spreading false information on his YouTube channel, which has over 1.8 million subscribers, after he reported Russian forces had deliberately shelled a maternity hospital in the city of Mariupol. Russia has denied the bombing, accusing Ukraine of a “staged provocation”.   Russia’s foreign ministry has said it was summoning the heads of US media outlets in Moscow to a meeting next Monday to notify them of measures in response to US restrictions against Russian media.   The UK has taken in fewer Ukrainian refugees per capita than all but one of 28 European countries, a Guardian analysis of official figures from across the continent has found. Seven million people have fled Ukraine for other European countries since Russia invaded on 24 February, according to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR).   Ukraine more than doubled interest rates to 25% on Thursday in a move to try to stem double-digit inflation and protect its currency, which has collapsed since Russia’s invasion. In the first interest rates intervention since president Vladimir Putin’s troops attacked on 24 February, the Ukrainian central bank’s governor, Kyrylo Shevchenko, increased the benchmark interest rate from 10% to 25%.   The White House announced a fresh round of sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, targeting Russian government officials and elites as well as several yachts linked to Putin. The sanctions were announced as Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he was “grateful” to the US and its secretary of state, Antony Blinken, for a new $700m weapons package for Ukraine.   EU ambassadors dropped the leader of Russia’s Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill, from a proposed blacklist, according to diplomats. The removal of Patriarch Kirill from the list of sanctioned individuals allows the EU to agree on a new round of sanctions after opposition from Hungary.   Russia has accused the son of a Conservative MP of involvement in the killing of a Chechen brigade commander in Ukraine. Russia’s national guard said one of its commanders, the Chechen fighter Adam Bisultanov, was killed on 26 May in a clash with a “group of mercenaries from the UK and the USA” that included the “son of a British parliamentarian”, Ben Grant.   UN aid chief Martin Griffiths is in Moscow on Friday to discuss clearing the way for exports of grain and other food from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. Since the invasion, Ukrainian grain shipments from its Black Sea ports have stalled and more than 20m tonnes of grain are stuck in silos, while Moscow says the chilling effect of western sanctions imposed on Russia has hurt its fertiliser and grain exports.   Ten Russian servicemen who looted the property of Bucha residents have been identified and reported on suspicion of violating the laws and customs of war. “Pre-trial investigation in criminal proceedings is carried out by investigators of … the national police of Ukraine,” Ukraine’s prosecutor general said in a statement on Thursday.

Speaking to an audience at the Hay festival, Clinton said her assertion that Russians “deserve to have their voices heard and votes counted” and “an election that meets international standards” prompted protests by tens of thousands of Russians, which Putin then blamed her for. The former Democratic party presidential hopeful, who lost out to Donald Trump in 2016, said: “Putin does not like critics, especially women critics. Putin then became very adversarial toward me with few exceptions. As we know, despite efforts to say to the contrary, he worked very hard to get Trump elected through all kinds of means.”Clinton said she had witnessed “his almost messianic belief in himself and what he was destined to be” as well of his “goal of restoring imperial Russia” while working with him. This had prompted her to write memos warning he would become a “threat to Europe and the rest of the world”, although she had hoped that friendly relations with the US would make him “shelve his aggressive ambitions and look to be more cooperative”. She said: “When he invaded Ukraine I was sadly not surprised. I was very pleasantly surprised at how effective the government of [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy and Ukraine defended themselves.”She also considered it positive that Nato had come together to supply Ukrainians with weaponry, which confirmed for her “a need to keep the institutions we have and try to make them more effective for the future”. She noted that had Trump been returned to power in 2020, he would probably have pulled the US out of Nato. Clinton called for the creation of a tribunal similar to those held after the Balkan wars and Rwandan genocide to hold individual Russians accountable for their war crimes, though she acknowledged that it was “always difficult to go after a head of state” unless they were deposed. Her interviewer, Helena Kennedy, who is among a group of human rights lawyers working to find ways to make Russia accountable for crimes committed in Ukraine, asked whether such a tribunal could open the UK and US to scrutiny of their actions in the Iraq war.Clinton said: “[It] could, but I think it’s less likely than people imagine.”"

In a statement, the treasury department said that it was sanctioning Monaco-based Imperial Yachts and its owner, Moscow-born Evgeniy Kochman. According to the department, Kochman’s company “provides yacht-related services to Russia’s elites, including those in President Putin’s inner circle”. It identified four yachts “favoured by Putin” that the Russian leader has “taken numerous trips on” as recently as last year: the Nega, the Graceful, the Olympia and the Shellest. According to the department, Putin used the Nega for travel in Russia’s north, and the Shellest to visit his “infamous Black Sea Palace”, a £1bn seaside mansion that Putin has denied owning. The BBC Russian service earlier reported that the Graceful abruptly left the German port in Hamburg where it was docked for maintenance two weeks before the invasion of Ukraine, prompting speculation that it was trying to avoid sanctions as it arrived in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Notably, the treasury department did not name the 459-foot Scheherazade, an Imperial Yachts-linked ship that was seized last month by Italy for its ties to Putin.   Related: ‘Mysterious’: the $700m superyacht in Italy some say belongs to Putin   The White House said in a statement that the latest sanctions were designed “to crack down on evasion and tighten our sanctions to enhance enforcement and increase pressure on Putin and his enablers”. “Russia’s elites, up to and including President Putin, rely on complex support networks to hide, move and maintain their wealth and luxury assets,” said Brian Nelson, the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the treasury department. “We will continue to enforce our sanctions and expose the corrupt systems by which President Putin and his elites enrich themselves.” The department also announced sanctions against the cellist Sergei Roldugin, a longtime friend of Putin who is believed to be the godfather of the Russian leader’s first child. Roldugin, already sanctioned by the EU, was named in the 2016 Panama Papers leaks as a behind-the-scenes player in a clandestine network operated by Putin associates that has shuffled hundreds of millions through banks and offshore companies. Putin at the time defended Roldugin, denying there was anything corrupt about his friend’s involvement in offshore companies. The state department also imposed sanctions on Maria Zakharova, the spokesperson for the Russian minister of foreign affairs and one of the country’s most vocal supporters of the war in Ukraine, and Alexei Mordashov, a Russian steel magnate."

In the first interest rates intervention since Vladimir Putin’s troops attacked on 24 February, the Ukrainian central bank’s governor, Kyrylo Shevchenko, increased the benchmark interest rate from 10% to 25%. It takes borrowing costs to their highest level since September 2015 – when Ukraine’s economy was reeling from Russia’s annexation of Crimea – and the highest in Europe. The Russian invasion has devastated Ukraine’s economy, which the World Bank has forecast could shrink by at least a third this year. The war has forced businesses to close, destroyed infrastructure, blocked shipping routes and reduced whole towns to rubble. Shevchenko called for talks with the International Monetary Fund on a new aid programme. The increase was criticised by an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, who said the rate was too high and dangerous to the economy during wartime. It was not clear whether he was speaking in a personal capacity.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  The National Bank of Ukraine had frozen its main rate 10% at the start of the invasion, but last week signalled it could resume regular monetary policy reviews as business activity partially recovered in safer parts of the country. It is betting that a sharp rate rise will also nudge the government to lift the yield on domestic bonds, making assets held in its currency, the hryvnia, more attractive and preventing household incomes and savings from being eroded by inflation. Inflation was already in double digits before the conflict began and climbed further to about 17% in May from 16.4% in April, according to central bank estimates. It said inflation could double in 2022 from 10% in 2021, pushed up by rising global prices and the damage of the war on domestic production and supply chains. The number of small businesses that had suspended operations in April fell to 26% from 73% in March, according to a survey by the European Business Association, the union of businesses operating in Ukraine."

Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said on Thursday that bitter street fighting continued in the city, where Ukrainian forces have pledged to fight “to the end”.
As Russia’s war on Ukraine neared its 100th day, he said 800 people were hiding in Soviet-era bomb shelters beneath the Azot factory. “There are locals there, who were asked to leave the city but refused,” he said. “Also children, though not many.”
The British defence ministry said that while the main road into Sievierodonetsk remained under Ukrainian control, Russia had taken most of the city and “continues to make steady local gains, enabled by a heavy concentration of artillery”.
Ukraine’s armed forces general staff said the invading forces were “conducting assault operations inside Sievierodonetsk” and also attacking other parts in the east and north-east of the city. At least four civilians had been killed and 10 wounded there, officials said.
Capturing Sievierodonetsk would give the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, control of all of Luhansk – the region that, with Donetsk, makes up Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland – consolidating a shift in battlefield momentum after his forces were pushed back from the capital, Kyiv, and northern Ukraine.







Russian forces now occupy about 20% of Ukrainian territory, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said, with the frontlines stretching across more than 620 miles (1,000km). More than 12 million Ukrainians had been displaced and more than 5 million had left the country, Zelenskiy told Luxembourg’s parliament.
“We have to defend ourselves against almost the entire Russian army. All combat-ready Russian military formations are involved in this aggression,” Zelenskiy said, adding that 100 Ukrainians were dying every day in eastern Ukraine and another 450-500 were being wounded.
The president said that in 2014 Kremlin-backed separatists and the Russian military controlled Ukrainian territory roughly equivalent in size to the Netherlands. That area had more than trebled to about 125,000 sq km, and nearly twice as much again had been “polluted” with mines and unexploded ordnance.
The fall of Sievierodonetsk would facilitate Putin’s drive into nearby Donetsk. The regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Thursday that Russian forces were trying to push south through Lyman and Izyum towards the key cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.
As the ground war raged on, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, thanked the US for a new $700m (£566m) weapons package it announced on Wednesday, including high mobility artillery rocket systems that can hit targets up to 50 miles away.
“Advanced American systems will help our brave armed forces to defend Ukrainian land from Russian invaders,” Kuleba tweeted. His Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, accused the US of “pouring fuel on the fire”, but the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Ukraine had promised not to use the systems to hit targets inside Russia.

Britain also said it would send sophisticated medium-range rocket systems to Ukraine in a move “closely coordinated” with the US. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said the UK would send an unspecified number of M270 launchers – similar to the US Himars” systems – and that Ukrainian troops would be trained in the UK to use them.
The Swedish government announced on Thursday it would provide Ukraine with more economic aid and military equipment, including anti-ship missiles, rifles and anti-tank weapons, saying it “sees a continuing need” to support Ukraine. Germany said on Wednesday it would supply anti-aircraft missiles and radar systems.
Moscow again denounced the large-scale provision of western arms to Ukraine. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the “pumping” of weapons “will bring more suffering to Ukraine, which is merely a tool in the hands of those countries that supply it with weapons”.
Peskov threatened “absolutely undesirable and rather unpleasant scenarios” if Ukrainian forces “hypothetically try to use these weapons against targets on our territory”, saying such a decision would “significantly change the situation in an unfavourable direction”.
On the diplomatic front, the US president, Joe Biden, was due to meet the Nato secretary general in Washington. Jens Stoltenberg said he would also convene a meeting soon with Swedish, Finnish and Turkish officials to discuss Turkey’s continued opposition to Sweden and Finland joining the US-led defence alliance.
The Danish foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, said on Thursday he expected Denmark to join the EU’s common defence policy on 1 July after a referendum on Wednesday in which two-thirds of voters backed abandoning Copenhagen’s 30-year-old opt-out.
Amid mounting fears over the war’s impact on world food supplies, Putin is due to meet the head of the African Union, Senegal’s president, Macky Sall, on Friday to discuss “freeing up stocks of cereals and fertilisers”, Sall’s office said. The meeting, in the south-western Russian city of Sochi, was organised at the Kremlin’s invitation, Dakar said.
Ukraine and Russia are major suppliers of wheat and other cereals to Africa, while Russia is a key producer of fertiliser."

Ministers representing Opec’s 13 members and 10 non-Opec producers led by Russia, a grouping called Opec+, said on Thursday they would increase output by nearly 650,000 barrels a day in July and August, nearly two-thirds more than previously planned rises of about 400,000 barrels a day. Reports earlier in the week had suggested the cartel was considering excluding Russia from future quotas, in a move that could have paved the way for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to pump more oil, but Opec stopped short of the move. Brent crude prices rose slightly after the announcement, up 0.5% at $116.94 a barrel. Opec members said they had “noted the most recent reopening from lockdowns in major global economic centres”, but failed to mention the fallout of the Ukraine conflict, which has led to oil embargos against Russia and driven demand for oil from other producers. The easing of Covid lockdowns around the world has also added to pressure on fuel supplies. Surging demand has sent energy prices soaring, pushing inflation to a 40-year high in the UK, and fuelling a cost of living crisis that has left many households struggling to cover basic costs. Thursday’s meeting was the first since the EU agreed a partial embargo on Russian crude earlier this week in hopes of “cutting a huge source of financing for its war machine”.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  While the sanctions will immediately hit 75% of Russian oil imports to the EU, and impact on 90% by the end of the year, oil transported through the critical Druzhba (“friendship”) pipeline will be exempt from the ban. That was a key concession to Hungary and other central EU states including the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which are heavily dependent on Russian oil. Bloomberg Economics has calculated that Moscow would still receive $285bn (£226bn) this year for its fossil fuel exports, including gas on which European countries rely heavily. However, the EU has also reached an agreement with the UK to ban insurers from covering ships transporting Russian oil, in order to make it more difficult for the country to export energy supplies."

Russia’s National Guard, a force also known as Rosgvardia, said in a statement on its website that one of its commanders, the Chechen fighter Adam Bisultanov, was killed on 26 May in a clash with a “group of mercenaries from the UK and the USA” that included the “son of a British parliamentarian,” Ben Grant. Grant first arrived in Ukraine in March, when he told the Guardian he was moved to volunteer after seeing footage of a Russian bombing of a house where a child could be heard screaming. He said he went without telling his mother, the MP for Maidstone and The Weald, Helen Grant, he was going.   Related: British MP’s son saves fellow volunteer while under fire in Ukraine   In dramatic footage posted online this week, Grant, who is a veteran of Afghanistan and a former Royal Marine, can be heard saying “go, go” as he and his unit exit a patch of woods and fire a Matador anti-tank missile at what is believed to be a Russian BTR-80 armoured personnel carrier. Rosgvardia said that Bisultanov was killed when his BTR-80 vehicle was hit three times by the foreign fighters. A picture of the vehicle’s carcass was posted online. In separate video, published by the Telegraph, Grant is seen dragging another British volunteer to safety after a Russian ambush in a woodland north of Kharkiv.

Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters   Grant told the newspaper that his unit of 15 British and American volunteers and two Ukrainian interpreters had been preparing an assault on a Russian-held target when they came under heavy Russian fire earlier this month. “I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life. I was terrified but driven to complete my most important goal, which at the time was getting him and my team out of the danger,” Grant said. Since Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced the creation of the International Legion of Ukraine in March, thousands of people from around the world, some with a military background and many without, have arrived in Ukraine. In a briefing on Thursday, the Russian Ministry of Defence said that it had “eliminated hundreds of foreign mercenaries in Ukraine”, adding that 3,500 foreign fighters were currently in the country. The ministry also warned that captured foreign soldiers would not be treated under the standards of international humanitarian law. “Mercenaries are not combatants, and in the best case for them they will face a criminal trial,” a representative of the defence ministry said. In a separate statement, Russian prosecutors said they had opened up an investigation into Grant and his activities in Ukraine. At least three British fighters are believed to be in Russian custody after being captured in Ukraine in April. Last week, Viktor Gavrilov, an official at the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic’s (DNR) prosecutor general’s office, said that two captured Britons whom he identified as Shaun Pinner and Andrew Hill may face the death penalty. The Guardian has contacted Helen Grant and Ben Grant for comment."

Jürgen Stock says once the conflict ends, a wave of guns and heavy arms will flood the international market and he urged Interpol’s member states, especially those supplying weapons, to cooperate on arms tracing. “Once the guns fall silent [in Ukraine], the illegal weapons will come. We know this from many other theatres of conflict. The criminals are even now, as we speak, focusing on them,” Stock said. “Criminal groups try to exploit these chaotic situations and the availability of weapons, even those used by the military and including heavy weapons. These will be available on the criminal market and will create a challenge. No country or region can deal with it in isolation because these groups operate at a global level.” He added: “We can expect an influx of weapons in Europe and beyond. We should be alarmed and we have to expect these weapons to be trafficked not only to neighbouring countries but to other continents.”   Related: Biden’s pledge to send rocket systems to Ukraine is no silver bullet   He said Interpol urged members to use its database to help “track and trace” the weapons. “We are in contact with member countries to encourage them to use these tools. Criminals are interested in all kinds of weapons … basically any weapons that can be carried might be used for criminal purposes.” Ukraine’s western allies have sent shipments of high-end military weapons to Ukraine since the Russian invasion more than three months ago. On Tuesday, the American president, Joe Biden, announced the US would supply Kyiv with advanced missile systems and munitions. After the US pulled out of Afghanistan in 2021, following 20 years of war, huge amounts of often highly sophisticated military equipment was left behind and fell into the hands of the Taliban. Stock, the secretary general of the international policing organisation who was speaking to the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris, said the conflict in Ukraine had also led to a rise in large-scale fertiliser theft and an increase in counterfeit agrochemicals. There was also a huge rise in fuel theft. “These products have become more valuable,” he said. Asked about alleged sanctions-busting and money laundering by Russian oligarchs faced with international restrictions, he said Interpol was investigating neither these nor alleged war crimes as Interpol’s constitution forbade the organisation to get involved in political activity and had to remain neutral. However, he added the organisation had received a request from Ukraine to help with the identification of those killed in the conflict. “We are not in Ukraine but we could help with this. It is classical identification work,” said Stock. Other requests would be considered by Interpol on a “case by case” basis, taking into consideration Interpol’s “strict neutrality”, he added. “Our channels of communication remain open [to member countries] for an exchange of war crimes information. But we are not looking at war crimes; Interpol has no investigating powers.”"

On the contrary, things are going very badly indeed. Sanctions were imposed on Vladimir Putin not because they were considered the best option, but because they were better than the other two available courses of action: doing nothing or getting involved militarily. The first set of economic measures were introduced immediately after the invasion, when it was assumed Ukraine would capitulate within days. That didn’t happen, with the result that sanctions – while still incomplete – have gradually been intensified. There is, though, no immediate sign of Russia pulling out of Ukraine and that’s hardly surprising, because the sanctions have had the perverse effect of driving up the cost of Russia’s oil and gas exports, massively boosting its trade balance and financing its war effort. In the first four months of 2022, Putin could boast a current account surplus of $96bn (£76bn) – more than treble the figure for the same period of 2021.   Related: EU leaders say gas unlikely to be part of new round of Russia sanctions   When the EU announced its partial ban on Russian oil exports earlier this week, the cost of crude oil on the global markets rose, providing the Kremlin with another financial windfall. Russia is finding no difficulty finding alternative markets for its energy, with exports of oil and gas to China in April up more than 50% year on year. That’s not to say the sanctions are pain-free for Russia. The International Monetary Fund estimates the economy will shrink by 8.5% this year as imports from the west collapse. Russia has stockpiles of goods essential to keep its economy going, but over time they will be used up. But Europe is only gradually weaning itself off its dependency on Russian energy, and so an immediate financial crisis for Putin has been averted. The rouble – courtesy of capital controls and a healthy trade surplus – is strong. The Kremlin has time to find alternative sources of spare parts and components from countries willing to circumvent western sanctions. When the global movers and shakers met in Davos last week, the public message was condemnation of Russian aggression and renewed commitment to stand solidly behind Ukraine. But privately, there was concern about the economic costs of a prolonged war. These concerns are entirely justified. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has given an added boost to already strong price pressures. The UK’s annual inflation rate stands at 9% – its highest in 40 years – petrol prices have hit a record high and the energy price cap is expected to increase by £700-800 a year in October. Rishi Sunak’s latest support package to cope with the cost-of-living crisis was the third from the chancellor in four months – and there will be more to come later in the year. As a result of the war, western economies face a period of slow or negative growth and rising inflation – a return to the stagflation of the 1970s. Central banks – including the Bank of England – feel they have to respond to near double-digit inflation by raising interest rates. Unemployment is set to rise. Other European countries face the same problems, if not more so, since most of them are more dependent on Russian gas than is the UK. The problems facing the world’s poorer countries are of a different order of magnitude. For some of them the issue is not stagflation, but starvation, as a result of wheat supplies from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports being blocked. As David Beasley, the executive director of the World Food Programme put it: “Right now, Ukraine’s grain silos are full. At the same time, 44 million people around the world are marching towards starvation.” In every multilateral organisation – the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization and the United Nations – fears are growing of a humanitarian catastrophe. The position is simple: unless developing nations are energy exporters themselves, they face a triple whammy in which fuel and food crises trigger financial crises. Faced with the choice of feeding their populations or paying their international creditors, governments will opt for the former. Sri Lanka was the first country since the Russian invasion to default on its debts, but is unlikely to be the last. The world appears closer to a full-blown debt crisis than at any time since the 1990s.   Related: The EU should forget about sanctions – they’re doing more harm than good | Simon Jenkins   Putin has rightly been condemned for “weaponising” food, but his willingness to do so should come as no surprise. From the start, the Russian president has been playing a long game, waiting for the international coalition against him to fragment. The Kremlin thinks Russia’s threshold for economic pain is higher than the west’s, and it is probably right about that. If proof were needed that sanctions are not working, then President Joe Biden’s decision to supply Ukraine with advanced rocket systems provides it. The hope is that modern military technology from the US will achieve what energy bans and the seizure of Russian assets have so far failed to do: force Putin to withdraw his troops. Complete defeat for Putin on the battlefield is one way the war could end, although as things stand that doesn’t appear all that likely. There are other possible outcomes. One is that the economic blockade eventually works, with ever-tougher sanctions forcing Russia to back down. Another is a negotiated settlement. Putin is not going to surrender unconditionally, and the potential for severe collateral damage from the economic war is obvious: falling living standards in developed countries; famine, food riots and a debt crisis in the developing world. The atrocities committed by Russian troops mean compromising with the Kremlin is currently hard to swallow, but economic reality suggests only one thing: sooner or later a deal will be struck.

The Himars (High mobility artillery rocket system) and the ammunition that Washington is sending with them, will allow Ukrainian forces to hit targets nearly 80km away with high accuracy. That’s twice the range of the US howitzers they have now, and about the same as the most powerful Russian rocket systems. US officials suggested they would help turn the withering artillery duel underway in the Donbas into a fairer fight.   Related: 100 days of war in Ukraine: how the conflict has developed   However, the small print of the deal was underwhelming. This first Himars delivery comprises just four systems, and although they have been pre-positioned in the region for fast delivery, it will take three weeks to train Ukrainian gunners to use them, and another two weeks to train maintenance crews. In the meantime, Russian artillery is blanketing Ukrainian positions in the east. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an interview on Wednesday that up to 100 Ukrainian soldiers are being killed a day and another 500 are wounded. Without stand-off weapons that can target the Russian guns from afar, Ukrainian lines are being pummelled and national morale, one of the decisive factors in the successful defence of Kyiv, is also taking a beating. Zelenskiy’s government has been screaming for multiple launch rockets for weeks, as it became clear that the battle for the east and south had become one of attrition, so why did it take this long for Biden to make the decision to respond? Amanda Sloat, the senior director for Europe in the National Security Council (NSC) insisted the administration had been as responsive to Ukrainian military needs as possible but timing had been determined in part by a congressional vote to approve a $40bn aid package for Ukraine. “Once we got the additional funding from Congress, which was provided on a very solid bipartisan basis, the administration moved quickly in response to the Ukrainians latest request,” Sloat told PBS television. The bill was passed by the Senate on 19 May and then was hand-carried by an aide on a commercial flight to Seoul where Biden was on an east Asia trip so he could sign it into law as quickly as possible. However it took another 10 days to make the critical decision, and judging by the leaks from inside the administration, there was a debate over whether to hand over the Himars and over what kind of range to provide. The underlying concerns were evident in Biden’s op-ed comment piece for the New York Times that coincided with the Himars announcement on Tuesday evening. The president’s emphasis was on setting parameters for the US involvement in the war. It was titled “What America will and will not do in Ukraine”, and aimed at diplomatic signalling to contain the risk of an escalation of the conflict into a Russia-Nato war. “As much as I disagree with Mr Putin, and find his actions an outrage, the United States will not try to bring about his ouster in Moscow,” Biden said, as a corrective to his off-the-cuff remark in March that the Russian despot “cannot remain in power”. Furthermore, the Himars come with strings attached. They cannot be fired into Russian territory, and the very long range munitions have been denied to Kyiv, to help ensure that does not happen. Biden has made clear that he will not allow a catastrophic failure of Ukrainian defences, but it is just as evident he has concerns about the implications of catastrophic success, a rout of Russian forces with the decisive help of western weapons, bringing with it the danger of a defeated Putin lashing out. Despite the Kremlin’s near-incessant nuclear sabre-rattling, Biden reassured Americans that: “We currently see no indication that Russia has intent to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.” However, Biden’s director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, told Congress last month that Putin could reach for the nuclear arsenal if he felt he was losing the war in Ukraine. If he did take that desperate path, Biden warned in his commentary, it “would entail severe consequences”. What the president did not say was that the US would “respond in kind”, the phrase he mistakenly used in March in reference to the possibility of a Russian chemical weapons attack. Few believe that the US would respond with a nuclear weapon to a “demonstration detonation” by the Russians, over the sea for instance. During the Obama administration, the National Security Council conducted a war game in similar circumstances and decided that a non-nuclear response was the best of bad options. In any case, catastrophic success looks a long way off for the Ukrainians right now as they continue to lose territory slowly, and their soldiers considerably faster. The weapons the US is sending will staunch the losses but not decisively turn the tables. “No system is going to turn the war,” Colin Kahl, the under secretary of defence for policy, said on Tuesday. “This is a battle of national will. You have ... hundreds of thousands of men mobilised on each side. It is a grinding, hard conflict, and it’s likely to be a conflict [which] will stretch on for a long time.”"

Titled “excursion that will never happen”, the city’s memorial featured empty school buses with stuffed toys strapped into seats to represent each of the 243 children so far claimed to be lost in the war. On Wednesday Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made note of International Children’s Day during his nightly video address to the nation, saying that since Russia began its latest invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Ukraine’s emergency services had counted 243 children as killed, 446 wounded and 139 missing. Zelenskiy also claimed that 200,000 children had been forcibly taken to Russia, saying: “The purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people but to make those who are deported forget about Ukraine and unable to return. Ukraine cannot be conquered, our people will not surrender and our children will not become the property of the occupiers.”    The installation ‘Caution! Children!’ in Lviv on Wednesday protesting against the violation of children’s rights during the war.

As well as the empty school buses, the streets were littered with signs saying “Caution! Children!” as a protest against the violation of children’s rights during the war. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, said the installation represented the fact that “243 Ukrainian children will never go on a field trip by bus”.

After the final whistle Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, sent a message of congratulations to the team. “There are times when you don’t need a lot of words! Just pride! Just thank you guys! Two hours of happiness to which we are not accustomed.”
Posting on his official Telegram channel, which has 1.2m followers, Zelenskiy said the victory had brought joy to “our military and to our whole country”. “We are all fighting, each on his own front for this. We fight, we endure, we win. Because we are Ukrainians!”
The mood in Kyiv on Thursday was upbeat, as the city digested the result in the summer sunshine. “We want to show the world that Ukraine is strong everywhere, including in football,” said Vasily Volodymyrovich, standing guard with a Kalashnikov in the capital. “We have a very strong collective. And we have a great spirit. It was an impressive group victory.”
Vasily – a 28-year-old member of Ukraine’s national guard – said he thought three players were outstanding: Andriy Yarmolenko, who scored the first goal, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Ruslan Malinovskyi. All played for leading European clubs and had huge experience, he said.
“It was great entertainment. I always thought Ukraine would win,” said Oksana, a 24-year-old receptionist. She described Artem Dovbyk’s cool stoppage-time finish for Ukraine’s third goal as “amazing”, adding: “Of course we will beat Wales.”
Journalists picked up on the banners shown by the Ukraine fans who went to Glasgow. Many were already living and working abroad. Since Russia’s invasion on 24 February men aged 18-60 have been forbidden from leaving the country, unless for exceptional reasons.

Before kick-off the crowd chanted the slogan “Armed Forces of Ukraine”. They waved banners saying “Kherson is Ukraine”, a reference to the southern region or oblast seized and occupied by Russia, and “Glory to Ukraine”, the official military greeting used by Zelenskiy in his video addresses.
Olga Tokariuk, a prominent independent journalist, said Ukraine’s “well-deserved victory means a lot”. “It’s a morale boost, it’s a source of joy in dark times,” she tweeted, with video clips of Ukraine’s goals.

132,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/02/germany-dependence-russian-energy-gas-oil-nord-stream,2022-06-02T05:00:30Z,‘We were all wrong’: how Germany got hooked on Russian energy,"On Sunday 1 February 1970, senior politicians and gas executives from Germany and the Soviet Union gathered at the upmarket Hotel Kaiserhof in Essen. They were there to celebrate the signing of a contract for the first major Russia-Germany gas pipeline, which was to run from Siberia to the West German border at Marktredwitz in Bavaria. The contract was the result of nine months of intense bargaining over the price of the gas, the cost of 1.2m tonnes of German pipes to be sold to Russia, and the credit terms offered to Moscow by a consortium of 17 German banks. Aware of the risk of Russia defaulting, the German banks’ chief financial negotiator, Friedrich Wilhelm Christians, took the precaution of asking for a loan from the federal government, explaining: “I don’t do any somersaults without a net, especially not on a trapeze.” The relationship would benefit both sides: Germany would supply the machines and high-quality industrial goods; Russia would provide the raw material to fuel German industry. High-pressure pipelines and their supporting infrastructure hold the potential to bind countries together, since they require trust, cooperation and mutual dependence. But this was not just a commercial deal, as the presence at the hotel of the German economic minister Karl Schiller showed. For the advocates of Ostpolitik – the new “eastern policy” of rapprochement towards the Soviet Union and its allies including East Germany, launched the previous year under chancellor Willy Brandt – this was a moment of supreme political consequence. Schiller, an economist by training, was to describe it as part of an effort at “political and human normalisation with our Eastern neighbours”. The sentiment was laudable, but for some observers it was a potentially dangerous move. Before the signing, Nato had discreetly written to the German economics ministry to inquire about the security implications. Norbert Plesser, head of the gas department at the ministry, had assured Nato that there was no cause for alarm: Germany would never rely on Russia for even 10% of its gas supplies. Half a century later, in 2020, Russia would supply more than half of Germany’s natural gas and about a third of all the oil that Germans burned to heat homes, power factories and fuel vehicles. Roughly half of Germany’s coal imports, which are essential to its steel manufacturing, came from Russia. An arrangement that began as a peacetime opening to a former foe has turned into an instrument of aggression. Germany is now funding Russia’s war. In the first two months after the start of Russia’s assault on Ukraine, Germany is estimated to have paid nearly €8.3bn for Russian energy – money used by Moscow to prop up the rouble and buy the artillery shells firing at Ukrainian positions in Donetsk. In that time, EU countries are estimated to have paid a total of €39bn for Russian energy, more than double the sum they have given to help Ukraine defend itself. The irony is painful. “For thirty years, Germans lectured Ukrainians about fascism,” the historian Timothy Snyder wrote recently. “When fascism actually arrived, Germans funded it, and Ukrainians died fighting it.”   Get the Guardian’s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning  When Putin invaded Ukraine in February, Germany faced a particular problem. Its rejection of nuclear power and its transition away from coal meant that Germany had very few alternatives to Russian gas. Berlin has been forced to accept that it was a cataclysmic error to have made itself so dependent on Russian energy – whatever the motives behind it. The foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, says Germany failed to listen to the warnings from countries that had once suffered under Russia’s occupation, such as Poland and the Baltic states. For Norbert Röttgen, a former environment minister and member of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrat Union (CDU), the German government bowed to industry forces pressing for cheap gas “all too easily”, while “completely ignoring the geopolitical risks”. In February this year, German Green economic affairs and climate action minister Robert Habeck said that gas storage facilities owned by Gazprom in Germany had been “systematically emptied” over the winter, to drive up prices and exert political pressure. It was a staggering admission of Russia’s power to disrupt energy supplies. “I was wrong,” the former German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, says, simply. “We were all wrong.” In recent weeks even Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, a totemic figure of the Social Democrats and greatest German advocate of the trade “bridge” between east and west, has recanted. He admits he misread Russia’s intentions as he pursued the construction of a new undersea gas pipeline. “My adherence to Nord Stream 2 was clearly a mistake,” he told German media in April. “We held on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in, and that our partners warned us about.” This is an extraordinary admission for a man who acted as chief of staff to Gerhard Schröder, the Social Democratic chancellor from 1998 to 2005 and thereafter a lavishly rewarded, and much reviled, lobbyist for Vladimir Putin. Steinmeier was also foreign minister under Chancellor Merkel, and a great evangelist for Wandel durch Handel, the concept that trade and dialogue can bring about social and political change. How did Germany end up making such a blunder? Some argue that Merkel should have seen that Putin was taking Russia in an authoritarian direction when he announced his return to the presidency in 2011. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Germany made no move to stop importing Russian gas, and although Merkel threatened to introduce crippling trade sanctions, German industry convinced her to hold back. But some blame a more persistent misjudgment stretching back 50 years, based on a fallacy that authoritarian countries can be transformed through trade.    Destroyed buildings in Borodianka, Ukraine, in April. Photograph: Alexey Furman/Getty Images   The Social Democrats have now set up a review into whether the policy of Ostpolitik – first laid out in a landmark speech in July 1963 by Egon Bahr, then the closest adviser to West Berlin’s mayor and chancellor-to-be, Willy Brandt – became deformed over time, especially after securing its great achievement, the fall of the Berlin Wall. What is extraordinary, retracing the history through memoirs and contemporary records, is how frequently and determinedly Germany was warned, by everyone from Henry Kissinger onwards, that it was making a pact it might live to regret. Kissinger wrote to Richard Nixon on 9 April 1970: “Few people, either inside Germany or abroad, see Brandt as selling out to the East; what worries people is whether he can control what he has started.” Over 50 years, Germany fought numerous battles with a series of US presidents over its growing dependence on Russian energy. In the process, Germany’s foreign office developed a view of American anti-communism as naive, and a belief that only Germany truly understood the Soviet Union. From the late 1960s, the Federal Republic of Germany tried to open its own direct line of communication with the Soviet leadership, even though its interest in reunification created tensions with the US. When it faced criticism from the US, Germany was wont to cite its unique status. “I cannot imagine there is anyone more interested in being allowed to continue working for detente and balance in Europe than the German people who are forced to live in two states,” Hans-Dietrich Genscher, then the foreign minister, told the German Bundestag in January 1980, to great applause. But after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, why was Germany still so reluctant to listen to others? A sense of guilt for the atrocities committed against the Soviet Union during the second world war may have played a role. Pride, too, that – through Ostpolitik – it had mended its relations with Moscow. Germany, in a sense, became a double prisoner of its past – bound both to the horrors it had committed, and to its belief that its response to those horrors was correct. * * * The conflicts between Germany and the US in the 70s and 80s, involving two very different presidents, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, were some of the most rancorous transatlantic battles since the second world war. “The disputes were all part of West Germany showing independence in foreign policy during the cold war, and that became uncomfortable for some American leaders,” the historian Mary Elise Sarotte said to me. Carter and the German chancellor Helmut Schmidt had little respect for each other. Carter found Schmidt moody, while the chancellor, in his autobiography, dismissed Carter as an idealistic preacher, who knew nothing of Europe and was “just not big enough for the game”. The two leaders did not just grate personally, they disagreed on issues of substance – including how to protect human rights in Russia. In 1979 Schmidt and Carter came together to jointly adopt the so-called dual track decision, by which Nato would upgrade its nuclear weapons based in Europe, while actively seeking an arms control agreement with Russia. But in other ways their approach was very different. Schmidt never lacked self-confidence, but like many Germans of that era he carried a deep sense of shame arising from painful war memories. He also believed that the stability of the eastern bloc was in the interest of West Germany, given Russia’s nuclear capability. In his autobiography he wrote that he had wanted to develop trading relations with Russia, in order to foster “a greater Soviet dependence upon European supplies”, in turn leading to “more European influence” on Moscow’s policies. And following the 1973 oil crisis, Schmidt became convinced that the Soviet Union represented a more reliable supplier of energy for Germany than the Gulf states. Carter, by contrast, saw withholding trade as the better way to influence the Soviets. In July 1978, responding to Moscow’s imprisonment of two Soviet dissidents, Aleksandr Ginzburg and Anatoly Shcharansky, Carter restricted US exports of technology for the exploration and development of the Soviet oil and natural-gas industries.    Vladimir Putin and Gerhard Schröder, then German chancellor, in Moscow in 2004. Photograph: Yuri Kochetkov/AFP/Getty Images   Yet, collectively, European business went in the opposite direction. Even after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, a large German business delegation went ahead with a visit to Moscow. The Soviets (Soyuzgazexport) and western Europeans (chiefly Ruhrgas and Gaz de France) completed negotiations on a new giant gas project, a 4,500km dedicated pipeline from the giant Urengoy field in West Siberia in late 1980. This deal was projected to increase Germany’s dependence on Russian gas from 15% to 30%. When German ministers reviewed the security implications, they concluded there was no danger of Russia misusing its potential stranglehold. Their reasoning was simple. “Long-term disruption would be against the self-interest of the Soviet Union,” the ministry decided. In a phone call with Carter on 5 March, Schmidt explained his support for the pipeline by telling the US president, “Those engaging in trade with each other do not shoot at one another.” It was a restatement of Norman Angell’s famous pre-first world war theory that the new interdependence of economies made war unprofitable and thus irrational. According to a note in his diary, Carter responded: “It is not beneficial for the Europeans to expect us to provide the stick and for them to compete with one another about providing the biggest carrot.” In 1980, Schmidt wrote: “To speak of the Federal Republic’s economic dependence on Moscow to a degree large enough to affect foreign policy indicates ignorance or malice.” Given Germany’s plight now, those words look hopelessly misjudged. * * * Schmidt faced a more challenging opponent in Carter’s successor, the traditional anti-communist Ronald Reagan. In Reagan’s eyes, German trade with Russia was in direct conflict with western security. Reagan’s view was informed by a CIA assessment submitted in July 1981, which noted a clear trend: from 1970 to 1980, Soviet gas exports to western Europe had risen from 1 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year to 26.5bcm annually. The CIA warned Reagan that the Urengoy gas project would not only accelerate Soviet economic growth, but provide the Soviets with $8bn in hard currency, facilitating a further military buildup. Far from giving Germany sway over Soviet thinking, “it would provide the Soviets one additional pressure point they could use as part of a broader diplomatic offensive to persuade the West Europeans to accept their viewpoint on East-West issues”.  In arguments that echo today’s debates, the US ambassador to the UN, Jeane Kirkpatrick, complained: “We consistently find in our talks the allies are already significantly dependent: France for 15% [of its] gas, Germany for 30%.” Schmidt assured the Americans that Germany “can go six months in the event of a Soviet cut-off”. The forecast now is that, in such an eventuality, Germany would have to go straight to a form of energy rationing. Despite various US efforts to persuade Europe to adopt a voluntary ban, including offering alternative sources of energy, in 1981 Ruhrgas AG and Soyusgazexport went ahead and signed a contract for annual imports of 10.5bcm of Soviet gas over a 25-year period. Unemployment in Europe was close to 9% at the time, and European industry needed to boost its energy supplies. At the same time, the US argument about security was dismissed as a veiled way of promoting the US oil industry. When Moscow backed the imposition of martial law in Poland on 13 December 1981, Reagan thought such a shocking event might persuade Germany to put the pipeline on hold. In a private note to Margaret Thatcher, sent on 19 December 1981, he urged her to back tough sanctions against the Soviets, stating that “this may well be a watershed in the history of mankind. A challenge to tyranny from within.” Unusually for her, Thatcher vacillated, advising Reagan that the Germans “cannot and will not give up the gas pipeline project”.    Work on the Nord Stream pipeline in Portovaya Bay north-west of St Petersburg in 2010. Photograph: Dmitry Lovetsky/AP   The US responded to the Soviet intervention by banning US companies from helping with the pipeline. In the summer of 1982 Reagan tried to force European firms to stop working on the pipeline by imposing secondary sanctions on them. Such sanctions are now a commonplace in the US foreign policy armoury, particularly over Iran, but then, they were seen as an incursion into European sovereignty. Thatcher bridled, telling the Commons “it is wrong” for “one very powerful nation [to] prevent existing contracts being fulfilled”. By November, Reagan had abandoned the attempt to impose sanctions. In a trial of strength in which Europe sided with Germany, the world’s superpower had lost. The new pipeline started pumping on 1 January 1984. The German advocates of change through trade had won. The US position on Russia was further weakened when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. The peaceful collapse of communism was trumpeted as a vindication for those that had championed dialogue, and engagement through trade. In a speech to the Brandt Foundation in March 2008, Steinmeier gave full vent to this view: “What Ostpolitik in fact achieved – as is now recognised also by those who criticised it at the time,” he said, “was to make peace in Europe, despite the difficulties, a degree more secure. For the democracy movements in eastern Europe it created new possibilities, new scope for action. It was a key factor, too, in finally ending the confrontation between the two blocs.” Olaf Scholz, Germany’s current chancellor, remains an adherent of this view, arguing last year that it contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union and laid the basis for democracy and EU membership for much of eastern Europe. The SPD co-leader, Lars Klingbeil, has also insisted that Ostpolitik “was the basis for reunification and the end of the cold war. As a result, there has been a consensus in the federal republic for decades that conflicts can be defused through dialogue. We won’t let that be bad-mouthed.” Yet a number of historians and writers believe that this rosy picture of Ostpolitik is misleading. “The idea that Willy Brandt’s policy of detente towards Moscow led in a straight line to the fall of the iron curtain and German unity is at least an over-simplification,” says the historian Jan Behrends. German journalist Thomas Urban, author of a new book critiquing Ostpolitik, believes its role in the fall of the wall and German reunification has been exaggerated: “It was military buildup by Reagan and the flooding of the market with cheap oil that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union,” he told me. The Russian government budget had grown so dependent on energy for its revenue, he said, that when the price of oil plummeted in the mid-1980s, Russia’s lifeline to external capital dried up. “Gorbachev could no longer fund the overseas wars and the Soviet Republics,” he said. “But this argument was entirely missing in the German debate, especially on the left.” Urban argued that Ostpolitik’s theory of change suffered from two basic misconceptions: the belief that political change in eastern Europe could only come from engaging with the elite in power, rather than from civilian movements, and second, that “security must be the key to everything”. * * * By the turn of the century, the advocates of change through trade were in their pomp. Chancellor Schröder, with growing confidence, promoted the idea of a strategic partnership with Russia. He invited the new Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to address the Bundestag in 2001, where he won over his audience by giving the speech in fluent German and declaring “the cold war is over”. Schröder, at the time of Putin’s address, saw a perfect confluence of interests between Europe, Germany and Russia: peace, stability, multilateralism and economic growth. Putin, Schröder was convinced, “wants to transform Russia into a democracy”. In this favourable political climate, pro-Russian German lobbyists such as Klaus Mangold, chairman of the powerful German Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations, pursued the construction of yet another gas pipeline, this time taking gas from Vyborg under the Baltic Sea to Germany – the first Nord Stream. The scheme was especially controversial since it would bypass Poland, Belarus and Ukraine, reducing those countries’ incomes, weakening their bargaining power and depriving them of badly needed transit fees. The €7.4bn pipeline construction costs were to be borne by the private German companies BASF and E.ON, and the majority Russian state-owned Gazprom. This time, protests against the pipeline did not just come from the US, but from the states that had recently emerged from Soviet rule, such as Poland and Lithuania. Radosław Sikorski, then Poland’s defence minister, notoriously compared the plan to the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, which paved the way for the invasion of Poland. Yet on 8 September 2005, 10 days before the election in which Schröder’s Social Democrats lost to Angela Merkel’s conservatives, the Nord Stream 1 contract was signed in Berlin by representatives of Gazprom, E.ON and BASF. Putin stood alongside Schröder at the signing ceremony. Schröder has since been singled out for his role in creating Germany’s dependence on Russian energy, and getting very rich in the process. But the distinguished former German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger recently argued that Schröder should not take the blame for giving the go-ahead to Nord Stream 20 years ago: most German politicians, he told the New York Times in April, did not question whether they were getting into an unhealthy dependence on Russian energy. In the article, Schröder made the same case: “It never occurred to anyone that this could become a problem. It was just a way of procuring gas for Germans, for Germany’s heavy industry, and also for the chemical industry, with fewer problems and disruptions.” Thereafter it seemed, whatever the setbacks in German-Russian relations, nothing could shift the faith in trade – not Russia’s “peace enforcement operation” in Georgia in August 2008, not the Russian disruption of the gas pipelines in a dispute with Ukraine in January 2009, nor the news that Putin was planning to return to the presidency in 2012, replacing Dmitry Medvedev, in whom Frank-Walter Steinmeier had placed his faith. In 2011, the year Nord Stream finally opened, German total trade exports to Russia rose 34% to €27bn.  Interactive The Nord Stream gas pipelines from Russia to Germany  Then came the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2014. Initially, Russia’s incursion seemed to mark a turning point. Merkel’s condemnation was clear: the annexation of Crimea was contrary to international law. Sanctions were duly imposed, and German exports to Russia fell. Following the 2014 invasion, serious German media such as Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published lengthy articles looking at the options for how Germany could wean itself off its dangerous dependency on Russian energy. Many of the proposals, such as new liquid gas terminals to allow Germany to import gas from other countries such as Qatar and the US, are the same ones under discussion now, which shows how little actual diversification was achieved. When I spoke to a Qatari energy official last month, he recounted how they spent five years trying to break into the German energy market, only to find their route blocked at every turn. Some German sanctions on Russia continued for many years, but the advocates of change through trade gradually re-established their ground. It seemed nothing Russia could do would shake their confidence. On 4 September 2015, at the Vladivostok economic forum, with Putin in attendance, an agreement was signed for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline on the Baltic seabed, which would vastly increase Germany’s reliance on Russian natural gas. Gazprom would also take over Germany’s gas storage business, thereby handing control of German energy reserves to a foreign power. * * * Various theories – some grubby, some metaphysical – have been proposed to explain Germany’s dogged refusal to see the dangers in its dependency on Russia. One argument places the blame on SPD politicians and civil servants who were allowed to move seamlessly between public office and Putin’s employment, and worked hard to manipulate the EU and German regulatory environment to suit Gazprom. Then there is the question of the German-Russian industrial lobby, as symbolised by the German-Russian Forum, which was closely linked with, and partly funded by, German companies active in Russia. (The Forum was suspended after the invasion of Ukraine.) Its board of trustees consisted mainly of business people, often with economic interests in Russia. Its chairman, Matthias Platzeck, the former SPD minister president of Brandenburg, seemed genuinely shocked by Putin’s invasion: “I was wrong because until recently I thought what happened was unthinkable.” The historian Sarotte said there is no clear evidence that business had exerted greater influence in politics in Germany than in other countries. Nevertheless, over the years, Russia showed an ability to suborn, and in some cases corrupt, the German political class. The Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, on a visit to Berlin in late May, called German Ostpolitik a “fiasco”. German rhetoric around the political value of interdependence, he said, crudely boiled down to gaining a competitive advantage through cheap energy.

Photograph: John MacDougall/AFP/Getty Images   Thomas Urban, examining the psychological roots of Ostpolitik, pinpoints two emotions in Germany’s relationship with Russia: nostalgia and guilt. He described to me “the memory of Bismarck, who saw the alliance with Russia as an anchor of stability in Europe. But then there was also the feeling of guilt because of the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, with millions of dead. It meant it was difficult to criticise the Red Army or the Soviet repression since to do so means you do not recognise the greatest crimes in history. It makes Germany blind to the black side of the Soviet Union. It also permits Putin’s propaganda by talking only of the Russian war dead, and not those that were killed in Ukraine and Belarus.” Much of Germany’s belief in trade with Russia was born of wishful thinking. It led Steinmeier as foreign minister, for instance, to look constantly for signs of reform, ignoring foreign office advice that he needed a plan B in case Germany’s faith in Russia turned out to be ill-founded. In 2016, Steinmeier gave a deeply sincere, almost elegiac speech at Yekaterinburg University asking whether Germany and Russia were still capable of listening to one another. He admitted the annexation of Crimea had been a low point, but hoped dialogue was still possible, urging both sides not to turn their backs on one another.   Related: How Putin’s invasion returned Nato to the centre stage | Thomas Meaney   It was the speech of a man who sensed the tide was going out, and who feared his belief in dialogue no longer matched the spirit of harsher times: “In political discussions, we sometimes hear opinions expressed by people who are not interested in the slightest in understanding others; people who have already made up their minds about the other side; people who don’t even bother reading because they think they already know the answer.” What he described as the “supposed antagonism” between the west and Russia, he feared was becoming entrenched and ideologically driven, running counter to the pursuit of diplomacy and peace. Now, as Germany’s president and head of state, Steinmeier has been told by Ukrainian officials that his record as the promoter of Russian interests in Germany means he is not welcome in Kyiv at this time. It seems a shame. There would be no need for him to fall to his knees – as Willy Brandt did in Warsaw in 1970, apologising for his nation’s wartime crimes – but he could give a sober reflection on what precisely went wrong with Germany’s eastern policy for so long.

They are also competing to win the battle for world opinion if the plans collapse. Both sides are busy diplomatically across Africa and the Middle East trying to portray their adversary as the culprit for spiralling food and fertiliser prices. Russia and Ukraine export more than a quarter of the world’s wheat, while Russia is the world’s top fertiliser exporter. The World Bank’s Fertiliser Price Index rose nearly 10% in the first quarter of 2022, to an all-time high in nominal terms. Ukraine’s backlog of 20m tonnes of grain needs to be exported quickly to avoid a further explosion of food prices, and also to preserve the next Ukrainian harvest that currently cannot be sent to already full storage facilities. That is not possible due to the Russian naval blockade of the Black Sea port of Odesa, and Ukrainian floating mines planted to block the port from Russian attack. Russia, in return for lifting the blockade, wants any sanctions on its shipping and fertiliser products lifted. At issue is whether there is a deal to be done. In what is beginning to look like the main plan, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has agreed to meet the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, but not until 8 June, over proposals for Turkey to de-mine Odesa and then escort grain ships through to the Bosphorous along a naval corridor. Erdoğan spoke with Vladimir Putin about the proposal on Monday, and according to the Turkish read-out, Putin was willing to cooperate, on conditions. Turkey, through the 1936 Montreux convention, is arbiter of sea traffic in and out of the Black Sea, and justifies its refusal as a Nato member to impose sanctions on Russia by pointing to this unique role. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said on Tuesday that food security was the most important question: “We are focusing on this. We are planning to establish a centre in Istanbul to observe the corridor.”   Related: Lithuania wants naval coalition to lift Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s grain   Within Europe, the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, has taken the practical initiative, discussing the issue first with Joe Biden a fortnight ago then last week holding talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, then Putin and then Zelenskiy again. The Ukrainians have said they are willing to see Odesa de-mined, but conditions would have to be set on how the Russian navy would not use the clearance of mines as an opportunity for its warships to move closer to the port. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said: “We must be very careful, because a unilateral guarantee from the Kremlin is not enough. We need third countries to take responsibility for enforcing the agreement.” Italy and the UK have offered to undertake the de-mining operation, something that could take a fortnight, but Turkey may be Russia’s preferred choice to complete this perilous task. According to Draghi, Putin has indicated that he would open access to Odesa provided valid checks could be made to ensure the grain ships were not carrying weapons for use by Ukraine. Unresolved issues also exist about the nationality of the ships escorting the convoy, and their terms of engagement if threatened by Russia. According to Moscow, Putin noted the “readiness of the Russian side” to facilitate the unhindered sea transit of goods in coordination with Turkish partners. But Russia also wants in return the lifting of western sanctions on Russian fertilisers, something Draghi says is also being urged on the EU by Africa and warrants a second look. The US is also showing some flexibility. Its ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the US was prepared to give “comfort letters” to shipping and insurance companies to help facilitate exports of Russian grain and fertiliser. She insisted that Russian grain and fertiliser were not under US Treasury sanctions but that “companies are a little nervous and we’re prepared to give them comfort letters if that will help to encourage them”. She stressed this was not a bargain to get the Russian blockade of the port of Odesa lifted. At the moment, the UK and the EU may be heading in contradictory directions by coordinating a ban on insurance for ships carrying Russian oil anywhere in the world. Distinguishing insurance for grain as opposed to oil ships is feasible, but could prove a complicating factor. One possibility is that Rebecca Grynspan, a senior UN official – recently in Moscow for talks on the issue – could help negotiate a draft security council resolution backing the humanitarian corridor, an idea backed by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. One western official said: “It is unlikely even Russia could veto a resolution to feed the world simply because Russian demands on the lifting of sanctions had not been met.” Draghi is not opposed to the UN involvement but has fears about the pace of progress. He said: “It can play an important role in resolving the crisis, but we have a duty to ask ourselves how we can help. How to accelerate, to avoid arriving late.” However, the UK, Poland and Baltic states are sceptical that Putin will ever agree. Britain backed Lithuania’s proposal for a similar convoy plan, but one that did not depend on Russian cooperation. It proposed a coalition of the willing – not a Nato force – to escort ships. Egypt, one of the many middle- and lower-income countries heavily dependent on Ukrainian and Russian grain, was mentioned as a possible member of the coalition. The plan certainly seemed to gain favour with the hawkish UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, when she met the Lithuanian foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis. It was significant that Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, made a rare visit to Cairo this week to discuss the grain crisis. But Gen Mark Milley, the chair of the US joint Chiefs of Staff, struck a cautious note in London on Tuesday, saying: “To open up those sea lanes would require a very significant military effort.” If policymakers opted for it, “it would be a high-risk military operation that would require significant levels of effort”, he said. It is for that reason Draghi, Macron and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, felt that it was necessary to test Putin out. If none of the sea-route options works, the only alternative is to intensify the use of existing and much more expensive routes that take grain on trucks through Poland to Baltic and Polish ports, or on barges down the Dnieper River to Romanian ports and finally via train to Poland. The option of taking grain by train through Belarus looks impossible due to Minsk’s demands for sanctions on potash to be lifted. At the main crossing point into Romania there is a 20km backlog of trucks waiting to be inspected. A queue of 100 barges were at the Dnieper River waiting to get to the Black Sea. Only seven vessels were being cleared a day. Apart from the humanitarian necessity to avoid famine, Draghi regards the risks to the west of spiralling bread prices, in terms of migratory flows, terrorism and political instability, as real and imminent. As one Italian official put it: “We have two weeks left to sort this or we face something very grave.”"

Speaking in relation to children take to Russia, he said: “The purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people but to make those who are deported forget about Ukraine and unable to return.” In her first public speech since leaving office about six months ago, Angela Merkel has described Russia’s war on Ukraine as a “barbaric war of aggression” which amounted to a “far-reaching turning point”. She said whilst she was reluctant to give her views from the sidelines as the former German chancellor, she could not avoid talking about the most “glaring breach of international law” in the history of Europe since the end of the second world war. Russian forces are currently occupying about 20% of Ukraine’s territory, Zelenskiy said in a video address to the Luxembourg parliament. The front lines of battle stretch across more than 1,000km (620 miles) Russia has taken control of most of the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sieverodonetsk, the UK ministry of defence has said in its latest intelligence report. The report adds: “The main road into the Sieverodonetsk pocket likely remains under Ukrainian control but Russia continues to make steady local gains, enabled by a heavy concentration of artillery.” Around 800 people, including children, are hiding underneath the Azot chemical factory in the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, which has come under intense Russian shelling, according to Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region. Local residents have sought shelter in the Soviet-era bomb shelters underneath the plant. The chief spokesman for Russia’s ministry of defence, Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, has claimed that the number of foreign mercenaries fighting for Ukraine has halved since the the start of the war, due to Russian high-precision strikes and their own poor training. He also had a warning for those still fighting as mercenaries in Ukraine, saying “Let me remind you that in accordance with international humanitarian law, mercenaries are not combatants and the best that awaits them is criminal liability.️” Russian forces are trying to assault the east Ukrainian village of Berestove that lies on a main road linking the Luhansk region’s city of Lysychansk to the rest of Ukraine, a Ukrainian general has said. The headquarters of the territorial defence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic claims to have 222 settlements are under their control. They claim overnight ten areas of Donetsk were shelled by Ukrainian forces, and that one person was killed and 19 more were injured. Foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Ukraine is working with international partners to create a United Nations-backed mission to restore Black Sea shipping routes and export Ukrainian farm produce. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will meet the head of the African Union, who is also the Senegalese president, Macky Sall, on Friday to discuss “freeing up stocks of cereals and fertilisers” and the conflict in Ukraine, Sall’s office said. The EU has dropped the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, from its new sanctions list. Diplomats are cited as saying that Patriarch Kirill has now been removed from the list of sanctioned individuals, at the request of Hungary. Slovakia will deliver eight self-propelled Zuzana 2 howitzers to Ukraine under a commercial contract which a state-controlled producer signed, the Slovak Defence Ministry has said. Ukraine’s football victory over Scotland in their Fifa World Cup playoff semi-final last night gave the country, in the words of Zelenskiy, “two hours of happiness to which we are not accustomed.” The US announced yesterday it will send Ukraine four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition to help try to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more. It will take at least three weeks to get the precision weapons and trained troops onto the battlefield, the Pentagon said. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the supply of US advanced rocket systems to Ukraine increases the risk of a “third country” being dragged into the conflict. Lavrov’s deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine “extremely negatively” and that it would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov added: “We believe that the United States is purposefully and diligently adding fuel to the fire.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Ukraine has given “assurances” that it will not use long-range weapons systems provided by Washington against targets on Russian territory. A Russian missile hit rail lines in the western Lviv region, a key conduit for supplies of western weapons and other supplies, officials said. Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskiy said five people were wounded in the strike. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the country’s interior minister, said the Russians hit the Beskidy railway tunnel in the Carpathian Mountains in an apparent effort to cut a key railway link and disrupt shipments of weapons and fuel. Denmark has voted overwhelmingly to join the EU’s common defence policy, becoming the last of the bloc’s members to sign up. The referendum on Wednesday, in which voters backed the government’s proposal by 66.9% to 33.1%, followed historic applications by Denmark’s previously non-aligned Nordic neighbours, Finland and Sweden, to join Nato last month. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he will convene a meeting in Brussels in the coming days with senior officials from Sweden, Finland and Turkey to discuss Turkey’s opposition to Sweden and Finland joining the alliance. Blinken said there was a “strong consensus within Nato, broadly, to support the rapid accession of Sweden and Finland” to Nato and he was confident it would happen. "

The referendum on Wednesday, in which voters backed the government’s proposal by 66.9% to 33.1%, followed historic applications by Denmark’s previously non-aligned Nordic neighbours, Finland and Sweden, to join Nato last month. Denmark, historically critical of the EU, secured exemptions from joining the common security and defence policy (CSDP) and the euro in a 1993 referendum, but the country’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said it was time to change tack. “Tonight Denmark has sent a very important signal. To our allies in Europe and Nato, and to Putin,” she told cheering supporters on Wednesday evening after the result was published. “We’re showing that when Putin invades a free country and threatens stability in Europe, we others pull together. “Denmark now can partake in the European cooperation on defence and security. And for that I’m very, very happy.” Frederiksen called the referendum barely two weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, after reaching an agreement with a majority of parties in the Danish parliament, and pledged to increase defence spending to 2% of GDP, in line with Nato membership requirements, by 2033. “Nato will of course remain our most important tool, but the EU gives us another in securing our defence in the east,” the ruling Social Democrats’ defence spokesperson, Mogens Jensen, said. Eleven of Denmark’s 14 parties, representing more than three-quarters of seats in parliament, had urged voters to drop the opt-out. “The world is changing, and not in a good way. We need to stand together and strengthen the cooperation that strengthens our security,” said Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, head of the opposition Liberal party. Participation in the EU’s defence policy will allow Denmark, a founding Nato member, to take part in joint EU military operations, such as those in Bosnia, Mali and Somalia, and will allow Danish officials to stay in the room when EU colleagues discuss defence issues. EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel welcomed the result. Denmark’s decision was a “strong message of commitment to our common security”, Von der Leyen tweeted, saying Denmark and the European Union would benefit. “This decision will benefit Europe and make both the EU and the Danish people safer and stronger,” Michel wrote on Twitter. It would be seen largely as a symbolic win in Brussels, experts said. “The political significance will outweigh the military contribution,” said Kristian Soby Kristensen, a senior researcher at Copenhagen University’s Centre for Military Studies. Those opposed to abandoning the opt-out argued that the EU’s defence cooperation is hampered by excessive bureaucracy and inefficient decision-making, and that a joint European defence would come at the expense of Nato.

“It’s a very poignant evening,” says the Tartan Army stalwart, who has been supporting the Scottish national team for nearly half a century, and has come together with other fans to perform the Ukrainian national anthem – led by the opera singer Vasyl Savenko – on the steps of the Glasgow stadium as the crowds stream in for Wednesday’s qualifier.
“Part of you says it wants Ukraine to do well and part says: ‘Oh no, no, no …’ I feel for Ukraine, my passion is football, and this is a good way to connect.”
“It’s like Rabbie Burns,” he muses. “He wrote that the time will come when all will brothers be.”

The plan for Scots to join Ukrainian fans in singing their national anthem inside Hampden as an expression of unity was prompted by the language learning app Duolingo.
“It was one of those ideas that just snowballed,” explains the app’s UK manager, Colin Watkins. A phonetic Latin version from the original Cyrillic script of Shche Ne Vmerla Ukrayina was produced for Scots to practise in advance and fans walking into the stadium will all receive a leaflet explaining the plan “to raise the roof at Hampden Park”.
For the professional musician Iryna Ganzha, who is accompanying the singing on the bandura, a 65-string instrument made only in Ukraine, the significance of Wednesday’s match and show of vocal solidarity is immense.

“This is incredibly important for the whole of Ukraine to see, those who cannot be here, our brave women and men on the frontline,” she said.
“Ukraine is a singing nation, we express ourselves through music, and so the support of the Scottish people standing hand in hand with us and also voice to voice means so much.”
There were around 3,500 Ukraine fans in attendance at Hampden Park, including an invited group of orphans, able to witness their team’s surprise 1-3 victory over the Scots. Ukraine will now play Wales on Sunday at 5pm in Cardiff for the chance to qualify for the Qatar World Cup which begins in November.
Earlier, around the stadium, the usual festival atmosphere was undercut by a pulse of raw emotion. Kostaia waves his flag wildly in time to the folk songs that another supporter is belting out by the car park. She wears the traditional floral crown paired with jeans, like many female Ukrainian fans at the stadium.
Kostaia has travelled from London today: his boss, a Scot, gave him the day off. “Today is very difficult for me because of what is happening in my country.” His eyes are wet. “I want to help but I can’t.”
But the show of solidarity is not reserved for Hampden, as fans came together across Scotland on Wednesday evening.
In the Highland Perthshire town of Aberfeldy, where the community has welcomed 40 Ukrainians since the conflict began, the Black Watch pub is draped in both saltires and the blue and yellow bands of Ukraine for the occasion.

“This is an opportunity to have a bit of normality together,” explains the pub’s owner, Gavin Price, who is also manager of Elgin FC. “It’s been a settling-in process for all of us. It’s a friendly buildup, but when it comes to the football I’m sure both nations wants their team to win.”
Hannah Beaton-Hawryluk, the chair of the Edinburgh branch of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, travelled to Hampden with her son after arranging two coaches to transport fans from the capital to Glasgow.
“It’s a little bit of light relief for people who arrived here, some with only the clothes they stand up in. It’s about being together and celebrating no matter what the outcome.”
Beaton-Hawryluk anticipates that singing her national anthem alongside home supporters at kick-off will be an “incredible” moment. She apologises as her voice breaks.
The association, which was founded in Edinburgh in 1946, has been so busy offering support to refugees who began arriving in February that she only now has a moment to reflect.
“Scots have been incredible from the moment the war started. They have rallied round and put their arms around Ukraine,” she said."

But Lee Zion, whose tiny Lafayette Nicollet Ledger reaches all 500 people in the tiny Minnesota town of Lafayette, says he is throwing in the towel – because he wants to fight for Ukraine. Zion is offering to give away the weekly publication, which is profitable and free of debt, before he goes off to fight against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Zion, 54, bought the Ledger four years ago for $35,000, after working in journalism for decades. “To put out a good newspaper, they have to do what I do,” Zion warned prospective owners in an interview with Minnesota’s Star Tribune. “And that is, do everything myself with only a handful of [freelancers], and work seven days a week and never take time off.” An advertisement posted in the journal said Zion “wants to leave the paper in good hands. To get this newspaper, entirely free of charge, the next owner must show that he or she has the knowledge, experience and the drive to take on the challenge.” Zion’s motivation to volunteer to fight against Russian soldiers is complex. Before the invasion, he concedes, he didn’t care much about Ukraine, but he did have strong feelings about the bandura, a plucked string folk instrument that combines elements of the zither and lute and is considered Ukraine’s national instrument. “It’s a gorgeous instrument. I thought, someday I’m going to buy one,” Zion told the Star Tribune. “And Russians murdered people just for the crime of playing it. “Sounds silly, but at the same time, it’s so silly that it’s evil,” he added. Zion contacted a bandura chorus in Toronto who advised him to contact the Ukrainian consulate in Chicago. Ukraine officials told the Military Times in March that they were looking for foreign volunteers with combat experience who would require little training before being armed and sent to the frontline. “Where I go, that is up to other people,” he said. “They’ll decide whether I’m going to be in a combat zone. They’ll decide whether I dig ditches. They’ll decide whether I’m a teacher. I can be an escort taking people out of Ukraine. “Maybe they’ll put me into news, because that’s what I’ve been doing my whole adult life.” Some won’t be sad to see him go. In a 7 March 2019 editorial decrying anti-immigrant sentiment, he suggested that if people with xenophobic attitudes did not want to fight a declining birthrate by accepting immigrants into the country, then women should have sex with him instead. A letter from Jan Anderson of Lafayette, publicly posted to Zion on Facebook and partially republished by South Minnesota News, called the editorial “disgusting, disturbing, and downright creepy” and called for Zion to leave town: “We are asking that Mr Zion make Lafayette, and the surrounding communities, less creepy again by packing up your wares and opening shop someplace else.”"

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Wednesday that after Joe Biden’s agreement to provide Ukraine with multiple-launch rocket systems, Ukraine had “given us assurances that they will not use these systems against targets on Russian territory”.
The US plans to supply the M142 high mobility artillery rocket system (Himars) equipped with munitions with a range of about 50 miles, but not the more advanced rockets that can fly 185 miles. Himars is light, highly mobile and can be quickly reloaded by its crew.

 Related: Himars: what are the advanced rockets US is sending Ukraine?  

The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, speaking in Saudi Arabia, said the supply of the rocket launchers to Ukraine raised the risk of a “third country” being dragged into the conflict.
The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said such supplies would not encourage Ukraine’s leadership to resume stalled peace talks. “We believe that the United States is purposefully and diligently adding fuel to the fire,” he said. “In order to trust [someone], you need to have experience with situations when such promises were kept. Regretfully, there is no such experience whatsoever.”
Shortly after the US decision was announced, the Russian defence ministry said Russia’s nuclear forces were holding drills in Ivanovo province, north-east of Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported.
The expectation is that Ukraine could use the rockets in the eastern Donbas region, where they could intercept Russian artillery and take out Russian positions in towns where fighting is intense, such as Sievierodonetsk.
With Ukraine facing reverses in the battle for Donbas, Kyiv has been pushing hard for allies in Europe and the US to supply long-range artillery systems in attempt to redress the balance for its outgunned and outnumbered forces in a war that has increasingly become dominated by intense artillery duels.
Each launcher can carry six GPS-guided rockets, which can be reloaded in about a minute, and the system is considered more advanced than other rocket systems that Ukrainian forces currently use.
Jonathan Finer, the White House deputy national security adviser, said Washington believed the system would meet Kyiv’s needs. “This is a defensive conflict that the Ukrainians are waging. Russian forces are on their territory,” Finer said in an interview with CNN.
He said there were significant targets that Ukrainians could not reach with the weapons they had, and the rocket system would make a big difference in the conflict in the south-eastern part of the country, where Russian forces are currently focused.
However, there was some scepticism among defence analysts over how significant an impact the delivery of Himars might have on the battlefield in the immediate future, pointing to questions over Ukraine’s ability to effectively deploy it.

 Related: 100 days of war in Ukraine: how the conflict has developed 

Franz-Stefan Gady, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote on Twitter: “We have an incomplete picture of the current combat status of the Ukrainian armed forces. I would be cautious when attempting to assess how quickly Ukraine would be able to integrate new platforms/weapons systems to increase combat effectiveness in a larger-scale counteroffensive.
“Combined arms manoeuvre is a complex undertaking. What you don’t want is rushing undertrained brigades into combat. Knowing how to rudimentarily use and do simple repairs on a weapon system is merely the first step and does not indicate how effective units will be in actual combat.”
While the weapons will close some of the gap, allowing Ukraine to hit further behind Russian lines in Ukraine – in particular allowing it to target command centres – other experts point out that using Himars effectively will rely heavily on the quality of Ukrainian battlefield intelligence.
The promise of Himars represents the 11th US assistance package for Ukraine approved so far and will be the first to tap into the $40bn in security and economic assistance package recently passed by Congress.
The rocket systems would be part of Pentagon drawdown authority, so their supply would involve taking weapons from US inventory and getting them into Ukraine quickly. Ukrainian troops would need training on the new systems, which could take at least a week or two.

Philip Breedlove, a retired US Air Force general who was Nato’s top commander from 2013 to 2016, said Ukraine needed multiple-launch rocket systems.
“These are very important capabilities that we have not gotten them yet. And they not only need them, but they have been very vociferous in explaining they want them,” he said. “We need to get serious about supplying this army so that it can do what the world is asking it to do: fight a world superpower alone on the battlefield.”

However, the process to apply has been described by the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, as being “unnecessary, long, [and] bureaucratic”. The government should realise that there’s more to be gained than the warm fuzzy feeling of a global do-gooder if we prioritise the expedient assistance of as many Ukrainians as possible, as soon as possible. The combination of EU workers in the UK heading back home post-Brexit, combined with the necessary safety net support provided by the government in the pandemic, has culminated in an unemployment rate of 3.7% in the first quarter of this year. This is the lowest it’s been since 1974, and the first time that there have been fewer unemployed people than job vacancies. In other words, UK businesses need employees now. And it turns out that there’s an able workforce ready to assist if they could get some help from the Home Office to simplify getting here. They are skilled workers too. In February this year, Ukraine was home to 5,000 IT companies, 290,000 developers, 150 fintech companies, five unicorn companies and startups that had secured $1.68bn (£1.35bn) of funding within the first 11 months of 2021. Before the war, Ukraine was positioning itself as a hub for people adept in digital transformation and business innovation. Surely prioritising and simplifying the process of applying for a visa for people who are highly skilled and desperately in need of our assistance is therefore a no-brainer?

Soldiers held out for weeks in the warren of tunnels, warehouses and cooling blast furnaces as they and hundreds of civilians sheltering with them were encircled and eventually forced to surrender. The site produced 40% of Ukraine’s entire steel output and was the key asset of the country’s biggest pre-war employer, Metinvest. Now its owner has an important role to play in the parallel battle to sustain the economy via its other plants outside occupied territory, according to its chief executive, Yuriy Ryzhenkov. “The war effort is not only what you supply to the army, but also how [the] economy functions,” the Metinvest boss says, speaking via video link from a company office in Lviv in the west of Ukraine. “So the better the economy functions, the better the country can fight a war. In our view, in my personal view, the people who are now at our steel mills are just as important to the victory of Ukraine as the soldiers on the frontline.”    Metinvest’s chief executive Yuriy Ryzhenkov. Photograph: Metinvest   Ryzhenkov was in the capital, Kyiv, when he first heard Russian weaponry signalling the start of the invasion, and was stunned that Vladimir Putin’s regime would launch open warfare. The company has since adjusted to operating in a warzone, but at least 153 Metinvest employees have died in the fighting.  Beyond keeping money flowing through the economy, the metals and mining group is playing a direct role in the war effort, delivering steel for 1,500 bulletproof vests a week to Ukraine’s armed forces, and importing military equipment such as drones, night-vision headsets and helmets. It is a remarkable shift for a company whose main shareholder – Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov – was as recently as November cited by the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as a target to be recruited to back a possible coup attempt. Zelenskiy said Akhmetov was not involved in the plot, and the oligarch said claims of moves to draw him in were “an absolute lie”.   Related: Evacuation of Azovstal plant in Mariupol – in pictures   Akhmetov, who has links to the UK including past property investments in London, has remained hugely powerful under successive Ukraine administrations, both pro- and anti-Moscow, and has swung behind the current government, saying his allegiance is only to Ukraine and that Russian soldiers should be punished, adding that he would dedicate his wealth to rebuilding the country.  Ryzhenkov says he is in regular contact with Akhmetov as well as the Kyiv government, but insists the company is not involved with the “political issues” of its owner. “We’re working as a single team towards Ukrainian victory.” Before the war, Azovstal employed 11,000 people, producing 4m tonnes of steel a year. That has all stopped. Given the scale of the human lives lost, it can be jarring to talk about quotidian business matters. Ryzhenkov raises an eyebrow when asked what Metinvest’s output will be this year, but responds that it will be down at least 60% compared with 2021.    Ryzhenkov visits one of the company’s operating blast furnaces in Kamianske. Photograph: Metinvest   Yet there has been “help from the market” in the form of strong steel prices, which have lessened the blow to the company’s finances, which were in any case in relatively good shape before the February invasion began, with cash balances high. Ryzhenkov says the company’s focus around Mariupol has now turned to providing temporary food and shelter for more than half of the workforce who have already left the city. Metinvest is running a “humanitarian hub” in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, offering medics and psychological help for adults and children. Yet he estimates that 50,000 of its employees are still working in the country. Two more blast furnaces in Zaporizhzhia and the city of Kamianske to the north are working at about 50% and 60% capacity respectively, with most products going to European markets or ports. Iron ore mining facilities in Ukraine are operating at around 35% to 40% capacity, and a coking coalmine is at about 75%.  Running a humanitarian operation alongside one of the country’s largest businesses during wartime is not something most chief executives face, but Metinvest has had some preparation. It was forced to move its headquarters from Donetsk after Kremlin-backed separatists first invaded Ukraine’s east in 2014 and turn more towards European markets and non-Russian suppliers for fuel where possible. Then, in the pandemic, it implemented remote working for all eligible staff.    Metinvest workers unloading humanitarian supplies. Photograph: Metinvest   The issue is getting the goods to customers. There has been “quite a significant slowdown in the flow of goods”, Ryzhenkov says. Ukraine and EU governments could step in to provide subsidies for transport, he suggests. The situation for food exports is of particular urgency, not just for Ukrainians, but for poorer consumers of imported wheat around the world. “It is a big concern,” he says. “Logistics is the key bottleneck right now for many Ukrainian businesses. The government is trying to restart the economy, but without resolving these logistical difficulties, it’s going to be very difficult. We are concerned about the speed at which these bottlenecks are being ‘debottlenecked’.” Reopening Black Sea ports at Mariupol and Odesa is “the key for economy restart”, he adds. Efforts to increase exports via rail are complicated by the different railway gauges used in Ukraine and Poland, so Metinvest has set up reloading centres in Poland and Slovakia to move products more quickly on to Europe-compatible trains. There is a limit to what can be taken by road, and Ukraine is struggling with severe lack of fuel. Ryzhenkov says government efforts to cap prices have worsened the shortage instead.    A labourer works at a Metinvest coke plant in the town of Avdiyivka near Donetsk. Photograph: Gleb Garanich/Reuters   From the images of Azovstal’s destruction that filtered out – some of them truly extraordinary – it seems like there cannot be much of it left, but the Metinvest boss cautions that the pictures could be “misleading”, with many showing less important auxiliary units, not the key blast furnaces.  The brutality of the battle for Mariupol has contributed to international isolation of Russia. (Ryzhenkov praised Boris Johnson’s backing for Ukrainian victory, saying the UK prime minister was sending a “very powerful message, and we can hear it and feel it”.) Putin’s apparent aim was to control Ukraine, but the invasion has prompted Metinvest and many other key parts of the economy to turn decisively away from Moscow.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  The company is even looking at options to produce more steel in the EU using Ukrainian commodities and Ryzhenkov hopes that Russian steel exports will be targeted by sanctions. Links with Russia of any kind are off the cards for the “foreseeable future”, he says, and Metinvest will “absolutely not” operate from Russian-controlled territory. “Until [the] Russian regime changes, I don’t see how that can be restored.” • This article was amended on 6 June 2022. Before the Russian invasion, Ukraine’s Azovstal plant employed 11,000 people and produced 4m tonnes of steel annually, not 35,000 people and 9.5m tonnes, as an earlier version said."

With fierce street fighting in Sievierodonetsk, western officials suggested that the city of Sloviansk was the likely next target for a Russian advance that has made gains in the past two weeks, even as the Biden administration in the US announced it was sending advanced rocket systems to Kyiv. Confirming the latest gains in Sievierodonetsk, a strategically important city in Ukraine’s east, the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said on Wednesday that Russia controlled 70% of the city.   Related: Himars: what are the advanced rockets US is sending Ukraine?    “Unfortunately, today, Russian troops control most of the city,” said Haidai. “Some Ukrainian troops have retreated to more advantageous, pre-prepared positions.” Haidai also said “quite a few” civilians were sheltering in Soviet-era bomb shelters under a chemical plant in the city, although he said the complex was not likely to become the site of a prolonged siege similar to that of the Azovstal steel factory in Mariupol. Ukraine said on Tuesday that Russian forces had struck a tank containing nitric acid at a Sievierodonetsk chemical plant. The high levels of attrition on the Ukrainian side, whose defenders have been pounded by Russian shelling, was conceded by Zelenskiy in an interview with the US Newsmax TV channel. “The situation is very difficult; we’re losing 60-100 soldiers per day as killed in action and something around 500 people as wounded in action. So we are holding our defensive perimeters,” he said. Joe Biden announced the supply of advanced rocket systems, called Himars, and munitions that could strike with precision at long-range Russian targets as part of a $700m (£560m) weapons package expected to be unveiled on Wednesday. “We have moved quickly to send Ukraine a significant amount of weaponry and ammunition so it can fight on the battlefield and be in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table,” the US president wrote in an opinion piece in the New York Times.   Related: 100 days of war in Ukraine: how the conflict has developed   Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces continued to hit northern, southern and eastern districts of the city of Sievierodonetsk in Luhansk, one of two provinces in the eastern Donbas region that Moscow claims on behalf of separatists. If Russia captures Sievierodonetsk, and its smaller twin Lysychansk on the higher west bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, it will hold all of Luhansk, a key war aim of Vladimir Putin’s forces. The update added that Russian forces were regrouping and strengthening their positions in preparation for launching a renewed attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk in Donetsk. Russian forces currently occupy Izium, a city north of Sloviansk. The expected Ukrainian loss of Sievierdonetsk, however, “is unlikely to be the crux” of Russia’s Donbas campaign, a western official said, adding that the war that could now grind on “to the end of the year” given the slow rate of Moscow’s advance. The average gain of Russian forces in Popansa south of Sievierdonetsk has “averaged between 500 metres and one kilometre” a day in the last month, the official added, meaning capturing the remainder of the Donetsk region in the Donbas would take months more at least. Russia would have to achieve “further challenging operational objectives” to declare victory on the Kremlin’s now reduced campaign terms, the official said. That would require taking the city of Kramatorsk, and more of the M04 main road between the Ukrainian-held city of Dnipro and the Russian-held city of Donetsk, they added, and more rivers would have to be crossed in the process. “Although we see Russia is starting to learn from its mistakes and make advances in the Donbas, I think it’s important to stress that the battle for Sievierodonetsk is unlikely to be the kind of the crux of the Donetsk campaign” the official said in a briefing.  The latest fighting in the east came amid predictions from some analysts that Russia may be overstretched in other areas, including around Kherson. In its daily update, the US-based Institute for the Study of War noted: “Moscow’s concentration on seizing Sievierodonetsk and Donbas generally continues to create vulnerabilities for Russia in Ukraine’s vital Kherson oblast, where Ukrainian counteroffensives continue. “Kherson is critical terrain because it is the only area of Ukraine in which Russian forces hold ground on the west bank of the Dnipro River. “If Russia is able to retain a strong lodgement in Kherson when fighting stops, it will be in a very strong position from which to launch a future invasion. If Ukraine regains Kherson, on the other hand, Ukraine will be in a much stronger position to defend itself against future Russian attack.” However, a recent limited Ukrainian counteroffensive around Kherson appears to have had only limited success so far. An official in southern Ukraine said Russian troops were retreating and blowing up bridges to obstruct a possible Ukrainian advance. Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Tuesday that Ukrainian fighters had seen “some success in the Kherson direction”. Russia is concentrating most of its military power on trying to capture all of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. Franz-Stefan Gady, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, also cautioned over how much impact the newly announced US rocket systems might have on the balance of the fighting and how quickly they could be effectively deployed.  We have an incomplete picture of the current combat status of the Ukrainian armed forces. I would be cautious when attempting to assess how quickly 🇺🇦 would be able to integrate new platforms/weapons systems to increase combat effectiveness in a larger-scale counteroffensive.— Franz-Stefan Gady (@HoansSolo) June 1, 2022  Writing on Twitter he said: “We have an incomplete picture of the current combat status of the Ukrainian armed forces. I would be cautious when attempting to assess how quickly Ukraine would be able to integrate new platforms/weapons systems to increase combat effectiveness in a larger-scale counteroffensive. “Combined arms manoeuvre is a complex undertaking. What you don’t want is rushing undertrained brigades into combat. Knowing how to rudimentary use and do simple repairs on a weapon system is merely the first step and does not indicate how effective units will be in actual combat.”"

The number of bodies in Mariupol is overwhelming. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian mayor, estimated that 22,000 died in the two months of fighting. However, a person among several coordinating burials in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity said they believed the total was closer to 50,000. Some of those in the messenger app group know where their loved ones are buried and are navigating the chaotic burial process under the new authorities. Others spend their days scrolling through social media groups for news, and fear they may never find them, while fellow members post photos and videos of grave markers, as well as photos of handwritten lists of the dead, occasionally with burial locations, written by unknown authors.    A makeshift grave in a courtyard, with a grave marker reading: ‘Here lie the dead bodies from apartment building 58’ Photograph: supplied   With the temperatures rising as summer approaches, the odour of dead bodies wafts down certain streets, people who have been in the city told the Guardian. There are bodies are still trapped under rubble or in flats or buried in shallow makeshift or mass graves – a number of which appear to have been poorly marked or even unmarked. Others were left in the street and rotted, and some may have disintegrated if they were hit directly or burned in a fire. “I joined the group to let people know that my father had been killed and, I don’t know, to share my grief,” said Mariana. She said she lost contact with her parents who lived in another part of Mariupol when the phone signal was cut at the beginning of March. The shelling had made it too dangerous to reach them before she left with her children two weeks later. Her father was killed putting out a fire and her mother buried him with her own hands next to their apartment building, before leaving herself, said Mariana, who plans to make the journey back to Mariupol next month to rebury her father properly.    Pages 1-8 of a handwritten list of the dead Photograph: supplied   Deaths such as her fathers are among a spreadsheet of more than 1,200 people created by members of the Telegram group, which includes information about how they died and often where they are buried. The cause of death section listed on the spreadsheet evokes the horrors the encircled civilian population underwent: death from hunger, lack of medicine and lack of medical treatment, heart attack, Covid and stroke. Died when their apartment was bombed, bombed while trying to get water, died while putting out a fire, froze to death, shot dead, and died from shrapnel wounds. The battle for Mariupol was fought over a densely populated city of an estimated 400,000 people. The Ukrainian army sent shells and missiles out and the Russian army’s response crashed back into residential areas, say residents. They say they still want to know why they were not evacuated and why they became “hostages” in a war that their mayor – who fled on 27 February – said would not happen. As the barrage of bombs made movement almost impossible, the courtyards between apartment blocks started to fill with makeshift graves dug by residents amid the shelling. Some of the grave markers are handmade, others were given to people by the emergency services who took them from a local funeral home.    Multiple makeshift graves dug next to apartment buildings in Mariupol Photograph: supplied   But sometimes even makeshift graves were not possible. A picture in the Telegram group shows a dead person’s name and date of death scrawled across an apartment door with paint, presumably written by a neighbour who wanted to leave a record for whoever would later retrieve the body. Yulia, who left Mariupol for Russia as an adult many years ago, said she found out through her former classmates on Telegram that her father had died in his apartment in late March. Her father’s neighbour told her he had wrapped him in a blanket, taken him outside in a wheelbarrow and left him next to their building. “[The neighbour] didn’t bury him because it wasn’t safe. Perhaps some [emergency] services took the body later because it began to warm up and hungry dogs were running around everywhere. I even watched a video of dogs eating corpses, it’s just awful. I’m afraid to even think about it,” said Yulia. Yulia wrote to the new city agency that has been set up to identify bodies and issue death certificates. They replied that her father was not on their list of identified bodies and asked her to come to Mariupol to give a DNA sample.    An apartment door with the name of the dead person inside and rough date, 17-20 March, scrawled across Photograph: supplied   “From their letter, it seems his body will never be identified. I think maybe the neighbour failed to leave any documents with his body,” said Yulia, who says she will return to Mariupol as soon as she can to look for her father’s body. The new authorities say the burial and identification process is in hand and that each body will be buried separately in a humane manner. But Telegram posts by people burying their dead show the process appears to be rife with problems. Since Russia declared victory in April, Mariupol has come under the control of the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk, a Russian proxy authority created to oversee Ukraine’s occupied eastern Donetsk region in 2014. Videos shot by the Donetsk authority’s TV channels show emergency workers digging up bodies from the makeshift graves and retrieving bodies from the rubble. They say they are in the process of making their way around the city with the aim of burying or reburying all the bodies. The authorities have publicly invited relatives to exhume bodies themselves, but this does not seem to involve supervision. Bodies are taken to the only Mariupol morgue still functioning, the Metro morgue, to be examined and registered, if the state of the body allows or if ID is found on the body. Photos of the Metro morgue taken by a Mariupol journalist, Vyacheslav Tverdokhleb, show piles of bodies in the courtyard next to people with face masks. On Telegram, one person who had been there warned others of the strong smell – which, they write, “starts on your approach”.    Photos of the Metro morgue in Mariupol show piles of bodies in the background. Photograph: Vyacheslav Tverdokhleb/Mariupol.City   “It’s like this: you’re queueing to get your death certificate in the yard and there are just piles of bodies next to you,” Daria said, who left Mariupol at the end of March but returned for two weeks in May to bury her close friend on behalf of his relatives. If the bodies go unclaimed or unidentified for two weeks, the authorities will bury them in graves marked with numbers, according to Telegram posts written by a representative of Ritual, the only funeral home still operating in the city.   Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am  As hundreds of thousands have left the city and cannot easily return, many are trying to employ the services of Ritual from afar. Ritual, a formerly private turned state company of the breakaway Donetsk authority, offers a paid service to dig up or retrieve a body if its whereabouts are known and bury it. This way, as one of Ritual’s representatives wrote in posts on their Telegram channel, relatives can avoid the stench or worse yet, their loved one’s body being lost in the bureaucratic chaos of Metro morgue or buried in a mass grave. Satellite images from the company Maxar and a CNN report, both taken after Russia took control of the area, show that Russian forces have dug mass graves. The CNN report, and another video posted on Telegram by Ritual on 9 May, from cemeteries outside Mariupol, show that the mass graves are numbered, and probably relate to a database the authorities are said to be keeping.    A makeshift burial site, with civilians being evacuated along humanitarian corridors from Mariupol. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images   Daria and one other person the Guardian spoke to, as well as posts on Telegram by those who had been through the process, say that the Donetsk authorities have a database with photos of the bodies and other information left on the body. But not all the bodies that should appear on the database are coming up. Olesya’s husband died and her child was seriously wounded when a rocket hit their apartment in March. Olesya decided her only option was to take her child to a doctor and she left her husband face-down near the entrance of their building. Now she cannot find his body and does not know if he has been buried. But, she says, his documents were next to him in the pocket of his jacket. “I think most likely he will be a missing person now,” said Olesya, who said that all the neighbours fled at the same time because their apartment block was burning, along with five other blocks around them. The Donetsk authorities say relatives can give DNA samples for identification, which in theory indicates that they are collecting samples from the bodies. But a person coordinating burials said they had not heard of such a practice or database. If DNA samples are not collected, thousands of bodies may never be identified and the scale and truth of what happened in Mariupol will never be known. Ukraine’s authorities accuse Russia of using the mass graves to cover up their crimes. “They should let the Red Cross in to oversee the process, collect DNA from the bodies and create a database which should be handed over to Ukraine,” said Serhiy Taruta, a Mariupol native, Ukrainian MP and oligarch whose businesses used to employ thousands in the city.  *Some names have been changed to protect people’s identities"

The new weapon is the Himars multiple launch rocket system, or MLRS: a mobile unit that can simultaneously launch multiple precision-guided missiles. Both Ukraine and Russia already operate MLRS, but Himars has superior range and precision. What system will the US provide?   Related: US to send advanced rocket systems to Ukraine as Russia tightens grip on Sievierodonetsk   The M142 Himars system (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) is a modernised, lighter and more agile wheel-mounted version of the track-mounted M270 MLRS developed in the 1970s for US and allied forces. The Himars that Washington is providing to Ukraine will have a range of about 50 miles (80km), a US official told reporters. Himars units carry one preloaded pod of six 227mm guided missiles (the M270 carries two pods), or one large pod loaded with an Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) tactical missile. The US will not supply Ukraine with the ATACMS, which has a range of 300km. With a small crew, the Himars can remove a spent pod and load a fresh one in minutes, without other vehicles helping. The crews will require some training. The US military already has Himars units in Europe; and Nato allies Poland and Romania have acquired the systems.  Interactive  Why are they valuable? Himars will give Ukraine’s forces the ability to strike further behind Russian lines, and at distances better protected from Russia’s own long-range weaponry. The GPS-guided missiles the Himars shoots have a range about double that of the M777 howitzers that the US recently supplied to Ukraine forces. At roughly 80km it generally puts Himars out of range of Russia’s own artillery, while placing the Russian batteries at risk.    Himars system during a landing exercise at Spilva airfield in Riga, Latvia, 25 October 2021. Photograph: Toms Kalniņš/EPA   It also could threaten Russian supply depots, amid western belief that the Russian forces suffer logistical problems. Some analysts have said Himars can be a “game-changer” in the war at a time when Ukraine forces appear to be struggling under Russian artillery fire. But others say Himars will not suddenly turn the tables. “The Himars would even the playing field,” a senior US defence official said. Why is Washington limiting the range? The US president wrote in the New York Times that the advanced rockets will enable the Ukrainians “to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine”. Yet the US plans to limit the range of the missiles it gives Ukraine to avoid them being used to hit targets deep inside Russia. “We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia,” Biden said. Since Russia invaded on 24 February, the US has been sensitive about taking any action to support Kyiv that might provoke Moscow to take the war beyond Ukraine’s borders. That has included not overtly backing Ukraine strikes inside Russian territory. Several times Ukraine has used its own rockets, drones and helicopters to hit nearby Russian targets in neighbouring Kursk and Belgorod oblasts. If the US provided ATACMS, they would theoretically have the ability to strike major Russian urban centres and military bases, including airfields from where attacks on Ukraine are launched. “[The] Ukrainians have given assurances they will not use these systems against Russian territory,” a US official said."

The medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance for Ukraine from the US that will include helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more, according to two senior administration officials. The weapons package will be formally unveiled on Wednesday.   Related: Himars: what are the advanced rockets US is sending Ukraine?    In a New York Times guest essay published on Tuesday, Biden said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will end through diplomacy but the United States must provide significant weapons and ammunition to give Ukraine the highest leverage at the negotiating table. “That’s why I’ve decided that we will provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine,” Biden wrote. The package also includes ammunition, counter fire radars, a number of air surveillance radars, additional Javelin anti-tank missiles, as well as anti-armour weapons, officials said. The move comes after Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Ukraine’s Luhansk province, said Russian forces had taken control of most of the key eastern city of Sievierodonetsk amid heavy fighting.   Related: ‘The west can change the outcome’: plea for heavy weapons on Ukraine frontline   Gaidai reiterated calls for residents to stay in shelters after he said a Russian airstrike hit a nitric acid tank, risking the release of toxic fumes. In a post on the Telegram app he added a photograph of a large pink cloud over residential buildings. The city’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, said artillery bombardments were threatening the lives of the thousands of civilians still sheltering in the ruined city, with evacuations not possible. Street fighting is under way, he said, adding: “The situation is very serious and the city is essentially being destroyed ruthlessly block by block.” Striuk estimated that about 13,000 people remained in the city out of a prewar population of about 100,000 but said it was impossible to keep track of civilian casualties amid round-the-clock shelling. He said more than 1,500 people in the city who died of various causes have been buried since the war began in February. Sievierodonetsk is important to Russian efforts to capture Donbas before more western arms arrive. The city, which is 90 miles (145km) south of the Russian border, is in an area that is the last pocket under Ukrainian government control in the Luhansk region of Donbas. The US decision on rocket systems tries to strike a balance between the desire to help Ukraine battle Russian artillery barrages while not providing arms that could allow Ukraine to hit targets deep inside Russia and trigger an escalation in the war. Biden said on Monday that the US would not send Ukraine “rocket systems that can strike into Russia”. Any weapons system can shoot into Russia if close enough to the border but the aid package expected to be unveiled on Wednesday would send what the US considers medium-range rockets, which can generally can travel about 45 miles (70km), the officials said.    The US High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) which will be sent to battlefields in Ukraine. Photograph: Toms Kalniņš/EPA   The Ukrainians have assured US officials that they will not fire rockets into Russian territory, according to the senior administration officials. Biden in his Times essay added: “We are not encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders. We do not want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia.”  Interactive   Interactive  The US deal is the 11th package approved so far, and will be the first to tap the $40bn in security and economic assistance recently passed by Congress. The rocket systems would be part of Pentagon drawdown authority, so would involve taking weapons from US inventory and getting them into Ukraine quickly. Ukrainian troops would also need training on the new systems, which could take a week or two. Officials said the plan was to send Ukraine the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which is mounted on a truck and can carry a container with six rockets. The system can launch a medium-range rocket, which is the current plan, but is also capable of firing a longer-range missile, the Army Tactical Missile System, which has a range of about 190 miles (300km). Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been pleading with the west to send multiple launch rocket systems. The rockets have a longer range than the howitzer artillery systems the US has already provided. They would allow Ukrainian forces to strike Russian troops from a distance outside the range of Russia’s artillery. “We are fighting for Ukraine to be provided with all the weapons needed to change the nature of the fighting and start moving faster and more confidently toward the expulsion of the occupiers,” Zelenskiy said in a recent address. Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned the west against sending greater firepower to Ukraine. The Kremlin said Putin held an 80-minute telephone call on Saturday with the leaders of France and Germany in which he warned against the continued transfers of western weapons.

Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine “extremely negatively”. “Attempts to present the decision as containing an element of ‘self-restraint’ are useless,” Ryabkov said. “The fact that the United States, at the head of a group of states, is engaged in a purposeful pumping of weapons into the Kyiv regime is an obvious thing.” US President Joe Biden has confirmed he will send the more advanced, longer-range rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance from the US. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has said that Russia now controls 70% of the city of Sievierodonetsk, which is the main crucible of Russia’s attack at the present time, and a key objective if Russian forces are to control the whole of the Donbas region. Haidai posted to Telegram claiming that “the Russians control 70% of Sievierodonetsk. Ukrainian troops retreated to more advantageous, pre-prepared positions. Another part continues fighting inside the city.” President Zelenskiy has blasted the “madness” of bombing a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk. “Given the presence of large-scale chemical production in Sievierodonetsk, the Russian army’s strikes there, including blind air bombing, are just crazy.” Local officials said a nitric acid tank was hit and posted images of pink smoke billowing. Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s military forces have had some successes near Kherson and in parts of the Kharkiv region. The UK’s ministry of defence latest assessment of the situation on the ground in Ukraine says: “Russian ground operations remain tightly focused, with the weight of fire power concentrated within a small sector of Luhansk oblast. Over 30-31 May, fighting intensified in the streets of Sievierodonetsk, with Russian forces pushing closer to the town centre. Over half of the town is likely now occupied by Russian forces, including Chechen fighters. Beyond the Donbas, Russia continues to conduct long-range missile strikes against infrastructure across Ukraine.” Overnight a video depicting children alleged to have been killed by Ukrainian forces in the Russian-occupied Donbas region of Ukraine was projected on to the US embassy in Moscow as part of a protest to coincide with International Children’s Day. Germany will supply Ukraine with the IRIS-T air defence system, chancellor Olaf Scholz said, following pleas from Kyiv and German opposition parties to step up heavy weapons deliveries. Switzerland’s government has vetoed Denmark’s request to send Swiss-made armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine. Denmark votes today in a referendum asking the nation whether it wants to end its decades-long opt-out from common European Union defence policies. Denmark’s foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, has said he will ask parliament tomorrow for Denmark’s support of the accession of Sweden and Finland to Nato. Ukraine is working on an international UN-led operation with naval partners to ensure a safe trade route for food exports, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who said Russia was playing “hunger games with the world by blocking Ukrainian food exports”. Pope Francis appealed to authorities to lift the block on wheat exports from Ukraine, saying the grain cannot be used as a “weapon of war”. The African Union warned EU leaders that Moscow’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports risked “a catastrophic scenario” of food shortages and price rises. Senegal’s president, Macky Sall, who chairs the union, said “the worst is perhaps ahead of us” if current global food supply trends continued. Ukraine would prosecute 80 suspected war criminals, said the prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova. Representatives of a group of countries investigating Russian war crimes have met with the international criminal court prosecutor, Karim Khan, at The Hague. A senior Russian lawmaker has suggested kidnapping a Nato defence minister. Oleg Morozov from the United Russia party said on Rossiya-1 state TV he had a “fantastical plot” that a Nato war minister would travel to Kyiv and wake up in Moscow. Sanctions against Russia are directed at ordinary citizens and motivated by hatred, the former president, Dmitry Medvedev, has said. Medvedev, who advises Vladimir Putin on national security, said on Telegram that the “endless tango of economic sanctions” won’t touch the political elite but have brought losses for big business. Russia has further cut off gas supplies to Europe. Gazprom turned off the taps to a top Dutch trader and halted flows to some companies in Denmark and Germany. The intensification follows the EU’s decision to place an embargo on most Russian oil imports. Ukraine’s giant seed bank is in danger of being destroyed.

Serhiy Gaidai said in an online post late on Tuesday that Russian shelling had made it impossible to deliver humanitarian supplies or evacuate people. Earlier, the city’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, said artillery bombardments were threatening the lives of the thousands of civilians still sheltering in the ruined city, with evacuations not possible. “Half of the city has been captured by the Russians and fierce street fighting is under way,” Striuk said. “The situation is very serious and the city is essentially being destroyed ruthlessly block by block. “The Ukrainian military continues to resist this frenzied push and aggression by Russian forces. Unfortunately … the city has been split in half. But at the same time the city still defends itself. It is still Ukrainian,” he said, advising those still trapped inside to stay in cellars.  Interactive   Interactive  Striuk estimated that about 13,000 people remained in the city out of a prewar population of about 100,000 but said it was impossible to keep track of civilian casualties amid round-the-clock shelling. He said more than 1,500 people in the city who died of various causes have been buried since the war began in February. “Civilians are dying from direct strikes, from fragmentation wounds and under the rubble of destroyed buildings, since most of the inhabitants are hiding in basements and shelters,” he said. The leader of the pro-Moscow self-proclaimed republic of Luhansk earlier admitted that Russian and pro-Moscow forces were moving more slowly than they hoped. “We can say already that a third of Sievierodonetsk is already under our control,” Russia’s Tass state news agency quoted Leonid Pasechnik as saying. Amid mounting concern for the civilians still trapped in the city Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council aid agency, which had long operated out of Sievierodonetsk, said he was “horrified” by its destruction. “We fear that up to 12,000 civilians remain caught in crossfire in the city, without sufficient access to water, food, medicine or electricity. The near-constant bombardment is forcing civilians to seek refuge in bomb shelters and basements, with only few precious opportunities for those trying to escape.” The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Gaidai, on Tuesday evening reiterated calls for residents to stay in shelters after he said a Russian airstrike had hit a nitric acid tank, risking the release of toxic fumes. In a post on the Telegram app he added a photograph of a large pink cloud over residential buildings. Elsewhere on the battlefield, there were few reports of major action on Tuesday. In the east, Ukraine says Moscow is trying to assault other areas along the main front, including pressing towards the city of Sloviansk. In the south, Ukraine claimed in recent days to have pushed back Russian forces on a bank of the Inhulets River that forms a border of Russian-held Kherson province. After having failed to capture Kyiv, been driven out of northern Ukraine and made only limited progress elsewhere in the east, Moscow has concentrated the full force of its armed might in recent days on Sievierodonetsk. Victory there and in adjoining Lysychansk would let Moscow claim control of Luhansk province, one of two eastern regions it claims on behalf of separatist proxies, partly achieving one of President Vladimir Putin’s stated war aims. But the huge battle has come at a massive cost, which some western military experts say could hurt Russia’s ability to fend off eventual Ukrainian counterattacks elsewhere, regardless of who wins the battle for Sievierodonetsk. “Putin is now hurling men and munitions at the last remaining major population centre in [Luhansk], Sievierodonetsk, as if taking it would win the war for the Kremlin. He is wrong,” the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War thinktank wrote this week. “When the Battle of Sievierodonetsk ends, regardless of which side holds the city, the Russian offensive at the operational and strategic levels will likely have culminated, giving Ukraine the chance to restart its operational-level counteroffensives to push Russian forces back.” The latest fighting came as Russia said on Tuesday that it will hand over the bodies of 152 Ukrainian soldiers found underneath the Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol, now under Moscow’s control. Russia’s defence ministry said its troops found “152 bodies of dead militants and servicemen of Ukraine’s armed forces” that it claims were stored inside a cooling unit and that “four mines” were found underneath the bodies. “The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies of Ukrainian militants and servicemen found on the territory of the Azovstal plant to representatives in Ukraine,” the ministry added.

The intensification of the economic battle on Tuesday over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine follows the EU’s overnight decision to place an embargo on most Russian oil imports as part of its financial sanctions against the Kremlin.   Related: EU leaders agree to partial embargo of Russian oil imports   EU leaders said the ban would immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports, rising to 90% by the end of the year. Gazprom extended its gas cuts on Tuesday by stopping supply to GasTerra, which buys and trades gas on behalf of the Dutch government. It later said it would also cut off gas flows to the Danish energy firm Ørsted and to Shell Energy for its contract to supply gas to Germany, after both companies failed to make payments in roubles. GasTerra said it had found contracts elsewhere for the supply of the 2bn cubic metres of gas it had been expecting to receive from Gazprom between now and October. Ahead of the late-night talks in Brussels, Denmark had signalled it expected its Russian gas supply to end. However, Ørsted said on Monday that a gas cut would not immediately put the country’s gas supplies at risk. Moscow has already halted supplies of natural gas to Bulgaria, Poland and Finland, after they refused to pay in Russian roubles. Gazprom said it had been told by Shell Energy Europe Limited that it would not pay in roubles for gas supplied to Germany. It added that the contract stipulated gas supplies of up to 1.2bn cubic metres per year. Gazprom said Shell and Ørsted had failed to pay for gas deliveries by the end of the working day on May 31, and would stop deliveries until they paid in line with Russian demands. The Kremlin had demanded payments for exports in roubles earlier in the spring, after the country’s currency fell off a cliff after the invasion of Ukraine and Russia was excluded from the Swift international bank messaging system in earlier rounds of sanctions. The EU’s energy commissioner had previously said that member states would have to reject Moscow’s demands, as the mechanism set out by Russia would have breached the bloc’s sanctions, even if this left them without alternative gas supply.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  Supply cuts have pushed already high gas prices even higher, contributing to soaring inflation, and also putting pressure on European governments and companies to find alternative supplies and infrastructure, including storage facilities. The EU has faced criticism over the past weeks for not going far enough in its sanctions against Russia. Ahead of Monday’s summit in Brussels, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed to EU leaders to show unity against Vladimir Putin. Under a compromise plan from the summit, Russian oil transported through the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline for use by Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia would be exempt from the EU embargo. Despite this agreement, Estonia’s prime minister has called on the EU to go further and work on a seventh round of sanctions against Russia, which would include restrictions on gas imports. However, Kaja Kallas said she was not confident this would happen. “I think that gas has to be in the seventh package but I am realistic as well,” Kallas told reporters as she arrived for a second day of talks in Brussels. “I don’t think it will be there.” "

Residents were urged not to come out of hiding due to toxic fumes. Ukraine welcomed EU sanctions, but criticised the “unacceptable” delay. Speaking alongside Slovakia’s president, Zuzana Čaputová, in Kyiv, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, noted that 50 days have passed between the fifth and sixth sanction packages. Ukraine is working on an international United Nations-led operation with naval partners to ensure a safe trade route for food exports, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who said Russia is playing “hunger games with the world by blocking Ukrainian food exports”. Ukraine’s giant seed bank near battlefields is in danger of being destroyed.

Sanctions against Russia are directed at ordinary citizens and motivated by hatred, the former president Dmitry Medvedev has claimed.

After nearly a month of wrangling, the EU agreed to ban 90% of Russian oil imports by the end of the year, with an exemption for Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. These landlocked central European countries, heavily dependent on Russian oil, can continue being supplied via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline for an indeterminate period. Following the oil embargo, a measure that would have been unthinkable six months ago, Baltic leaders called for talks on further sanctions. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said the EU needed to start discussing its next sanctions against Russia because things were “not going any better” in Ukraine. “As long as the war is going on, there is no peace, Ukraine hasn’t won the war; we haven’t done enough.” The Estonian PM, like her counterparts in the Baltic states and Poland, wants the EU to phase out Russian gas quickly. But Kallas said she was “realistic” and did not expect to see gas in the next set of sanctions. “Gas is of course much more difficult than oil already was,” she told reporters on the second day of an EU summit. “All the next sanctions will be more difficult, because so far they have only hurt Russians, but now they are also having effects on Europeans and that is why it is also much more politically difficult to decide.” Austria’s chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said gas could not be part of the EU’s next set of sanctions. “Russian oil is much easier to compensate [for] … gas is completely different, which is why a gas embargo will not be an issue in the next sanctions package,” he said. The oil embargo was agreed at a special EU summit on Monday, after Hungary gained a guarantee that it could get access to seaborne oil, if Russian supplies via the Druzhba pipeline, which passes through war-torn Ukraine, were cut off. In a message on Facebook, Hungary’s PM, Viktor Orbán, said he had secured an exemption from the oil embargo that he likened to an “atomic bomb” hitting the Hungarian economy. “Families can sleep peacefully tonight, we kept out the most hair-raising idea,” Orbán said. EU leaders played down the row with Hungary, currently embroiled in a long-running stand-off with Brussels over the rule of law and its access to EU cash. “The important thing is that we are all together, we are united,” said Latvia’s prime minister, Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš. The Ukrainian foreign minister on Tuesday welcomed the partial block on Russian oil imports. “The oil embargo will speed up the countdown to the collapse of the Russian economy and war machine,” Dmytro Kuleba said in a statement, estimating the ban could cost Russia tens of billions of dollars. He praised the EU for “not only making it harder for the Kremlin to finance the aggression but also shoring up its own energy security”, though a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had earlier given a withering assessment of EU support for his country. “Russia must not win, but we won’t give heavy weapons – it may offend [Russia]. Putin must lose, but let’s not impose new sanctions. Millions will starve, but we’re not ready for military convoys with grain. Rising prices are not the worst that awaits a democratic world with such a policy,” Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter. Zelenskiy addressed EU leaders by video link on Monday, urging them to unite because disputes “only encourage Russia to put more pressure on you”. Ending the dispute over the oil embargo allows the EU to move ahead with other restrictions in the package, targeting Russian banks and individuals close to the Kremlin. Three more Russian banks, including the country’s largest lender, Sberbank, are to be removed from the Swift international bank messaging system, a move that isolates them from global finance. Three state-owned broadcasters will be banned from the EU. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, hailed the sanctions agreement – “late as always … but a reasonable way out of the discussion”. He predicted that Russia would be forced to lower the price of its oil. “We are the most important client for Russia. They will have to look for another one and certainly they will have to decrease the price.” Some economists have suggested, however, that Russia could gain in the short-term rising prices caused by the oil embargo. At the start of the war, the EU was paying Russia around €1bn a day for energy imports. The bloc has now agreed to phase out coal by mid-August, and most oil by the end of the year, but has not set a date for gas. EU leaders also suggested energy sanctions had gone far enough, arguing that gas was already dealt with under a European Commission plan on phasing out Russian fossil fuels. Known in Brussels as RepowerEU, that plan calls for an extra €210bn (£178bn) over the next five years to pay for ending Russian fossil fuels and speeding up the switch to renewable power. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, told reporters that Russian fossil fuels had been “clearly addressed” by a coming ban on coal, oil and the RepowerEU plan. “The big bulk on energy this is up and running,” she said.  Asked about further sanctions, she said it was important to tackle attempts by Russia to circumvent EU energy and financial sanctions. “Therefore, I would not exclude that over and over we have to address the situation that we close loopholes. “These sanctions are biting hard and are really destroying … the financial basis of Putin leading this war,” she said."

If that assessment was intended to galvanise EU leaders at a crucial moment, it appears to have just about done its job. The partial embargo on Russian oil imports agreed at the summit on Monday night constitutes a significant, if belated, ratcheting up of economic pressure on Vladimir Putin’s regime. After a month of negotiations between member states, objections from Hungary were finally overcome through a temporary exemption for oil transported through a Soviet-era pipeline to central Europe. Given that Germany and Poland will forgo imports from this source, by the end of the year the embargo should cover over 90% of Russian oil supplies to Europe. The effect of the ban over time, and combined with other sanctions, will be to deprive Moscow of funds and means to prosecute a prolonged war of attrition that it did not anticipate having to fight. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, was therefore justified in describing the oil embargo as a show of unity and a “landmark” agreement. An announcement of €9bn in economic aid to Ukraine was also welcome, although it should only be seen as a start. The Kyiv School of Economics has calculated that the war is causing about $4.5bn worth of damage to civilian infrastructure every week. The costs of postwar reconstruction could run into hundreds of billions of dollars. However, financing that colossal challenge is tomorrow’s task. In the shorter term – as it attempts to intensify the financial squeeze on Mr Putin – the west must give Ukraine the military assistance it needs to resist Russian forces, while continuing to avoid moves that risk escalating and widening the war. In May, Washington committed to a $40bn package to aid Ukraine’s war effort, and the supply of US weapons is accelerating – including vital artillery capability. European countries need to up the pace of their own contributions, as the Kremlin attempts to concentrate overwhelming force in the east and annexe new territory. But the US president, Joe Biden, was right this week to rule out sending long-range missile systems to Ukraine which could be deployed to hit targets inside Russia. Moscow’s nuclear capability – and the threatening rhetoric intermittently deployed in relation to it – must necessarily inform the west’s strategic calculations, however enraging that may be. The goal, as Mr Putin’s appalling war of choice continues, must be that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people are enabled to negotiate its end from a position of strength and dignity. If this is to be achieved, it will be through a combination of economic pressure on Moscow and military resistance. Russia’s armed forces are being steadily and damagingly depleted, even as incremental territorial gains are made. Around 1,000 tanks may have been lost on the battlefield, while two of Russia’s tank manufacturers have reportedly ceased production due to a lack of parts. Thus far, Mr Putin has shown total disregard for the human cost of his invasion, now measured in tens of thousands of lost lives. But the cumulative impact of sanctions can set logistical limits to his brutal revanchist ambitions. This week’s oil embargo is an important step in that direction."
151,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/31/plea-for-heavy-weapons-ukraine-frontline-mykolaiv,2022-05-31T15:41:51Z,‘The west can change the outcome’: plea for heavy weapons on Ukraine frontline,"A stack of deadly weapons line the corridor next to Roman Kostenko’s office in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv. Giant tube-like Javelin missiles and a powerful-looking green cylinder. “That’s an NLAW anti-tank weapon supplied by Britain,” Kostenko – a member of Ukraine’s parliament and a special forces commander – explained. “We’ve used it.” 
When Russia invaded on 24 February, Kostenko was in Kyiv. He swapped his politician’s outfit of suit and tie for a uniform and hurried to Mykolaiv on the southern frontline. By this point Russian troops had practically encircled the city and its port on the Bug River. They had seized Mykolaiv’s airport and were advancing from the north-east. “I was the last car in,” he said.
Citizens were piling up tyres and making molotov cocktails in preparation for street-to-street fighting. The Ukrainian army, however, managed to push the Russians back. Kostenko showed off a video he took of a Russian position on Mykolaiv’s outskirts. There were bodies of enemy soldiers killed in a Ukrainian artillery strike, as well as abandoned field guns and vehicles.

Since this failed incursion the fighting has turned into a “war of rockets and artillery”, Kostenko said. The frontline in the south runs approximately along the administrative border between Russian-occupied Kherson oblast and Mykolaiv, 12 miles (20km) to the north. It is a shimmering landscape of green wheat fields and steppe villages, now under constant fire.
Russian howitzers are able to target Mykolaiv with ease. On Saturday a missile smashed into a residential block in the city, killing one person and injuring seven. The Ukrainians lack long-range rocket systems that would enable them to fire back, as well as defensive anti-aircraft batteries, Kostenko said. In the meantime they sit in makeshift trenches under fire.
“To survive artillery hitting you 24/7 is very hard,” Kostenko added. The Javelins sent by the US were ineffective because the Russians hid their armoured vehicles in a network of Soviet-era irrigation canals, he explained. “Our anti-tank weapons don’t see them. If our partners give us heavy artillery and advanced systems like MRLS [multiple-launch rocket systems] we can win and take back occupied territory.”

For now, Ukrainian soldiers are only able to make local tactical gains. On Monday they retook a village in north-east Kherson. Kostenko said Russia had plenty of tanks and supplies of ammunition left. The fighting in the south, and in the east where a battle is raging for the city of Sievierodonetsk, resembled the second world war with modern weapons, he said. The Russians, he admitted, had the advantage.
The MP, secretary of the national security, defence and intelligence committee, spent 15 years as a soldier. He was wounded twice in late 2014 while fighting at the airport in Donetsk against the Russians and their separatist proxies. He grew up in a village outside Kherson now controlled by Moscow, where Russian soldiers broke into his parents’ house, looted his parade uniform and took away all of the furniture, he said.
Kostenko suggested Vladimir Putin’s goal was to seize the Donbas and annex Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, making it a “non-sea country”, after he had failed in his original goal of toppling Kyiv’s government to return Ukraine to Russian influence and to demonstrate Moscow’s military invincibility.







A member of the liberal pro-European Golos party, he praised the UK, US and Poland: “We love Boris Johnson. Britain is a country which has clearly stated its position. It stands by its values. It is not afraid of the Russia Federation. We have several British volunteers who are fighting with us. The whole civilised world is fighting Russia, not just Ukraine.”
He was less enthusiastic about Germany and France. “Some of our partners are behaving very cautiously. It’s inexplicable. They are not calling out the enemy. We are fighting totalitarianism,” an exasperated Kostenko said.
Mykolaiv’s inhabitants, meanwhile, have got used to thunderous booms, which shake the city on an hourly basis. For more than a month there was no water after a pipeline was destroyed. Last week a supply for washing was finally reconnected. There is no drinking water. It is delivered to the city, a major shipbuilding centre in USSR times, in large plastic bottles. About 40% of its population have left.
A humanitarian aid point has been set up in a crumbling 200-year-old theatre and concert hall once used by naval officers. There are supplies of clothes, shoes and medicines. Residents fill in a form explaining what they need. Viktoria Veselovska, a journalist working in a pop-up basement pharmacy, said she had no mosquito repellant. “Insects are a big problem for our soldiers,” she said.

Morale among those who have decided to remain in shell-battered Mykolaiv appears high. Olga Pidsosonna, a volunteer and major in the port’s customs department, described the war as “one very long bad day”. “Russia is trying to eat us. But it will break its teeth. We are a very strong nation. I’m proud to be Ukrainian and I’m proud of our army and our volunteers,” she said.
In peacetime 10 cargo ships a day would leave Mykolaiv’s harbour, she said. Most exported grain. Russia’s naval blockade of the Black Sea meant the port was inoperative. A Ukrainian victory should include Crimea, “stolen by the Kremlin in 2014”, Pidsosonna said, adding: “I have relatives in Crimea. They want to be back with Ukraine. They can’t say this openly, of course. They are afraid.”
Few people in this city of half a million expected to find themselves living in an old-school war zone. One person not surprised by how 2022 turned out was Makar Kostiuk, a student from Vladivostok. Kostiuk volunteered in the local office of the Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny. He left the country for Ukraine before Navalny was arrested and jailed.
“When the bombs started falling I was working on my second novel. The explosions made me type faster,” Kostiuk said. Shrapnel landed in his courtyard, punching a hole in the glass on the stairwell. Kostiuk said he had not encountered any anti-Russian prejudice. But his bank cards had been blocked and he was likely to have to leave Ukraine in the summer when his residency permit ran out.

Many shops on Mykolaiv’s main street, Sobornaya, were boarded up. Tinned music played from loudspeakers attached to maple trees. A few people were out shopping and a man in Lycra rode past on his mountain bike. A lot of destruction was visible. An airdropped bomb had flattened the Ingul hotel. In March the Russians fired a cruise missile at the regional administration building, killing 12 and wounding 33.
Nobody knows when the Ukrainian army will be able to take back Kherson, which was overrun in the first days of the invasion. The Kremlin says the area now belongs to Russia. It recently prohibited residents from fleeing and has mined the road leading to Mykolaiv. Plans to hold a “referendum” on joining Moscow have been put on hold because of a lack of public support. “Ninety-nine per cent of the country does not want Russia,” the MP said.
Kostenko gave the Guardian a souvenir: a jagged fragment from a Russian Kalibr warhead, which he wrapped up carefully in kitchen roll. “Victory now depends on our international friends,” he said. “We have plenty of kalashnikovs and machine guns.

Senegal’s president, Macky Sall, who chairs the union, said “the worst is perhaps ahead of us” if current global food supply trends continue.   Related: The food crisis is what happens when global chains collapse. We might need to get used to it | Will Hutton   Speaking via video link to the 27 EU leaders meeting in Brussels, Sall said African countries had been hit hard by the global food crisis, because of their “strong dependence” on Russian and Ukrainian wheat. The situation was “worrying” for a continent that has 282 million people that did not get enough to eat, he said. “In the immediate future, we would like everything to be done to release available grain stocks and ensure transport and access to the market, to avoid a catastrophic scenario of shortages and generalised high prices,” Sall said. Before the war, African countries imported 44% of their wheat from Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine alone grew enough food for 400 million people. Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian ports is contributing to what analysts have called a “perfect storm” for global food supplies, as farmers face rising oil and fertiliser costs and the lingering effect of coronavirus labour restrictions. Drought is also threatening to reduce wheat harvests in countries including France, the US and India. Proposals to end the blockade have been made. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Tuesday that he and the German chancellor had put to Vladimir Putin ending the blockade under the terms of a UN resolution. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov will visit next week for talks to address among other things opening a Black Sea corridor for Ukrainian grain exports. The head of the UN World Food Programme, David Beasley, warned earlier this month that nearly 49 million people in 43 countries were on the edge of famine. “In many countries we are forced to make the heartbreaking decision to take food from hungry children to give it to starving children,” he said. Sall said the price of fertiliser was now three times higher than in 2021, while cereal yields in Africa were forecast to be 20-50% lower this year. He also blamed EU sanctions on Russian banks for exacerbating the problem: “When the Swift system is disturbed, this means that even if the products exist, payment becomes more complicated, even impossible.” The EU has cut some of Russia’s largest banks out of the Belgian-headquartered Swift interbank messaging system, making it almost impossible to do business with them. The African Union leader said he supported proposals for the UN to coordinate efforts to release supplies from Ukrainian ports. Lithuania has proposed that a naval “coalition of the willing” should lift the Black Sea blockade. Under the Lithuanian plan, the UN would call on Russia to ensure safe passage for ships and Ukraine to remove mines from the port of Odesa, a defensive measure to protect the strategic site. After the talks with Sall, the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, tweeted: “Russia is using food as weapon of war. Destroying crops, blocking tonnes of grain, risking global famine. EU is sparing no efforts to free Ukraine’s exports over land and exploring alternative sea routes.” And in a press conference, Michel said opening the Black Sea maritime route “should be the first priority … but we are not certain it will work”. The European Commission wants to get 20m tonnes of wheat out of Ukraine before the end of July, half of the amount currently stuck in the country. But finding alternatives to sea transport is a huge logistical challenge, as trucks and trains cannot take the same quantity of goods, and face an average wait of 16 days to cross the EU border. The EU is attempting to help firms create alternative routes, so-called “solidarity lanes”, but senior EU officials have described this as a “gigantic” task. The EU transport commissioner, Adina Vǎlean, said earlier this month that “an astonishing 10,000 barges and almost 300 large ships are needed to carry 20m tonnes of grains” if it is to be exported via alternative EU ports. Some EU diplomats believe Russia wants to add fuel to the fire of a global food crisis, with the aim of stoking a wave of migration from the Middle East and Africa that could destabilise European countries. Moscow has blamed the global food crisis on western sanctions. Lavrov, said on Tuesday his country would guarantee “free export of Ukraine grain by ships that are now locked in Ukrainian ports” if Ukraine removed mines from its coastal waters. He said western countries had created “a flurry of artificial problems” by closing their ports to Russian vessels, a sanction passed by the EU and the UK."
153,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/31/whats-next-for-ukraine-after-russias-donbas-offensive,2022-05-31T12:13:13Z,What’s next for Ukraine after Russia’s Donbas offensive?,"The recent Russian advances in the Donbas lead to an inevitable question: whether the indiscriminate tactics the Kremlin deployed there will be a template for future offensives. With reports of large numbers of troops, artillery and rocket launchers mustering across the border near the Russian city of Kursk – in an area that borders Ukraine’s Sumy province – it is an urgent issue. While much has been made of the painfully slow and grinding pace of Russia’s recent offensive in the Donbas, the speed of territorial gains is not the only metric. The Russian tactics that have shaped the battle in the Donbas have also posed a brutal dilemma for Ukraine’s defenders – to hold their ground amid rapidly mounting casualties, or withdraw and risk giving the attackers momentum. While other parts of the 300-mile frontline in Ukraine’s east lack some of the same vulnerabilities that existed around Sievierodonetsk – which sat in the midst of a Ukrainian salient that Russia exploited – in any future offensive the Kremlin is likely to offer Kyiv the same hard choices, attempting to stretch its ability to respond.  Interactive   Interactive  Perhaps the first and most pressing issue – if and when Russian forces fully take Sievierodonetsk – is whether they then attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets River, after disastrous attempts at crossing elsewhere were targeted by Ukrainian artillery with deadly effect. Whether or not Russian forces attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets River – a natural barrier – at Sievierodonetsk or elsewhere within Ukraine, Russian forces appear to be preparing for a fresh push farther north amid evidence that they are regrouping near the Ukrainian town of Izium to renew their stalled efforts against Slovyansk, rebuilding a railway bridge near Kupyansk to facilitate the movement of troops and equipment to the area. What is more difficult to assess is the level of attrition inflicted on both sides, and what impact that will have on further offensives and Ukraine’s ability to defend and counterattack. While the UK’s Ministry of Defence has made much of Russian losses throughout the war – most recently the mounting casualties among junior officers – Russian gains in the Donbas appear to tell a different story, for now at least. Increasing anecdotal evidence suggests that Ukraine has suffered heavy casualties during recent fighting in the east, largely from shrapnel, and there are reports of equipment and supply issues. What may well be true is that despite evidence of fresh Russian preparations, the difficulty of the fighting and heavy losses may limit Russia’s ambitions beyond controlling the Donbas, the south and its key coastline. “After almost a hundred days of war,” Michael Clarke of the Royal United Services Institute wrote in the Times earlier this week, “the Russian offensive in Ukraine is finally beginning to look more coherent, if not yet strategically wise or sustainable.” Predicting a prolonged war, however, the former Australian general Mick Ryan disputed the notion that either Russia or Ukraine was close to exhaustion in a lengthy Twitter thread examining the current military position and likely trajectory. “In April and early May, after Ukraine’s victory in the battle of Kyiv, a degree of triumphalism crept into Ukraine war narratives. But as the Russians have shown recently, by concentrating their forces on smaller regions of Ukraine, they can generate tactical victories,” he said. “Neither belligerent has demonstrated the capacity to land a strategically decisive blow against the other. Despite the Ukrainians demonstrating superiority in global influence, strategy and leadership, the Russians keep generating the combat power to attack them in the east. “Despite the Russians and Ukrainians losing people and equipment in the hundreds (if not thousands), neither are exhausted nations. The Russians have reserves of manpower and equipment in storage. Ukraine has masses of military aid flowing across its borders.” In spite of continuing Russian shelling around Kharkiv and in the south around Kherson, where two limited Ukrainian counteroffensives have stalled, the Russian objective in both those areas – according to the Ukrainian general staff – is to consolidate defences and supply lines and to disrupt Ukrainian forces where they have managed to advance. Elsewhere, however, as the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War suggests: “Russian advances remain limited and are unlikely to increase in pace in the near term, particularly as Russian forces continue to prioritise assaults on Sievierodonetsk at the cost of other lines of effort.”"

Instead, he said, his band had decided to change the words to their most famous song during their ongoing US and European tour, which opened in Las Vegas on 26 March, a month after the start of the invasion. The revised lyrics, projected on to a screen behind the band, say: “Now listen to my heart / It says Ukrainia / Waiting for the wind to change.” Even though the song was released over a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in December 1990, it is widely remembered as the soundtrack to the era of economic and social changes in the former Soviet Union that heralded the end of the cold war. Scorpions performed Wind of Change at the Brandenburg Gate on the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1999, and it was voted song of the 20th century by viewers of the public broadcaster ZDF in 2005. Meine, who wrote the music and lyrics for the hard rock band’s uncharacteristic ballad, said he composed the words on 3 and 4 September 1989, after Scorpions had performed at the Moscow Music Peace festival in mid-August. More recently, Wind of Change was the subject of a playful eight-part podcast series in which the investigative journalist Patrick Radden Keefe tried to chase down a rumour that the anthem had in fact been written by the CIA, without unearthing any substantial evidence for the theory. In his interview with Die Zeit, Meine again denied that his most successful song had been written by US propaganda officers. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Germany’s political establishment has faced criticism that it has spent too long buying into the implicit premise of Scorpions’ chart-topper, of a Russia ever ushered down a road of democratisation as it opened routes of trade and diplomatic exchange with the west. The threats an increasingly aggressive Kremlin continued to pose to the states that once made up its empire, critics allege, were overlooked in Berlin for decades. In his interview with Die Zeit, Meine denied that his band, too, had overlooked Ukraine’s plight, pointing out Scorpions had played concerts in Donetsk, Kharkiv and Odesa. “But as a musician you hold on to the thought that people in wildly different countries, some of whom may look on each other as enemies, react to music in the same way. That was also the case in Ukraine and Russia.” Hailing from Hanover, the state capital of Lower Saxony in north-west Germany, the band used to be seen as part of the friendship circle of the Hanoverian ex-chancellor turned Russian gas lobbyist Gerhard Schröder, whose fifth wedding party Meine attended in 2018. “I haven’t spoken with Gerhard Schröder for a while,” Meine told Die Zeit. “But his behaviour really is hard to understand.” The Social Democrat politician held on to his boardroom post with Rosneft for the first three months of the war before the Russian state-owned oil company announced his stepping down on 20 May. “If he now gives up this post on the supervisory board, then that is a genuine step in the right direction after a long time,” Meine said."

The team, made up of hundreds of lawyers and several major law firms, plans to bring “multiple actions in different jurisdictions against different targets”, including the UK and the US, said Jason McCue, a London-based lawyer who is coordinating the initiative, in an interview in Kyiv. The plan is to use UK and US judgments to seize Russian assets across the globe. Targets are likely to include the Russian state and private military contractors such as the Wagner Group, which is believed to have been active in Ukraine. But McCue said they would also include business figures linked to these contractors, and to the Russian war effort more broadly. He believes that it will be possible to go after assets that have already been hit by sanctions as well as those that have not. The class action will be a private case, independent of the Ukrainian state. But according to McCue, they will need access to Ukraine’s evidence and intelligence. The Ukrainian MP and businessman Serhiy Taruta is supporting the initiative by facilitating meetings for the lawyers and investigators with Ukrainian officials. Taruta, who is from Mariupol and had investments in the city, lost a large chunk of his business when Russia and its proxy forces took more than half of the Donbas region in 2014. This time he lost friends, colleagues and a cousin as Russia destroyed Mariupol while attempting to occupy it. “Ukrainians have waited 20 years for the prosecution of [Pavlo] Lazarenko, and now eight for MH17,” said Taruta, referring to a case against Ukraine’s former prime minister who embezzled millions, and to an ongoing case in The Hague over the downing of a Malaysian Airlines flight in 2014. “We need to develop a quicker mechanism [for compensation],” said Taruta. “The normal routes are too slow.” Ukraine has already begun prosecuting captured Russian soldiers for war crimes in criminal cases, and other war crime cases may later be tried in international courts. But claims for reparations for the war damage are trickier, and McCue said part of the idea behind speedily launching the case was because reparations on a state-to-state level are rarely possible. “Often when it gets to the negotiations, the issue of reparations is put to one side to focus on the sustainability of peace,” he said. According to Taruta, individuals who have suffered the loss of a loved one or property or who have been injured will be the primary recipients of the compensation, followed by state and local institutions, and only then businesses. He estimated the total potential claim could be no less than $1tn (£793.9bn). A number of teams of investigators have come on board to help the team find assets of businesspeople they believe to be complicit in Russia’s war effort. They include Bellingcat, which has been investigating the activities of the Wagner Group and other Russian private military contractors for some years. “We are closely monitoring the activity of Russia’s mercenary units in Ukraine,” said Christo Grozev, Bellingcat’s executive director. “We believe that a deep dive into the [Wagner Group’s] chain of command and its links to official Russian authorities would not only help bring justice for the victims and their families, but also will bring more public awareness and transparency on how Russia is conducting this war,” said Grozev. A key part of the case will involve pleading that Russia’s invasion is not just an aggressive war but also falls at least partially under the legal definition of terrorism, which would make it easier to go after assets. “All the legal teams from different countries are satisfied that we have what we need,” said McCue. “It’s very solid.” McCue has extensive experience in similar cases on a smaller scale, the first of which was won on behalf of victims of the 1998 Omagh bombing, in which four men were found liable for the bombing and ordered to pay compensation to families of the victims. “The evidence was with the police but nobody was prosecuting because of the peace process,” said McCue, who described how the families approached him. “So, we did a civil action, and we won, and we managed to take houses off two of them.” The Ukraine case, which is much bigger in scale, is likely to operate on similar principles, though it will be more focused on winning financial compensation for people who have suffered the loss of their loved ones, property or businesses. “The Omagh case wasn’t about money, it was about proving who did it. This case is about money,” said McCue. He conceded that there would be enormous work ahead to verify and rank cases and create a “victim hierarchy”, and that targeted figures were likely to work hard to move or cover up their assets. However, he said he believed the case had a good chance of succeeding. “What we know is that if we don’t do this, people are less likely to get something. This increases the chances,” he said."

The country is doggedly pursuing a path of neutrality, coupled with a policy of economic diversification designed to keep its unique culture and still relatively recent independence alive, according to Nomin Chinbat, its culture secretary. A Soviet satellite state until 1990, and heavily dependent on China as a market and conduit for its copper and coal exports, Mongolia has to tread carefully. It is three times the size of France but has a population of only 3.5 million, half of whom live in the capital, Ulaanbaatar. So far it has dodged a definitive position on Ukraine by abstaining in major UN votes. However, its governing Mongolian People’s party is attending briefings given by United Russia, the biggest party in Russia – which has been interpreted in Russia as support for the war. Doubtless all this is a disappointment to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, who spent four of his childhood years in the Mongolian town of Erdenet as the son of a Soviet mining specialist.    Nomin Chinbat and US deputy secretary of state, Wendy Sherman, visit the Choijin Lama Temple Museum in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, July 2021. Photograph: Byamba-Ochir Byambasuren/EPA   Chinbat, a graduate of the University of East Anglia, is a model of diplomacy when she points out the term ambassador was invented in Mongolia. “Abstaining was a decision that our country had to make because of our geopolitical location,” she said. “We have had very healthy and manageable relationships with our two neighbours, but we also have a third neighbour policy that allows us to develop a multi-pillar international relationships with other countries. “We have survived where we are, and our sovereignty has been respected by our neighbours. But democracy is what will keep us developing further.” Chinbat, who has been tasked with attracting foreign investment to her country – whether from film-makers, industrialists or tourists – said there had been a generational shift among Mongolians, over 60% of whom are under 35. The outlook of younger people, she said, is less defined by relations with the country’s neighbours and more by Mongolia’s own development. Nevertheless, if there is a prolonged war Mongolia’s ultimate political orientation may once again be up for grabs, especially if China and Russia genuinely form the long-discussed anti-western alliance, making it harder for Mongolia to play its two powerful neighbours off one another. One path for the country is to form the third part of a Russian-Chinese triangle, largely becoming a transport hub between the two superpowers, and supplier of raw materials, while the other option is to try to acknowledge the two countries’ economic importance, while exploiting Mongolia’s own mineral resources to diversify the economy and modernise. The visit in May of the UK Asia minister, Amanda Milling, is a sign that Britain and the US will try to coax it along the latter course.    Nomin Chinbat. Photograph: World Economic Forum   Some claim Mongolia in reality has already chosen the Sino-Russian option, since four days after the invasion it signed a memorandum of understanding to press ahead with the long-planned trans-Mongolian gas pipeline deal. This pipeline would increase Mongolia’s dependence on Russia by taking gas from Siberia’s Yamal fields and allowing Russia to transport gas originally destined for Europe to find a new market in China. As a landlocked country, its vulnerability to China has been exposed by the prolonged Chinese border closures caused by Covid, slowing a planned rise in Mongolian energy exports to Chinese ports due to be enabled by a network of new freight lines that will cut journey times by a third. Chinbat said the government had invested heavily in a wider economic policy of privatisation, tourism, climate and rural development policies, which will allow it to diversify its economy over the next 20 years. The plan needs to succeed: in April, young people took to the streets to protest against the impact of inflation on their lives. Once in charge of one of her country’s largest independent broadcasters, Chinbat said Mongolia would not backslide from democracy. “We have free media and democracy. It is one of the beauties of Mongolia: that we have this ability to have so much different media, from black and white to middle ground.” Chinbat acknowledged that Mongolia’s culture of ubiquitous citizen journalists operating in a society that is not particularly media literate could be frustrating, but said: “Media should be challenging – that is what I fought for in my period in the media industry. Democracy and freedom of speech keeps our society lively and upright.” A bigger problem Chinbat identified was keeping younger people committed to the nomadic lifestyle, when parents sometimes want to send their children to be educated in the city. Chinbat said that at the heart of the nomad mentality was a respect for nature, a skill to survive in extreme weathers and a neighbourliness that means doors are left open in case herdsmen get lost. Mongolian politicians will require all that tact and resourcefulness in the years ahead."

After nearly a month of wrangling, the European Union has agreed to a partial ban on Russian oil, with the aim of cutting off funding to the Kremlin’s war machine. According to the European Council president, Charles Michel, three-quarters of Russian oil imports will be immediately affected, rising to 90% by the end of the year. What countries have been exempted and why? The EU is banning seaborne oil immediately, which covers about two-thirds of Russian imports to the EU. Oil transported through the critical Druzhba (“friendship”) pipeline will be exempt from the ban, a key concession to Hungary, which is heavily dependent on Russian oil. The EU is confident most Russian oil flows will cease by the end of the year, because Germany and Poland, countries on the northern branch of Druzhba, have promised to forgo its supplies. Countries on the southern branch of the Soviet-era pipeline – Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – will benefit from the temporary exemption. When will the EU move to a complete oil embargo? That is not clear. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president who has been driving sanctions policy, promised the EU would discuss how to close the loophole “as soon as possible”. Hungary is seeking EU cash to retool its oil refineries that can only take Russian crude. Croatia also needs time to boost supplies to its northern neighbour through the Adria pipeline. EU leaders have avoided giving details on the end date of the exemption for central Europe. How will the embargo affect Russia’s war machine? The EU is paying Russia about €1bn (£850m) a day for oil and gas, an invaluable source of hard currency for the Kremlin in funding its war against Ukraine. A sharp cut in those financial flows deepens Russia’s economic problems in the long term. Some economists have warned, however, that it could have the perverse effect of helping Moscow in the short term, as Russia benefits from high prices. The EU’s lengthy discussions have also given Russia time to find alternative buyers. What will the impact be on consumers and businesses in Europe? Motorists and businesses will see higher prices at the pumps, as the embargo feeds into higher oil prices. Governments will find it even harder to manage the already soaring cost of living. After the announcement of the EU oil embargo, the price of a barrel of Brent crude hit $124.10 (£98.59), its highest level since March, although it dropped back a little in later trading. Oil prices have already risen more than 55% this year and are at their highest levels since 2008. Does the EU have more sanctions cards to play? Before the EU had even agreed on the oil embargo, some countries were already considering further sanctions against Russia’s biggest export: gas. Before the war, Russia supplied 40% of EU gas but EU leaders have promised to gradually phase this out. However, Ukraine’s most outspoken allies in the EU, Poland and the Baltic states, think the EU should now put an end date on Russian gas. That step is far from assured and will be even harder than talks on the unfinished oil embargo."

For many of us, it’s no longer a simple question | Ivan Philippov","“Ukrainians don’t have to pay!” I am trying to buy three shawarmas in a market in Tbilisi, Georgia, but the street vendor emphatically refuses to take my money. I try to explain, even though I was warned not to say this: “I am sorry, I am not Ukrainian, I am Russian.” The vendor looks at the Ukrainian flag pin on my lapel; he doesn’t believe me. Before 24 February, I never thought about what it means to be Russian. Now it’s all I think about. I was born in Moscow and, until recently, lived there all my life. But “I am Russian” would literally be the last thing I would answer to the question, “Who are you?” I am a father, I am a creative executive at a film company, a writer, a journalist, a podcaster, a friend … a Russian? Well, yes, but it’s just the name on a passport that I have, nothing else.   Related: Russians advance into largest city in Donbas still in Ukrainian hands   I grew up in the 1990s and 2000s, when people of my generation – or at least the people I knew – thought of themselves as citizens of the world. After my first year at university I hitchhiked across Europe. The only time I thought about my nationality was when I was had to apply for visas. I know, however, that this was ultimately down to privilege. Unlike my friends from Dagestan, Buryatia, Yakutia or North Osetia, I could afford not to think about my Russian identity. With a Slavic face and a Slavic name, I was not subject to the everyday chauvinism that saturates Russian society. I loved my country, but I never waved a Russian flag at a demonstration or publicly expressed my patriotism – it was just not something that people like me did. We thought about patriotism in terms of politics – if you care for your country you try to make it better. So I tried. For over a decade I went to all the opposition rallies, I protested against injustice. Like-minded people and I tried our best to make our country a better place. But I never fell for the patriotic mantras about how great Russia is or how great it used to be and should be again. Why should I be proud that the Soviet Union was the first country to launch a man into space? Yuri Gagarin or Sergei Korolev should be proud of that, it was their achievement, not mine. Why should I be proud that the Soviet Union won the great patriotic war? My grandfathers fought in it. The war broke them, but they won: they should be proud of that. I know they were. These achievements were certainly never part of my identity in the same way that they are for the “Putin majority”, my compatriots who build their sense of self on past victories to which they are associated only by an accident of birth. But now these questions do feel important to me. “I am Russian,” I repeat to the street vendor. “But you are with them?” he asks, nodding in the direction of my companions. Maria Belkina and Kirill Zhivoi are the people who run Tbilisi Volunteers – a movement that has already helped thousands of Ukrainian refugees in Georgia. Yes, I am with them. We had just finished buying a car full of supplies – food and hygiene products to be distributed among refugees in one of the Tbilisi Volunteers help centres. “I am with them – but I am Russian.” The day of the invasion – 24 February – is a day that will be forever seared into my memory. The enormity and the irrationality of the war was like a physical blow. In my carefully constructed social bubble, there wasn’t a single person who supported the war. We felt like leaves, scattered by a hurricane. We still feel like this. Some of us left Russia and some stayed. I left with the film director Kantemir Balagov. It was past midnight when we were sitting in the deserted food court of Istanbul airport, waiting for our flight to Yerevan, Armenia. Nursing a glass of water, Kantemir asked me: do you think we should stop speaking in Russian? Do we have to be ashamed of our language? That is probably the only question to which I have an unequivocal answer: “No!”   Related: Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 96 of the invasion   Let me try to explain. Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy both speak Russian, but their languages could not be more different. Zelenskiy’s Russian is passionate, emotional and vibrant – alive. The language of Russian propaganda is dead: a senseless pile-up of obscure bureaucratese. The great Russian director Andrey Zvyagintsev made a powerful film, Loveless, about an absence of love in everyday Russian life. The Russian that Putin and his cronies speak reflects this – it is deliberately un-alive. So no, we will never be ashamed of Russian: we speak a different language. It’s not quite the same with our passports. In the line to the border control in Istanbul, I overheard a conversation between a Ukrainian mother and daughter. They were standing right behind me – they were trying to fly back home to Kyiv. They left for a holiday in Turkey before the war and now they were going back to a world in which their grandmother was hiding in a bomb shelter and their father and brother had joined the territorial defence forces. I listened to their conversation and felt an overpowering sense of shame. My Russian passport burned like hot coal in my pocket. I don’t think I will be able to read any of my favourite Russian books or watch Russian films or TV shows that I loved any time soon. They all have has the same ending now: 24 February and the robotic voice of President Putin announcing his “limited military operation”. Bucha, Irpen, Hostomel, Mariupol … We will have to write new books and make new films. And, step by step, we will figure out what it means to be Russian now. Back in Tbilisi, I finally convince the vendor to take my money. “You don’t support the war, do you?” he asks me suspiciously. No, of course I don’t. How can anyone support this bloody madness? But while I am very much against the war and against Putin, I am Russian. For some reason, it is important for me to say that.

On Monday, Russian troops began to advance into Sievierodonetsk, the largest city in Donbas still held in Ukrainian hands. The city is important to the control of Luhansk, one of two provinces in Donbas. If it falls, that success – achieved at the cost of the city’s ruination and 1,500 civilian lives – will be viewed as grim vindication for Vladimir Putin’s decision to consolidate Russian forces in the region and bombard targets with artillery fire. There’s something else about the battle for Sievierodonetsk, though: while Russian tanks are moving into the centre of the city, they were not able to encircle it first. Cutting a city off from its supply lines to soften it up is brutally effective, as the siege of Mariupol indicated. So why hasn’t that happened here? For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, about a compelling explanation that could have much bigger consequences: Russia may be running out of tanks. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories  Energy | The European Union agreed to an embargo on most Russian oil imports after late-night talks in Brussels.

In depth: The chink in Russia’s armour    Destroyed Russian tanks and armoured vehicles laying beside a road on 25 May 2022 in Irpin, Ukraine. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images   Few assets of conventional warfare are more intimidating than the tank, and when Russia attacked Ukraine, its invasion force of around 1,500 (out of a total of about 2,800) was often judged to be among the most formidable in the world. Phillips O’Brien was never especially convinced by that analysis, and given the accuracy of his earlier assessments of Russian might – in January, he wrote that Russia “lacks the ability to mount sustained military operations and deploy a wide range of military forces at the same time” – it’s worth paying attention to his view of the current situation. So, what should we expect next in Ukraine? O’Brien believes that Russian advances have largely stalled because the country’s forces are running very short of tanks, and other armoured vehicles. It’s a view he laid out in a Twitter thread on Sunday, and which built on a piece for the Atlantic last week, based on evidence from the eastern Donbas region. I asked him how he reached that conclusion, and what it might mean. *** What are tanks supposed to do? Tanks are powerful, well-armoured, and move fast in open country. “They’re usually used to seize the land between cities quickly and surround an enemy,” O’Brien told me. “In Russian doctrine, you have these battalion tactical groups which are supposed to have maybe 10 tanks alongside 30 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) carrying the infantry.” The theory – dating back to the second world war – is that tanks allow you to punch a hole in the enemy lines and cut forces or a strategic target like a city off from supplies, softening them up before a final assault. All of that relies on effective air support to neuter the threat that enemy jets and drones pose to the progress of the armour on the ground. *** What’s happened in reality? Nothing which Vladimir Putin will be pleased to hear about. “When I look at Donbas, I don’t see the kind of breakthroughs which you would want to see in modern armoured warfare,” O’Brien said. “You want to get through the line and then exploit the situation by quickly encircling the enemy. What we’re seeing is that the Russians may make a hole in the line, but then they are stopped.” He points to the failure to encircle Sieverodonetsk, and declining numbers in Ukrainian claims of Russian tanks being destroyed. That could mean a change in Russian deployment or in Ukraine’s ability to attack them. But since at the same time the Russian machine has failed to break through after its artillery has softened the Ukrainian forces up, it is more likely to indicate that there are simply fewer tanks in the fight in the first place. While exact measures of the scale of the damage to Russian armour are hard to come by, Ukraine has claimed more than 1,300 Russian tanks have been destroyed. The lowest independent assessments are more than 700 destroyed or captured. The Pentagon, which does not appear to have made unrealistically high estimates so far, puts it at about 1,000 – a number which O’Brien thinks is “probably a safe bet”. “Those are vast losses,” O’Brien said. In its usually reliable defence intelligence update on Friday, the UK Ministry of Defence said that Russia was now moving 50-year-old T-62 tanks out of storage for deployment. “These tanks are antiquated,” O’Brien said. “The Russians don’t have nearly the frontline armoured capability that they had.” *** Why has that happened? The military doctrine that sees tanks as all-powerful is pretty out of date, as you might expect given its second world war foundations. There are many examples of videos that appear to show Russian tanks being destroyed by handheld missiles, some of which – like the British-manufactured Next-generation Light Anti-armour Weapon (NLAW) (pictured below held by a Ukrainian soldier shortly after destroying an armoured personnel carrier) – are designed to strike on top of the tank, where its armour is weakest.    A Ukrainian soldier holds a Next Generation Light Anti-tank Weapon (NLAW) that was used to destroy a Russian armoured personnel carrier in March. Photograph: Sergei Supinsky/AFP/Getty Images   Most importantly, Russia has failed to secure the air superiority which is a prerequisite of effective tank warfare – instead finding that Ukrainian planes and drones continue to be able to stop Russian tanks in their tracks. “They’re far more vulnerable than they need to be,” said O’Brien. “They’re not flying air patrols, or close air support. So they’re running into considerable defensive firepower.” *** How did Russia get itself into this position? Because it overestimated its prospects of air superiority, and underestimated the capacity of simple, cheap anti-tank systems to stop it in its tracks. If, as O’Brien has written, “we are witnessing in Ukraine the final war of 20th-century militaries”, we might be shocked that the Kremlin entered such a fight without a clear-eyed assessment of the likely risks – but “dictators on the whole have systems that tell them what they want to hear, and Putin has clearly done that”. As for the failure of analysts worldwide to spot the same flaw: “A lot of people fell for what we could call ‘the American trap’: because the US military was able to do something, people looked at other militaries, and just view it as a scaled-down version of the US. And that is not the case here. The Russian military is an entirely more deficient beast. The US can overwhelm an enemy with complex air systems and defeat their air defences, it still has the capacity to do these ‘break out’ operations. Russia just can’t.” *** What does it mean for the future of this war – and wars around the world? It’s obviously favourable to Ukraine if the tanks are failing, but as Russia’s grim progress in Sieverodonetsk indicates, it doesn’t signal an end to the fight. “If they’re bringing out obsolete equipment they probably can’t keep going with their current approach for that much longer,” said O’Brien. “The problem the Ukrainians then have is: can they drive the Russians back? I wouldn’t be surprised if we have a summer of ranged warfare, mostly – more attritional combat with both sides trying to destroy the other’s resources.” That’s why, as the Guardian’s defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh wrote yesterday, Ukraine has been pleading with its western allies for longer-range rocket systems. There is, meanwhile, a wider positive for those who fear Russia’s invasion signals a new era of military expansion around the world. “The one hopeful thing to come out of this is that this conflict demonstrates that going to war is really hard,” O’Brien said. “And it may be that militaries around the world look at it and realise that war is fraught with enormous new risks because of the power of cheaper forces. So maybe people will be less likely to take that risk in the future.” What else we’ve been reading  Guessing how many Tory MPs have submitted no-confidence letters in the prime minister is essentially a game of pin the tail on the donkey, but Katy Balls’ well-informed piece helps you peek from behind the blindfold a little.

160,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/30/eu-nears-compromise-agreement-for-partial-ban-on-russian-oil,2022-05-30T23:30:17Z,EU leaders agree to partial embargo of Russian oil imports,"The European Union has agreed to an embargo on most Russian oil imports after late-night talks at a summit in Brussels.
The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, hailed the deal as a “remarkable achievement”, after tweeting on Monday night that sanctions will immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports, “cutting a huge source of financing for its war machine”.
Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said the ban “will effectively cut around 90% of oil imports from Russia to the EU by the end of the year” because Germany and Poland had committed to renounce deliveries via a pipeline to their territory.
Michel added that the package also included removing access to Swift payments for Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank; banning three more Russian state-owned broadcasters; and further sanctions against “individuals responsible for war crimes in Ukraine”.
Von der Leyen called the agreement on a sixth sanctions package was “an important step forward” and said the bloc had agreed a “massive investment in renewable energy” in order to compensate for the diversifying away from Russian oil.
The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, later tweeted: “A landmark decision to cripple Putin’s war machine. Our unity is our strength.”
Volodymyr Zelenskiy had earlier appealed to EU leaders to show unity against Vladimir Putin. At a summit in Brussels, EU leaders had been attempting to find a way to placate the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has been holding up a deal on the latest sanctions against Putin’s war machine.
Under a compromise plan that was discussed at the summit, Russian oil transported through the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline for Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia would be exempt from the EU embargo.
In a press conference on Monday night, Michel acknowledged talk of a lack of European unity, adding: “I think that more than ever it is important to show that we are able to be strong, that we are able to be firm, that we are able to be tough in order to defend our values and our interests.”
Michel said the European Council and G7 was also ready to grant Ukraine €9bn to aid its post-war reconstruction and immediate liquidity needs. However, von der Leyen warned that Ukraine needed €5bn a month just to maintain basic services and “... to give Ukraine a fair chance to rise from the ashes”.
The EU had stalled over its latest sanctions against Russia for nearly four weeks since the Von der Leyen, proposed a complete ban on Russian oil by the end of the year.
Arriving at the summit, Orbán said “the pipeline solution is not bad” but insisted his country needed guarantees it could get oil from other sources if there was an “accident” at the Druzhba pipeline, which runs through war-torn Ukraine. In typically pugnacious style, Orbán attacked the commission for what he called its “irresponsible behaviour” and blamed it for creating a “difficult situation”.
The bloc has come under increasing criticism for slow progress in agreeing the latest sanctions package, the sixth, including from Zelenskiy, who addressed the gathering on Monday by video link.
Ukraine’s president called on leaders to end their disputes, which “only encourage Russia to put more pressure on you”, according to an extract of his speech published on Telegram.
The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said earlier he was confident there was a “good solution” on the oil embargo. Germany, along with Poland, has pledged to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Officials close to the talks say the decision of these two large economies to forgo oil from the northern leg of the Druzhba pipeline means the EU oil embargo would cover 93% of Russian oil supply by the end of the year.
As yet there is no end date on the exemption for the southern leg of Druzhba, covering Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, landlocked countries that are heavily dependent on Russian oil.
Latvia’s prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš, said he intended to warn his fellow leaders not to get “bogged down” in details. “The big picture is that we have to starve Russia, Moscow, of the funds to continue the war,” he said. “If each European country only thinks about itself then we will never move forward.”
Italy, the Baltic states, the Netherlands, Belgium and other countries that import oil on tankers had initial reservations about an exemption for pipeline oil that would give an advantage to those countries that can continue to import cheaper Russian oil. But there was growing willingness to accept an imbalance on the EU’s internal market to secure agreement on sanctions.

Beyond sanctions, EU leaders are expected to approve €9bn in emergency support for Ukraine, although there is no decision yet on whether the funds will be low-interest loans or non-repayable grants.
Ukraine will need hundreds of billions to rebuild destroyed schools, hospitals, residential buildings and infrastructure. The European Commission has proposed a jointly managed reconstruction body to be organised by Ukraine and the EU, with contributions from international institutions.
As EU talks went on, it emerged Russia would cut off gas supplies to the Netherlands on Tuesday, in the latest escalation of the energy payments row with the west. The Dutch-backed trader GasTerra revealed the move after the company refused to meet the Kremlin’s demand of paying Gazprom in roubles. About 15% of Dutch gas comes from Russia.
Some EU leaders are already talking about a seventh round of Russia sanctions targeting gas. But some argue the EU rushed too quickly into an oil embargo. “We talked about oil, under pressure from [the] Baltics and Poland before having done our homework,” a senior EU diplomat said. “Under the pressure of this war we have maybe taken some steps too soon and we are now facing the consequences.”

News channel BFMTV said in a statement it was “immensely saddened” to announce the death of Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, 32, who had worked for it for six years and was on his second tour of the conflict, adding that the journalist and cameraman was killed on the road to Lysychansk. “Our reporter was covering the ongoing war. He was the victim of shrapnel while following a humanitarian operation in an armoured vehicle on Monday,” the 24-hour news station said. “He was accompanied by his colleague, Maxime Brandstaetter, who was slightly injured during this strike, and their fixer, Oksana Leuta, who was unharmed.” Leclerc-Imhoff had been reporting from the easternmost Ukrainian-held city, which has come under intense attack from Russia. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the reporter “was in Ukraine to show the reality of the war. On board a humanitarian bus, alongside civilians forced to flee to escape Russian bombs, he was fatally shot. I share the pain of the family, relatives and colleagues of Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, to whom I send my condolences.” Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “A little more than a month ago I gave an interview to this very TV channel. It was my first interview to the French media during the full-fledged war. My sincere condolences to Frédéric’s colleagues and family. He became the 32nd media representative killed after February 24.” BFMTV said the tragedy “reminds us of the dangers faced by all journalists who have been reporting this conflict at the risk of their lives for more than three months now”. The Committee to Protect Journalists, an international media advocacy group, said over a dozen journalists had been killed while reporting on the Ukraine conflict. France’s new foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, has called for an investigation into Leclerc-Imhoff’s death. “France demands that a probe is carried out as soon as possible and in transparency on the circumstances of this drama,” she said in a statement. Luhansk’s regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said on Telegram that the armoured evacuation vehicle came “under enemy fire” as it went to collect 10 people from the area. There was no immediate comment from the Russian authorities, who have repeatedly denied targeting civilians in Ukraine. “Shrapnel from the grenades pierced the armour of the car … a fatal wound in the neck was received by an accredited French journalist who was making a report on the evacuation. A policeman on patrol was saved by a helmet,” Haidai said.  Andrei Marotchko, a spokesperson for the self-declared People’s Republic of Luhansk, told the Russian news agency Tass that it was unlikely Leclerc-Imhoff was a journalist and claimed could have been delivering arms to Ukrainian forces. “He is not presented just as a journalist, even the Ukrainian media say he was a volunteer,” Marotchko said. “We do not rule out him having carried arms and ammunition to the [Ukrainian] army positions. That’s why he met such a sad fate. I wouldn’t describe him as a journalist because all his activities were probably of another nature. “He could be described as a foreign mercenary. We can say with certainty he was an accomplice of the far-right Ukrainian forces because we have observed the kind of aid these volunteers deliver. They deliver arms and munition capable of killing civilians.” Efforts to evacuate civilians from the area were suspended after the death, which came as Russian tanks and troops began advancing into Sievierodonetsk – the largest city in the Donbas still held by Ukraine.  Witnesses said Russian tanks were advancing towards the centre of the city one blast at a time, razing everything in their path that remained after intense shelling that Ukrainian authorities have said has led to conditions on the ground reminiscent of Mariupol. “They [the Russian army] use the same tactics over and over again,” Haidai said. “They shell for several hours – for three, four, five hours – in a row and then attack. Those who attack die. Then the shelling and attack follow again, and so on until they break through somewhere.” Witnesses said the city was being bombed “200 times an hour” as Russian forces tried to cut off reinforcement lines and surround its remaining defenders. The city’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, confirmed in a telephone interview with the Associated Press that Russian troops had “advanced a few blocks towards the city centre”. He said Ukrainian forces were trying to push the Russians out in street fighting and that the 12,000-13,000 civilians left in the city were sheltering from the relentless bombardment in basements and bunkers. The battle for Sievierodonetsk, which lies on the eastern bank of the Siverskyi Donets, about 90 miles south of the Russian border, is in the spotlight as Russia grinds out slow but solid gains in the industrial Donbas, which comprises the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk. "

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said: “I share the pain of the family, relatives and colleagues of Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, to whom I send my condolences.” EU leaders failed to agree on a Russian oil import ban before the two-day summit in Brussels. While the leaders of the 27 countries will agree in principle to an oil embargo, the details of their draft conclusions are yet to be decided. Russia will stop supplying gas to the Netherlands as of tomorrow after the government-backed trader GasTerra refused to pay supplier Gazprom in roubles. About 44% of Dutch energy usage is based on gas, but only about 15% of Dutch gas comes from Russia, according to government figures. Russia is considering paying Eurobond holders by applying the mechanism it uses to process payments for its gas in roubles. The scheme would allow Moscow to pay bondholders while bypassing western payment infrastructure. Investors, however, said the move would not enable Russia to avoid a historic default on debt. In talks with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said if sanctions were lifted, then Russia could “export significant volumes of fertilisers and agricultural products”. The new US ambassador to Ukraine has arrived in Kyiv, the Guardian understands, a symbolic move after the US withdrew all diplomats from the country before the Russian invasion in February. The US president, Joe Biden, has said the US will not send Ukraine rocket systems that can reach into Russia. The comments followed reports that the Biden administration was preparing to send advanced long-range rocket systems to Kyiv. Russian troops have entered the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk. Regional governor Serhiy Gaidai has described the fighting as “very fierce”. Gaidai has also appeared on national television in Ukraine to say “Unfortunately we have disappointing news, the enemy is moving into the city.” “Some 90% of buildings are damaged. More than two-thirds of the city’s housing stock has been completely destroyed. There is no telecommunication,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a televised speech last night about the status of Sievierodonetsk. The “liberation” of the Donbas was an “unconditional priority” for Moscow, Russia’s foreign minister said on Sunday, adding that other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own. “The liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority,” Sergei Lavrov told French TV channel TF1. Lavrov also denied speculation that President Vladimir Putin is ill. Lavrov said that Putin, who will turn 70 in October, appeared in public “every day”. "

The White House has been weighing up pleas from Ukraine – which is losing ground in the battle for Donbas – for multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) to offset Moscow’s increasingly effective use of long-range artillery, amid Russian warnings that doing so would cross a red line.
“We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia,” Biden told reporters on Monday after arriving back at the White House after a weekend in Delaware.
The US-made MLRS comes in many different variants, which in turn use a variety of munitions. The longest range can fire missiles up to 185 miles away, but others use rockets with shorter ranges of 20 to 40 miles.

The precise meaning of Biden’s remark on Monday was unclear, but it was consistent with other briefings from the weekend that the White House was willing to provide MLRS as long as it withheld the longest-range missiles.
That was repeated on Monday. One senior US official said: “MLRS is under consideration, but nothing is on the table with long-range strike capabilities.”
The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev described Biden’s remarks as “reasonable” and warned that if his country’s cities had been struck, then Russian forces would “have struck at the centres of these criminal decisions”.
Ukraine appears close to losing the city of Sievierodonetsk, the easternmost city it had held in the Donbas region, amid a relentless Russian artillery barrage that has destroyed large parts of a city that had a prewar population of 100,000.







Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, acknowledged late on Sunday that “the entire critical infrastructure” and “more than two-thirds of the city’s housing stock” had been “completely destroyed”, as he asked for “more modern weapons to defend our land, to defend our people”.
Nick Reynolds, a land warfare specialist with the Rusi thinktank, said: “The disparity in artillery capability is a major factor allowing the Russian ground forces to continue pushing forwards.”
Russian firepower was preventing Ukraine’s forces from massing for counterattacks, the analyst said, adding that MLRS could help Kyiv by “disrupting all kinds of activity in enemy rear areas”.
Last week, Ukraine’s ministry of defence released a video of what it said was the shelling of its positions by Russian TOS-1A flamethrower rockets in the Donetsk area. “Ukraine is ready to strike back. To do this, we need Nato-style MLRS. Immediately,” the ministry’s Twitter feed said.
The M270 tracked MLRS, and its wheeled equivalent, the M142 high mobility artillery rocket system (HIMARS), have a far greater range than anything Ukraine can deploy at the moment. Using them could allow Kyiv to hit at Russian targets from further back, although it could expose more of its hinterland to retaliation.

Ukraine began the war with artillery such as Soviet-standard howitzers with a range of about 10 miles, before the US agreed to send 90 M777 Nato-standard artillery pieces to Ukraine. Depending on the shells used, M777s can have a range of up to 25 miles.

Other Nato members may follow the US lead. Ukraine has also been pressing the UK to supply some of its own M270s, with some sources complaining that Britain has been dragging its feet. The British M270 has a range of 52 miles, although 44 of the army’s stock are being upgraded to 93 miles.
Last Friday Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, said MLRS would enable the Ukrainians “to defend themselves against this very brutal Russian artillery, and that’s where the world needs to go”. His remarks, a public acknowledgment of Ukraine’s request, fuelling expectations an announcement could come within days.
Briefings from the US have suggested an announcement could come later this week, after Monday’s Memorial Day holiday."
164,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/30/rumours-continue-about-putins-health-with-little-to-back-them-up,2022-05-30T16:58:51Z,Rumours continue about Putin’s health – with little to back them up,"The rumours have spanned the gamut: Vladimir Putin is suffering from cancer or Parkinson’s disease, say unconfirmed and unverifiable reports, the Russian leader has survived a coup attempt or, as some tabloids think, he is already dead and has been replaced by a body double. Photographs of Putin meeting top aides are inspected in microscopic detail: is he gripping the table in pain during a meeting with defence minister Sergei Shoigu in late April? Is his puffy face a sign of steroid use, as former foreign secretary Lord Owen claimed in March? As Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its fourth month, reports suggest that Russia’s leader may be ill. But that may be just wishful thinking for Putin’s many critics, who appear ready to embrace conspiracy theories of divine vengeance or palace coups for his unrelenting assault on Ukraine. In an interview on Sunday, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was forced to deny speculation that Putin was ill or dying, as the diplomat continued to defend Russia’s assault on Ukraine. “President Vladimir Putin appears in public every day,” Lavrov said in an interview with French television. “You can watch him on screens, read and listen to his performances. I don’t think that sane people can see signs of some kind of illness or poor health.” He said he left reports of Putin’s poor health “on the conscience of those who spread such rumours”. On Monday, Putin spoke with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and chaired a meeting of his security council. Both meetings were held remotely, as the Kremlin leader continues his coronavirus isolation. Aides and world leaders who have met Putin but have not quarantined have been forced to sit at a long table, dozens of metres away from the president. Last week, Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said he believed that Putin was both seriously ill and that he had survived a recent coup attempt, saying only that the supposed attackers came from the Caucasus region. “He has several serious illnesses, one of which is cancer,” Budanov told Ukrainian outlet Ukrainskaya Pravda. “But it’s not worth hoping that Putin will die tomorrow.” He also claimed that a coup “will eventually lead to the change of leadership of the Russian Federation. This process has already been launched.” A former Soviet spy has claimed that Putin has Parkinson’s disease, while New Lines Magazine claimed to have obtained a recording of an oligarch saying Putin is “very ill with blood cancer”. Neither of the reports have been confirmed. One report from the Proekt investigative website said that Putin is believed to have thyroid cancer or another disease. The report was based on leaked travel documents that showed that Putin had received regular visits from an oncologist and from two otolaryngologists, whom the outlet said would often make a first diagnosis of a thyroid condition. The Kremlin has not confirmed any reports about Putin being sick, saying that the Russian leader is in excellent health. Dmitri Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, called it a “fabrication and untruth”. Rumours of Putin suffering from illness and injury have stretched back for more than two decades and are, to a certain degree, the fault of the Kremlin for closely guarding information about Putin’s health and whereabouts. Since taking power, Putin has been portrayed as an active sportsman to contrast with the image of Boris Yeltsin as a heavy drinker whose poor health made him an even poorer leader. But Putin has disappeared for weeks at a time in the past, amid reports of sporting injuries from ice hockey and judo. He recently told an interviewer that he had fallen off a horse early in his presidency as well. The Kremlin has regularly used pre-filmed reports, often called “conserves”, to make it appear that Putin is in meetings when he is in fact unaccounted for. One extended absence took place during the coronavirus outbreak, when Putin claimed to be in Moscow while reports said he was in Sochi, occasionally appearing in an identical office as if in Moscow. Since the beginning of the war, some reports have focused specifically on Putin’s pained body language, suggesting that he may have some back problems. A bulky frame has been explained alternatively as the president wearing a back corset or some kind of body armour when in public. Those rumours gained steam when Putin noticeably grimaced during a meeting with Shoigu in late April. Putin will turn 70 in October and the focus on his health is likely to continue as he ages. But Budanov said he believed that Putin “still has at least a few years left. Whether we like it or not, that’s the truth.”"

Witnesses said Russian tanks were advancing towards the centre of the city one blast at a time, razing everything in their path that remains after intense shelling that Ukrainian authorities have said has led to conditions on the ground reminiscent of Mariupol. “Unfortunately we have disappointing news: the enemy is moving into the city,” the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Gaidai, told Ukrainian national television on Monday. The Russian army “use the same tactics over and over again. They shell for several hours – for three, four, five hours – in a row and then attack. Those who attack die. Then the shelling and attack follow again, and so on until they break through somewhere.” The battle for Sievierodonetsk, which lies on the eastern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, about 90 miles south of the Russian border, is in the spotlight as Russia makes slow but solid gains in the industrial Donbas, which comprises the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Witnesses said the city was being bombed “200 times an hour” as Russian forces try to cut off reinforcement lines and surround its remaining Ukrainian defenders.  Interactive  The city’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, confirmed in a telephone interview with the Associated Press that Russian troops had “advanced a few blocks towards the city centre”. He said Ukrainian forces were fighting to push the Russians out in street fighting and that the 12,000-13,000 civilians left in the city were sheltering in basements and bunkers to escape relentless bombardment. Local authorities estimated that 1,500 civilians had already died in Russian attacks on Sievierodonetsk, including from a lack of medicines. Striuk said the city had “been completely ruined” and that the number of victims was “rising every hour, but we are unable to count the dead and the wounded amid the street fighting”. Relentless Russian artillery barrages have destroyed critical infrastructure and damaged 90% of the buildings, and power and communications have been largely cut to a city that was once home to 100,000 people. A French journalist was killed after an armoured humanitarian evacuation vehicle in which he was travelling was hit by shrapnel from a Russian shell in Sievierodonetsk. According to local authorities, shrapnel pierced the vehicle’s armour, killing Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff as he travelled alongside civilians forced to flee Russian bombs. The evacuation was called off after the attack. Having failed to take the national capital, Kyiv, in the early phase of the war, Russia is seeking to consolidate its grip on Donbas, large parts of which are already controlled by Moscow-backed separatists. It has concentrated huge firepower on a small area – in contrast to the earlier phase of the conflict, when its forces were often spread thinly – bludgeoning towns and cities with artillery and airstrikes. “They don’t care how many lives they will have to pay for this,” said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his latest national address, referring to Russian forces in the region. Russia has also stepped up its efforts to take the neighbouring city of Lysychansk, where, according to Gaidai, a Russian shell fell on a residential building over the weekend, killing a child. The two cities sit on either side of the strategically important Siverskyi Donets River. According to Ukrainian officials, Lysychansk is still under Ukrainian control, while the main road into the two cities has been shelled, but not blocked. The last remaining access and evacuation route, leading south-west towards the town of Bakhmut, remains under Ukrainian control.  Interactive  The Ukrainian defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Ukrainian troops were doing all they could to prevent Russian forces from completely encircling Sievierodonetsk, which if it fell could help Moscow to consolidate its grip on the Donbas – large parts of which were controlled by Moscow-backed separatists before the 24 February invastion. “The liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority,” Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, told the French TV channel TF1, adding that other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own. Russian forces are also regrouping to resume their offensive further west in the direction of the Sloviansk region of eastern Ukraine, Motuzyanyk said. “In Sloviansk, the enemy is regrouping to resume attacks in the direction of Izyum-Barvinkove and Izyum-Sloviansk,” he told a briefing. In the south of the country, the Russian-appointed mayor of occupied Melitopol said two civilians had been wounded by an explosion that she blamed on Ukraine. No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion, which Halyna Danylchenko denounced as a “cynical terror attack by the Kyiv regime” in remarks broadcast by Russian state television. Meanwhile, the fate of the the last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the smashed Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, who surrendered on 20 May, hangs by a thread. According to Yuri Sirovatko, a pro-Moscow separatist official and justice minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk people’s republic (DNR) in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian fighters may face the death penalty. “The court will make a decision about them,” Sirovatko was quoted as saying by the RIA Novosti news agency. “For such crimes we have the highest form of punishment in the DNR – the death penalty. “All the prisoners of war are on the territory of the DNR,” he said, adding that there were about 2,300 soldiers from Azovstal among them."

A career diplomat who served as US ambassador to Slovakia until recently, Bridget Brink was nominated by President Joe Biden in late April and confirmed unanimously by the US Senate on 18 May. Brink confirmed her arrival in Kyiv with a tweet noting that she had visited the foreign ministry to present her credentials. “Our first priority is to help Ukraine defend itself,” she wrote.  The US embassy evacuated all family members and non-essential staff in January and moved operations to Lviv in western Ukraine in mid-February. Immediately before the Russian invasion, the diplomats moved again, to Rzeszów in Poland. At the time, the Americans were criticised in some quarters for their departure, with widespread scepticism inside Ukraine and in other European capitals over the apocalyptic warnings coming from US and British intelligence that Russia was preparing for full-scale war. In the end, almost all western diplomats left Kyiv, either before or immediately after Russia launched its invasion. Since the Russian army was pushed away from the region around Kyiv at the end of March, small teams of diplomats have been slowly returning. The British ambassador arrived at the end of April. The US embassy restarted limited operations in Kyiv two weeks ago. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, called the reopening a “momentous step”, in a statement after the American flag was raised at the embassy on 18 May. The skeleton US diplomatic presence that has returned to Kyiv is mainly locked down at the embassy, a large compound in the suburbs. Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported the Pentagon was considering deploying special forces operatives to guard the embassy. When Brink presents her credentials to Zelenskiy it will mark the first time the US has had a full-fledged ambassador to Ukraine in three years, after the departure of Marie Yovanovitch in 2019, who was recalled by Donald Trump and became embroiled in the scandal over Trump associates attempting to pressure Zelenskiy to investigate the activities of Biden’s son in Ukraine. During the buildup to Russia’s invasion, the US embassy was headed by a chargé d’affaires, Kristina Kvien."

This is despite Europe pouring about $1bn a day into Russia to pay for the gas and oil it continues to consume. This seems crazy. Proposals by the EU to halt the payments are understandably being opposed by countries close to Russia and heavily dependent on its fossil fuels; Germany buys 12% of its oil and 35% of its gas from Russia, figures that are much higher in Hungary. The EU in Brussels seems not to know what to do. A diplomatic compromise has been raised – exempting sanctions on imports via pipeline, which would spare Hungary and Germany – but no practical plan has been agreed. The real reason is that arguments over the sanctions weapon have been reduced to macho rhetoric. They are supposed to induce a foreign regime to change some unacceptable policy. This rarely if ever happens, and in Russia’s case it has blatantly failed. Apologists now claim that sanctions are merely a deterrent, intended to work in the medium to long term. As war in Ukraine shifts into a different gear, that term could be long indeed.   Related: Russia-Ukraine war live: US will not send long-range rocket systems to Kyiv; journalist among civilians killed in Sievierodonetsk   Sanctions may have harmed Russia’s credit-worthiness, but the 70% surge in world gas prices alone has supercharged its balance of payments. Its current account trade surplus, according to its central bank, is now over three times the pre-invasion level. At the same time, sanctions are clearly hurting countries in western and central Europe who are imposing them.  It is absurd to expect Hungary to starve itself of energy and, as it says, “nuclear bomb” its economy, with no fixed objective or timetable in sight. Sanctions have an awful habit of being hard to dismantle. Worse is to come. Russia’s reaction to sanctions has been to threaten to cut off gas to Europe, further driving up prices to its advantage. It is already blockading the Black Sea ports, from which millions of tons of Ukrainian grain are normally shipped to the outside world. This blockade has seen cereal prices rise 48% on their 2019 base, devastating markets, particularly across Africa. This in turn has increased the value of Russia’s own massive grain exports. Russia has offered to lift the blockade if sanctions are lifted. Whether it means this is moot, but the west cannot be blind to the unintended consequence of its sanctions war. Nato has been sensibly scrupulous in not escalating the war in Ukraine into a Europe-wide conflict. Sanctions know no such subtlety. Millions of innocent people across Europe and far from its shores will suffer as food and energy prices soar. Supply lines are disrupted. Trade links collapse. The victims are overwhelmingly the poor. The objective – to compel Russia to withdraw its forces from Ukraine – has patently not been achieved. Military aid has been far more effective in that respect. But the harm done to the rest of Europe and the outside world is now glaring. The EU should stick to helping Ukraine’s war effort and withdraw economic sanctions against Russia. They are self-defeating and senselessly cruel. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"

It is composed in largely static tableau shots, many of them featuring windows, windscreens and other partitions, implying both the estranged unreality of the conflict taking place so close to civilised life, as well as an elusive redemption sought by the film’s characters. The first window gets covered in multicoloured splatters at the paintballing birthday party of Polina (played by Nika Myslytska, Vasyanovych’s daughter), child of Serhiy (Roman Lutskyi), a Ukrainian surgeon. It’s a playful allusion to nearby warfare, which Serhiy discusses with Andriy (Andriy Rymaruk), the current partner of his ex-wife Olha (Nadia Levchenko). But when the two men head out to the frontline, they run into a Russian checkpoint and are captured. Serhiy is tortured by fists and electrodes, then forced to assist in the brutalisation of other Ukrainians – including Andriy – by checking their vital signs to see if they are still alive.    These scenes, which contain one of Reflection’s few bursts of camera movement as Serhiy is frogmarched into the bowels of the security outpost, thrust us into a harrowing abyss. Serhiy contemplates suicide in his cell, helps load corpses into an incinerator in the back of a truck marked “Russian humanitarian aid” and is finally forced into a terrible predicament regarding Andriy. Vasyanovych’s unwavering style is the cinematic equivalent of having your eyes prised open, which gives his film the kind of unrelenting horror of Come and See.   Related: 20 of the best films to help understand what’s happening in Ukraine   The tableau method arguably weighs Reflection down a little in its second half, as Serhiy adjusts to civilian life, but Vasyanovych lets some metaphysical light filter through. While Serhiy is reconnecting with his daughter, a pigeon is killed as it flies into his apartment window; the ghostly smear it leaves behind, like an imprint of a soul, symbolises all at once the missing Andriy, the difficulty of forgetting, and a state of grace that may still exist in the world. Hauntingly enigmatic in its storytelling, even with the highly controlled formalism, Reflection is both a shaken outcry for Ukraine and subdued declaration that hope still lies beyond. • Reflection is available on 2 June on the BFI Player."

Kira Rudik, the leader of the opposition liberal Golos party, said she was afraid of the three-month long war “becoming the new normal” and that the west would not supply the Nato-standard weapons Ukraine needed to push back the invaders. “One bad outcome is that this war becomes a stalemate, like a long-term frozen conflict,” Rudik said in an interview with the Guardian. “One of our goals is to make sure that the world does not get used to a war being in Ukraine.” The MP argued that Ukraine’s “first and foremost need is weapons” because without battlefield success Kyiv would come under pressure to give up territory to Russia, as suggested by the veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger – a suggestion Rudik said was “borderline … how do I not say the word stupid?”. The 36-year-old said she was in daily contact with frontline troops and conceded Ukraine’s military was “not fine; they are under a lot of pressure” as Russian forces advance under heavy shelling in the eastern Donbas region. “We should not repeat Russia’s mistake of underestimating us. We should not underestimate Russia right now,” Rudik said. It remained possible that as well a deadlock, Ukraine could yet be more seriously defeated, she added. Ukraine’s army needed multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) with a range of hundreds of kilometres, Rudik argued, which are already the subject of intense lobbying by Kyiv – and which could be supplied by the US and others within days. “We need to let our soldiers on the front fight better and for that we need MLRS systems, longer-range systems,” Rudik said. “We know that there is like no peaceful agreement on this conflict. We will need to win it militarily.”  Capable of firing 12 rockets in a minute, Ukraine believes the US-made M270 MLRS could turn around Kyiv’s fortunes, with Russia currently outshelling it and, under the heavy bombardment, closing in on Sievierodonetsk. But the rocket artillery is controversial not least because it would give Ukraine the capacity to reach inside Russia. That has prompted warnings from Moscow that a US decision to supply the systems would “cross a red line”. Rudik is in the UK for a few days where she is meeting MPs in London and Scotland, including Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, part of her first trip abroad since the war began on 24 February. On the second day of the war Rudik was pictured holding a Kalashnikov rifle, saying she was prepared to use it to defend Kyiv. “Our women will protect our soil the same way as our men,” she wrote in a tweet that was picked up around the world.  I learn to use #Kalashnikov and prepare to bear arms. It sounds surreal as just a few days ago it would never come to my mind. Our #women will protect our soil the same way as our #men. Go #Ukraine! 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/UbF4JRGlcy— Kira Rudik (@kiraincongress) February 25, 2022  The MP said she did not have to use the weapon as Russian forces bore down on Kyiv in the first weeks of the war, but insisted she remained willing to do so if necessary, not least because of the sexual violence the invaders had inflicted on Ukrainian women and girls in occupied suburbs north-east of the capital. “I have been to Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka since the days of the occupation and I have talked to women who suffered from sexual crimes,” she said. “Honestly, this is probably one of the parts [reasons] why I have the rifle.”"

Within Europe, 55% of those surveyed for the Alliance of Democracies said they were in favour of cutting economic ties with Russia due to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, whereas in Asia there was a majority against, and in Latin America opinion was evenly split.  Negative views of Russia are largely confined to Europe and other liberal democracies. Positive views of Russia have been retained in China, Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam, Algeria, Morocco, Malaysia, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The annual Democracy Perception Index, carried out after the invasion of Ukraine, covers 52 highly populated countries in Asia, Latin America, the US and Europe. Majorities in a total of 20 countries thought economic ties with Russia should not be cut due to the war in Ukraine. They included Greece, Kenya, Turkey, China, Israel, Egypt, Nigeria, Indonesia, South Africa, Vietnam, Algeria, the Philippines, Hungary, Mexico, Thailand, Morocco, Malaysia, Peru, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia. Colombians were evenly split. By contrast, among the 31 countries that favoured cutting ties, 20 were in Europe. Although Russian diplomats will point to the findings as evidence that global public opinion does not share western interpretations of events in Ukraine, the level of distrust of Russia in some countries was high. The countries with a widely held most negative view of Russia included Poland (net negative 87%), Ukraine (80%), Portugal (79%), Italy (65%), UK (65%), Sweden (77%), US (62%) and Germany (62%). Even in Hungary – whose leader Viktor Orbán is an ally of Putin – a net 32% have a negative view of Russia. In Venezuela, often seen as propped up by Russia, the local population has a net negative view of Russia of 36%. Countries with a net positive view of Russia included India (36%) Indonesia (14%), Saudi Arabia (11 %), Algeria (29%), Morocco (4%), and Egypt (7%). Despite the mixed views about Russia, strong sympathy was shown for Ukraine. Most people surveyed in Asia, Latin America and Europe thought Nato, the US and the EU could do more to help Ukraine. In Latin America, 62% of respondents thought Nato has done too little and only 6% too much. In Europe 43% said Europe has done too little and 11% too much. In China, 34% said the US has done too much to help. Nearly half (46%) globally said that the European Union, United States and Nato were doing too little to assist Ukraine, while 11% said they are doing too much. Negative perceptions of China are not as widespread as for Russia. British respondents were the most likely to want to cut economic ties with China if it invaded Taiwan. "

The 44-year-old dreaded the day he knew would surely come, when the body of someone he was close to was brought in. But he was not prepared for it to be someone he knew so well. “It was the body of a dear friend and wife of one of my best mates,” Fenenko said in an interview at the weekend, bursting into tears at the memory. “The car she was driving hit a landmine as she was trying to flee a village where she lived near Chernihiv, which had been occupied by the Russians.”    Yurii Fenenko, 44, inside his lab. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian   Before the war, Fenenko examined an average of four bodies a day – mostly people who had died from disease, or occasionally in a car accident or gun violence. Everything changed when Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, and Russian forces advancing from Belarus began bombarding the city. By 10 March Chernihiv was encircled by Russian forces, trapping its 150,000 inhabitants. Now Fenenko was examining up to 15 bodies a day. “At first no one understood what was going on”, he said. “It was scary, you didn’t know what to expect. Then after a few days the first bodies started to turn up in our lab. And the numbers grew day by day.”    Bodybags being loaded on to a refrigerated truck after the local morgues of Chernihiv and Kyiv had no more space for the dead. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian   Space ran out in Chernihiv’s morgues, which are designed to hold 30 bodies, and corpses piled up in refrigerated trucks. Fenenko carried out his work in a room without electricity because of the bombing. A diesel generator provided dim light. “Before the war, I had seen bodies completely torn apart by accidental explosions,” he said. “But never in such numbers.” Fenenko’s postmortem reports are being forwarded to prosecutors investigating alleged war crimes perpetrated by Russian forces in Ukraine. “Among the signs of torture, we found hands tied behind the back from bodies of people living in the Russian occupied villages, blindfolded, the limbs shot through,” he said. “Another time a missile hit a queue of people standing outside a grocery store. Thirty people were killed that day and they were all brought to my lab.” Fenenko has extracted hundreds of projectiles and shrapnel from bodies, but also cluster bomb fragments, explosives which are designed to release dozens of smaller bombs, called submunitions, over a wide area. Cluster bombs are banned under international law by a 2008 treaty signed by more than 100 countries. “You see these little cylinders? They come from a cluster bomb,” he said. “I found them in civilians’ bodies. Some of them explode when they hit the ground and some of them in the air. That’s why they hit lots of people.” Fenenko said the most unusual thing he had found in bodies was probably fléchettes – small metal darts contained in tank or field gun shells. Each shell can contain up to 8,000 fléchettes. Once fired, shells burst when a timed fuse detonates and explodes above the ground. Once released from the shell, they disperse in a conical arch about 300m wide and 100m long. On impact with a victim’s body, the dart can lose rigidity, bending into a hook, while the arrow’s rear, made of four fins, often breaks away causing a second wound.

Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian   Early in April, Ukrainian forces liberated dozens of villages occupied by the Russians. At the end of the siege, more than 700 bodies were recovered from the Chernihiv region. Before abandoning the villages, the Russians placed thousands of mines that continue to cause injuries and deaths, while every day Ukrainian authorities find more bodies buried in the rubble. As a coroner with over twenty years of experience, Fenenko said he had learned to put his emotions aside before starting an autopsy, but on the day police delivered the body of his old friend to his lab, it wasn’t possible. “Fortunately, that day, there were two other experts working with me. So I let them perform the autopsy,” he said. “I just couldn’t do it.” Artem Mazhulin contributed to this report"

It blew out the glass from his windows. Three more missiles fell on a neighbouring plot but didn’t explode. “I was on my land when the invasion started. The Russians think we are slaves. But our guys are going to kick them out,” Shumeyko predicted. In the meantime, the 42-year-old farmer acknowledged his industry is facing a heap of war-related problems. The biggest is what to do with this season’s crop, currently growing on his 1,000-hectare estate. The wheat is due to be harvested in late June and July. Next come sunflowers in August and September. Before Russia’s offensive, Shumeyko would load the grain on to a truck. It would be transported 15 miles from his village of Velykyi Dalnyk to Odesa, Ukraine’s biggest commercial port. From there, food products continued their journey by ship across the Black Sea. Ukraine’s grain helped feed an estimated 400 million people. It went to Egypt, Tunisia and beyond.    Local farmer Igor Shumeyko says he is running low on fertiliser, which used to arrive through Odesa. Photograph: The Guardian   Since 24 February, however, this maritime traffic has entirely ceased. Russia has blockaded and occupied all of Ukraine’s seaports. It has seized Mariupol and Berdiansk on the Sea of Azov, which is now a de facto Russian lake, and overrun Snake Island, a strategic base, allowing it to control shipping to and from the Dardanelles strait. Ukraine can no longer export its agricultural produce. About 22m tonnes of food is stuck. Many farmers say they have no space to store this summer’s harvest. Others are building makeshift shelters. Shumeyko says he is running low on fertiliser, which used to arrive through Odesa. His last sacks of ammonium nitrate are stored next to his red tractor. The UN World Food Programme has warned that millions of people will die if Ukraine’s ports remain blocked. Vladimir Putin has offered to open up a sea corridor but only if the west lifts what he calls “politically motivated” sanctions. He accuses Ukraine of mining its ports. Kyiv says Moscow is guilty of blackmail, with the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, calling on the world to act.  Sanctions on Russia have no connection to the unfolding global food crisis. The sole reason for shortages, rising prices, and threat of hunger is the Russian military physically blocking 22 million tons of Ukrainian food exports in our seaports. Demand Moscow to end its blockade.— Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) May 28, 2022  The topic is now at the top of the international agenda. In a phone call on Saturday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor Olaf Scholz tried to persuade Putin to lift the blockade, without success. In his nightly video address on Saturday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he discussed the crisis with Boris Johnson, as well as the related issue of military aid. The Ministry of Defence points out that Ukraine has deployed maritime mines “because of the continued credible threat of amphibious Russian assaults from the Black Sea”. It says Moscow is falsely trying to present itself as a “reasonable actor”. In reality, it is leveraging global food security in order to advance its “political aims” and “to blame the west for any failure”.

He has suggested Turkey and the UK send vessels to enforce a waterways equivalent of a “no-fly zone” in the north-west Black Sea. “We need to unblock it militarily,” he said. “Ukraine is an agricultural superpower,” he added. “This is our number one problem. It’s a question of the country’s survival. Without the grain, the economy will stop and die out. This isn’t just about us. It’s about the global situation. We are talking about hunger of huge proportions here.”    Village mayor and farmer Denis Tkachenko wants the blockade lifted and believes Putin won’t attack English ships. Photograph: Luke Harding/The Guardian   On Saturday, the head of Velykyi Dalnyk, Denis Tkachenko, met with other Odesa region mayors to discuss the blockade. There were no simple answers. Belarus, the Kremlin’s ally, is unlikely to facilitate road shipments without the lifting of western sanctions. Poland uses a different track gauge to Ukraine, making railway transport expensive. The Russians, meanwhile, have twice fired cruise missiles at the bridge over the Dniester estuary in Zatoka, in the Odesa region, closing off a vital land route to the south-west and Romania. One small-scale solution is to take the grain to the Ukrainian port of Izmail on the Danube river. But this is costly for farmers at a time when diesel prices are going up. “It used to be easy. Odesa had big traffic. It was Ukraine’s main port,” Tkachenko said. He described a tentative UK-Turkish plan to create a humanitarian sea corridor as “realistic”, adding: “Putin won’t attack English ships.” His 100-hectare farm grows wheat, sunflowers and strawberries, he said, irrigated by water taken from the Dniester through a network of Soviet-era canals. In Odesa, the harbour is eerily quiet. The Ukrainian army has sealed off the port area. There are sandbags and checkpoints in the city’s historic centre, with its statue of Catherine the Great, Odesa’s imperial founder. The Potemkin steps – made famous by the Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein in his 1925 film Battleship Potemkin – are no longer accessible to the public.

Photograph: Loop Images/Universal Images Group/Getty Images   Russia’s apparent plan to storm Odesa from the sea has not yet happened. In the meantime, life continues. Couples, dog-walkers and kids on scooters go up and down Primorsky Boulevard, which overlooks the port. Swifts screech in the sky; the air is heady with the scent of elderflower blossom; a Pushkin statue has the inscription “Odesa resident”. Taking in the harbour view, the Odesa city council deputy, Peter Obukhov, pointed to a row of giant steel cylinders. These, he explained, were grain silos, filled to capacity. The cranes next to them were idle. Nearby was a rusting three-masted sailing ship, Druzhba, and an ancient ferry. The Black Sea sparkled in the sunshine. It was tranquil and boatless. The state-owned port and private tug company are the biggest employer in Odesa, with a workforce of 5,000 people. Their salaries contribute to the city’s budget. “It’s very difficult to transfer last year’s harvest by road. We need to lift the blockade,” Obukhov said. He added: “Even if Putin died and the war stopped, it would take half a year to ship the grain we already have.” The Russians have fired long range missiles at Odesa on several occasions. But it has been spared the destruction meted out to other Russian-speaking Ukrainian cities including Mariupol and Kharkiv. One explanation is the Kremlin thinks it enjoys some local support – a view not borne out by polling data and by non-scientific conversations conducted by the Guardian. Odesa’s mayor, Gennadiy Trukhanov, has dumped his previous Russian-friendly position and is now a Ukrainian patriot. According to Obukhov, who ran against Trukhanov, Moscow still plans to capture Odesa and to create a land corridor stretching to Transnistria, a breakaway pro-Russian republic of Moldova. “Putin wants everything. The whole of Ukraine and Moldova as well,” Obukhov said. In the first days of the invasion, Russian troops advancing from Crimea captured large chunks of southern Ukraine. They include the agricultural heartlands in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Kyiv says Moscow has stolen grain from local producers as well as farming equipment and agri-drones. Satellite photos suggest thousand of tonnes have been loaded on to ships in Crimea and sold abroad, including to Syria.    A satellite image shows a ship loading grain at the port of Sevastopol. Photograph: Maxar Technologies/Reuters   Hennadiy Lahuta, the head of Kherson’s Ukrainian military administration, said some farmers were cooperating with Russia. Others are not planting or are unable to plant because of fighting. “What can be said for sure is that the Russians are transporting food and grain from the Kherson region. Traffic jams on the road to Crimea are already several kilometres long,” he said last week.   Related: ‘Fortress Odesa’: city falls silent as fearful residents await Russian advance   This theft has painful historical echoes. In 1932-33, about 4 million people died as a result of Stalin’s state-engineered famine in Ukraine. Teams of Communist party enforcers went to villages and individual houses, confiscating grain, seeds, cows and vegetables. Peasants starved to death. The famine – known as the Holodomor – had a political aspect. It was designed to wipe out support for Ukrainian independence. Back in Velykyi Dalnyk, Shumeyko said he would sell his wheat and vegetables on the domestic market. It was a contribution to the war effort. He said he enjoyed his job, which involved spending time outdoors amid a blooming landscape of fields, swallows and wild roses. “A good harvest requires professionalism and protecting crops. When you bring it in, you get a great feeling in your soul.”"

Senior EU diplomats holding a special meeting on Sunday were deadlocked over a compromise plan that would see the bloc ban Russian oil arriving in tankers but allow pipeline imports, a proposal that would allow Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to continue being supplied via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline that runs through Ukraine.  More than three weeks after the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, proposed a complete ban on Russian oil imports by the end of the year, the EU is stalled on the plans. Hungary, which is heavily dependent on Russian oil, has said it needs five years and billions of euros to upgrade its refineries. The row threatens to overshadow a summit of EU leaders in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday, formally dedicated to discussing economic, political and humanitarian support for Ukraine and the crisis in global food supplies. EU ambassadors will meet on Monday morning in a fresh attempt to find a compromise on the oil embargo. “It might not work, it might work, but I think we have a duty to try it,” a senior EU official said. Excluding pipelines from EU sanctions would protect one-third of Russian oil that comes to the bloc, preserving a valuable source of revenue for Moscow.  Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is due to address EU leaders via video link on Monday, criticised the bloc last week for its failure to come to an agreement on the oil embargo. “Look at the number of weeks the European Union has been trying to agree on a sixth package of sanctions against Russia,” he said on Thursday, noting that the EU was paying Russia nearly €1bn (£850m) a day for energy. “Where did those who block the sixth package get so much power?”  When the idea of excluding pipeline oil was floated weeks ago, several member states shot it down on the grounds that it gave an unfair advantage to countries that can continue getting cheap Russian crude. Internal estimates suggest Hungary could benefit from oil 35% cheaper than neighbouring countries. After weeks of stalemate, however, a growing number of countries are looking for ways to break the deadlock. “To have no agreement or drag things further would be the worst, but to see blackmailing consequences is also disappointing,” a senior EU diplomat said. The issue has deepened the wedge between Hungary and its traditional central European allies. A senior Polish diplomat said they could not understand the logic of Budapest’s policy on Ukraine and described opposition to the oil embargo as political rather than technical. “They have received everything that is technically reasonable,” they said. Hungary has been offered a two-year delay in introducing the oil embargo to allow time to retool refineries and establish new oil routes from its southern neighbour Croatia. Some advise against rushing into a hasty deal as the proposed oil embargo was not envisaged to come completely into force until the end of the year. Others feel the delay sends a terrible political signal as Russian forces appear to be gaining the upper hand in Donbas through relentless artillery fire and airstrikes. Hungary further angered some EU states when it said the question should not even be discussed at the summit on Monday. “It would only highlight our internal divisions without offering a realistic chance to resolve differences,” Orbán wrote last week to the European Council president, Charles Michel, who is organising the meeting. Budapest is angling for EU funds to upgrade its refineries, which can currently only take Russian oil. Orbán complained that there were not enough specifics on EU funds for landlocked central European states in a recent European Commission plan outlining how the EU can move away from Russian fossil fuels. In that plan, known as RePowerEU, the commission made a controversial proposal to allow member states to sell surplus carbon credits that could make it cheaper to burn fossil fuels. It also suggested a voluntary transfer of funds from other parts of the EU budget. But some of the decarbonisation funds would be placed in a recovery plan, which is unavailable to Hungary because of longstanding concerns about the rule of law in the country. The country has been denied €7.2bn in funds from the EU’s Covid recovery fund because it has failed to satisfy EU officials that it can ensure the money is spent properly. Hungary is seen as being in a vulnerable position as the Druzhba – which translates as “friendship” – pipeline runs through Ukraine. A senior Ukrainian official described the part of the pipeline running to Hungary as “great leverage” last week. Olena Zerkal, an adviser to Ukraine’s energy minister, said it would be “very appropriate if something happened to this pipeline”, according to comments reported by the Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform.  Hungary’s opposition means other measures in the EU sanctions package have not come into force, including tightening restrictions on Russian banks and imposing asset freezes and travel bans on dozens of high-ranking Russians, including a former gymnast rumoured to be Vladimir Putin’s girlfriend and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill."

Witnesses said the city was being bombed “200 times an hour” as Russian forces try to cut off reinforcement lines and surround its remaining defenders. Ukrainian authorities have described conditions in Sievierodonetsk as reminiscent of Mariupol, the southern port city that fell on 20 May after almost three months of relentless assault. The intensified fighting came as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visited Ukrainian troops on the front lines in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, in his first official appearance outside the Kyiv area since the start of the war. “You risk your lives for us all and for our country,” Zelenskiy told soldiers there.   Related: Russian forces close to encircling Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine   He added that Russian shelling has destroyed “the entire critical infrastructure of the city” and more than two-thirds of its housing stock. Taking Sievierodonetsk was Russia’s “principal aim” right now, the president said. The battle for Sievierodonetsk, which lies on the eastern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, about 145km (90 miles) south of the Russian border, is in the spotlight as Russia grinds out slow but solid gains in the industrial Donbas, which comprises the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. “They don’t care how many lives they will have to pay for this,” Zelenskiy said in his latest national address, referring to Russian forces in the region. Having failed to take the capital Kyiv in the early phase of the war, Russia is seeking to consolidate its grip on the Donbas, large parts of which are already controlled by Moscow-backed separatists. It has concentrated huge firepower on a small area – in contrast to the earlier phase of the conflict, when its forces were often spread thinly – bludgeoning towns and cities with artillery and air strikes. Regional officials reported that Russian forces were “storming” Sievierodonetsk and that fighting was taking place street by street, knocking out power and mobile phone services.  Sievierodonetsk’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, said those residents remaining in the city, which had a prewar population of about 100,000, risked exposure to shelling when they left their homes to access water. Striuk has estimated that 1,500 civilians have already died either from Russian attacks or from a lack of medicine and diseases that couldn’t be treated. Russia has also stepped up its efforts to take the neighbouring city of Lysychansk, where, according to Haidai, a Russian shell fell on a residential building over the weekend, killing a child. The “liberation” of the Donbas was an “unconditional priority” for Moscow, Russia’s foreign minister said, adding that other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own. “The liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority,” Sergei Lavrov told French TV channel TF1 in an interview on Sunday.   Related: Ukraine war is Putin’s death warrant, says wife of jailed politician    Zelenskiy’s office posted a video on Telegram of him wearing a bulletproof vest and being shown destroyed buildings in Kharkiv and its surroundings, from where Russian forces have retreated in recent weeks. It was the Ukrainian president’s first official appearance outside the Kyiv area since the start of the war. “Kharkiv suffered terrible blows from the occupiers … One third of the Kharkiv region is still under occupation,” he said. Last Thursday, Russian artillery pounded the city of Kharkiv for the first time in two weeks, just as life in Ukraine’s second city was starting to return to normal after Moscow’s troops were pushed back from its outlying towns and villages. At least nine people have been killed and 17 injured in the attacks on the northern part of the city. Zelenskiy voiced hopes that his allies would provide much needed weapons and said he expected “good news” in the coming days. A few days ago, the US and its allies indicated that they would provide Ukraine with increasingly sophisticated weapons, including the multiple-launch rocket systems for which Kyiv has been appealing. Ukraine said it has started receiving Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark and US self-propelled howitzers. Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak repeated a call for US-made long-range multiple-rocket launchers. US officials said such systems are actively being considered, with a decision possible in the coming days. “It is hard to fight when you are attacked from 70km away and have nothing to fight back with,” Podolyak posted on Twitter. ”We need effective weapons.” In the meantime, Zelenskiy said in a television interview that he believed Russia would agree to talks if Ukraine could recapture all the territory it has lost since the invasion. Zelenskiy ruled out the idea of using force to win back all the land Ukraine has lost to Russia since 2014, which includes the southern peninsula of Crimea, annexed by Moscow that year. “I do not believe that we can restore all of our territory by military means. If we decide to go that way, we will lose hundreds of thousands of people,” he said. Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report"
176,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/29/putin-vladimir-kara-murza-wife-russian-politician,2022-05-29T10:22:37Z,"Ukraine war is Putin’s death warrant, says wife of jailed politician ","Vladimir Kara-Murza’s wife Evgenia thinks he will have been like a “hurricane contained inside a bottle” since he was arrested on 11 April in Moscow and held in pre-trial detention over a speech he had made in Arizona criticising the war in Ukraine. “He has so much energy, so many ideas, and initiatives, that being contained within the four walls of a prison will be the hardest part for him,” said Evgenia, who has not been allowed to speak to him. As a Russian politician, campaigner and regime critic, Vladimir Kara-Murza worked for 15 years alongside Boris Nemtsov, another opposition leader, who was killed in 2015. Sitting in a hotel near Westminster on the same day she met the Foreign Office minister James Cleverly, Evgenia Kara-Murza warned the UK government that her husband, a British citizen who has twice been allegedly poisoned by the Russian spy agency the FSB, may have reason to fear for his own life. She had no criticism of her husband’s decision to repeatedly return to Russia, even after the invasion of Ukraine, saying: “He believed that as a Russian politician, he cannot call on people to continue fighting if he himself is somewhere safe, and he believes that he has to share the same risks, the same challenges as the Russians who continue to oppose this war.  “Basically, by calling this war a war, instead of the ‘special operation’ as the government wants it to be called, by saying that, a person can end up in prison for up to 15 years. On the basis of the charges laid so far Vladimir is now facing up to 10 years.” No court date has been yet set, possibly because officials will press additional charges such as advocating personal sanctions against the regime, she said. “Our family has been living like this for a long time,” said Kara-Murza, who has three teenage children. “He was targeted by an FSB team that tried to kill him twice in 2015 and 2017. “Thanks to an amazing independent investigation by Bellingcat and Insider, we now know the names and the faces of those people from the FSB, who had followed him before the poisoning. Both times Vladimir was left in a coma with multiple organ failure. And I brought him back to the US. He recovered and then he went back to Russia. “The Russian authorities have chosen this new tactic of dealing with opposition figures, especially well-known opposition figures like [Alexei] Navalny, or my husband – they try to lock them away and hide them from the public eye and prevent them from continuing to work. It is because they’re so effective when they’re outside.” Kara-Murza said that since the war started Russia had switched from being an authoritarian regime to a totalitarian one. “There is not one independent media outlet left, there is massive repression and propaganda pumped out on national TV … There is a new iron curtain around this country.” But she insisted dissent exists below the surface as people access news via virtual private networks or the Telegram messaging service. “I believe that Putin has not yet declared mobilisation because he knows how people will react to it. But a week or two ago, they said that there have already been 11 conscription centres burned down across Russia. “So that’s how people protest – by saying: ‘We’re not going to go to your war.’ People get arrested for going out on the street with a copy of War and Peace. Others have been arrested for carrying ‘invisible anti-government slogans’. The police said they could see invisible things. It is that crazy.” She pleaded for the west not to give up on the dissidents in Russia. “I believe Putin has signed his own death warrant with this war,” she said, “but he will fall the sooner we end these double standards: at the same time as countries support the Ukrainian people by sending weapons and providing humanitarian aid and imposing sanctions on the Russian economy, they also give Putin billions for oil and gas, which allows him to continue his aggression … this has to stop because honestly, it is inexplicable.” Her husband’s arrest and her campaign to secure his release have required her to change her role. “The fact is, I’ve never been a public figure. I’ve never been a public speaker, so everything I’m doing today, I’m learning it day by day. “All the people I’m meeting, I heard of them, of course, from my husband’s work, but I’ve met very few of them before. So everything is novel. Everything – speaking and being on stage, speaking to journalists – is very new to me. It’s a rather glum joke, but we do have this joke in the family, that I only emerge when my husband gets poisoned or thrown in jail.”"
177,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/29/ukraine-war-foreign-medics-volunteer-frontline,2022-05-29T10:11:57Z,‘This is Europe’s war’: the foreign volunteer medics on Ukraine frontline,"It was the photo of a young girl, dying in a Mariupol hospital after Russian shelling, that made up Martin Wyness’ mind. He had to go and help in Ukraine. Less than three months later, he was in an ambulance racing to save the life of another little girl gravely injured by a Russian attack, as more shells crashed down around them. They turned around and raced back the way they had came, looking for another route to safety and medical care for the eight-year-old, whose body was peppered with shrapnel. “They didn’t get her the first time so they had another go,” he said, in his hospital base in Donbas region. “As if that little girl wasn’t vulnerable enough.” Wyness is part of a volunteer medical unit bridging the gap between Ukraine’s eastern frontline – which is experiencing the most intense fighting of the war – and major hospitals where war-injured soldiers and civilians can get long-term treatment for their wounds. Medbat Pirogov volunteer hospital brings together dozens of Ukrainians, including some who returned from abroad to serve, and a handful of internationals who felt compelled to try to help out in a conflict thousands of miles from home. “I felt this wasn’t Ukraine’s war, it was Europe’s war, my war,” said Wyness. He has twice made the journey to Ukraine from his Southampton home. The first month of the war he spent in the basement of a Kyiv hospital, patching up those injured in the battle for the city. After the Russians were defeated he returned home for a break, but in early May returned to the new frontline near the almost-besieged town of Sievierodonetsk. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the battle in Donbas was so intense that up to 100 of the country’s soldiers were dying in combat each day.    A Ukrainian/German medic (left) talks as he cleans an ambulance in Bahkmut. Photograph: Ed Ram/The Guardian   It is a gruelling artillery duel in which the enemy is often faceless and unseen, appearing only in the form of shells, rockets and missiles, and visible through the terrible injuries they inflict on the bodies of civilians and soldiers alike. “Some days I think I’ve got to go, it’s just too much,” Wyness said, in an interview interrupted when shells started landing close to the base and the team had to race down to a basement bunker. Both the injuries and the constant threat of death are exhausting; the medics are targets for a military that has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Ukraine and in Syria, killing doctors, nurses and patients in defiance of international law. The medics are fundraising for armoured ambulances that would at least protect medics and patients from the worst of the shrapnel, but the war has sent prices even for secondhand vehicles soaring. So for now the group race towards the frontline in ordinary vehicles that would be ripped to shreds if an artillery round landed too close. Jennifer spent $4,500 (£3,560) of her own money to travel from California and risk death daily to help out. She does not want her last name published because she told her mum she was only going to Poland to help refugees, although she told her daughters – who are 17 and 23 – the truth. “The way I’ve raised them, they understand that this is an important thing to do,” she said. “If you know something is wrong and you don’t say or do anything, it’s doubly wrong.” Jennifer worked as a medic in Afghanistan, on contract with the international mission, so is used to conflict injuries and dangerous environments but the intensity and proximity of the fighting in Ukraine has still shocked her. “It’s more than I expected. Yesterday morning I was upstairs getting changed, a rocket flew by and landed just close by. The first night we got here we were in the basement, told to get ready to evacuate, because they thought the Russians had breached [Ukrainian lines] and were coming.”    Canadian medic Jennifer holds a gas mask she has been given. Photograph: Ed Ram/The Guardian   She made up her mind to volunteer when she saw Zelenskiy appealing to the world for assistance in Ukraine’s struggle, and began researching her options before contacting Gennadiy Druzenko, the founder of Medbat. “It’s a struggle for freedom and they need help,” Jennifer said. Ukrainians have tried to deter foreigners who do not have military experience from trying to go to the frontlines but Martin and Jennifer have practical skills that are needed as the deaths and injuries mount among civilians and soldiers. There are also Ukrainian medics in the team, some returned from abroad, others unable to get commissions in the oversubscribed military medical corps but determined to serve. Dmytro Rusnak drove back from Germany with a car full of medical aid. He had been getting ready for this moment for the best part of a decade. In 2014, after Russia seized Crimea and Russian-backed proxy forces took control of parts of Donbas, Rusnak changed his speciality from radiology to acute care.    A doctor walks through a corridor in a hospital in Slovyansk. Photograph: Ed Ram/The Guardian   “I saw I had to prepare myself, because at any moment it was possible that Russia could start a full war,” he said. When they did, he paused only to put his contract on hold – his bosses were very understanding – and gather as much medical supplies as he could from friends and colleagues. His main worry when the shells start falling is not his own safety but the worry he is bringing his elderly parents. “Although they are proud, it is very traumatic for them, there are no parents who want to see their children’s funeral.” He is waiting to get his German medical qualifications certified so he can practise as a doctor in Ukraine, so for now works with Wyness as an ambulance paramedic. “These years of education and preparation, all these skills, should be used,” he said. “I wanted to be an example, you can say thousands of words, make thousands of posts on social media, but this means nothing … you have to act, to do something.”"

Vlad is one of hundreds of teenagers who applied to the Homes for Ukraine scheme having fled war without his parents. While the Home Office struggles to decide how to deal with cases like his, they have been left in limbo for weeks – and even months – with no decision. “It is very difficult to be waiting, knowing that my parents are one and a half thousand miles away and our destiny is still unknown,” Vlad said. “It’s very hard.” A keen student, Vlad was preparing for school exams when areas around his home town of Krasyliv in western Ukraine came under intense bombing. His mum, Marina, was scared for his life but, being unable to leave, she rang her best friend, Olesia Reviuk, to ask if she could help her son escape. Reviuk, 43, recalled: “She was telling me that every day they could hear sirens and three or four times a day they would go down to the bomb shelter which was very cold, with no water. It was impossible to sleep there at night with the sirens going off.” Reviuk did not hesitate. “I promised that I would take good care of Vlad,” she said. She arranged for him to join her and her two sons in Italy, to where she had fled in February. Then, with his parents’ blessing, she became his legal guardian. The children spoke English and no Italian, so Reviuk applied under the Homes for Ukraine scheme at the earliest opportunity. They were matched with Paul Hanlon, a GP from Lancaster, his wife, Rebecca Shepherd, an anatomy lecturer, and their two young children. The British family quickly made ready two large spare bedrooms and a separate living room, assuming the group would soon be arriving. Instead, two months have gone by while Reviuk and the children wait in a cramped rented room in a flat in Modena, Italy. Reviuk said: “Living in one bedroom with two teenage boys and one small child who wakes up at night and is also sometimes sick is very difficult for us.” Hanlon, 42, said: “It’s so frustrating to think that they could have been enjoying the space and support on offer here, but instead we’ve all been spending hundreds of hours battling with bureaucracy that seems to have been set up to deflect rather than to protect those fleeing this brutal conflict.” Hanlon is in touch with about 40 other sponsors in similar situations, all despairing at the same impasse. “The government’s broad answer to most questions on the subject, ‘because of safeguarding’, is a cynical use of this term to avoid having to deal with the most vulnerable group affected by this war.” Given that Vlad is travelling with a legal guardian, his case should be one of the straightforward ones. But it appears to have made no difference. “I do not understand the logic of safeguarding me because in my country there is a war and there is no worse security situation for me than staying there,” Vlad said. “It just doesn’t make sense to me what safeguarding issues the government could have, when we have all the documents in place and Olesia is a family friend who has legal guardianship?” The Home Office has been sent a “letter before claim” over the families’ case, threatening judicial review. Vlad’s lawyer, Simon Robinson, said: “The delay in even providing a decision while keeping the family in the dark demonstrates that the secretary of state has failed to make an adequate policy to meet the promises she has made. She is turning her back on some of the most vulnerable people fleeing the conflict, children.” For Vlad, the waiting means uncertainty over his education. He has only a week left to tell the Ukrainian authorities which country he will be in to take his exams remotely and is unsure what to put. He also wants to apply to university. Reviuk said: “The UK government is taking the future away from Vlad. He’s a very talented boy. He reads a lot, he wants to study. And right now we just do not see the future.”"
179,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/29/homes-for-ukraine-children-stuck-waiting-for-uk-visa-decision,2022-05-29T09:12:44Z,Over 500 Ukrainian children stuck waiting for UK visa decision,"More than 500 Ukrainian children who fled the war without their parents are stuck waiting in limbo across Europe after applying to the Homes for Ukraine scheme, sources working closely with the Home Office say. Most are teenagers who thought they would be eligible and have British families waiting to host them, but have heard nothing from the Home Office. Many have been waiting for two months or more without an answer due to indecision about how to handle their cases. Some are alone in Europe having left home thinking they would soon be joining a British family that is ready to welcome them. Others are with adult siblings or family friends who have been made legal guardians but still have no permission to come. About 25 unaccompanied children were allowed into Britain during the first two weeks of the Homes For Ukraine scheme and ended up in care as a result, sources say. Though the policy now says children cannot travel without their parents unless they are with a legal guardian, the Home Office has not been offering a decision or solution to all those who applied before this was set out. Even teenagers travelling with adults who have been made legal guardians by their parents are among those caught up in the deadlock. Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, said: “I have only this week raised concerns in a letter to the immigration minister regarding the government’s policy on unaccompanied minors, but this latest information reflects the potential scale of the problem. “We understand that the government needs to undertake comprehensive safeguarding checks but there is a particular question about why long delays are still happening in instances where a parent has already completed the relevant paperwork which grants permission for their child to be placed in the care of a relative.” Earlier this month, the Guardian told the story of Nazarii, 17, who was listening to war planes flying overhead in his village in western Ukraine while he waited for a decision from the Home Office. A teaching assistant and her family in Hampshire were ready to host him but he had heard nothing since submitting an application on 11 April. More than three weeks later, he is still in Ukraine with no refusal or update. “The Home Office hasn’t given me any information. I don’t know what to do,” he said. “If it’s a refusal, OK, but without any information it’s impossible.” Beth Gardiner-Smith, the chief executive of the child refugee charity Safe Passage, said: “We know of far too many children who are currently stuck in limbo, alone in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, who are desperate to join their sponsors here in the UK. Unacceptably, this is leaving lone children in dangerous and vulnerable positions, at risk of exploitation.” Gardiner-Smith said the government should expand the Homes for Ukraine scheme to include unaccompanied children by working with local authorities and charities to ensure safeguarding.  Even those with British hosts ready to foster children have had no decision. Among these is severely autistic 16-year-old Timothy Tymoshenko, who the Guardian reported is still waiting in Poland to be allowed to join a British foster carer. The situation is so critical that sources said it was the biggest point of concern at the latest weekly meeting of MPs’ offices with the Home Office. Krish Kandiah, the founder of the Sanctuary Foundation, which is supporting British hosts in the Homes for Ukraine scheme, said: “It is disturbing to hear that unaccompanied minors seeking to leave Ukraine for their own safety are waiting so long for visas when I know that there are foster carers like my own family and other appropriate hosts in the UK that are willing to care for them.” A government spokesperson said: “Due to safeguarding concerns, unaccompanied minors are only eligible under the Homes for Ukraine scheme if they are reuniting with a parent or legal guardian in the UK. “The Ukrainian government has been clear that their preference is children should not be taken from Ukraine without their parents and that moving a child from their home region must be in their best interest.”"

Military analyst Michael Kofman wrote on Twitter last week: “The overall military balance in this war still trends in Ukraine’s favour, given manpower availability and access to extensive Western military support … But the local balance in the Donbas during this phase is a different story.”
How fully and how quickly Vladimir Putin attains his objectives in Donbas may dictate how and whether other parts of Ukraine come back into play. The level of losses sustained will also play a role.
Donbas
Russia has abandoned attempts to encircle all Ukrainian forces in Donbas for the more modest goal of creating “cauldrons” – smaller encirclements cutting Ukrainians off from supplies and reinforcements.
Last week, the focus was on the city of Sievierodonetsk, where local governor Serhiy Haidai said Russia had committed 10,000 soldiers and an extra 2,500 pieces of equipment to attacking the city. There are reports that the Russians already control a hotel on the outskirts of the city, after many days of ruthless bombardments.

If Russia takes Sievierodonetsk, it will control the entire Luhansk region, and can increase its focus on parts of Donetsk it still does not control.
“I don’t think the Russian offensive looks stalled, and while sluggish, there is no good way to predict when it will culminate,” wrote Kofman.
Occupied territories
There is no longer any doubt that Russia plans to fully annex parts of Ukraine, as it did with Crimea in 2014. Then, Moscow declined to do the same with the areas it controlled in east Ukraine, preferring instead to prop up separatist administrations there. Now, there is talk of rapid annexation of the parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces that Russia took in the first days of the invasion.
Unlike Mariupol, which Russia conquered after bombing it to rubble – and possibly other cities in Donbas that Russia may soon capture – these territories were largely taken with no fighting, so Russia has been able to focus on mopping up dissent and trying to take full control.
The areas have seen an increased crackdown on pro-Ukrainian sentiment, as well as reports that Russia is introducing the rouble and Moscow time zone, announcements that teachers will be retrained in the Russian curriculum, and a series of sinister videos of locals announcing on camera that they had been through “a course of denazification” and no longer support Ukraine.
Formal annexation of this territory could have huge consequences for the prospect of a peace deal. Ukraine will not accept the loss of these areas, but if it launches a counterattack, Russia could claim Ukraine was attacking Russian territory.

Life in the Ukrainian capital feels more normal by the week. The occasional air raid siren and men with guns on the streets are reminders of the war, but cafe terraces are busy, the opera has reopened and the curfew has been pushed back to 11pm. Since the Russians withdrew at the beginning of April, there has been no artillery threat, and no repeat of the booms from the suburbs that characterised the first weeks of the war.
However, Russian-language news outlet Meduza last week quoted Kremlin-linked sources claiming that Putin had not yet given up on Kyiv and may launch another assault once the battle for Donbas is over.

As with Kyiv, the Russians attempted to storm the country’s second city in the early days of the war and, as in the capital, they faced unexpectedly strong resistance, were stalled on the outskirts and then pushed back into positions surrounding the city.
In recent weeks, Ukrainian forces have pushed the Russians back further but, unlike with Kyiv, the invaders are still within striking distance of the city. Last Thursday, areas within the city limits were shelled for the first time in two weeks and nine civilians died, according to local authorities.







Military commanders say there is no sign of a new advance on Kharkiv, but the Russians are digging firmly into the positions they still hold, with no plans to retreat all the way to the border as they did elsewhere.
“They are planning something,” said one commander based outside the city last week.
“We may only find out what it is when it happens.”"

But the world’s attention is fading | Peter Pomerantsev,"Russia needs to stop being a threat: to its neighbours, to its own people, to the world. Minimising that threat should be the goal of our policies and the only way to face up to the reality of the Kremlin’s boot stamping on so many faces. The hope that the current iteration of Russia is ready to recognise that other states have rights is gone. Putin’s Russia is not an ordinary country seeking some rational security guarantees. It’s a predator that works according to its own logic of internal oppression and external aggression. With such a state there is no going back to “normal”. No clever “deal” that can be cut to restore previous relations. As we work out what minimising Russia’s threat means in practice, we may also get to something bigger: a set of security, humanitarian and economic interconnections that redefine how we reduce aggression in an interconnected age. Russia’s aim in its invasion of Ukraine was to reset the world order, tilt it towards dictatorships, impunity and the right of great powers to crush the small. Instead, it may produce a desire to strengthen rights, sovereignty and democracy. In pushing for the worst, it might produce something better. The first place where Russia’s threat has to be minimised is in Ukraine itself. This will be achieved on the battlefield. Ukraine is still vastly outnumbered in both men and arms. The situation in the Donbas is tenuous. Every day, about 100 Ukrainian soldiers are killed. And it’s no longer hardened professional fighters – it’s IT specialists, sociologists, students. When I met President Zelenskiy, together with colleagues from the Atlantic magazine a few weeks ago, his greatest fear was that the victory in the battle for Kyiv meant that too many people would think the war over when it was just shifting to a different, more deadly phase in the Donbas. The world’s attention has faded. Allies are being slow to arm Ukraine sufficiently. Positions are being ceded daily because of a lack of basic munitions for artillery. This needs to change fast. Any eventual negotiations have to be taken from a position of Ukrainian strength, not weakness, or else they risk being another deal that gives up all the leverage to Russia, only augmenting the threat it poses.   Russia attacked Ukraine in 2022 because, after its 2014 invasion, Putin thought he could get away with it   We shouldn’t be worried about “humiliating” Putin and his henchmen on the battlefield – humiliation in Russian politics and society comes from within, centuries of not dealing with a history of repression and mass murder has produced a political culture that seethes with resentment and fear. All that can be done is encourage Russian elites and society to face up to the reality and the limits of their power. It’s up to us whether negotiations – if and when they happen – take place in the far east with Russia exhausted – or at the gates of Kyiv, with Russia ascendant. If and when those negotiations happen, Ukraine has to be armed to the teeth to deter future Russian incursions. It is also hoping for security guarantees, including from the UK. But there’s a greater context here too. The Russian invasion is relevant to any nation that lives unprotected in the neighbourhood of nuclear bullies: think Moldova, Georgia and the central Asian states around Russia; Japan, Australia and Taiwan around China. It’s no coincidence that Australia, a country that could have chosen to sit out this conflict, has been such an enthusiastic advocate of the Ukrainian cause, even providing $70m-worth of defensive equipment. How can you protect such countries from aggression, given they are not Nato members and the nuclear status of the states that threaten them? The ad hoc support to Ukraine gives us a clue: a mix of economic warfare and provision of arms. But to act as a deterrent this threat has to be made clear and be coordinated before any invasion. Russia attacked Ukraine in 2022 because, after its 2014 invasion, Putin thought he could get away with it. The moment sanctions kick in should not be up for debate: a war of aggression should trigger harsh measures. Moreover, we need to tie crimes against humanity to even more aggressive sanctions. The indiscriminate bombing of Mariupol or slaughter in Bucha should lead to oil embargoes. We need to reconnect humanitarian norms to economics.   All talk about “regime change” from outside is foolish: Russia is a great power no one can influence or attack that brazenly   So far, the economic power dynamics lie the other way. At the moment, a country such as Australia, which criticised Beijing’s human rights record, is bullied by China with grain sanctions. Russia holds the world hostage to hunger by limiting its own grain exports and blocking Ukraine’s, demanding sanctions against Russia are lifted. In central Europe, a gruesome calculation is emerging: what hike in gas prices are people willing to bear before they close their eyes to Putin’s crimes against humanity? Everywhere, human rights are subservient to economic needs. For us to rein in the aggression of the Russias and Chinas of this world, it needs to be the other way round. While such measures can act as a deterrent, Russia will also have to change internally before it stops being a threat. Can we ever hope for a Russia that is ready to give up imperial pretensions, live in harmony with its neighbours and even establish rule of law at home? It seems a far-off dream. All talk about “regime change” from outside is foolish: Russia is a great power no one can influence or attack that brazenly. But what we can do is remain steadfast in our sanctions and commitment to indicting war criminals, showing Russian elites that their punishment is long and serious. Anecdotal research from inside the country suggests many think the sanctions will be lifted soon. This betrays great weakness. In his memoirs of life in Nazi concentration camps, the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl noted that those who thought their imprisonment would end soon were in denial of reality – and the first to then break and collapse. Who will communicate this? Currently, we are not explaining the meaning and intent of sanctions and western policy to the Russian people. If they are perceived purely as random and poorly motivated economic weapons, this will actually risk strengthening the cleaving of Russian society to the state. People bunch together when faced with what they claim, rightly or wrongly, is an unjustified attack. However, if they are shown to be part of a more values-based rejection of Russia from the global community, somewhat like South Africa under apartheid, then they will act as a way to undermine Russians’ connection to their own leadership. It’s no wonder that Kremlin propaganda is always celebrating any cracks in western resolve towards Russia: from Tucker Carlson’s pro-Russian diatribes through to Italian and French “peace” proposals favourable to Moscow. The Kremlin knows many Russians don’t want to feel completely isolated and rejected from the world. We have launched a form of economic warfare, without backing it up with advocacy and engagement. This is absurd, allowing the Kremlin to manage perceptions. It wouldn’t be hard to get Russians’ attention. A short video from Arnold Schwarzenegger directed at his Russian fans and condemning the war got millions of views. The Russian internet firewall is feeble: you can still use radio, WhatsApp, Telegram and YouTube. The more understanding there is that the Kremlin has led people into a dead end, that this is permanent, the more impetus there is for elites to change the direction of the country. • Peter Pomerantsev is the author of Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: Adventures in Modern Russia  Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Arriving in a long column of cars, filled mostly with women, babies and pets, Oksana Borisova and Alisa Poliakova (who are speaking under pseudonyms to protect their families still living in occupied territory), didn’t dare trust that they were safe. For weeks, Russian soldiers had stalked them around the southern Ukrainian city in Z-marked vehicles, destroyed their livelihoods, imprisoned and tortured their friends and lobbed grenades at them at rallies. But after driving past seven Russian checkpoints over 10 hours to Mykolaiv – a journey that prewar would have taken an hour – and surviving a close encounter with a missile, they had finally reached what appeared to be a Ukrainian soldier.   Related: Kherson diary: ‘Now we know in person our heroes and our traitors’   “You understand that it should be our territory, and you see the soldier, but can’t distinguish the military signs on his uniform,” said Borisova, now in the UK, recalling their escape last month. “And you think: ‘Well, Russian or Ukrainian?’” The confirmation she was looking for came when, the car window lowered to the greeting “dobrogo dnia!” (Ukrainian for “Good day”). She could have hugged him, she said. “Because now I believed that the Ukrainian army exists. Since 24 February we hadn’t seen our soldiers.” In a series of dispatches for the Observer at the start of the war, the two female Ukrainian journalists bravely documented the horrors of life in occupied Kherson – from the city’s brave resistance to looming humanitarian disaster and burying the dead. But they also offered an insight into how, despite it all, residents fiercely continued to find glimmers of joy: a tale of young hospital interns getting married; drinking coffee at their favourite coffee shop under the roar of artillery strikes. There were scenes of dark humour too. In one dispatch, they described how a queue of civilians laughed a group of empty-handed Russian soldiers out of the butcher’s shop because they were unimpressed with the quality of meat available.

Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer   Despite growing numbers of people leaving, the escalating danger – particularly for journalists – and dwindling supplies, the old friends, who are both in their 50s, hadn’t planned to leave their home city. Despite writing anonymously, they feared being identified by their reporting. One of their friends, Oleh Baturin, was detained and tortured for eight days and threatened with mutilation and death, and Maxim Negrov, the owner of the online newspaper Postfactum, was arrested and detained. They also worried that if the city were liberated it could lead to further killings by Russian soldiers. But it was only when they were offered seats in friends’ cars that they made the decision to go. Borisova in a car with her daughter-in-law and a baby, and Poliakova with a friend and her cat. Their husbands and sons remain in Kherson. “I made up my mind very quickly, during half a day,” said Borisova. “Not because of me, more for the sake of my daughter-in-law because my son begged me. Now with all these Bucha stories [of rape], he was very afraid. He said: ‘I will sleep well when you girls get out of Kherson.’” She added: “That chance was given to me and it was too foolish not to take it.” They left just in time. Just a few days ago, an acquaintance was shot in the head and killed trying to escape. His family were not allowed to bury him. “Now I’m ready to pay any money for my son to leave,” said Borisova. “And I told him frankly: ‘Don’t bargain, pay anything they want, I will get money for you.’” Her mother, who her husband has promised to take care of while she is away, is dying with cancer. After reaching Mykolaiv, they went to Odesa, which, initially at least, felt like “a resort”. At a cafe, they drank good coffee and ate fish, revelling in the fact that they didn’t have to worry about being harassed by Russian soldiers. But when bombing started, they realised it wasn’t safe there either. With the help of Christian volunteers, they travelled for free by bus to Germany via Moldova, where they stayed at a shelter for two nights, before reaching Halle where they had been invited to Artist and the City, a residency on the role of public spaces. Last week, they arrived at Stansted under the Homes for Ukraine scheme after a London-based friend found them a host.    Elderly local residents speak to a group of Russian soldiers in Kherson. Photograph: AP   After months of communicating online, this is our first time meeting in person. Sat side by side on a sofa in the quiet Surrey suburbs, Poliakova wearing a blue T-shirt and Borisova a hoodie that says “I speak fluent sarcasm” across it, they seem remarkably calm and pragmatic on the surface – direct and quick to laugh and joke – but as they talk the heaviness of their deep pain seeps through. Although arriving in the UK was in some ways a relief, they continue to suffer from the steady stream of debilitating updates from home via Telegram. “This news makes us anxious, depressed, we cry,” said Borisova. “We cry every day.” Before the war, their lives in Kherson were busy and full. Borisova travelled throughout Europe, writing about architecture and contemporary art, and Poliakova reported on political and social issues. In the summer, they spent holidays and weekends at the nearby seaside. Now, however, the shore has been mined by Russia. While it was not very prosperous and had fallen victim to corruption, Kherson was “a cosy city and very warm”, they said, and had potential as a tourist attraction. They had a new mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, who they hoped would restore the city with new green zones and public spaces. But after the invasion of Ukraine and a battle for the city, on 2 March Kherson became the first to fall. Kolykhaiev has since been replaced by a pro-Russian administration. After the Russians arrived, they said, the city was “cut off from the rest of the country immediately”. The television centre was quickly seized and the vast majority of residents did not have time to leave. “The next day we were absolutely sieged.”  Living under occupation, the issue of trust has become a life or death matter. “We stopped talking to anyone, it’s a paranoia,” said Borisova. “You stop believing people.” To illustrate, Poliakova cites the example of a former city manager who was such a convincing patriot with his “perfect Ukrainian”, slogans and speeches but turned out to be a Russian collaborator. Although for weeks they continued to attend daily protests in the city’s Freedom Square, a sense of escalating threat and distrust was palpable in their occupation diaries and in my communications with them. In one of their final Signal messages before they left, Borisova expressed doubt they would stay alive.    A woman with her child walks past a Russian soldier at an embankment of the Black Sea in Kherson. Photograph: AP   How did their feelings change under occupation? “From great, great fear to some acceptance of reality to total despair, because nothing helps you to accept it really,” said Borisova. She compares waking up under occupation to the film Groundhog Day. “It’s a nightmare and you feel like the day is repeating and repeating.” The streets were littered with explosives disguised as toys and they were watchful entering their homes. Each day, from around 3pm, the streets would empty out when soldiers started patrolling. People hid in their houses to avoid being shot. “Riding their vehicles around with their machine guns they could be drunk sometimes and just start firing. So it was quite dangerous wandering around in the evening,” said Borisova. While it was rare to see the Russians engaging in terrible acts in the morning, they could be hungry and angry. “They were told in Russia that we would be happy to have them there. And they couldn’t understand, it was a paradoxical thing for them, that we were not waving flowers and Russian flags.” For weeks, the Russian response to the daily protests was muted, giving them the confidence to carry on. “It was a very surprising thing for me personally, and for others I suppose, that why they allowed protests so long,” said Borisova, who now sees it as a tactic to paint them as “aggressive Nazis” rising up against “peaceful Russian soldiers”. But on 21 March, the protesters were taken by complete surprise when they were met with grenades. The next day, there was teargas and shooting and Borisova narrowly escaped with her life. Rally numbers dwindled and soon the protests stopped. “For the first time we saw lots of blood on the ground and we understood it was the end of peaceful rallies,” she said with sombre finality. “They showed us, ‘OK people, we’re fed up with it.’” Now, they said, life in Kherson is very tough. There are no jobs, Russia has stolen their grain and people are being paid in food instead of money. Meanwhile, the shops are full of expensive food from Moldova and regions of Russia that most couldn’t afford to buy, even if they wanted to. “For people who stayed there, nothing will help them except themselves,” said Poliakova. “So they start making gardens, orchards near their houses to provide themselves with some food.” Sometimes medicines are smuggled in, but it’s painfully insufficient. “So many countries of the world are ready to help us but it’s not very easy to squeeze between all these checkpoints,” said Borisova. “They’re numerous. And sometimes they’re in good mood, sometimes they’re furious, so it’s quite a roulette.” Trying to escape now can mean spending several days in battlefields surrounded by explosions. “We were lucky to escape within one day,” said Borisova. “But after the roadblocks are getting more and more numerous, people spend two-three days. You’re very, very scared. You are in the centre of the battle.” A ghost city would be bad for Russian propaganda, she said, but not everyone wants to leave. There are those who are prepared to cooperate and are informing on their neighbours.    A picture taken during a media tour organised by the Russian army shows a poster reading ‘Great Patriotic War 1941-1945’, in Kherson. Photograph: Sergei Ilnitsky/EPA   Although many of its residents speak Russian, the journalists said there has been a sharp rejection of Russia since 2014, when Moscow annexed nearby Crimea, but Russian culture was not cancelled entirely. But now, as she translates the eyewitness accounts of Ukrainian women and girls who have been killed and raped by Russian soldiers for a book about the war, Borisova said she cannot tolerate anything Russian. “When you come through this terror and see these atrocities … I couldn’t bear it,” she said. “While translating, I was just crying. I stopped for a while to comfort myself but it’s unbearable to read all of this.” Since arriving in the UK they have been received with warmth and kindness, immediately bonding with their host over their shared love of Monty Python, but it has also been overwhelming. Borisova is trying to see it as an adventure, but Poliakova feels a strong pull back to Ukraine. They want to continue their journalistic work, documenting Ukrainians’ experiences of the invasion and hope to write a book. “We are very conscious that our psychological conditions are very fragile. Not stable,” said Borisova. But she hopes that every day spent in the UK will help distract them from their grief. “This routine, this desire to see another places, meeting with other people will help us to cope and to overcome.”"

Ukrainian officials say they urgently need advanced US-made mobile multiple launch rocket systems, which are capable of striking targets up to 300km away, to halt Russian advances in Luhansk and Donetsk. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has conceded that not all the land that Russia has seized since it annexed Crimea in 2014 can be recaptured militarily. While he is certain his country will take back the territory Russia has claimed since its 24 February invasion, he said other territory could not be recovered by force. “I do not believe that we can restore all of our territory by military means. If we decide to go that way, we will lose hundreds of thousands of people,” he said. Russia’s defence ministry claims to have captured the strategically important city of Lyman and several other smaller towns and encircled Sievierodonetsk, which Ukraine denies. Zelenskiy said in a Saturday night television address that conditions in Donbas were “indescribably difficult”, and thanked Ukrainian defenders holding out in the face of the onslaught. At least six superyachts linked to UK-sanctioned Russian oligarchs have “gone dark” on ocean tracking systems, vanishing from the global maps used to locate marine traffic. The owners of these yachts will almost certainly realise they are at risk of being targeted in a global hunt for the assets of Russia’s super-rich. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has scrapped the upper age limit for military recruits in the face of mounting losses in Ukraine, Tass reported. UK intelligence estimated this month Russia had lost about a third of its ground forces. Officials in the south-eastern port city of Mykolaiv said at least one person was killed, and at least six injured, in Russian shelling. Two rounds landed in courtyards of high-rise buildings, and one shell fell close to a kindergarten, CNN reported. Boris Johnson and Zelenskiy discussed concerns over food supplies in a phone call. A Downing Street spokesperson said Johnson told Zelenskiy the UK would continue to support Ukraine’s armed resistance, including by supplying equipment. She added that the UK was involved in “intensive work … with international partners to find ways to resume the export of grain from Ukraine to avert a global food crisis”. Putin spoke to French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz and, according to the Kremlin, he told them that continuing arms supplies was “dangerous”, warning “of the risks of further destabilisation of the situation and aggravation of the humanitarian crisis”. Russia said it was willing to discuss ways to make it possible for Ukraine to resume shipments of grain from Black Sea ports. Spain is sending a battery of surface-to-air missiles and about 100 troops to the Nato forward presence mission in Latvia, joining about 500 compatriots already present in the Baltic state, El País reported.

Ukrainian officials say they urgently need advanced US-made mobile multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to halt Russian advances in Luhansk and Donetsk. The rockets would be capable of striking Russian firing positions, military bases, air strips and supply lines at a range of up to 300km (185 miles). “We are in great need of weapons that will make it possible to engage the enemy over a long distance,” Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said. “The price of delay is measured by the lives of people who have protected the world from [Russian] fascism.” Ongoing disagreements in Washington have held up MLRS deliveries. Some of President Joe Biden’s national security advisers are said to be fearful Ukraine may use the rockets to hit targets inside Russia, a development that could spark an escalation drawing in the US and Nato. Kyiv has previously launched attacks on Russian soil. Moscow, keenly aware of the game-changing potential of the rocket systems, has already voiced strong objections. “If the Americans do this, they will clearly cross a red line,” said Olga Skabeeva, an influential Russian state TV host whose views reflect the Kremlin’s. Russia’s response could be “very harsh”, she warned. US news outlets reported on Saturday that Biden had agreed to provide some rocket systems as part of a major new US arms package for Ukraine to be announced this week. The package may also include another advanced weapon, the high mobility artillery rocket system, known as Himars. The decision reportedly followed talks between the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister. “Heavy weapons on top of our agenda, and more are coming our way,” Kuleba said after the talks. But doubts remain about which weapons systems will be provided, and the timing of the US move. The White House and the Pentagon have yet to confirm the reports. “I won’t get ahead of decisions that haven’t been made yet,” the Pentagon spokesman, John Kirby, said. Despite the delay, he insisted it was “not too late” to send new weapons to Ukraine. If the US defies Russia’s warnings and goes ahead this week, the UK is expected to simultaneously announce it will also supply advanced long-range rocket systems. The British version of the MLRS, which can fire 12 missiles in less than a minute, has a more limited range of 84kms (52 miles). Earlier this month, Britain announced an additional £1.3bn in military support. Speaking in Prague on Friday, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said it was “completely legitimate” for Nato and EU countries to provide more weapons, including tanks and planes, to Ukraine despite Russia’s objections. Like Boris Johnson, Truss says Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin, must be seen to lose the war. Britain has demanded a return to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders.    An injured man is carried on a stretcher in Kharkiv on Thursday after being injured by Russian shelling. Photograph: Bernat Armangué/AP   The UK’s uncompromising stance is not shared by leading European countries shaken by Russia’s advances, whose focus is increasingly on notional peace negotiations. Henry Kissinger, the veteran American diplomat, fuelled this debate last week in Davos by suggesting Kyiv should prepare to make concessions, amounting to a possible de facto partition. Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz held an 80-minute phone conversation with Putin, during which they urged the Russian president to hold “direct serious negotiations” with Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The French president and German chancellor called for an “immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal of Russian troops”. Keir Giles, of London-based thinktank Chatham House, said a quick end to the conflict appeared to be the priority for France and Germany. “There are already worrying indications that the flakiest of the western European partners may be discussing between themselves how to force a surrender on Ukraine in the form of territorial concessions in order to end the fighting ... It is more important to them [France and Germany] to end the fighting than to arrive at a workable outcome,” Giles said. This apparent shift has angered east European governments such as Poland, whose president accused Germany of failing to keep a promise to provide heavy weapons. After Italy last week put forward a peace plan, which was dismissed by the Kremlin as “fantasy”, Edgars Rinkēvičs, Latvia’s foreign minister, warned that, in any case, Putin could not be trusted to stick to any settlement. “Any agreement with Russia isn’t worth a broken penny,” the Ukrainian presidential adviser and peace talks negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said. “Is it possible to negotiate with a country that always lies cynically? ... Russia has proved that it is a barbarian country that threatens world security. A barbarian can only be stopped by force.” Pressure to talk peace or make concessions is feeding Ukraine’s concerns that it is in a race against time to turn around its battlefield fortunes. The Kyiv government said on Saturday that its forces may have to retreat from Luhansk to avoid encirclement. Russia’s defence ministry said the eastern Ukrainian town of Lyman had fallen under the full control of Russian and Russian-backed forces in the region. Meanwhile, a group of independent international legal experts accused Russia of committing genocide. Notwithstanding recent Ukrainian setbacks, Peter Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser, said the west must not back away now. “Having supported Ukraine and encouraged them to stand up to Russian aggression in the early phase, we’ve now got a real obligation to see it through for the long term,” he said. “It would be disastrous to scale down western support after they’ve done the really hard bit to face the Russians. We’ve got to knuckle down for the long term. Military support can reduce over time and probably the economic support will become more important as the fighting gradually subsides.”"

The Ukrainian family, now coming to a food bank in Euston, north London, every week, is among a growing number of recently arrived refugees from the war-torn country relying on handouts to survive, according to charities. Helena Aksentijevic, manager of the Euston food bank, said she had been handed the letter by the Ukrainian family. It was from the host and said that they were struggling to cover the extra cost of feeding two women and two children, as well as additional energy costs. Aksentijevic said the system was “a mess” and that the number of Ukrainian refugees coming to the food bank, which had had a 300% increase in visitors since the start of the pandemic, was rising rapidly. Under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, refugees are eligible for a £200 interim payment for subsistence costs, provided by their local council, and can apply for benefits, including universal credit, pension credit, disability benefits, carer’s allowance and child benefit. However, some say their access to benefits has been delayed because they have not yet received biometric residence permits. The government denies this. Sponsors can claim £350 a month from the government. They do not have to feed refugees, but many do. Most of the Ukrainians coming to the food banks are women with children, but Aksentijevic said they had also been visited by a teenage boy. “I can only see us getting more and more people from that community,” she said. The Independent Food Aid Network (Ifan) and the Trussell Trust, which between them represent hundreds of food banks, report that newly arrived Ukrainians are seeking help to feed their families. Ifan said it had created Ukrainian versions of its referral leaflets in the Highlands and Carlisle.    A family who fled their home in Oblast arrive at Luton airport to meet their host. Many hosts are experiencing increased financial pressures. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian   Sabine Goodwin, Ifan’s coordinator, said: “A social security system that is fit for purpose would be able to support Ukrainian refugees struggling to afford food.” Meanwhile, amid an escalating cost of living crisis, food banks are already struggling to meet the needs of people across the UK. Research by the food network found earlier this month that 93% of its members reported an increase in the need for services since the start of the year, while more than 80% reported issues with food supplies. Goodwin said that new cost of living crisis measures announced last week by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were welcome, but added that “there’s a long way to go before people in the UK can count on accessible financial help at a time of crisis”. A refugee living alone in emergency accommodation in Exeter said she had visited a food bank after losing her Homes for Ukraine sponsor. She said she was “very well received” and was given help to choose food. Sutton4Ukrainians, a support group, said that one in three refugees they encounter go to food banks, many because they are waiting to access benefits or because the money they have does not stretch far enough. A spokesperson said the £200 interim council payment for subsistence was insufficient. “This is not a huge amount – public transport is expensive,” they said, adding that often refugees wanted to be independent.   Related: Food bank demand for items to eat cold ‘mind blowing’, says Jack Monroe   Lifeafterhummus Community Benefit Society in north London has worked with several Ukrainian refugees who have visited its outdoor surplus food cart. One family said they were being sponsored but that they did not have access to food. Lifeafterhummus has also supplied refugees with cooking equipment. Farrah Rainfly, the group’s operations manager, said the issue for Ukrainian refugees came on top of the existing cost of living crisis. “I have families coming to me in tears, saying, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do.’” A government spokesperson said: “We do not recognise these reports – Ukrainians can access benefits immediately without a biometric test and will receive an additional £200 payment while these are being processed. “Translation services are available to help with phone applications for benefits, welcome points have been set up to help arrivals and we are in constant contact with councils who are providing further support to the small number of Ukrainians who may need more help.”"

But few of the tourists who spotted its sleek black hull would have appreciated that it was quite a find. Since the invasion of Ukraine, the superyacht, which is linked to the Russian billionaire Andrey Guryev, has vanished off the global tracking maps used to locate marine traffic. An investigation by the Observer this weekend reveals it is one of at least six superyachts linked to UK-sanctioned oligarchs which have “gone dark” on ocean tracking systems. The owners of these yachts will almost certainly realise they are at risk of being targeted in a global hunt for the assets of Russia’s super-rich. At least 13 such vessels with a total value of nearly £2bn have already been impounded since the invasion of Ukraine, from southern France to Fiji. In the latter case, the superyacht Amadea, allegedly linked to the gold billionaire Suleiman Kerimov, was seized on behalf of the US. Analysts report an increase in Russian-linked yachts which are turning off the automatic identification system (AIS) equipment used for tracking large vessels. The system can be turned off for legitimate reasons, but experts believe some vessels want to avoid detection.  Interactive  An analysis by the Observer of AIS data compiled by the maritime and aviation market intelligence firm VesselsValue reveals other superyachts which have “gone dark” for more than a month include: • The 72-metre (238ft) superyacht Clio, linked to industrialist Oleg Deripaska, which sailed from the Indian Ocean to Turkey after the invasion. Its last transmitted location was on 18 April in the Black Sea, within range of the Russian ports of Sochi and Novorossiysk. • The 70-metre Galactica Super Nova, linked to the oligarch Vagit Alekperov, the sanctioned former president of Lukoil. The last transmitted location of the vessel was on 2 March off the Croatian coast. • The 140-metre Ocean Victory, linked to the sanctioned oligarch Viktor Rashnikov, which last transmitted its location at anchor in the Maldives on 1 March. One member of crew on a superyacht linked to a Russian oligarch sanctioned by the UK told the Observer last week: “We were told to turn off the AIS. We removed the screws on the power plug and pulled it out.” There are about 9,300 superyachts on the seas, worth more than £50bn, according to industry data. An estimated 10% of that fleet is owned by Russians.    The swimming pool with waterfall feature on the Galactica Super Nova, which last transmitted a location via AIS on 2 March. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images   One of the first superyachts to be impounded was the 86-metre Amore Vero, linked to the oil tycoon Igor Sechin, which was seized by customs officers at a shipyard at La Ciotat, near Marseille, on 2 March. Italian authorities also impounded the 143-metre Sailing Yacht A on 12 March in Trieste. It is believed to be owned by the billionaire entrepreneur Andrey Melnichenko. He was sanctioned by the UK on 15 March. Melnichenko’s other superyacht, the futuristic £240m Motor Yacht A, has disappeared from global tracking system. Its last confirmed location was on 10 March in the Maldives. The last recorded location of the Alfa Nero on AIS was in the Caribbean on 3 March, when it was anchored at Philipsburg in Sint Maarten. The yacht is operating on a skeleton crew and has put its tender, the Alfa Fish, into storage. Guryev, 62, a Russian who made his fortune with the Russian fertiliser giant PhosAgro, is reported by maritime sources to be the owner of the vessel. He was revealed to have bought London’s largest private residence, the 25-bedroom mansion Witanhurst, for £50m in 2008. He has regularly enjoyed sailing on the Alfa Nero. The vessel is also used by his family, including his son (also Andrey) and his son’s wife, Valeria, who studied at the London College of Fashion and once reportedly stated on Instagram that she was “too pretty for work”. Like many yachts, it is owned via an opaque offshore structure, and Guryev has denied being the owner. Other yachts which have not been tracked by AIS for more than a month include the Galactica Super Nova, which has a glass-bottomed swimming pool with a waterfall. It left Tivat in Montenegro on 2 March and promptly disappeared off the system. The Clio, linked to Deripaska, sailed more than 3,000 miles after the invasion, from the Maldives, through the Suez Canal, across the Mediterranean and into the Bosphorus, gateway to the Black Sea and its Russian ports. In the Clio’s case, one reason it may have gone dark could be the perilous situation in the Black Sea arising from the war.

Photograph: Albert Gea/Reuters   Other yachts which have not transmitted a confirmed location via AIS for at least a month include the My Sky, linked to the cigarette tycoon Igor Kesaev, which last reported its location in the Maldives on 30 March. The Maldives has no extradition treaty with the US, and at least five yachts linked to Russian owners have headed for its waters since the invasion. Other vessels, including two owned by Roman Abramovich, have headed to Turkey. Under maritime rules, AIS should always be in operation when ships are under way or at anchor. All vessels of 300 gross tonnage and upwards must be fitted with it. A cruising vessel will typically transmit its location frequently, but it can turn the system off when in port. The data is relayed by radio receivers and satellites. Sam Tucker at VesselsValue said: “There are some vessels where we would be previously getting a signal every few minutes from transponders and we are now seeing gaps of months. It’s very likely that some have flicked off the switch and gone into stealth mode.” None of the sanctioned oligarchs linked to the six superyachts suspected of turning off their AIS responded to a request for comment."
187,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/28/tv-chief-who-fled-russia-viktor-muchnik,2022-05-28T11:48:03Z,‘We can’t live with people who support Putin’s war’: the TV chief who fled Russia,"On the ninth day of Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, editor-in-chief Viktor Muchnik gathered the staff of TV2 for a meeting at their small newsroom in the Siberian city of Tomsk. New wartime laws meant the whole newsroom risked jailtime for reporting on the conflict, Muchnik told them, and TV2 had just been officially blocked by Russia’s communications watchdog, along with many other independent media outlets. “All of us who wanted to change things for the better here, at this moment we can feel we have failed,” said Muchnik, reflecting bitterly on his three decades of work at one of Russia’s most resilient media outlets. The journalists drained glasses of wine, and almost everybody cried. Then Muchnik signed resignation papers for the entire collective. A few days later, he and his wife, Viktoria, who also worked for TV2 for more than a quarter of a century, packed a couple of suitcases and flew out of Russia, probably for ever. “One reason was professional: the thing you’ve been doing for so long has been killed. The other one was human. Neither of us wanted to be inside this space, in this country which has launched a war, and living among people who support this war,” said Muchnik, in an interview in the Armenian capital Yerevan, where the couple now live, along with tens of thousands of Russians who have fled in the weeks since the war began. For years, TV2 was an anomaly in the Russian media landscape, an island of media freedom in the Siberian university town of Tomsk. From its chaotic yet idealistic beginnings as the Soviet Union collapsed, through various gritty battles with authorities, culminating in fury, defiance and ultimately defeat, the history of TV2 gives remarkable insight into Russia’s last three decades. The channel was the brainchild of Arkady Maiofis, a reporter on Soviet television who wanted to create a place for free debate in 1991 as the Soviet Union was on its last legs. At the time, Muchnik was a young history professor attracted by the idea of making political programmes; the first cameraman was a former policeman “Arkady was the only one who knew anything about television – the rest of us were straight off the street. We had one VHS camera, and we made programmes and took them to the television tower. They put it out for us,” recalled Muchnik. For entertainment, the channel showed American films: they located pirated cassettes at the market and broadcast them, happily oblivious to copyright concerns. The channel came into its own in August 1991 during the coup from reactionary forces who wanted to restore hardline Soviet rule. As the central television stations went dark, TV2 journalists got updates by calling friends in Moscow and broadcasting the latest news to viewers in Tomsk. Later, TV2 sent a two-person crew to Moscow to film events. The journalists sent the tapes back with pilots flying to Tomsk. So it was that television viewers in the heart of Siberia got more relevant information than those watching at home in Moscow, thousands of miles away. In Boris Yeltsin’s Russia, the channel’s journalists felt they were riding on a wave of freedom. Local politicians did not much like TV2, but they felt obliged to come to the studio for interviews. But then, when Vladimir Putin became president in 2000, things slowly began to change. “I didn’t like him from the start. I didn’t like his KGB background, I didn’t like his smile and his way of speaking,” said Muchnik. Gradually, the space for free programming began to shrink. It did not help that the channel was purchased by the oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who kept his promise not to interfere in editorial policy but left the authorities suspicious that the channel was his personal mouthpiece. By this time, TV2 was a media holding with several radio stations and two television channels. A nine-story building to house the media group was under construction when Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003 in a sign of Putin’s intention to make sure the oligarchs stayed out of politics. The channel survived Khodorkovsky’s arrest but the pressure on independent media outlets kept increasing. In 2007, the channel received a series of unofficial warnings from Moscow. “It was made clear: if you want to attack the mayor, that’s fine; if you want to attack the governor, that’s just about OK, but please don’t attack Putin,” said Muchnik. ”And how are you supposed to leave Putin out of it if you want to do journalism in our wonderful country? If you get into any problem, before long you arrive at the Kremlin, because that’s how the system is built,” he said.    Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny appears on a video link from prison provided at Moscow city court on 24 May. Photograph: Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP   The channel continued to host opposition figures such as Boris Nemtsov and Alexei Navalny, banned from the airwaves of most Russian television stations, when they visited Tomsk. At the end of 2013, TV2 sent a reporting team to Kyiv to cover the first stirrings of the Maidan revolution, and put out reports on the subsequent annexation of Crimea that had a very different flavour from those on state television. “Our reporting alienated us not only from the authorities but also part of our audience, who started sending us abuse,” said Muchnik. A month later, the channel was taken off the air, due to supposed technical problems, and at the end of 2014 it was formally closed down. TV2 went from a media holding with more than 250 employees to a website run by a team of 15 people. Authorities refused to register the website as a media outlet, meaning they were banned from attending press conferences or requesting official commentary. Despite this, TV2 continued to have impact beyond its modest means. During the Covid pandemic, TV2 journalists received calls from doctors, talking of a catastrophe that state television pretended didn’t exist. People sent footage of patients lying on the floor for a lack of beds. The site broke several Covid-related stories: a man who dressed up as a doctor to care for his grandmother and recorded the awful conditions in the hospital in the process, and a family who were told their grandmother had died, but when they opened the coffin found the body of a stranger. Working in these conditions was hard yet possible – but the invasion of Ukraine in February was a game-changer. A new Russian law about “fakes” meant the entire newsroom could be jailed for their coverage. In these conditions, Muchnik took the decision to close down the station. “We couldn’t convey to people what was happening in their own country, and that hurts me,” said Alexander Sakalov, a TV2 cameraman. “People don’t want to know. They want flowers and birds. Well, now all the independent media in the country will be closed down, and people will get what they wanted,” he said. Now, from Yerevan, the Muchniks keep in touch with journalists from other independent regional outlets who have also fled Russia, trying to coordinate future work. They are also working on a project called Witnesses, interviewing Russians on their feelings about the war, and how the decision changed their lives. Some are people who have fled but others are still in Russia, and decline offers to be interviewed anonymously. “Some people feel it’s important to show their faces despite the risks. If you go to a protest, you can just be arrested and nobody will see you, but this is a way for them to register that they do not agree with this war,” said Viktoria. Many of the interview subjects told the Muchniks they had fallen out with their own families over their opposition to the war, and Viktoria has had similar difficult conversations with her own mother, who is 82 and mainly watches state television. “She was so upset when we were leaving. She really wanted us to stay, and she said, ‘Why did you have to talk so much, couldn’t you have just kept quiet?’”   Related: ‘Paranoid dictator’: Russian journalists fill pro-Kremlin site with anti-war articles   Like many recent Russian emigres, the Muchniks feel bitterly disappointed that their long years of work failed to bring about a different kind of Russia, and saddened that they felt they had no choice but to flee. They hope they will be able to continue to have an influence on politics in Russia from outside the country, but are adamant that they will not return before there is political change. “It’s very difficult to exist inside this atmosphere of militaristic hysteria. We will not go back until the collapse of the regime,” said Viktor."

The call came as Russia’s assault on Ukraine’s Donbas region continues to grind on. During the 80-minute conversation, the two leaders “insisted on an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal of Russian troops”, according to a readout from Scholz’s office. Putin is unlikely to heed such calls. Instead, he warned Macron and Scholz that western weapons deliveries to Ukraine were “dangerous” and risked “further destabilisation of the situation”, according to a Kremlin readout. Hopes for diplomacy have faded in recent weeks as Russia’s invasion reaches the three-month mark. Although Ukraine is taking heavy losses on the battlefield, there is a widespread belief in the country that agreeing to a negotiated settlement would simply give Russia time to regroup ahead of a further attack. Russia’s army confirmed on Saturday that it now controls the strategic town of Lyman in eastern Ukraine, as Moscow’s assault on the Donbas region continues to grind on. Lyman, a town of 20,000 people, lies on the road to Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, two of the major Donbas population centres not yet under Russian control. “The town of Krasny Liman has been entirely liberated from Ukrainian nationalists,” said Russia’s defence ministry in a statement, using the town’s old name. Ukraine is on the back foot in Donbas, the industrial heartland of the country where Russia-backed forces already seized territory eight years ago and which has now become the centre of Moscow’s Ukraine invasion after the failed attempts to take the major cities of Kyiv and Kharkiv. In his daily video address on Friday evening, Zelenskiy, said the Russians had “concentrated maximum artillery, maximum reserves in Donbas”, making life very difficult for the Ukrainian army. “There are missile strikes and aircraft attacks – everything,” Zelenskiy said. Attention this week has been focused on the city of Sievierodonetsk, which if captured would give Russia control of the whole Luhansk region. The city has been under intense artillery and missile bombardment all week, and the Russians have taken control of the Myr hotel on the edge of town. On Saturday morning, the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said the Russians had so far not been able to advance any further than the hotel. “We have not yet been able to get them out of there, despite their losses. But they are not able to move further either. Their tactics are always the same: a few hours of shelling, and then they try to advance,” he wrote. Ukraine’s defence minister said foreign military deliveries were helping Ukrainian forces on the frontline, noting three systems that were now in active use against the Russians: M777 and FH70 howitzers as well as the Caesar self-propelled artillery. He also said American M109 howitzer systems had arrived in Ukraine. “To imagine this back in March would have been impossible. But today it is a reality,” Oleksii Reznikov wrote on Facebook. At the same time, Ukrainian officials continue to demand more weapons deliveries from the west, saying they risk being outgunned in Donbas and need the deliveries urgently. There were reports in Washington that the Pentagon may be preparing to send Ukraine advanced long-range rocket systems to help their battle in the Donbas, something that the Ukrainian army and political leaders have been requesting for months. Meanwhile, Russian forces also carried out a demonstrative test of a new hypersonic missile on Saturday. The Zircon missile, which was first tested in late 2020, was fired from a frigate in the Barents Sea and hit a target in the White Sea in the Arctic that was 625 miles away, said Russia’s defence ministry. The Zircon can reach speeds of up to 10-times the speed of sound and flies at a low altitude, making it more difficult to intercept. Also on Saturday, Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko said he was barred from leaving the country, accusing Zelenskiy of breaking a “political ceasefire” in place since the start of the war. Poroshenko was due to travel to a Nato parliamentary assembly meeting in Vilnius. Zelenskiy defeated Poroshenko in a 2019 election and before the start of the war prosecutors were investigating Poroshenko over his participation in an allegedly corrupt coal export scheme. Many observers suggested the charges were politically motivated.   Related: Biden says Putin trying to ‘wipe out’ Ukrainian culture, as prospect of retreat looms in east   After the outbreak of the war, Ukrainian authorities suspended the activities of a number of political parties with pro-Russian platforms, but others were allowed to continue, including Poroshenko’s European Solidarity party. Despite the longstanding acrimony between Zelenskiy and Poroshenko, both appeared to put their quarrels aside to focus on the threat from Russia. “There is a risk that by this decision, the authorities have broken the ‘political ceasefire’ in place during the war … which one of the pillars of national unity in the face of Russian aggression,” said Poroshenko’s office in a statement."

Ben Grant arrived in Ukraine in March, when he told the Guardian he was moved to volunteer after seeing footage of a Russian bombing of a house where a child could be heard screaming. He said he went without telling his mother, MP Helen Grant, he was going. Dramatic video footage, published by the Telegraph, follows the 30-year-old, who is a veteran of Afghanistan and a former Royal Marine, screaming: “We’ve got to move now or we’re gonna die!” Meanwhile, he and others dragged former grenadier guard Dean Arthur to safety after a Russian ambush in a woodland north of Kharkiv earlier this month. He told the newspaper of his terror, saying: “I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life.” He said he believes they were spotted by drones beforehand and the Russians had set up their lines so that when they went in, a “mass firefight broke out”. He added: “I was terrified but driven to complete my most important goal, which at the time was getting him and my team out of the danger. “What was so scary was being so limited by trying to carry someone, when I can’t pull my weapon up, while there are attack helicopters overhead and tanks firing through the woods. It was unreal – I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life.” He said his unit of 15 British and American volunteers and two Ukrainian translators had been preparing an assault on a Russian-held target earlier this month. The video footage, shot with a helmet-mounted camera, shows them attempting to treat Arthur’s leg with a tourniquet and dressing. They are heard telling him: “You’ve got to try to walk or we’re going to die, mate.” Arthur lost part of his lower left calf after kneeling on the mine but is now in hospital in Kyiv where doctors saved his leg. The group were reportedly part of a Ukrainian counter-offensive to push Russian troops out of Kharkiv. In places, they pushed them to the Russian border. Arthur, 42, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said he was in “excruciating pain”, adding that he was lucky to have escaped alive. “This type of camaraderie is only forged in these situations. If the coin was flipped, it was one of those guys, I would have got them out,” he said.

The US president told 1,200 graduating cadets in Annapolis, Maryland, on Friday: “Not only is he trying to take over Ukraine, he’s literally trying to wipe out the culture and identity of the Ukrainian people. Attacking schools, nurseries, hospitals, museums, with no other purpose than to eliminate a culture.” The Russian president tried to “Finland-ize” Europe, Biden said, but “instead he Nato-ized all of Europe”, a reference to neutral nations Finland and Sweden’s plans to join the alliance.   Related: Russia is guilty of inciting genocide in Ukraine, expert report concludes   On the ground, in the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, the situation appeared bleak, with Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, saying Ukrainian forces may need to retreat after Russian troops entered the city, the largest in Donbas still held by Ukraine. “The Russians will not be able to capture Luhansk region in the coming days as analysts have predicted,” Haidai said on Telegram, referring to Sievierodonetsk and its twin city Lysychansk across the Siverskiy Donets river. “We will have enough strength and resources to defend ourselves. However it is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat.” Haidai said 90% of buildings in the city were damaged. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accepted the situation in Donbas was “very difficult”, saying in a Friday night address that invading forces “have concentrated maximum artillery, maximum reserves” to the region. “There are missiles strikes and aircraft attacks – everything,” he said. “We are protecting our land in the way that our current defence resources allow. We are doing everything to increase them. And we will increase them. “If the occupiers think that Lyman or Sievierodonetsk will be theirs, they are wrong. Donbas will be Ukrainian.”  Interactive  Zelenskiy also appealed to European leaders for help with fuel shortages sparked by Russian airstrikes on a refinery in Kremenchuk and on oil depots across the country. Analysts believe the main Russian effort appeared still to be focused to the east, while Russian attacks elsewhere appeared to be aimed at consolidating their positions and tying down Ukrainian defenders who could otherwise be redeployed. Ukraine’s foreign minister offered a bleak assessment of fighting the east. “The military situation in eastern Ukraine is even worse than people say it is and the country needs heavy weapons now to effectively fight Russia,” Dmytro Kuleba said. His comments came as the US and its allies indicated they would provide Ukraine with increasingly sophisticated weapons, including the multiple-launch rocket systems for which Kyiv has been appealing. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, told Bloomberg UK that Putin “at great cost to himself and to the Russian military, is continuing to chew through ground in Donbas”. “He’s continuing to make gradual, slow, but I’m afraid palpable, progress and therefore it is absolutely vital that we continue to support the Ukrainians militarily,” he said. Russian troops advanced after piercing Ukrainian lines last week in the city of Popasna, south of Sievierodonetsk. Russian ground forces have now captured several villages north-west of Popasna, the UK Ministry of Defence said. Russia’s eastern gains follow a Ukrainian counter-offensive that pushed Moscow’s forces back from Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv in May. But Ukrainian forces have been unable to attack Russian supply lines to the Donbas. On Friday, the Moscow branch of Kyiv’s Orthodox church said it was cutting ties with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, declaring “full independence” in a historic move against Russia’s spiritual authorities. “We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow ... on the war,” the church said in a statement after holding a council focused on Russia’s “aggression” and declaring the “full independence and autonomy of the Ukrainian Orthodox church”. “The council condemns war as a violation of God’s commandment ‘You shall not kill!’ and expresses condolences to all those who are suffering in the war,” it said. Patriarch Kirill has expressed clear support for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. It said its relations with the Moscow leadership had been “complicated or absent” since martial law was declared in Ukraine. The council also appealed to both Ukraine and Russia to “continue the negotiation process” and find a way to “stop the bloodshed”. Speaking to AFP, church spokesman Archbishop Kliment said of Patriarch Kirill: “Not only did he fail to condemn Russia’s military aggression but he also failed to find words for the suffering Ukrainian people.” The Russian Orthodox church said it had “not received an official statement from the Ukrainian Orthodox church” and was unable to comment, spokesman Vladimir Legoida wrote on Telegram. He said the Ukrainian Orthodox church was in “a very difficult position and under pressure from many directions: from the authorities, from schemers, from nationalistic-minded people ... and the media”. Ukraine has been under Moscow’s spiritual leadership for hundreds of years, since at least the 17th century."

Vladimir Putin’s invasion to “denazify” the country has always pointed toward a purge and show trials. Now Moscow may seize on that chance. As Russia holds hundreds of prisoners from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, its proxies in east Ukraine have floated the idea of holding a “military tribunal” inspired by Nuremberg that observers say would reflect a mass show trial meant to justify Russia’s invasion to the world. “We are planning to organise an international tribunal on the republic’s territory,” said Denis Pushilin, the leader of a Russian-controlled territory in the Donetsk region. A model could be the Kharkiv trial of 1943, he said, when the Soviet military tried, convicted and executed three Germans and one Ukrainian by hanging. One key audience was the world press. Photos of the hangings were printed in Life magazine.   Related: Fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers unclear as Azovstal resistance ends   Whether the Kremlin will follow through with such a gruesome spectacle remains unclear, but the idea has found backers in the foreign ministry and among top MPs who have angrily declared that there should be no prisoner exchanges of the soldiers captured in Mariupol. The head of annexed Crimea said that a tribunal in Russian-occupied east Ukraine, where local authorities support the death penalty, would serve as a “lesson for everyone who forgot the lessons of Nuremberg”. The signalling of a great political trial has raised fears that Russia is about to pass yet another grisly landmark in its reliving of the second world war, simulating a triumphant legal process that would taint the legacy of the Nuremberg verdict. One expert called it an Orwellian distortion of the postwar language of human rights. It would be “a political trial whose aim is to present a particular narrative about the war that supports the argument about denazification that Putin has been putting forward, that supports his claim that Ukraine is being run by Nazis and that supports his claims that there are direct links between the Ukrainian collaborators during the second world war and Ukrainian soldiers today”, said Francine Hirsch, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the author of Soviet Judgment at Nuremberg: A New History of the International Military Tribunal after World War II. “I think it’s going to be used to try to present what we in the west understand as a fiction as if it’s a reality. That’s what show trials do.” With a growing focus on Russian war crimes in Ukraine, including an international investigation into the massacre of civilians in towns such as Bucha, some observers believe that Moscow may launch a military tribunal as a counter-process as more atrocities are revealed. “They’re trying to create a counterbalance because of all the talk of the international criminal court and the Ukrainian prosecutions” for war crimes said Philippe Sands, a professor of law at University College London and author of East West Street: On the Origins of Genocide and Crimes against Humanity. “I suspect … they’re creating another form of leverage for what’s going to come in due course.”    Russian servicemen frisk Ukrainian soldiers as they are evacuated from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. Photograph: AP   Sands has been part of an effort now under discussion to form a special criminal tribunal to try Russia for the crime of aggression, a charge that was originally coined at the Nuremberg trials of 1945-46 by a Soviet lawyer as “crimes against peace”. He said there was an irony to Russia’s embrace of a Nuremberg-style process that would ignore any charges for launching an illegal war against Ukraine. “For me, the crime of aggression is the beating heart of this whole issue,” said Sands. “At the end of the day, if Putin had not gone to war, none of the other crimes would have taken place.” As part of the history of the second world war, the Nuremberg trials remain a deeply personal issue for the Kremlin. The decision to propose a military tribunal is a dive deeper into what one former adviser called a historical “mania”, where terms like “denazification” are seen as having the potential to mobilise the Russian public.   Related: How Victory Day became central to Putin’s idea of Russian identity   The Kremlin “thinks this is what the public wants to see … to feel themselves a part of history”, said the former adviser, who has worked with Putin. He also said he believed that senior officials had bought into their own propaganda about the resurgence of nazism in the west. History appears to be the wellspring for both the Kremlin’s propaganda and state policy. Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia’s security council and a top Putin ally, said in an interview this week that its policies for the “denazification” of Ukraine were exactly the same as in Nazi Germany in 1945. “It’s fanaticism,” the adviser said. The Nuremberg trials that convicted Nazi war criminals reflected the political divisions of the times. Western representatives were concerned that the Soviets treated them as a repeat of their own show trials of the 1930s. The Soviet judges were appalled when Winston Churchill gave his famous “iron curtain” speech about the menace of communism while the trial was in progress. Today, Russia has wielded the trial as a shield against accusations of the crimes under Stalin. After the European parliament condemned Russian state propaganda in 2019 for “whitewashing communist crimes and glorifying the Soviet totalitarian regime”, Putin shot back that the statement “challenged the conclusions of the Nuremberg trials” and could “undermine the foundations of the entire postwar Europe”. “There’s a narrative about Nuremberg that has become really significant. It’s a narrative where the Soviets are the heroes and the Soviets are the victims but they weren’t responsible for any kinds of crimes,” said Hirsch. “There’s a way in which Nuremberg has really become a part of Russia’s patriotic education.” Now there are new concerns that Russia could use a tribunal modelled on a glorious past to whitewash its new invasion of Ukraine. “If these kinds of things happen we need to be ready for it and journalists need to really think about how do you cover this,” said Hirsch. “How do you cover something that you know is play-acting but is deadly?”"

Officials close to the Kremlin have said confidence has spread to the leadership of United Russia, the country’s ruling party, that a full-scale victory in Ukraine is possible before the end of the year. The besieged Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk appears to be almost completely surrounded by attacking Russian forces. “The Russians are pounding residential neighbourhoods relentlessly,” the governor of Ukraine’s eastern region of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, wrote in a Telegram post on Friday. The Kremlin continued to make incremental gains in its offensive in the Donbas region, backed by withering shell fire.   Interactive   The Luhansk governor has said Ukrainian forces may be forced to retreat from the zone to avoid being captured. “The Russians will not be able to capture Luhansk region in the coming days as analysts have predicted,” Haidai posted on Telegram, adding: “However it is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said the situation in Donbas is “very difficult”. In a short video address, he said Russian forces are concentrated in the coastal region of Ukraine and using “maximum artillery” reserves. The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, has stated that Vladimir Putin is “prepared to discuss a prisoner swap with Ukraine”, after holding talks with the Russian president. Nehammer also said Putin had “given signals that he is quite willing to allow exports via the seaports”, adding: “The real willingness will only become apparent when it ... is actually implemented.” Russia expects to receive 1tn rubles ($14bn) in additional oil and gas revenues this year, the country’s finance minister announced, noting that the additional income will be spent on Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The US president, Joe Biden, accused Putin of attempting to “wipe out” Ukrainian culture and identity during a speech. Biden also said that Putin inadvertently “Nato-ized all of Europe” after Sweden and Finland sought out membership in the alliance following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The US is expected to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine that could be announced as early as next week, reports CNN. The rocket systems, multiple launch rocket system or MLRS, have been a top request of Ukraine officials who say it is necessary to ward off Russia’s advancements. More than 100 Russian national guardsmen have been fired for refusing to fight in Ukraine, court documents show. The cases of the 115 national guardsmen, a force also known as Rosgvardia, appear to be the clearest indication yet of dissent among some parts of Russia’s security forces over the invasion of New UN figures have revealed that 4,031 civilians have died since Russia first invaded Ukraine in February, including 261 children.

Russia tightens its grip on the Donbas Peter Beaumont reported this week on Russia’s advances in the Donbas region, with Ukrainian officials admitting that Moscow has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east as defending forces fell back from some of their positions. Amid reports that Lyman, the site of an important railway junction, had largely been taken, Ukraine’s general staff said that Russian forces were also advancing on Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, which makes up the southern part of the Donbas, said just 5% of the region now remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% little more than a week ago. Ukraine’s president has also given an insight into the level of losses being suffered by his forces in the Donbas. “Today, from 50 to 100 people could be killed here in the most complicated area, in the east of our country,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said.

He spoke to Svitlana and Vitaly, a couple who lost almost everything, including their unborn baby, before being forced into a wearying and humiliating journey through so-called “filtration” procedures, followed by forced deportation to Russia. “There’s nothing there,” Vitaly said bitterly. “Nothing. It’s over. Mariupol is over.” Meanwhile, Andrew Roth reported on Russia’s deployment of mobile propaganda vans with large-screen televisions to humanitarian aid points in the captured city as the Kremlin has pushed forward with efforts to integrate newly occupied territories across the south of Ukraine. “The practice of ‘there is nothing to eat, so feed them lies’ is gaining momentum,” wrote Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol. It’s “cynicism of the highest level”.    A man walks with a bicycle in a street damaged by shelling in Mariupol. Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/AP   The Guardian documents Russia’s use of illegal weapons As prosecutors investigate alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine, reporters Lorenzo Tondo and Isobel Koshiw, and photographer Alessio Mamo revealed the evidence they discovered on the ground: cluster bombs, fléchettes and unguided missiles on residential areas. On 1 March, a Russian air force jet dropped a series of 250kg Soviet-era FAB-250 bombs over Borodyanka, north of Kyiv – explosives designed to hit military targets such as enemy fortifications and bunkers. The bombs fell on at least five residential buildings, splitting them in two. Dozens of bodies were found under the rubble when the Russians withdrew. Bellingcat, a not-for-profit online journalism collective dedicated to war crime investigations, reviewed some of the pictures collected by the Guardian and confirmed the presence of cluster bombs in towns and villages occupied by the Russians. The weapons, banned in more than 100 countries (but not the US, Russia or Ukraine) were unleashed in areas with no military personnel and no military infrastructure. ‘I lost everything’    Ivan Mishchenko in the ruins of his farmhouse. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian   Lorenzo Tondo met Ivan Mishchenko, a farmer in a small village north of Kyiv whose plight mirrors that of hundreds like him and has worsened food insecurity around the world. Their businesses were devastated by a war that has unleashed economic devastation in the country and threatened famine elsewhere. And like other farmers in Ukraine, Mishchenko’s few hectares of surviving wheat fields cannot be harvested due to the shortage of fuel in the region and after his harvester and other machinery were destroyed by shelling. “The war will absolutely cause grain shortage and perhaps hunger,” Mishchenko said.

194,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/27/russia-guilty-inciting-genocide-ukraine-expert-report,2022-05-27T17:45:42Z,"Russia is guilty of inciting genocide in Ukraine, expert report concludes","Russia is guilty of inciting genocide and having the intent to commit genocide in Ukraine, legally obliging other countries to stop it, according to a new report by more than 30 internationally recognised legal scholars and experts. The report, compiled by two thinktanks, the New Lines Institute in Washington and the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights in Montreal, found that there were “reasonable grounds to conclude” that Russia is already in breach of two articles of the 1948 Genocide Convention, by publicly inciting genocide, and by the forcible transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia, which the report notes is itself a genocidal act under article II of the convention. The report concludes there is “a serious risk of genocide in Ukraine, triggering the legal obligation of all states to prevent genocide” under the convention. States will not be able to say they were unaware of the risk, it warns, but neither the report nor the 1948 convention stipulates what actions foreign governments should take. The report just notes “a minimum legal obligation on states to take reasonable action to contribute toward preventing genocide and protecting vulnerable Ukrainian civilians from the imminent risk of genocide”. Joe Biden labelled Russian atrocities in Ukraine as genocide in April, and some other governments have followed suit, though the state department said it was ultimately up to a court to determine. The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court, Karim Khan, is leading an investigation of war crimes and has the authority to bring charges of genocide if he feels there is evidence of intent to “destroy, in whole or in part”, the Ukrainian people. “I’ve never seen anything like this report this early during a conflict,” said Tanya Domi, one of the expert contributors to the report, and an adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs. “I think the documentation of crimes in Ukraine outstrips anything that we’ve seen in the recent past.”   Related: Filtration and forced deportation: Mariupol survivors on the lasting terrors of Russia’s assault   The report finds ample evidence of incitement to genocide, noting the Kremlin leadership and Russian state media commentators have consistently denied the existence of a distinct Ukrainian identity, “implying that those who self-identify as Ukrainian threaten the unity of Russia or are Nazis, and are therefore deserving of punishment”. “Denial of the existence of protected groups is a specific indicator of genocide under the United Nations guide to assessing the risk of mass atrocities,” the report said. It also looked at the language used by Russian officials depicting Ukrainians as somehow subhuman, with terms like “zombified”, “bestial” or “subordinate”, or as diseased or contaminated, using words like “scum” and “filth”. “What they’re saying is: if you’re Ukrainian you’re a Nazi, and therefore we’re going to kill you,” Domi said. “They are saying this is a Nazi regime and that means that they are pursuing Ukrainians and the Ukrainian state for the purposes of elimination and destruction.” By issuing blanket denials of the atrocities and by rewarding soldiers suspected of mass killings, as Putin did with the units that were in Bucha at the time of the mass killings of civilians there, the Kremlin is enabling Russian forces to commit more war crimes and conditioning the Russian public to condone them, the report said. The public incitement at the time of the invasion points towards a genocidal plan, the experts argue, as does the pattern of atrocities committed: the mass killings, the shelling of shelters and evacuation routes, and the indiscriminate bombardment of residential areas. In that category, the report points to the sieges of cities such as Mariupol, the 248 attacks on Ukraine’s healthcare system documented by the World Health Organization, and the destruction or seizure of basic necessities, humanitarian aid and grain. A systematic pattern of rape and sexual violence is also part of an overall picture of atrocities that point towards genocidal intent, the experts said, as is the forcible transfer of over a million people to Russia, including more than 180,000 children. The report cites Ukrainian officials as pointing to planned reforms in Russian legislation to accelerate adoption procedures for children from the Donbas, while abducted Ukrainian children have been forced to take Russian classes. “I think the forced transfers of people is just one of the most egregious crimes because that shows intent to remove them from their country. There is no ability of those individuals to resist,” Domi said. The international court of justice ruled in 2007 that state parties to the Genocide Convention had an obligation to take preventive action when they learn of, or should have learned of, the existence of a serious risk that genocide will be committed. “Each state then will determine whether it has the means to help deter those suspected of preparing genocide and take action as the circumstances permit,” David Scheffer, a former US ambassador at large for war crimes issues and now a senior fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations, said. “There are many options: provision of military weaponry, humanitarian and refugee aid, economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and even military intervention, that complies with the UN Charter.”"

Russia has continued to make incremental gains in the Donbas region, backed by shelling. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said Russian forces have surrounded two-thirds of Sievierodonetsk. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Kremlin of carrying out a “genocide” in the country’s east. He said Ukraine was not eager to talk to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but that it had to face the reality it would probably be necessary to end the war. Russia did not appear to be ready for serious peace talks, he added. More than 30 leading legal scholars and genocide experts concluded that Russia is inciting genocide in Ukraine and committing atrocities intended to destroy the Ukrainian people. Their independent report accused the Russian state of violating several articles of the UN Genocide Convention, according to CNN. The Kremlin blamed Ukraine for frozen peace talks, saying it was unclear what Kyiv wanted. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused the leadership in Kyiv of making “contradictory statements” that do “not allow us to fully understand what the Ukrainian side wants”. Ukrainian authorities have issued contradictory statements about their control over the strategic city of Lyman in  Donetsk. A presidential adviser said he had unverified information that Ukraine had lost Lyman, while Ukraine’s armed forces said Russian troops were trying to strengthen their positions in the city. The governor of the region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said there was heavy fighting around the city after Ukrainian troops withdrew to a new line of defence. Russian media reported that pro-Russian separatists had seized the city. Ten people were killed and at least 35 were injured after Russian missile strikes hit the Dnipropetrovsk region in central-eastern Ukraine on Friday morning, according to reports. Regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, said rescuers were working in the rubble to look for possible survivors in the aftermath of “an unquiet night and an unquiet morning”. The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, said Russia was making “slow but palpable progress” in Donbas. He said Ukraine should be supplied with long-range multiple launch rocket systems to help Kyiv’s embattled forces, but stopped short of committing the UK to send the powerful M270 rocket system, which Kyiv has been pleading for from Britain, the US and other Nato members for several weeks. Kharkiv was hit by new strikes amid fears the city is still on Russia’s agenda. At least nine civilians were killed, including a child, and 19 were injured, authorities said. Residents have been urged to shelter. Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said “doctors are providing all necessary assistance” and that there were no further casualties overnight. Officials in Ukraine have admitted  Russia has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east. The governor of the Luhansk region said only 5% of the area remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% just over a week ago – and that Ukrainian forces were retreating in some areas.  "

Volodymyr Zelenskiy rarely gives casualty figures but Ukraine’s president said last Sunday that “50 to 100 Ukrainian troops die on Donbas frontlines each day”, meaning perhaps 3,000 a month in the grisly war of attrition.
Wounded will typically be three or perhaps four times as much, a serious loss for a Donbas defence force estimated at 30,000 before the war began, although the numbers increased following Ukraine’s mass mobilisation.
“Russian forces have secured more terrain in the past week than efforts earlier in May,” reported the Institute for the Study of War on Tuesday, in particular approaching the frontline city of Sievierodonetsk and in villages nearby.
“The shelling of Sievierodonetsk is growing exponentially,” said Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Ukraine’s Luhansk region, which is now 95% controlled by the Russians. He estimated 10,000 Russian troops and an extra 2,500 pieces of equipment had been committed to the attack.

The Russian advances are not dramatic but they reflect a new strategy. Gone for now are the attempts at wider encirclements of Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, which included a failed river crossing in early May. Instead units are focused on smaller encirclements – or “cauldrons” – and a sheer concentration at Sievierodonetsk.
That was confirmed by the militia head of the self-proclaimed pro-Russian republic in Donetsk, Eduard Basurin, who said Russian forces had adopted an approach of creating smaller encirclements to deprive Ukrainian troops of logistics and reinforcements, rather than pursuing a single large one.







Russian efforts in the Donbas have also been aided by shorter supply lines over the border into Russia as well as a dense network of railway lines in the parts of Luhansk occupied by pro-Russian forces since 2014. And forces previously thrown into the failed attempt to take Kyiv continue to arrive.

It follows the appointment by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of Gen Aleksandr Dvornikov to lead the fight. Infamous as the “Butcher of Syria” he also commanded a motor rifle division that devastated Grozny in the late 1990s. Dvornikov has brought the same tactics to Ukraine.
Nick Reynolds, a land warfare expert at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said the Russians had engaged in “progressive reorientation of their operations towards increasingly modest objectives” allowing them to take villages such as Popasna and Rubizhne, although he argued “their ground forces are still performing badly” as demonstrated by the reliance on artillery.
Others are not so sure. An anxious Kyiv continues to plead with the west for more powerful weapons. The latest demand is for M270 long-range multiple rocket launchers. On Friday, after a to and fro lasting several weeks, it appears the US now appears to be willing to provide some, after previously refusing.
The M270 comes in many versions but it can use missiles with a range of over 100 miles (165km), while the British version has a limit of 52 miles. Both are well beyond anything Ukraine has and would be a significant addition to Kyiv’s arsenal at a time when the country continues to have a pressing requirement for western arms.
When asked what Ukraine needed at present, Kira Rudik, a Ukrainian MP visiting the UK, said “the first and the foremost is weapons always”, arguing her country and the west “should not underestimate Russia right now” just because Moscow’s forces had, until earlier this week at least, made limited progress in the Donbas.
Rudik said she spoke to Ukrainian soldiers on the frontline every day. But an ongoing problem, she acknowledged, was that it can take two months or more for promised western weaponry to arrive, another reason why Russia may be enjoying a tactical advantage.
Ukraine’s fundamental problem is that while it may have fought off the attacks on Kyiv and Kharkiv in the first phase of the three month-long war, it has not been able to reverse Russia’s territorial gains in the south and east.

That means it has incurred human and economic losses far greater than Russia. Nearly 13 million people have been displaced by the fighting, the UN estimates. Its economy is set to fall 45% this year, according to the World Bank, and the country cannot balance its books. Its strategic exports of grain – 99% of which used to travel by ports blockaded or held by Russia – lie in silos where 22m tonnes are at risk of rotting.
Meanwhile, it may have taken three months for Russia to take the port of Mariupol, ruining and depopulating the city in the process, but this week minesweepers were clearing the beaches and the port, which Moscow hopes to reopen to create a fresh supply line from Russia to the occupied south.
A threat for Ukraine remains western fatigue, or a loss of unity, particularly if a largely stalemated war drags on towards next year. Countries traditionally less hostile to Russia may follow the suggestion of the veteran diplomat Henry Kissinger at the Davos summit this week, to consider pressing Ukraine to agree to a partition.
There are signs Russia is happy with the current pace. The defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, claimed on Tuesday the offensive was being slowed “deliberately in order to avoid civilian casualties” – and while there is plenty of evidence to the contrary about harm to ordinary Ukrainians from Russian shelling, it also suggests a country being prepared for a longer war.
Phil Osborn, a former head of UK defence intelligence, said the military situation was such that Ukraine needed as much help as it could get.
“The west must focus unremittingly on Ukraine and be prepared for pain. Putin calculates that we will be increasingly distracted (just look at the news cycle moving on and the ‘reasonable’ voices nudging Zelenskiy to settle) and that he has more patience than the west.”"

But the prime minister stopped short of committing the UK to sending the powerful M270 rocket system, which Kyiv has been pleading for from Britain, the US and other Nato members for several weeks. Johnson said the MLRS would enable Ukraine “to defend themselves against this very brutal Russian artillery, and that’s where the world needs to go” in an interview with Bloomberg Television. He added that Putin’s forces were “continuing to chew through ground” in the Donbas region, making “slow, but I’m afraid palpable, progress” as they close in on Sievierodonetsk, the easternmost city held by Ukraine. Johnson’s comments appear to confirm that there has been a significant change of stance over the weapons among western nations. The US previously rejected Ukraine’s request for the long-range rockets but overnight, briefings suggested that the White House was now willing to supply them. An announcement could come next week, CNN reported, for a weapon that could have a significant impact on the fighting. Far more powerful than conventional artillery, M270 MLRS rockets have a maximum range of more than 100 miles (165km) and up to 12 projectiles a minute can be fired from an armoured vehicle. Their firepower goes far beyond the original commitment made by Nato members to only send “defensive systems” to Ukraine when the war began. The British M270 has a range of 52 miles although 44 of the army’s stock are being upgraded to 93 miles. Ukraine’s existing conventional artillery has a maximum range of roughly 15 miles, including the M177 howitzers supplied by the US army to help fend off the Russians in Donbas. The surface-to-surface rockets are made by Lockheed Martin and have been bought by the US, UK and nearly 30 other countries. Some smaller countries had been willing to send MLRS weapons via larger third countries, but to the frustration of the Ukrainians the larger nations had not been willing to go ahead. Kira Rudik, a Ukrainian MP with the centrist Golos party, said on a visit to the UK that Ukraine was in need of more powerful arms. “There’s this discussion of getting us more MLRS systems. I know that the British government is right now deciding on if they can get to us from the United Kingdom and that will be fantastic. That is something that we exactly need right now,” she said."

The cases of the 115 national guardsmen, a force also known as Rosgvardia, came to light on Wednesday, after a local Russian court rejected their collective lawsuit that challenged their earlier sacking. According to the court’s decision, published on its website, the lawsuit was dismissed after the judge determined that the soldiers had been rightfully fired for “refusing to perform an official assignment” to fight in Ukraine and instead returned to a duty station. The appeal took place in Nalchik, the capital of the Kabardino-Balkarian republic in the Russian Caucasus, where the unit is based. Since Moscow’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, its military has reportedly been plagued by poor morale, with reports of soldiers claiming they did not know they were going to war until they crossed into Ukraine. The Pentagon said this month that it had seen “anecdotal reports” that “mid-grade officers at various levels, even up to the battalion level”, had “either refused to obey orders” or were not obeying them with the expected measure of “alacrity”. Andrei Sabinin, the lawyer who represented the 115 soldiers, said the court’s decision was “unprecedentedly quick” given the complexity of the case. “I express doubts about the fairness of the process as a whole because my clients were denied to call up certain witnesses and several documents were rejected by the court.” According to Sabinin, the commanders of the Rosgvardia unit offered the soldiers the option not to fight and their dismissal was illegal. Russia created Rosgvardia, a militarised force separate from the army, in 2016 to fight terrorism and maintain public order. Since its inception, members of Rosgvardia, which is often referred to as Vladimir Putin’s “private army”, have mostly been involved in crackdowns on peaceful anti-government protests. Military analysts have linked Russia’s heavy use of Rosgvardia soldiers in Ukraine to Moscow’s strategic aims of capturing and holding major Ukrainian cities, including Kharkiv and the capital, Kyiv. These plans failed, while Rosgvardia units suffered heavy casualties after Ukrainian cities remained battlegrounds rather than being captured by Russia, which left Rosgvardia units exposed to Ukrainian attacks. Documents acquired by the Guardian on Friday from a separate criminal case against a Siberian journalist further reveal Rosgvardia’s role in Ukraine. Mikhail Afanasyev, the chief editor of Novy Fokus in the Russian region of Khakassia, was arrested by security forces last month over the website’s reporting on a separate Rosgvardia unit that also refused deployment to Ukraine. Court testimonies given by members of the Rosgvardia unit mentioned in Afanasyev’s reporting confirm earlier reports that 11 Rosgvardia from Khakassia refused to fight. The testimonies also give weight to suggestions that the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine was intended initially as a blitzkrieg attack on Kyiv with the aim of capturing the capital. In one testimony, a Roskgvardia soldier told the court that his commander instructed his unit three days prior to the invasion that they would be sent to Ukraine to “patrol the streets and intersections of Kyiv”. “The commander explained that all employees of the national guard and the Russian armed forces were assigned specific tasks during the special operation in Ukraine. The task of our detachment and for all the other detachments that were stationed with us was to guard the streets and intersections of Kyiv,” said the testimony, seen by the Guardian. The content of the court documents was first reported by the regional independent outlet Tayga.info. A month into the war, Moscow was forced to switch its offensive to more limited objectives after running into fierce Ukrainian resistance, with the army prioritising what it calls the “liberation” of the Donbas region. But despite a recent string of military successes in the Donbas, the Kremlin this week was confronted with two incidents of rare public dissent from Russian officials. On Wednesday, Boris Bondarev, a career diplomat posted to the Russian mission to the UN in Geneva, became the highest-level Russian diplomat to denounce the war, publishing a scathing letter in which he wrote that he was “ashamed” of his country and called the invasion a “disaster.” And on Friday, two communist lawmakers from the Khabarovsky Krai in the far east of Siberia urged Putin to end the Ukraine conflict. “If our country does not halt the military operation then there will be even more orphans in our country,” lawmaker Leonid Vasyukevich said, according to a video of the meeting. “During a military operation, people become disabled. These are young people who could be of great use to our country,” he added. “We demand an immediate withdrawal of the Russian troops.” "
