The name refers to the former Del Posto and Daniel chef Melissa J. Rodriguez, who is partnering with Jeff Katz and James Kent of Crown Shy and Saga to develop this sprawling space. (Al Coro, a lavish Italian restaurant, and Discolo, a lower-level lounge, will open in the Del Posto space in early summer.) Mel’s is done warmly in orange tones and polished light wood, a bar and a dining counter open into a rear dining room, and a huge wood-fired pizza oven is central to the space. “Everything is cooked with wood,” Ms. Rodriguez said. “There’s no gas here.” The pizzas start with Margherita but quickly veer into creative territory: mushrooms, smoked mozzarella and shaved shallots; and kale, basil pesto, ricotta and preserved lemon. Many appetizers, like roasted parsnips with robiola cheese, roasted maitake mushrooms with soppressata piccante, and charred shrimp, are wood fired, as are mains like whole fish, whole roasted cauliflower and strip steak. Unlike at most pizzerias, dessert is neither an afterthought nor skippable. Consider milk chocolate gelato with dark chocolate sable swirl; salted caramel and fior di latte gelato with caramel sauce and shortbread crumble; or an Italian rainbow cookie hot fudge sundae, a tribute to Little Italy. The timing of the opening is calculated so that Ms. Rodriguez, a Culinary Institute of America graduate, has several months to get Mel’s in order before Al Coro is unveiled.
