Decisions to declassify intelligence are “always very complicated ones,” Burns said at the Billington Cybersecurity annual summit in Washington, D.C. “But I think when President Biden has decided very carefully and very selectively to, you know, make public some of our secrets, it’s played a very effective role over the course of the last six months,” Burns said. The CIA director said he expected the practice to continue “if we make it the exception, not the rule because the surest way, I’ve certainly found in a year and a half now as director of CIA, to lose access to good intelligence is to be reckless about how you handle it.” Burns added that U.S. intelligence will continue to play a role in “ensuring that Putin fails in Ukraine.” Burns did not mention the current legal and political battle over an FBI search that found classified and sensitive government documents at former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The director’s comments came the same week that the Biden administration shared intelligence alleging Russia had turned to North Korea to buy millions of artillery rounds and that Moscow had orchestrated the forcible deportation of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to Russia. The accounts were the latest in a series of publicly released intelligence reports that the White House has released during the course of the six-month-old war in Ukraine, starting with U.S. warnings that Russia planned to invade its neighbor. The administration often has used the declassified intelligence to warn of possible Russian actions and draw attention to Russian military failings. The strategy has won praise from both sides of the aisle in Congress. At a congressional hearing earlier this year, Burns, a former ambassador to Russia, told lawmakers that “in all the years I spent as a career diplomat, I saw too many instances in which we lost information wars with the Russians.” Now, Burns said, “by being careful about this we have stripped away the pretext that Putin, in particular, often uses.” “That has been a real benefit, I think, to Ukrainians,” he said. At the cybersecurity event Thursday, Burns said the U.S. intelligence agencies had a clear picture of Russia’s invasion planning last fall, citing what he called Putin’s “sense of destiny and his appetite for risk.” “And nowhere was that sense of destiny or that risk appetite greater than on his fixation with controlling Ukraine,” Burns said. The CIA director, a career diplomat who rose to senior positions in previous administrations, said Putin misjudged Ukraine, wrongly assumed Washington would lose interest in Ukraine and was “profoundly wrong in his assumptions.”"
2022-09-08,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/blinken-makes-unannounced-trip-ukraine-nuclear-fears-rise-rcna46766,"Blinken makes unannounced trip to Ukraine, pledges $2.6 billion in security assistance to region","Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Ukraine Thursday for an undisclosed trip, his third visit to the country since Russia launched its invasion in late February. He landed in the country after an overnight flight and met with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, just hours after Ukraine’s military chief publicly warned of the threat of Russia using nuclear weapons in the conflict. Later in the day, Blinken met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who presented him with a special medal awarded to people for distinguished service of the state. During the meeting, Blinken announced a $675 million drawdown of U.S. arms and equipment for Ukraine, confirmed by a senior Department of State official earlier in the day. The 20th drawdown since September 2021, which Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin mentioned in remarks to allies in Germany earlier Thursday, includes additional arms, munitions and equipment from U.S. military inventories. Blinken also announced that the State Department is notifying Congress that it will make $2 billion available in long-term investments to strengthen the security of Ukraine and 18 other neighboring countries, including many NATO allies. ""In total, the secretary will announce $2.6 billion in additional security assistance for Ukraine and its neighbors today. These announcements will bring the total U.S. military assistance for Ukraine to approximately $15.2 billion since the beginning of this administration,"" the State Department official said. In the city of Irpin, located near Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv, Blinken shook hands and spoke with local leaders near bombed-out, deserted apartment buildings. Khrystyna Podyryaka, director of the National Police of Ukraine's War Crimes Investigation Unit, told Blinken that they were investigating 30,000 recorded war crimes, including 20,000 that directly involve the civilian population. Blinken reiterated the importance of holding Russia accountable and investigating war crimes. Blinken’s visit comes on the heels of a call last month with Kuleba, in which he reinforced U.S. support for Ukraine’s defense needs. President Joe Biden later announced a $3 billion package to train and equip Ukrainian armed forces. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has mocked the West’s response to the war, saying Wednesday that his nation had “not lost anything” amid a host of sanctions that targeted elites and services that helped finance the ongoing invasion. Ukraine also faces nuclear concerns regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest. On Wednesday, Ukraine called for the residents of Russian-occupied areas around the power plant to evacuate for their own safety. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the nuclear plant, risking a nuclear disaster. Blinken’s trip comes roughly four months after he visited Ukraine with Austin. At the time, Blinken said they weren’t able to visit much of Kyiv or speak to many people due to security concerns."
2022-09-08,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-forced-deportations-russia-un-filtration-rcna46804,"Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians forcibly deported to Russia, U.S. says","The United States said Wednesday it has evidence that “hundreds of thousands” of Ukrainian citizens have been interrogated, detained and forcibly deported to Russia in “a series of horrors” overseen by officials from Russia’s presidency. Russia immediately dismissed the allegation as “fantasy,” calling it the latest invention in a Western disinformation campaign. NBC News has not verified the claims. The charge came during a Security Council meeting called by the United States and Albania to discuss Russia’s “filtration operations.” That involves Ukrainians voluntarily fleeing the war in their homeland and those forcibly being moved to Russia passing through a series of “filtration points” where treatment allegedly ranges from interrogations, data collection and strip searches to being yanked aside, tortured, sent to a detention center in Russia and never seen again. US. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said estimates from a variety of sources, including the Russian government, indicate that Russian authorities have interrogated, detained and forcibly deported between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainians. She said they are sent to Russia, often to isolated regions in its far eastern regions. “These operations aim to identify individuals Russia deems insufficiently compliant or compatible to its control,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “And there is mounting and credible evidence that those considered threatening to Russian control because of perceived pro-Ukrainian leanings are `disappeared’ or further detained.” Russia’s presidency is not only coordinating filtration operations but is providing lists of Ukrainians to be targeted for filtration, she added. She said estimates indicate thousands of children have been subject to filtration, “some separated from their families and taken from orphanages before being put up for adoption in Russia.” According to U.S. information, “more than 1,800 children were transferred from Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine to Russia” just in July, she said."
2022-09-07,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/zaporizhzhia-ukraine-evacuation-russia-occupied-nuclear-plant-town-rcna46675,Ukraine calls for evacuation of Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant town,"Ukraine on Wednesday called for the residents of Russian-occupied areas around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to evacuate for their own safety. Moscow and Kyiv accuse each other of shelling the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, risking a nuclear disaster. “I appeal to the residents of the districts adjacent to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant .... evacuate! Find a way to get to (Ukrainian) controlled territory,” Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a post on the Telegram messaging service. The exiled Ukrainian mayor of Enerhodar, the main town serving the plant, said in a separate Telegram post that it was under fire from Russian forces and that it had no electrical supply. “The intervals between provocations are becoming shorter and shorter,” Dmytro Orlov, the mayor, wrote. He said the plant’s employees did not have time to repair the installation “as another shelling nullifies their work and they have to start all over again.” Orlov added that residents should stockpile drinking water and food that did not require cooking. It is now impossible to predict the timing of the restoration of electricity supply. Russia denies targeting civilians and accuses Kyiv of shelling the nuclear plant. The call to evacuate followed a warning from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which said on Tuesday that there was an “urgent” need to establish a “security protection zone” at the Russian-held power plant in order to prevent a nuclear catastrophe. “The situation in Ukraine is unprecedented,” the United Nations nuclear watchdog warned. “It is the first time a military conflict has occurred amid the facilities of a large, established nuclear power” program, it said in a report. A nuclear accident would be a disaster not just for Ukraine, but also for the countries “beyond its borders,” it said. “We in this case have the historical, ethical imperative to prevent something from happening,” Rafael Grossi, head of the IAEA, later told the U.N. Security Council. “We can agree on a very simple but incredibly necessary protective mechanism to avoid what is happening now, as we speak, which is the shelling of a nuclear power plant,” he added."
2022-09-07,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/runaway-chimpanzee-kharkiv-zoo-escape-ukraine-raincoat-rcna46595,Video shows runaway chimpanzee return to Kharkiv zoo on bicycle ,"KYIV, Ukraine — The risks of wandering in war-torn Kharkiv alone did not seem to faze Chichi, the runaway chimpanzee whose escapades this week have made her famous on social media. It was not until a timely intervention from the heavens in the form of rain that her Ukrainian zookeepers were able to persuade her to return home — with a little help from a raincoat and a bicycle. The 13-year-old female chimpanzee escaped from Kharkiv Zoo on Monday, with zookeepers tracking her down about two hours later in the northeastern city’s Freedom Square, not far away. Video shows Chichi eventually being persuaded to put on a yellow hooded rain jacket, before being returned home perched on a bicycle, after briefly roaming through Ukraine's second largest city. Videos of the incident have been shared widely, offering both a rare moment of levity in the thick of Russia's war and an insight into the plight of animals in Ukraine whose homes have also come under bombardment. “Chimpanzees are highly intellectual creatures, it wasn’t difficult to her to break the fence and leave,” Victoria Kozyreva, the zookeeper at Kharkiv Zoo who helped persuade Chichi to return home, told NBC News on Wednesday. ""After I heard that she left, I followed her to the square and began to talk to her."" Kozyreva, who has known Chichi since the primate's childhood, can be seen approaching her and helping her put on the yellow jacket in the video. It took careful negotiations, she said, to overcome the chimp's initial skepticism. ""It wasn’t difficult to convince her. All that's needed is negotiations,” the 45-year-old zookeeper said. ""There was rain. I talked to her and invited with my jacket, helped to put it on and gave her a hug."" Chichi, who once resided at the Feldman Ecopark in the city’s northern suburbs, was relocated to Kharkiv Zoo after heavy fighting in early March, shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country. The ecopark has since permanently closed due to the conflict, which has seen Kharkiv continue to face deadly shelling. Chichi's escape from her enclosure at Kharkiv Zoo was likely made easier by the fact that she used to be kept behind an electric fence at her home before the war, said Serhii Kuvshar, who was Chichi’s caretaker at the ecopark and has also known her since childhood. He speculated that Chichi may have escaped from her enclosure because she was bored, given the lack of recent attention from a public understandably distracted by their own shattered lives. ""They are fed up and bored to see zookeepers only,"" Kuvshar said of chimpanzees in Ukraine. ""They do like to boast in front of the people about what they can do, they like when people admire them, it is a great joy for them to communicate with people,"" he said. Around 4,000 animals from the ecopark were evacuated to other sanctuaries across Ukraine at the beginning of the invasion, according to the zoo. Six zoo personnel were killed in the shelling, it said. While Chichi's adventure ended happily, Kozyreva said many of the primates were suffering due to the war. “All of them have PTSD now, they experienced real hell, they saw how their relatives died,"" she said, referring to post-traumatic stress disorder. ""They understand everything."" Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv, Rhoda Kwan reported from Taipei, Taiwan, and Matteo Moschella reported from London."
2022-09-07,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-mocks-west-russia-sanctions-ukraine-war-china-xi-rcna46598,"Putin mocks West, says Russia will press on in Ukraine","Russian President Vladimir Putin mocked the West’s response to his invasion of Ukraine on Wednesday, insisting that his country had “not lost anything” after the “sanctions frenzy.” Vowing that Moscow would press on with its military action, he said that Russia had “resisted the economic, financial and technological aggression of the West.” “I’m sure that we haven’t lost anything and we won’t lose anything,” Putin told an annual economic forum in Russia’s far-eastern port city of Vladivostok. “The most important gain is the strengthening of our sovereignty, it’s an inevitable result of what’s going on.” He added that the economic and financial situation in Russia had stabilized, consumer prices inflation had slowed down and unemployment has remained low. Putin said that “a certain polarization is taking place, both in the world and inside the country,” something he said he thought was “only for the best.” “Everything unnecessary, harmful and everything that keeps us from moving forward will be abandoned,” he said, adding that Western sanctions were “a danger to the entire world.” Taking aim at foreign corporations that have pulled out of Russia since the invasion, Putin said that many European companies were now folding because of their choice to leave. He added that Western attempts to cap prices for Russian oil and gas were “stupid” and Moscow will have enough customers in Asia. “The demand is so high on global markets that we won’t have any problem selling it,” Putin said. “Any attempt to limit prices by administrative means is just ravings, it’s sheer nonsense,” he added. “It will only lead to a hike in prices.” The confrontation with the West over Ukraine has prompted Russia to embark on a hurried tilt toward Asia, and particularly China, once a junior partner of the former Soviet Union and now the world’s second largest economy. “Emerging states and regions around the world, primarily, of course, in the Asia-Pacific region, now play a substantially bigger role,” he said. Putin said that the West was failing because a futile and aggressive attempt to isolate Russia with sanctions was destroying the global economy just as Asia was rising to claim the future. Putin and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, will meet next week at a summit in Uzbekistan, a Russian official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. If it goes ahead, it will be Xi’s first foreign trip in 2½ years. The pair last met in Beijing in February, weeks before the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine. Putin also rejected the European Union’s argument that Russia was using energy as a weapon by suspending gas supplies via the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline to Germany. He reaffirmed the Russian argument that Western sanctions have hampered maintenance of the last turbine that remains in operation, forcing its shutdown. Putin repeated that Moscow stands ready to “press the button” and start pumping gas “as early as tomorrow” through the Nord Stream 2, which has been put on hold by the German authorities."
2022-09-07,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/un-nuclear-watchdog-calls-security-protection-zone-russian-held-zapori-rcna46446,U.N. nuclear watchdog calls for a 'security protection zone' around the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant ,"There is an ""urgent"" need to establish a ""security protection zone"" at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine to prevent a nuclear catastrophe, the International Atomic Energy Agency declared Tuesday. ""The situation in Ukraine is unprecedented,"" the United Nations nuclear watchdog warned. ""It is the first time a military conflict has occurred amid the facilities of a large, established nuclear power"" program, it said in a report. A nuclear accident would be a disaster not just for Ukraine, but also for the countries ""beyond its borders."" ""The IAEA is ready to start immediately the consultations leading to the urgent establishment of such a nuclear safety and security protection zone"" at the plant, the IAEA said. The dire warning from the Vienna-based organization that is not given to hyperbole came just 24 hours after the Ukrainian energy company that runs the Zaporizhzhia complex reported that the last line connecting the power plant to the Ukrainian electrical grid was disconnected after days of ""intensive shelling."" The three other lines went down earlier in the war. “We are playing with fire, and something very, very catastrophic could take place,” Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, warned the U.N. Security Council, days after leading an inspection visit to the plant. At the Security Council meeting, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres likewise demanded that Russian and Ukrainian forces commit to halting all military activity around the plant and agree on a “demilitarized perimeter.” ""The current situation is untenable and the best action to ensure the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and its people would be for this armed conflict to end now,"" the IAEA report states. “The world is once again on the brink of a nuclear disaster,” Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko said earlier on Facebook. The Zaporizhzhia plant in the southeastern Ukrainian town of Enerhodar went online in the 1980s when the country was part of the then-Soviet Union and provided up to 20% of Ukraine's power after independence. Its six reactors generate more power than any such facility in the United States. But it was captured in the early days of the Russian invasion, which began in February. The IAEA inspectors made it to the Zaporizhzhia plant Sept. 1 and since then they have been evaluating the damage at the site, assessing its safety and security systems, and interviewing the Ukrainian staffers who have kept the facility going. Before the war, the Ukrainian plant employed 11,000 staffers. How many remain was not immediately clear. But the IAEA has left two inspectors at the plant. ""The IAEA is still gravely concerned about the situation at the ZNPP — this hasn’t changed,"" the watchdog group said in its report, referring to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. ""The Seven Pillars have all been compromised at the site."" The Seven Pillars refers to the IAEA's seven core nuclear safety standards, the first of which states: ""The physical integrity of the facilities — whether it is the reactors, fuel ponds, or radioactive waste stores — must be maintained."" The West has accused Russia of heightening the risk of a nuclear disaster by using the plant as a ""shield"" where it stations troops and weapons — and launches attacks on other Ukrainian targets from the site. Russia has denied the accusations and has, in turn, accused Ukraine of repeatedly attacking the plant. The IAEA has warned that the consequences of a war-induced meltdown at the plant would be far-reaching and “much more terrible” than those from the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant near the northern Ukrainian city of Pripyat. That catastrophe sparked the evacuation of more than 100,000 people living near the plant and resulted in a radioactive cloud that drifted across most of Europe and was blamed for cancer spikes — especially in children — in both Ukraine and neighboring Belarus. The Zaporizhzhia plant is almost twice the size of Chernobyl, although its reactors are more modern, experts told NBC News earlier."
2022-09-06,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-buying-north-korean-rockets-artillery-use-ukraine-rcna46382,Russia is buying North Korean rockets and artillery to use in Ukraine,"Russia is in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to use in Ukraine, a senior U.S. defense official said, an indication that Western sanctions are severely hampering Moscow's military supply effort. Russia is seeking help from Kim Jong Un's regime at a time when it is also leaning on Iran for military supplies. U.S. officials disclosed late last month that Russia received shipments of Iranian-produced drones. Russian cargo planes loaded up Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles over several days last month at an Iranian airfield and then ferried the drones to Russia, three U.S. officials told NBC News. The delivery is part of Russia’s plans to import “hundreds” of drones from Iran, they said. But the drones transferred to Russia have already experienced “numerous failures,” the U.S. officials said. They did not offer more details about the nature of the technical problems. The Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of economic sanctions from Washington and its European allies, placing Moscow in a position similar to Iran, which for years has been shut out of Western economies and the international financial system. Since the war began, Iran has become the top purchaser of Russia’s grain, and the two countries have announced agreements to bolster trade, including a $40 billion deal to enlist Russian help to develop Iran’s gas fields. With the war in Ukraine dragging on and Russia expending thousands of rounds of ammunition every week, it will likely seek to purchase additional military equipment from North Korea, defense officials said. The New York Times was the first to report the purchase."
2022-09-05,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-russia-shelling-grid-rcna46303,Line between Ukrainian nuclear power plant and grid disconnected,"The last reserve line connecting the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to the Ukrainian energy grid was disconnected Monday after days of “intensive shelling,” the national energy company that runs the plant said. A fire caused by the shelling left transmission lines “damaged and disconnected,” Energoatom said in a statement. As a result, power from unit No. 6, which supplies the plant's own needs, was disconnected from the network. The company said in a later statement that the sixth power supply unit was “operational” but only to cool reactor cores and waste. It said that no power was going out of the plant and that generators had not been activated in response. German Galushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister, said on Facebook that any immediate repair work on the lines was impossible because of the fighting around the plant. “The world is once again on the brink of a nuclear disaster. The de-occupation of the ZNPP and the creation of a demilitarized zone around it is the only way to ensure nuclear safety,” Galushchenko said. The International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, said it had been informed that the line was deliberately disconnected to extinguish a fire. ""The line itself is not damaged, and it will be re-connected once the fire is extinguished,"" the agency said in a statement. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the IAEA, said Saturday that the plant had lost external power, with Ukrainian staff members telling the United Nations watchdog’s inspectors that the fourth and last operational line was down. Three more were lost earlier in the war. At the time, the IAEA said only one out of six nuclear reactors at the site was operational. Fears of a possible nuclear disaster have grown since Russia invaded Ukraine, and concerns deepened after the plant was completely disconnected for the first time in its 40-year history on Aug. 25. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame for problems caused by the intense fighting around the plant. World leaders, meanwhile, have called for a demilitarized zone. After he traveled to Ukraine over the past week to inspect the installation and determine whether it could continue to run safely, Grossi warned that the “physical integrity of the plant has been violated.” He said the IAEA would establish a “continued presence” of experts at the plant “so they can provide me and all of us with an impartial, neutral, technical, sound assessment of whatever may be happening there.” He added that he would “continue to worry about the plant until we have a situation that is more stable.”"
2022-09-04,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/us-ambassador-russia-leaving-post-ukraine-war-drags-rcna46246,U.S. ambassador to Russia leaving post as Ukraine war drags on  ,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, ended his tenure as America’s top diplomat in Moscow on Sunday after nearly three years, spanning the Trump and Biden administrations, and will retire from a lengthy career in government service, the embassy announced. His departure comes as Russia’s war with Ukraine is in its seventh month. His four-decade public service career included postings as deputy secretary of state and senior positions in the departments of Justice, Defense and Commerce. Elizabeth Rood, the deputy chief of mission to Russia, will be the top U.S. diplomat in Moscow until a successor nominated by President Joe Biden replaces Sullivan. On Saturday, Sullivan attended a farewell ceremony in Moscow for former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who died Tuesday. The departure comes as U.S.-Russian relations remain tense. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the war has slowed to a grind with both sides trading combat strikes and small advances in the east and south. Both Russian and Ukraine have seen thousands of troops killed and injured, and Russia’s bombardment of cities has killed countless innocent civilians. The U.S. has imposed numerous waves of sanctions on Russia and provided billions of dollars worth of military assistance to Ukraine, shifting to a longer-term support strategy in recent weeks. In April 2021, Sullivan headed back to the U.S. for consultations after officials in Moscow “suggested” he follow the example of the Russian ambassador to Washington who was recalled from Washington after Biden described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “killer.” A Boston native, Sullivan was nominated by President Donald Trump and confirmed by the Senate with unusually strong bipartisan support as ambassador to Russia in December 2019. Biden asked him to remain in the post when Biden took office last year."
2022-09-04,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-nord-stream-zelesnkyy-energy-war-europe-germany-rcna46229,"Russia is preparing for 'energy attack' on Europe, Zelenskyy warns as major gas pipeline stays closed","The Kremlin is preparing an “energy attack” on Europe, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday, a day after Russian energy giant Gazprom indefinitely suspended natural gas supplies to Germany through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. “Where Russia cannot do it by force of conventional weapons, it does so by force of energy weapons,” Zelenskyy said in a video address. “Russia is preparing for a decisive energy attack on all Europeans,” he said. His comments came after Gazprom, the state-controlled company with a monopoly on Russian gas exports through the key pipeline, said Friday that it could no longer provide a time frame for restarting deliveries through Nord Stream 1. It said an oil leak meant a pipeline turbine could not run safely and that it could not safely resume operations until all malfunctions had been resolved. Siemens, the German manufacturer of the turbines, however, said in a statement that such leakages “do not usually affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site,” adding that it had never suspended operations in the past. Despite the leak, there were additional turbines to operate the pipeline, the statement said. The pipeline, which runs under the Baltic Sea to Germany, has historically supplied about a third of the gas exported from Russia to Europe, but it was already running at only 20% of capacity before flows were halted last week for maintenance. Lower gas flows have already pushed up European prices by nearly 400% over the past year, sending electricity costs soaring and leading to accusations that Russia is weaponizing energy supplies. Moscow blames Western sanctions and technical issues for supply disruptions. Zelenskyy said Russia was trying to attack with “poverty and political chaos where it cannot yet attack with missiles.” The announcement about the pipeline came after finance ministers from the Group of Seven countries — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States — agreed to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil, which they said would reduce Moscow’s “ability to fund its war.” Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian shelling hit the southern port city of Mykolaiv during the night, damaging a medical treatment facility, the city’s mayor said in a statement on his Telegram channel. Oleksandr Senkevych did not specify whether there were any injuries in the overnight attack, which he said also damaged some residences. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaphorizhzhia also continued to be caught in the crossfire at the frontlines of the war, fueling fears of a nuclear disaster. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency said Saturday that the plant had lost external power. Ukrainian staff operating the plant told the IAEA inspectors that the fourth and last operational line was down. The other three were lost earlier in the war. Only one out of six nuclear reactors at the site was in operation, the IAEA said in a statement Saturday. The sole reactor was producing electricity for cooling and powering households, with a reserve line supplying electricity to the facility. Russian forces captured the plant shortly after they moved into Ukraine, and the two sides have exchanged accusations about shelling the plant. Zelenskyy blamed Russian shelling for an Aug. 25 shutdown that severed the Zaphorizhzhia plant from the national grid, narrowly avoiding a radiation leak and prompting blackouts across Ukraine. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Ukrainian troops launched another attempt to seize the plant late Friday, despite the IAEA tour. NBC News has not been able to verify the claims from either side. The IAEA, whose experts have been stationed at the plant since Thursday, said a “secure off-site power supply” as well as backup systems were essential for nuclear safety, adding that their presence at the plant was a “game changer.” Grossi is set to brief the U.N. Security Council next week following the inspection of the plant."
2022-09-03,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-mikhail-gorbachev-funeral-vladimir-putin-snub-thousands-line-up-rcna46189,Thousands of Russians — but not Putin — line up to say goodbye to Gorbachev,"Thousands of people lined the streets of Moscow to pay their respects to Mikhail Gorbachev ahead of his funeral on Saturday — a farewell snubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Gorbachev, who died on Tuesday at the age of 91, was buried without state honors next to his wife, Raisa, after a farewell ceremony at the Pillar Hall of the House of the Unions, an opulent 18th-century mansion near the Kremlin that has served as the venue for state funerals since Soviet times. At the ceremony, mourners filed by Gorbachev’s open coffin, laying flowers as music, including the melancholic score from the movie “Schindler’s List,” played in the background. Gorbachev’s daughter, Irina, and his two granddaughters sat beside the coffin that was flanked by honorary guards. The turnout was large enough that the viewing was extended for two more hours beyond the stated two hour schedule. Lauded in the West and by many liberal Russians for bringing down the Iron Curtain and instigating greater social and economic freedoms in the Soviet Union, the Nobel Peace Prize winner has been strongly criticized by others at home for precipitating the end of the Soviet empire and the ensuing economic meltdown that plunged millions into poverty. Reflecting the uneasiness of his legacy in Russia, the government stopped just short of offering Gorbachev a state funeral, although Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it would have “elements” of one and the government would help to organize it. In a private ceremony on Thursday, Putin laid flowers at Gorbachev’s coffin at the Moscow hospital where Gorbachev had died two days before, but the Kremlin said that his busy schedule would keep him from attending the funeral. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Saturday that the president would have a series of working meetings and an international phone call, and needed to prepare for a business forum in the Russian Far East he was scheduled to attend next week. The Kremlin’s ambivalence about Gorbachev was reflected in state television broadcasts, which described his worldwide acclaim and grand expectations generated by his reforms but held him responsible for plunging the country into political turmoil and economic woes, and for failing to properly defend the country’s interests in talks with the West. Putin's attendance would have been required for it to be a full state funeral, and it would have necessitated invitations to world leaders who the Russian leader has been busy avoiding since his invasion of Ukraine in late February. Putin, a longtime KGB intelligence officer who has called the Soviet Union’s collapse a “geopolitical catastrophe” has avoided criticizing Gorbachev since his death but has in the past repeatedly blamed him for failing to secure written commitments from the West that would rule out NATO's expansion eastward. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a conservative nationalist and one of the few European leaders to still enjoy a cordial relationship with Putin, did attend the ceremony. The U.S., British, German and other Western ambassadors were also present, along with several Russian cultural figures. The modest event contrasted with the lavish 2007 state funeral for Boris Yeltsin, Russia’s first post-Soviet leader who sidelined Gorbachev as the Soviet Union fell apart, and later hand-picked Putin as his political successor. Yeltsin, however, was also buried at Novodevichy Cemetery, a burial ground that survived the monastic and holy destructions of the Stalinist era. Novodevichy is also the final resting place of former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev."

Lukoil, Russia’s largest private oil company, said its chairman Ravil Maganov “passed away following a severe illness,” Thursday at age 67. But citing two sources familiar with his death, Reuters reported that he died after falling from the window of the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow. Several Russian media outlets, citing sources from law enforcement agencies, have also suggested that he was trying to smoke when he plunged to his death. NBC News has not verified how he died and Maganov’s family has remained silent on the matter. The hospital and police declined to comment, and Russia’s Investigative Committee did not return requests for comment. However, several Western commentators have noted that Lukoil, the country’s second largest oil producer, came out against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war a few days after his forces invaded Ukraine, calling for it to end. And while no political link to Maganov’s death has been established, several people who have chosen to cross the Kremlin have died suddenly and in unexplained circumstances. “There has been a remarkable number of suspicious deaths in recent months of senior executives connected with the oil and gas industry,” John Lough, an associate fellow at London’s Chatham House think tank, told NBC News via email Thursday. “It is reminiscent of the banditry of the 1990s in Russia during the first phase of privatization after the collapse of the USSR,” added Lough, who specializes in Russian affairs. Maganov’s death follows the passing of seven other senior Russian energy executives since the start of the year. Among them was his former top Lukoil executive Alexander Subbotin, whose body was discovered in the basement of a country house in the Moscow region in May, police in the city said. Other senior executives from natural gas giants Gazprom and Novatek, as well as Vladislav Avayev, the former vice president of Russia’ third largest bank Gazprombank, have also died. “This suggests there is some serious infighting taking place in the sector connected to access to financial flows,” Lough said. Olga Oliker, the program director for Europe and Central Asia at the International Crisis Group in Brussels, said that “trend” was the wrong word to describe the deaths She said there were enough incidents to argue that Russian state policy either allows for political assassinations or that it lacks control over its security services and does not have the capacity to prevent them. “There are enough incidents that those who run afoul of Russian leadership, or appear to, may well worry about potential threats to their lives,” she said. Former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov was gunned down on a bridge near the Kremlin in February 2015, police said, a day before a planned protest against Putin’s rule. Nemtsov was a sharp critic of Putin, assailing his government’s inefficiency, rampant corruption and the Kremlin’s policy on Ukraine. A report he was working on about Russia’s military involvement in the war in eastern Ukraine and in the annexation of Crimea was released after his death. Five men were found guilty and jailed for his murder, but Nemtsov’s death left the country’s opposition without a central figure and ignited fury among critics who assailed the Kremlin for creating an atmosphere of intolerance of any dissent and called the killing an assassination. His death was likened by Kremlin critics and Western commentators to that of the prominent investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was shot to death in October 2006. Known for her critical coverage of the war in Chechnya, despite numerous acts of intimidation and violence, Politkovskaya had written a critical book about Putin and his campaign in the region, documenting widespread abuse of civilians by government troops. Police investigated her death as a murder, but it remains unsolved and the Kremlin has denied any connection to both her death and that of Nemtsov. Just over a month after Politkovskaya’s killing, former Russian spy turned dissident Alexander Litvinenko suffered an agonizing death in London in 2006 after drinking tea laced with an extremely rare radioactive substance called “polonium-210,” British police said. The haunting image of Litvinenko in his hospital bed became world famous as the face of tortured suffering. After about three weeks of misery, he lapsed into a coma and died, at age 43, after claiming on his deathbed that Putin likely ordered his killing. A decorated KGB and FSB officer, Litvinenko defected from Russia in 2000 and settled in the United Kingdom, where he became an outspoken critic of the Kremlin and Putin."
2022-09-02,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/gazprom-keeps-pipeline-germany-switched-g7-caps-russian-oil-prices-rcna46132,Gazprom keeps pipeline to Germany switched off as G7 caps Russian oil prices,"Europe’s energy crisis loomed larger Friday after Russian energy giant Gazprom said it couldn’t resume the supply of natural gas through a key pipeline to Germany for now, citing what it said was a need for urgent maintenance work to repair key components, just hours before it was due to restart deliveries. The Russian state-run energy company had shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline on Wednesday for what it said would be three days of maintenance. It said in a social media post Friday evening that it had identified “malfunctions” of a turbine and added that the pipeline would not work unless those were eliminated. It was the latest development in a saga in which Gazprom has advanced technical problems as the reason for reducing gas flows through Nord Stream 1 — explanations that German officials have rejected as a cover for a political power play following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It came after finance ministers from the Group of Seven wealthy democracies — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States — said a cap on the price of Russian oil was meant to “reduce ... Russia's ability to fund its war of aggression whilst limiting the impact of Russia's war on global energy prices” which have soared. European utilities have scrambled to find additional supply during the summer months to get ready for the winter’s heating demands, buying expensive liquefied gas that comes by ship, while additional supplies have come by pipeline from Norway and Azerbaijan. Fears of a winter shortage have eased somewhat as storage has progressed, but a complete cutoff could present Europe with serious difficulties, analysts say. The European Union needs to step up efforts to reduce gas consumption, said energy policy expert Simone Tagliapietra at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. The continuing interruptions from Gazrpom mean that “a winter with zero Russian gas is the central scenario for Europe.” he said. “There is only one way to prepare for that: reducing gas and electricity demand.” Gazprom said it had identified oil leaks from four turbines at the Portovaya compressor station at the Russian end of the pipeline, including the sole operational one. It claimed to have received warnings from Russia’s industrial safety watchdog that the leaks “do not allow for safe, trouble-free operation of the gas turbine engine.” “In connection with this, it is necessary to take appropriate measures and suspend further operation of the . gas compressor unit in connection with the identified gross (safety) violations,” the company said. Gazprom started cutting supplies through Nord Stream 1 in mid-June, blaming delays to the delivery of a turbine that had been sent to Canada for repair. Canada has since allowed the turbine’s delivery to Germany, which has said that nothing stands in the way of it being sent to Russia other than Russia saying it wants the part. In recent weeks, Nord Stream 1 has been running at only 20% of capacity. Russia, which before the reductions started accounted for a bit more than a third of Germany’s gas supplies, has also reduced the flow of gas to other European countries which have sided with Ukraine in the war. Natural gas is used to power industry, heat homes and offices, and generate electricity. Increasing the amount in reserve has been a key focus of the German government since Russia invaded Ukraine, to avoid rationing for industry as demand rises in the winter. Germany’s storage facilities are now over 84% full. The head of Germany’s network regulatory agency, Klaus Mueller, tweeted that the Russian decision to keep Nord Stream 1 switched off for now increases the significance of new liquefied natural gas terminals that Germany plans to start running this winter, gas storage and “significant needs to save” gas. It is “good that Germany is now better prepared, but now it comes down to everyone,” Mueller added. Germany’s Economy Ministry said it had “taken note” of Gazprom’s latest announcement and wouldn’t comment on it directly, but added that “we have already seen Russia’s unreliability in recent weeks” and continued efforts to reduce the country’s reliance on Russian energy imports. “Of course these are difficult times but we will continue to strengthen provisions consistently,” the ministry said in a statement. “Great efforts are still needed but we are on a good path to coping with the situation.” The European Union has just reached its goal of filling its gas storage to 80%, ahead of a Nov. 1 deadline, despite Russian supply cutbacks."

Ukraine’s state nuclear company said the International Atomic Energy Agency mission had not been allowed to enter the plant’s crisis center, where Ukraine says Russian troops are stationed, and would struggle to make an impartial assessment. The Kremlin said Ukraine was continuing to shell the plant, raising the risk of a nuclear catastrophe. NBC News has not verified the claims of either side."
2022-09-01,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russian-lukoil-exec-dies-falling-hospital-window-reports-say-rcna45823,"Russian Lukoil exec dies after falling from hospital window, reports say","The head of a Russian oil giant that criticized President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine died Thursday after reportedly falling out of his hospital window. Lukoil Chairman Ravil Maganov died after falling from a window of the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow, Reuters reported, citing two sources familiar with the situation. The company issued a statement early Thursday confirming the death of Maganov, 67, ""after a severe illness,"" but did not specify the cause. “Ravil Maganov immensely contributed to the development of not only the Company, but of the entire Russian oil and gas sector,” the statement read. NBC News has not verified how he died. The hospital declined to comment and referred comment to the police, who declined to comment. Lukoil is Russia’s second-largest oil producer. It was a rare Russian business to come out against Putin’s war in Ukraine, which the Kremlin insists on calling its “special military operation.” The company’s board of directors called for an end to the war in early March, within days of the full-scale invasion of Russia's neighbor. “Calling for the soonest termination of the armed conflict, we express our sincere empathy for all victims, who are affected by this tragedy,” a statement from its board of directors read. The Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow frequently treats Russia's political and business elites, and was where the final Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev passed away earlier this week. Maganov had served on Lukoil’s board of directors since 2020, and served as the company’s first executive vice president since 1994. His death raised eyebrows given the company's opposition to the war and similar unexplained deaths in recent years. Alexander Subbotin, a former Lukoil manager, was found dead in his basement outside Moscow in May, according to Reuters, citing local media. In November 2021, a Russian diplomat was found dead on the streets of Berlin after falling from an upper floor of the embassy, the German outlet Der Spiegel reported, citing security sources. Investigative journalist Maxim Borodin, who wrote stories about corrupt officials and the Russian military, died in 2018 after falling from his fifth-story balcony, according to the news agency for which he worked."
2022-09-01,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-nuclear-plant-inspectors-shelling-zaporizhzhia-russia-rcna45811,Ukraine nuclear plant inspectors arrive despite fighting,"A team of international inspectors arrived at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant Thursday despite renewed shelling that underscored fears of a radiation disaster. Ukraine and Russia traded fresh accusations that the other side was endangering the United Nations team, as well as the Zaporizhzhia plant’s nuclear reactors, to disrupt the risky mission to secure the plant's safety. But the experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, pressed on despite the fighting. Kyiv accused Moscow's forces early Thursday of shelling the occupied nuclear power plant — and the route the IAEA inspectors were taking. Russian officials blamed Kyiv for the fierce fighting around the site. Its Defense Ministry said Ukrainian troops had tried a daring amphibious landing to seize back control of the plant. NBC News could not immediately verify either side’s claims. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told reporters that he had been able to tour the whole site. “I went into the units. I could visit the emergency systems, the diesel generators, the different parts. So we have the control rooms of some of the nuclear power plants there, so we chose three or four key areas we needed to see firsthand, and I was able to do that,” he said. He said he had spoken “to the staff a lot and the people of Enerhodar, the people from the village who came to meet with me and to see me and to get the support that they deserve from the IAEA.” Grossi said the IAEA would establish a “continued presence” of experts at the plant “so they can provide me and all of us with an impartial, neutral, technical, sound assessment of whatever may be happening there.” He added that he would “continue to worry about the plant until we have a situation that is more stable” and that it was “obvious” that the integrity of the plant has been “violated.” Earlier, the nuclear agency said the mission was delayed on the Ukrainian-controlled side for about three hours. Grossi told Reuters the inspectors would spend “several days” at the plant before it reports back to an increasingly alarmed international community."
2022-08-31,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/un-inspectors-heading-ukrainian-nuclear-plant-zaporizhzhia-rcna45590,U.N. inspectors heading to nuclear plant arrive in Zaporizhzhia,"ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — A team of international inspectors arrived Wednesday in Zaporizhzhia ahead of its unprecedented mission to try to restore stability and avert a potential nuclear catastrophe at a nearby Russian-occupied power plant. The visit comes as Ukrainian forces appeared to make some progress after launching a long-awaited counteroffensive to retake territory in the country's south that was seized by Russian forces early in the invasion. During their visit to the plant, which has seen weeks of shelling that Russia and Ukraine have blamed on each other, the United Nations nuclear experts plan to assess damage and evaluate whether safety systems are still intact. They also intend to speak with Ukrainian workers operating the plant, some of whom have reported being tortured by Russian troops occupying the site. “We are going to a war zone,” International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told reporters before departing the capital, Kyiv, at dawn. Grossi said the inspectors would spend “several days” at the power plant, before reporting back to an increasingly alarmed international community. Yet, even as the team's armored convoy arrived in Zaporizhzhia, it remained unclear how and when they would be able to safely reach the plant in nearby Enerhodar. Advisers to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russian forces were shelling the route the inspectors would take to the plant to force them to instead travel there through Russian-held territory, while Russia accused Ukraine’s forces of firing on the plant overnight. Ukrainian officials said it was actually Russian troops firing on the plant from a nearby town across the Dnieper River. NBC News has not verified the claims of either side. On arrival in Zaporizhzhia, Grossi said he was confident the mission could be carried out safely. Elsewhere in southern Ukraine, the country’s apparent counteroffensive to try and take back Russian-occupied areas was making progress, according to Britain’s defense ministry. “Ukrainian armored forces have continued to assault Russia’s Southern Grouping of Forces on several axes across the south of the country since Monday,” it said in an intelligence update Wednesday. ""Ukrainian formations have pushed the front-line back some distance in places, exploiting relatively thinly held Russian defenses."" the ministry added. While Ukraine's potential gains could prove crucial in the overall direction of the war, in recent weeks the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — the largest in Europe, with six reactors — has become a major flashpoint in the conflict. Last week, a nearby fire disconnected the plant from Ukraine’s electricity grid for the first time in its history, forcing the plant to revert to backup power for the safety systems that prevent a nuclear meltdown. Tariq Rauf, a former IAEA inspector now at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said the IAEA mission includes experts on radiation safety, physical security of power plants and nonproliferation of nuclear material located at the site. He said inspectors were likely bringing cameras and radiation measuring devices to replace those damaged during the war. “This is very unprecedented,” he said. “I would expect that it would take at least a few days, if not maybe up to a week because the site is quite large. If they have to go around the site, to look at damage from the shelling and so on, I think that would take some time.” Amid the fighting and conflicting reports about the agreed-upon conditions for the IAEA visit, Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed governor of the part of Zaporizhzhia occupied by Moscow's troops, claimed the inspectors would only spend one day at the plant and downplayed prospects for the mission’s success. “I think it will be more political engagement,” Balitsky said in comments carried by the Russian state-run news agency Interfax. Zelenskyy, meeting Tuesday with the IAEA delegation in Kyiv, said it was crucial that Russia acquiesce to demands from the nuclear watchdog and the international community that the power plant be demilitarized and returned to Ukrainian control. “Only this way, we can eliminate any risks regarding the atomic energy,” he said. Underscoring the rising fears of a radiation catastrophe, workers from Ukraine’s State Emergency Service and State Police held nuclear disaster drills Tuesday that focused on how the civilian population would be evacuated in the event of a radiation leak. Local authorities in Zaporizhzhia have also been doling out potassium iodine tablets to residents within a 31-mile radius of the plant."
2022-08-30,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/russia-gets-first-drones-iran-two-nations-strengthen-ties-rcna45352,Russia gets its first drones from Iran as the two countries strengthen ties,"Russia has picked up the first batch of Iranian drones for its war in Ukraine but it has run into technical problems in the initial tests of the unmanned aircraft, U.S. officials said Tuesday. Facing a protracted war in Ukraine and a wall of Western sanctions, Russia is turning to Iran to bolster its military and keep its economy afloat, as both countries’ interests converge. Barred from importing Western technology and with China wary of openly breaching U.S. sanctions, Russia has sought out drones from Iran to fill a major gap in its arsenal, as the Russian military has failed to develop combat drones able to strike targets behind enemy lines. Russian cargo planes loaded up Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles over several days this month at an Iranian airfield and then ferried the drones to Russia, three U.S. officials told NBC News. The delivery is part of Russia's plans to import “hundreds” of drones from Iran, they said. U.S. officials, however, said the drones transferred to Russia have already experienced “numerous failures,” though they did not offer more details about the nature of the technical problems. The Washington Post first reported on the drone shipment and subsequent technical difficulties. The Iranian U.N. mission and the Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. The partnership between Russia and Iran has been building for more than a decade but it has accelerated since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, with Tehran providing armed drones to Russia and Moscow launching an Iranian satellite, according to U.S. officials. The trend has raised concerns in Washington and elsewhere, though it remains unclear whether the partnership will evolve into a full-fledged alliance or alter Moscow’s relatively friendly relations with Iran’s foes in the region, including Israel, former U.S. officials and experts said. Although Russian and Iranian military and intelligence officers have worked closely together in Syria in support of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, Iran’s decision to provide weapons to Russia for a war in another region is unprecedented, said John Brennan, a former director of the CIA. “That’s new. I haven’t seen Iran provide that to Russia before. We’re talking about significant support,” said Brennan, who is also a senior NBC News and MSNBC national security analyst. Russia earlier this month launched an Iranian satellite into orbit, which Western officials believe could be used for possible intelligence gathering in Ukraine or elsewhere. Iran denied that was the case and said the satellite would be used for scientific research related to agriculture. The Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of economic sanctions from Washington and its European allies, placing Moscow in a position similar to Iran, which for years has been shut out of Western economies and the international financial system. Since the war began, Iran has become the top purchaser of Russia’s grain, and the two countries have announced agreements to bolster trade, including a $40 billion deal to enlist Russian help to develop Iran’s gas fields. Both countries share a common foe and a shared goal of circumventing financial and other sanctions, with Iran accumulating years of experience trying to undercut U.S. measures. With Moscow and Tehran essentially barred from the SWIFT international bank messaging system, the two countries have agreed to use domestic messaging services as an alternative, according to Iranian media. One foreign government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security matters, said the Russian-Iranian cooperation was now more than just a marriage of convenience. “Relations between Russia and Iran are assuming a more serious character, a more strategic character than before because the calculation has changed,” the official said. The official said that “the very fact that Iran is going to provide drones to attack Ukrainians is a very important development, which cannot be ignored,” and added that Washington was still weighing how to respond. The White House has sought to expose the Russian-Iranian military cooperation, publicly revealing Iran’s plans to deliver “hundreds” of drones — including weapons-capable unmanned aircraft — before President Joe Biden’s July visit to the Middle East. The administration also released satellite imagery of a Russian delegation visiting Kashan Airfield in central Iran on June 8 and July 5, where some of Iran’s more advanced drones were on display. Last month, when asked about drone deliveries to Russia, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said technological cooperation between the two countries preceded the conflict in Ukraine. Military experts said that Iran has built up a significant drone fleet, including “kamikaze” drones, that would fill a gap in Russia’s armed forces. The U.S. government believes Russia plans to use the drones on the battlefield in Ukraine and that the drones are capable of conducting air-to-surface attacks and electronic warfare, U.S. officials said. U.S. officials say they are watching Russian-Iranian cooperation closely. One senior administration official said the drone deal suggested Russia was struggling to maintain its military campaign in Ukraine. “We think that really demonstrates some desperation on the Russian side, in terms of the state of its military,” the senior administration official said. Russia’s troubled performance on the battlefield in Ukraine has damaged Moscow’s efforts to promote the Russian defense industry to governments in the Middle East, according to Brennan. The Russian experience in Ukraine “has undermined and undercut their arguments about just how effective these weapons systems are, given that the Ukrainians have been able to withstand the onslaught. It has hurt their image as a military supplier and developer of sophisticated weaponry,” he said. Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior foreign policy adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in July that Russia had established itself as a reliable partner for Iran, and that the Islamic Republic should give up trying to accommodate the West and instead look to Moscow for support and shared strategic interests. CIA Director William Burns said last month that both Iran and Russia are looking for ways to help each other evade sanctions and “to demonstrate that they have options.” “The reality is that the Russians and Iranians need each other right now,” he told Andrea Mitchell of NBC News at the Aspen Security Forum in July. But Burns said the two oil-rich countries are economic competitors and historical rivals, and that there were limits to the partnership. Despite Moscow’s alignment with Iran, Russia so far has maintained friendly relations with Tehran’s adversaries in the Middle East, including Israel, which has enjoyed a pragmatic relationship with Russia. Although Russia waged an air war against Syrian rebels in support of the Damascus regime, it has never tried to prevent Israel from carrying out repeated military strikes against Iranian or Iranian-backed forces in Syria over the past decade. But Russia’s growing cooperation with Iran has raised the possibility that Moscow could end its understanding with Israel, though there is no evidence such a move is imminent or that Israel’s freedom of action has been curtailed, former U.S. officials said. “I really don’t think it’s in either of their interests to upset the apple cart there,” said Douglas London, a retired CIA officer from the agency’s clandestine service and the author of ""The Recruiter: Spying and the Lost Art of American Intelligence."" In May, after Israeli warplanes attacked targets in northwestern Syria, Russia fired anti-aircraft missiles toward the Israeli jets, according to Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz, who confirmed an Israeli media account of the incident in July. Gantz called it a “one-off incident” and said the Israeli jets were never in danger as the Russian missiles had not locked onto the planes. Since the May episode, Israel has continued to conduct strikes inside Syria without any reports of warning shots from Russia. Last week, Israel struck a warehouse containing hundreds of Iranian-made missiles in the Syrian city of Masyaf, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based opposition war monitoring group. The Israeli Embassy in Washington declined to comment when asked about Israeli strikes in Syria. Russia’s increasing cooperation with Iran could also complicate diplomacy outside the Ukraine conflict, including efforts to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. U.S. officials say the talks have made some progress over the past few weeks. But some skeptics of the deal argue that deepening ties between Moscow and Tehran could mean that if sanctions were lifted on Iran, the regime would be better placed to help Russia counter the effects of its economic isolation. The senior Biden administration official said that argument “doesn’t hold up.” Any Iranian bank or company that tried to help Russia violate sanctions would be sanctioned and the nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA, would not prevent the strict enforcement of sanctions targeting Russia. “Iran can try to help Russia evade sanctions without the JCPOA or with the JCPOA. And we’ll obviously look for ways to frustrate that regardless,” the official said."
2022-08-30,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/europe/ukraine-russia-kherson-counteroffensive-putin-zelenskyy-crimea-rcna45477,Ukraine: Fighting rages in Russian-held south ,"KYIV, Ukraine — A surge in fighting on the southern front line and a Ukrainian claim of new attacks on Russian positions fed speculation Tuesday that a long-expected counteroffensive has started to try to turn the tide of the war. But Ukrainian officials warned against excessive optimism in a war that has seen similar expectations of changing fortunes before, and the Russian defense ministry claimed an attempt by Ukraine’s troops to launch an offensive had failed and caused heavy casualties. Even though independent verification of battlefield moves has been extremely tough, the British defense ministry said in an intelligence report that, as of early Monday, “several brigades of the Ukrainian Armed Forces increased the weight of artillery fires in front line sectors across southern Ukraine.” Attention centered on potential damage Ukraine might have inflicted on Russian positions around the port city of Kherson, a major economic hub close to the Black Sea and one of Moscow’s prized possessions since it started the invasion just over half a year ago. Ukraine’s presidential office reported Tuesday that “powerful explosions continued during the day and night in the Kherson region. Tough battles are ongoing practically across all” of the strategic area. Ukrainian forces, the report said, have destroyed a number of ammunition depots in the region and all large bridges across the Dnieper River that are vital to bring supplies to the Russian troops. The Russian state news agency Tass reported five explosions rocking Kherson on Tuesday morning — blasts likely caused by air defense systems at work. The Ukrainian military’s Operation Command South also reported destroying a pontoon crossing the Dnieper that the Russian forces were setting up and hitting a dozen command posts in several areas of the Kherson region with artillery fire. “The most important thing is Ukrainian artillery’s work on the bridges, which the Russian military can no longer use,” Ukrainian independent military analyst Oleh Zhdanov told The Associated Press. “Even the barges have been destroyed. The Russians can’t sustain forces near Kherson — this is the most important.” On Monday, the southern command center’s Nataliya Gumenyuik told the Ukrainian news outlet Liga.Net that Kyiv’s forces have launched offensive operations “in many directions in our area of responsibility and have breached the enemy’s first line of defense.” The statement quickly made headlines after weeks of reports that Ukraine forces were preparing an offensive there and as Ukrainian attacks on the Kherson region intensified. Zhdanov said that Russia has three lines of defense in the Kherson region and that breaching the first one signals only “isolated offensive actions by the Ukrainian army.” The war has ground to a stalemate over the past months with casualties rising and the local population bearing the brunt of suffering during relentless shelling in the east and also in the wider area around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has also been at the heart of fighting in Ukraine. Amid fears the plant could be damaged, leading to a radioactive leak, a U.N. nuclear watchdog team has arrived in Kyiv and is further preparing a mission to safeguard the Russian-occupied plant from nuclear catastrophe. The stakes couldn’t be higher for the International Atomic Energy Agency experts, who will visit the plant in a country where the 1986 Chernobyl disaster spewed radiation throughout the region, shocking the world and intensifying a global push away from nuclear energy. Compounding an already complicated task is the inability of both sides in the war to agree on much beyond allowing the team to go there. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the wider region around the nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, time and again. Nikopol, which is just across the Dnieper from the Zaporizhzhia plant, once again came under a barrage of heavy shelling, local authorities said, with a bus station, stores and a children’s library sustaining damage. And the city of Zaporizhzhia itself, about 30 miles away, was targeted by a Russian missile strike, the Ukraine presidential office said. The dangers of a leak are now so high that officials have begun handing out anti-radiation iodine tablets to nearby residents. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacted to speculation in his nightly video address Monday, about whether his forces had launched a major counteroffensive. “Anyone want to know what our plans are? You won’t hear specifics from any truly responsible person. Because this is war.” From the other side, the Moscow-appointed regional leader of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, dismissed the Ukrainian assertion of an offensive in the Kherson region as false. He said Ukrainian forces have suffered big losses in the area. And for its part, the Russian defense ministry said its forces had inflicted heavy personnel and military equipment losses on Ukrainian troops. The Kherson region is just north of the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 to set off a conflict that was largely frozen until the Feb. 24 invasion."
2022-08-29,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/inspectors-ukraine-nuclear-plant-zaporizhzhia-iaea-rcna45214,U.N. inspectors head to Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine,"International inspectors were heading Monday to the Ukrainian nuclear plant at the center of growing alarm about a potential radiation disaster. The United Nations nuclear watchdog mission is set to arrive at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power plant later this week, offering hope for progress even as the two warring sides exchanged new accusations of shelling around the complex in southern Ukraine. “The day has come,” Rafael Grossi, the head of the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a tweet early Monday, announcing that a team was ""on its way"" after weeks of negotiations about getting nuclear inspectors access to the site near the conflict's front lines. “We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility,” he said. The mission, which will be led by Grossi, will assess physical damage to the plant, determine how well its safety systems are functioning, evaluate working conditions for its staff and perform any urgent safeguard activities, the IAEA said in a separate tweet. The inspectors are expected to arrive in Zaporizhzhia as early as Wednesday, two people with knowledge of the matter told NBC News. After making their way from Kyiv, the individuals said, the group will meet with local officials in Zaporizhzhia, in addition to their site visit to the nuclear plant, which is located in nearby Enerhodar. They said the inspectors are expected to spend several days inspecting the power plant. The U.N.’s atomic energy agency has warned for months about the risk of a nuclear catastrophe, and has sought to send in a team to inspect and help secure the safety of the plant. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Moscow considers the mission necessary, the Russian state news agency Tass reported. He was quoted as saying that Russia will ensure the safety of the IAEA inspectors on the territory that it controls, but reiterated Moscow's opposition to creating a demilitarized zone around the plant. It's up to the international community to pressure Kyiv to reduce tensions around the site, he added. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Monday that the mission ""will be the hardest in the history of IAEA"" given the active fighting on the ground. Kuleba said earlier that the inspectors were expected to arrive in Kyiv Monday. Last week, fighting in the area temporarily disconnected the plant from Ukraine’s power grid for the first time in its 40-year history, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying the incident left the world narrowly avoiding a radiation catastrophe. On Friday, Ukrainian authorities began distributing iodine tablets to residents near the plant in case of any future radiation leak, bringing back painful memories in a country still haunted by the 1986 nuclear disaster at Chernobyl. Ukraine’s allies have urged Russia to hand over control, and the U.N. has warned that any attack on the plant would be ""suicidal."" Kyiv and Moscow have been trading blame for shelling at the plant for weeks. NBC News could not verify either side’s claims. The Zaporizhzhia plant has been under Russian control since the Kremlin's forces seized land in the south in March, but Ukrainian engineers continue to operate it. Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, Energoatom, said earlier Monday that Russia “increased pressure” on the station’s personnel ahead of the IAEA mission’s arrival in order “to prevent them from disclosing evidence of the occupiers’ crimes at the plant and its use as a military base.” It did not provide any evidence for the claim. In its latest update Sunday, the IAEA said that despite reports of renewed shelling in recent days, all safety systems remained operational and there had been no increase in radiation levels. The United States accused Russia of failing to acknowledge the “grave radiological risk” at the plant, and blocking the final draft of a review of a key U.N. nuclear nonproliferation treaty over the issue. The news of the mission to Zaporizhzhia was welcomed by the Group of Seven countries, which includes the U.S. In a statement released Monday, it said the IAEA staff must be able to access all nuclear facilities in Ukraine “timely, safely and without impediment.” It came as Ukraine appeared to launch its long-awaited counteroffensive against Russian-occupied areas in the south, including the Kherson region. “Today we started offensive actions in different directions,” southern military command spokesperson Natalia Humeniuk told Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne. Military observers have been anticipating a counterattack on the ground in the south for months as Kyiv seemingly targeted Russian weapons depots and other military installations behind its defensive lines there and in nearby Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014."
2022-08-29,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-counteroffensive-russian-held-south-kherson-rcna45265,Ukraine launches counteroffensive to retake Russian-held south,"Ukraine announced a military offensive Monday in areas across its south, signaling the launch of a long-awaited push to retake Russian-held territory. “Today, we started offensive actions in different directions,” Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for the southern military command, told Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne. The apparent start of the major counteroffensive comes after weeks of buildup and nearly six months since Russian forces seized swaths of territory in southern Ukraine in the early days of the war. Kyiv has long vowed to retake that land and has displayed growing confidence in recent weeks, increasingly taking the initiative in a conflict that the Kremlin itself has admitted was stalled. Military observers have been anticipating a counterattack on the ground in the south as Ukraine seemingly targeted Russian military sites, as well as key bridges, with strikes deep behind defensive lines there and in nearby Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014. The front lines in the south are centered on Kherson, a region Russia seized in its entirety in March. A strategic gateway to the Black Sea and Crimea, it has been critical in cementing Moscow’s grasp on the area. The extent of the Ukrainian offensive and any gains made were unclear as social media buzzed with unconfirmed reports. Humeniuk expressed caution and called for patience, noting that the Russian military was still strong and had been reinforcing its positions in the area. “We do not declare the beginning of the offensive or the end of the offensive,” she said in a clarifying comment by phone. “But under the pressure of our actions, the enemy began to retreat. It is currently recorded that the enemy has withdrawn from some of its positions.” NBC News has not verified the claim. “Early reports are that Ukrainian forces have broken through the first set of Russian defenses in places around Kherson,” said Neil Melvin, the director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. “These were likely defended by some of the weaker Russian forces, notably from the occupied eastern areas of Ukraine, and the real test of Ukraine’s ability to turn back the Russian forces is still likely to lie ahead,” he said. Regarding the current operations, White House spokesman John Kirby said, “There have been efforts throughout the six months of this war where Ukraine has gone on the offense. This is a major offensive effort but the idea of being on the offense is not new to Ukrainians."" He declined to comment on future Ukrainian operations. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appeared to make a veiled reference to the news. “The only possible option for negotiations with Russia is being conducted by a special Ukrainian delegation in the southern and other directions of the front-line,” he said in a tweet. But Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration for the Kherson region, denied the reports of a Ukrainian offensive, calling them a “fantasy” and adding that the region’s capital was leading “a peaceful life,” the Russian state news agency Tass reported Monday. Russian media also reported Ukrainian strikes on the occupied towns of Nova Kakhovka and Beryslav near the city of Kherson overnight. Meanwhile, the governor of the nearby Mykolaiv region, Vitaliy Kim, said at least two people were killed and 11 injured in what he described were heavy Russian strikes on the city of Mykolaiv, which is under Ukraine’s control. It came amid ongoing fears of a nuclear catastrophe at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, also in Ukraine’s south, as an international team of nuclear experts finally set out Monday to inspect the site. Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of continuing to strike the plant despite the risk of a radiation disaster. NBC News has not verified the claims of either side. Without a clear picture of what exactly transpired on the battlefield in the south, some military experts were reserved in their analysis. “It’s a bit too early to tell, but the Ukrainians have been paving the way for an offensive for several weeks now,” said Michael A. Horowitz, a geopolitical and security analyst and the head of intelligence at Le Beck consultancy. “I think the Ukrainian military is also keeping a tight lid on tactical information for operational purposes, which to me also means that this is a major offensive,” he added. The apparent offensive could mean the war has now entered its most important stage since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February, Melvin said. “The Ukrainian armed forces are aiming to destroy Russian forces west of the Dnipro River and to reclaim the city of Kherson, and possibly further north to Zaporizhzhia, as well as inflicting heavy losses on Russian forces in occupied areas further east,” he added. “If this can be achieved, it will raise the prospect that Russians can be defeated in the conflict and drive a spike through the heart of Putin’s war strategy.”"
2022-08-27,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-shelling-zelenskyy-rcna45089,Zelenskyy warns of ‘dangerous’ situation as sides trade blame about nuclear plant shelling,"Russian forces fired missiles and artillery on Ukrainian-held areas across the river from Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, officials said Saturday, amid fears that fighting around the complex could trigger a radiation leak or an even bigger catastrophe. As concern persisted about safety at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Valentyn Reznichenko, the governor of Ukraine‘s Dnipropetrovsk region, said in a Telegram post that Grad missiles and artillery shells had hit the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, both of which are across the Dnieper River, about 6 miles away from the facility. After power lines were damaged in Nikopol “almost 5,000 families were left without electricity,” Reznichenko said, adding that homes and an educational center had also been hit. Russia’s Defense Ministry, meanwhile, in a post on its Telegram channel Saturday, accused Ukrainian artillery units of shelling areas around the facility three times in the past 24 hours. Ukrainian forces hit a roof of a building that contains nuclear fuel, the post said. Each side has repeatedly accused the other of shelling the complex in southeastern Ukraine, raising fears that the fighting could trigger a catastrophe. NBC News could not independently verify either claim, which came after Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy warned, in a late-night video address, that the situation around the plant remained “very risky and dangerous.” The facility was temporarily disconnected from the national power grid on Thursday for the first time in its 40-year history, heightening fears of a nuclear disaster in a country still haunted by the 1986 explosion at Chernobyl. Exactly what went wrong Thursday was unclear, but Zelenskyy said that “any actions by Russia that could trigger the shutdown of the reactors will again put the plant one step away from disaster.” Seized by Russian forces in March, the plant is still operated by Ukrainian technicians from Ukraine's state nuclear company, Energoatom. The U.N.’s atomic energy agency has warned about the risk posed by conflict for months and has tried to send in a team to inspect and help secure the plant. Officials told The Associated Press that preparations for the visit were underway, but it remained unclear when it might take place. Ukraine and its international allies, including the United States, have been urging Russia to hand over control of the plant. With safety concerns persisting, Ukrainian authorities began distributing iodine tablets to residents near the facility on Friday. The pills were being distributed to those who live within a 50 kilometer (30 mile) radius of the plant in Enerhodar, Volodymyr Marchuk, a spokesperson for the Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration, told NBC News. Recipients were instructed not to take them preventively, he said, adding that they were “being distributed in case of any future radiation leak, at which time the government would instruct people to take the tablets.” Potassium iodide tablets can block one type of radioactive material and are used in nuclear emergencies to help protect the thyroid, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Earlier this week, authorities in the region also started to draw up emergency plans to evacuate civilians in the event of a disaster. Elsewhere in Ukraine, one person was killed and another wounded in the Russian firing in the Mykolaiv region, local government officials said. Mykolaiv city is an important Black Sea port and shipbuilding center. The governor of the eastern Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said Saturday that two people were had been killed in the Russian firing on the city of Bakhmut, a significant target for Russian and separatist forces seeking to take control of the parts of the region they do not already hold."

Kyiv’s allies have been aghast at the split-screen juxtaposition of Russian tourists sunning themselves on Mediterranean beaches while many Ukrainians spend some of their summer in bomb shelters, dodging missiles and artillery. Fueled by a plea from Ukraine’s government earlier this month, the debate over visa bans is raging from Brussels to Washington, underscoring longstanding fractures within the West over how aggressively to confront Russia in the war’s next phase. At the heart of the moral question hanging over European capitals is the Russian public’s culpability: Whether ordinary citizens, by putting up little visible opposition, are enabling President Vladimir Putin’s war. Europe’s struggle to answer that question is pitting competing values against each other: pluralism and fairness versus national sovereignty; accountability for a country’s actions versus the moral hazards of “collective punishment.” “We are not speaking about punishment, we’re speaking about restrictive measures which are aiming to end the war,” Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu told NBC News via Zoom this week. “The right to enter any particular country is not a human right.” The decision could have significant economic ramifications for the continent. Russian travelers spent $22.5 billion last year in foreign countries, according to the analytics firm GlobalData, and there were some 13.7 million international departures from Russia. Among the most popular destinations for Russians, the group says: Italy and Cyprus. Kyiv wants that to change and has called for countries in the European Union and the Group of Seven — a club that includes the United States — to ban Russian travelers. The issue may come to a head next week at an E.U. foreign ministers meeting in Prague, but not all Western nations are on the same page. Germany is against a visa ban affecting “ordinary Russians,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said recently, adding: “This is Putin’s war.” The E.U.’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, told a conference in Spain on Monday that it was “not a good idea” and that “we have to be more selective.” This week, the U.S. also came out against a visa ban. “The U.S. wouldn’t want to close off pathways to refuge and safety for Russia’s dissidents or others who are vulnerable to human rights abuses,” a State Department spokesman said. “It is important to draw a line between the actions of the Russian government and its policies in Ukraine, and the people of Russia.” Yet, many countries on Moscow’s doorstep have led the charge to stop letting in Russians, in some cases citing security concerns given the ongoing war. Finland plans to slash the number of visas issued to Russians by 90 percent. And Poland has said it supports the E.U. denying Russians the Schengen visas, which allow passport-free travel within 26 European countries."

The move came a day after the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was temporarily disconnected from the national power grid for the first time in its 40-year history, heightening fears of a nuclear disaster in a country still haunted by the 1986 explosion at Chernobyl. The pills were being distributed to people who live within a 50 kilometer (30 mile) radius of the plant in Enerhodar, Volodymyr Marchuk, a spokesman for the Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration told NBC News. Recipients were being told not to take them preventatively, he said, adding that they were “being distributed in case of any future radiation leak, at which time the government would instruct people to take the tablets.” He did not say how many tablets were being distributed and who was receiving them, but in a separate post on his Telegram channel, Enerhodar Mayor Dmytro Orlov said that 25,000 tablets were delivered to the southern town from the regional reserve. He did not say whether they were going to be distributed, but he stressed that radiation levels at the plant and its surrounding areas were normal. Potassium iodine tablets can block one type of radioactive material and are used in nuclear emergencies to help protect the thyroid, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Earlier Friday, the country’s state nuclear company, Energoatom, said the plant was being safely powered through a repaired line from the power grid, a day after it was disconnected from the national power grid. There were no issues with the plant’s machinery or safety systems, it said. It was later announced that the plant had been reconnected to Ukraine’s power grid and was producing enough electricity to meet the country’s needs. The plant has been occupied by Russian forces and run by Ukrainian workers since the early days of the 6-month-old war, and both sides have repeatedly accused each other of shelling the site. Exactly what went wrong Thursday was unclear, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy blamed Russian shelling for the damage in a late-night video address Thursday. He said catastrophe was averted only because the plant’s safety systems kicked in with backup power. “The world must understand what a threat this is: If the diesel generators hadn’t turned on, if the automation and our staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would now be forced to overcome the consequences of the radiation accident,” he said. “Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster,” Zelenskyy added. However, Russian-installed officials in the surrounding Zaporizhzhia region sought to play down the gravity of the situation. “There was just an emergency situation” that was handled by the plant’s safety systems, Alexander Volga, a Russian-installed official in the nearby town of Enerhodar, told the state news agency Tass on Friday. NBC News has not verified either side’s claims. As the accusations flew about the plant, Belarus’ authoritarian leader, President Alexander Lukashenko, said Friday that the country’s warplanes have been modified to carry nuclear weapons in line with an agreement with ally Russia. Lukashenko said the upgrade followed his June meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who offered to make Belarusian combat aircraft nuclear-capable at Russian factories and to help train pilots. “Do you think it was all blather?” Lukashenko said to reporters Friday. “All of it has been done.”"

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, was back on the grid and supplying electricity to Ukraine on Friday, officials said, a day after it was disconnected from the national power grid for the first time in its 40-year history. Zelenskyy said in a late-night video address Thursday that after the last working line connecting it to Ukraine’s power grid was damaged by Russian shelling, it was only the plant’s safety systems kicking in with backup power that had averted catastrophe. “The world must understand what a threat this is: If the diesel generators hadn’t turned on, if the automation and our staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would now be forced to overcome the consequences of the radiation accident,” he said. “Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster,” Zelenskyy added.

The agency hailed the plant’s staff as heroes who “tirelessly and firmly hold the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders.” But authorities nonetheless began distributing iodine tablets to residents near the plant Friday in case of a radiation leak, amid mounting fears that the fighting around the complex could trigger a catastrophe, the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration confirmed to NBC News. Russian-installed officials in the surrounding Zaporizhzhia region sought to play down the gravity of the situation. “There was just an emergency situation” that was handled by the plant’s safety systems, Alexander Volga, a Russian-installed official in the nearby town of Enerhodar, told the state news agency Tass on Friday. Intense fighting around the site has spurred growing fears of a catastrophe. The two sides have traded blame for the attacks, with world leaders calling for a demilitarized zone around the nuclear complex while pushing for access for United Nations inspectors. Any damage to the plant would be “suicide,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned earlier this month. “It was potentially a very, very dangerous situation,” said Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, who led the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense forces known as CBRN in both the British army and NATO. Cooling systems and other mechanisms that are essential to the safe operation of the reactors need power to run them, while emergency diesel generators are sometimes unreliable. “The generators at Zaporizhzhia are in an unknown condition, thought to be not in great condition mainly because the Russians have occupied the site for six months, had not allowed inspectors in and maintenance has not been taking place as it should be,” de Bretton-Gordon said. “So we now have the safety mechanisms being run on generators, which we are not 100% certain are reliable.” “Absolutely had those generators failed, we would then be in a serious position,” he added. Nuclear experts have raised concerns before about the risk the fighting could pose to the plant’s reactors and the silos of nuclear waste around it. Ukraine and its international allies, including the United States, have been urging Russia to hand over control of the plant. Moscow captured the site in March and has controlled it since, although Ukrainian engineers still operate it. As the accusations flew about the plant, Belarus' authoritarian leader President Alexander Lukashenko said Friday that the country’s warplanes have been modified to carry nuclear weapons in line with an agreement with ally Russia.

2022-08-25,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-orders-increase-russian-armed-forces-ukraine-war-rcna44774,Putin orders Russian military to increase its forces,"Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree Thursday increasing his country’s armed forces by 137,000 as the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine passed the six-month mark. Putin’s decree will increase the number of combat personnel in the armed forces by about 10%, to 1.15 million. That will take the military’s total head count to 2.04 million. A copy of the order on a Russian government website says it goes into effect Jan. 1. It was published online and reported on by Russian state media. No reason for the boost was immediately given. It also orders that the Russian government ensure funds are provided for the increase from the federal budget. A previous such order signed by Putin in 2017 boosted the headcount to 1.9 million, of which 1.01 million were combat personnel. The decree comes just a day after Putin’s defense chief acknowledged that the Russian military campaign in Ukraine has stalled, with experts saying the Kremlin's troops appeared demoralized and understaffed. Russian forces failed to capture the capital, Kyiv, but now control large parts of Ukraine’s south and east, where Moscow has refocused most of its forces in the industrial Donbas region. In recent weeks the world's attention has been focused on a nuclear plant in the south, where fighting has fueled growing alarm about a potential disaster — Ukraine said shelling caused the Russian-occupied plant to be disconnected from the country's power grid Thursday. Wednesday marked six months since Putin’s army launched the full-scale invasion of its neighbor, an anniversary that coincided with Ukraine’s Independence Day in dual symbolism that prompted warnings that Russia might use the occasion to step up attacks. Those fears materialized when Kyiv said at least 25 people were killed in a Russian rocket strike on a train station in the central town of Chaplyne. Moscow confirmed the strike but not the civilian casualties, saying Thursday that more than 200 Ukrainian soldiers and military equipment headed for the Donbas were destroyed in the attack. Russia has not recently released any estimates of how many of its troops have been killed or injured in Ukraine. Kyiv says the number is more than 45,000. Ukraine said this week that 9,000 of its military personnel have been killed, publicly disclosing the number for the first time since the invasion. NBC News has not verified the claims or the number of dead or injured on either side."
2022-08-25,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/22-reported-killed-rocket-attack-ukraine-independence-day-rcna44731,25 reported killed in rocket attack in Ukraine on Independence Day,"Russian forces Wednesday launched a rocket attack on a Ukrainian train station on the embattled country’s Independence Day, killing 25 people, Ukrainian officials said after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Moscow might attempt “something particularly cruel” this week. The lethal attack took place in Chaplyne, a town of about 3,500 people in the central Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukrainian news agencies quoted Zelenskyy as telling the U.N. Security Council via video. The president’s office also reported that an 11-year-old child was killed by rocket fire earlier in the day in the settlement. “Chaplyne is our pain today,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. At one point, Zelenskyy put the number of wounded at about 50. On Thursday, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a deputy head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said in a post on the Telegram messaging app that 31 people have been injured. He also said there were two children among the 25 killed in the attack. ""An 11-year-old boy died under the rubble of a house, another 6-year-old died in a car fire near the railway station,"" Tymoshenko said. Ukraine had been bracing for especially heavy attacks around the national holiday that commemorates Ukraine’s declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Wednesday also marked the six-month point in the war. Days ahead of Independence Day, Kyiv authorities banned large gatherings in the capital through Thursday for fear of missile strikes. Nevertheless, a festive atmosphere prevailed during the day at Kyiv’s Maidan square as thousands of residents posed for pictures next to burned-out Russian tanks put on display. Folk singers set up, and many revelers — ignoring the sirens — were out and about in traditionally embroidered dresses and shirts. Others were fearful. “I can’t sleep at night because of what I see and hear about what is being done in Ukraine,” said a retiree who gave only her first name, Tetyana, her voice shaking with emotion. “This is not a war. It is the destruction of the Ukrainian people.” In a holiday message to the country, Zelenskyy exulted over Ukraine’s success in fending off Moscow’s forces since the invasion, saying: “On Feb. 24, we were told: You have no chance. On Aug. 24, we say: Happy Independence Day, Ukraine!” Britain’s Johnson urged Western allies to stand by Ukraine through the winter. “This is not the time to put forward flimsy negotiating proposals,” he said. “You can’t negotiate with a bear when it’s eating your leg or with a street robber when he has you pinned to the floor.” A car bombing outside Moscow that killed the 29-year-old daughter of right-wing Russian political theorist Alexander Dugin on Saturday also heightened fears that Russia might intensify attacks on Ukraine this week. Russian officials have blamed Ukraine for the death of Darya Dugina, a pro-Kremlin TV commentator. Ukraine has denied any involvement. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces have encountered unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance in their invasion and abandoned their effort to storm the capital in the spring. The fighting has turned into a slog that has reduced neighborhoods to rubble and sent shock waves through the world economy. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, speaking Wednesday at a meeting of his counterparts from a security organization dominated by Russia and China, claimed the slow pace of Moscow’s military action was due to what he said was an effort to spare civilians. Russian forces have repeatedly targeted civilian areas in cities, including hospitals and a Mariupol theater where hundreds of people were taking shelter. But Shoigu said Russia is carrying out strikes with precision weapons against Ukrainian military targets, and “everything is done to avoid civilian casualties.” “Undoubtedly, it slows down the pace of the offensive, but we do it deliberately,” he said. On the battlefield, Russian forces struck several towns and villages in Donetsk province in the east over 24 hours, killing one person, authorities said. A building materials superstore in the city of Donetsk was hit by a shell and erupted in flames, the mayor said. There were no immediate reports of any injuries. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Russians again shelled the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, damaging several buildings and wounding people, authorities said. Russian troops also shelled the city of Zaporizhzhia, but no casualties were reported. In addition, Russian rockets struck unspecified targets in the Khmelnytskyi region, about 180 miles west of Kyiv, the regional governor said. Attacks there have been infrequent."
2022-08-24,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-independence-day-zelenskyy-reborn-russia-war-six-months-rcna44548,Ukraine independence day: Zelenskyy hails 'reborn' country six months after Russia invaded,"Ukraine was “reborn” when Russia invaded six months ago, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday as his country observed its Independence Day marked by fears that Moscow may step up its attacks. Kyiv’s international allies offered praise and new promises of military aid to mark the occasion, with President Joe Biden announcing a package of nearly $3 billion that he said would allow the country to acquire weapons to defend itself over the long term. The festivities were subdued, however, with mass gatherings canceled and Ukrainians across the country told to be vigilant in case Russia unleashed fresh strikes. But the symbolism of a nation celebrating its identity six months after its neighbor's tanks rolled across the border in an effort to erase it was evident in Zelenskyy’s address. “On Feb. 24, we were told: You have no chance. On Aug. 24, we say: Happy Independence Day, Ukraine!” Zelenskyy said in a recorded video, which aired early on the 31st anniversary of Ukraine’s independence from Soviet rule. The country’s perseverance throughout the six months of conflict has shaped it like nothing before, the 44-year-old leader told Ukrainians as he stood in Kyiv’s historic Maidan Square, wearing his signature military slacks. “We finally became truly one,” he said. “A new nation that emerged on Feb. 24 at 4 a.m. Not born, but reborn.” Biden hailed Ukrainians' ""extraordinary courage"" in a statement that also acknowledged the “bittersweet” nature of the occasion. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were among the other world leaders who used the occasion to praise Ukraine’s resistance and vow to stand by its side for as long as it takes. In Moscow — as a war the Kremlin hoped would be long over stretches on — Russia's defense chief acknowledged that its offensive had slowed, while the arrest of an opposition politician highlighted the domestic crackdown on dissent. Zelenskyy warned earlier that Russia may unleash “repugnant provocations and brutal strikes” Wednesday. The United States also said that it had information that “Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days.” Local authorities — from Kharkiv in the east to Lviv in the west — have warned people to pay more attention to air raid sirens, respect curfews and work from home, if possible. Some air raid sirens sounded in an otherwise quiet Kyiv early on Wednesday, but perhaps the most potent sign of the war in Ukraine’s capital was the procession of burned-out Russian military vehicles displayed defiantly in the heart of the city. Having held on to Kyiv, Zelenskyy renewed his vow to recapture the eastern region of the Donbas, large swaths of which Russia now controls, and Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014. “What is the end of the war for us?? We used to say: peace. Now we say: victory,” he said in the address."

The package includes radars, surface-to-air missiles, ammunition drones and laser-guided rockets. weapons with newly developed capabilities, a response to the Defense Department’s request this year for private industry to develop and speed new capabilities to Ukraine. In part, the contents of the package reflect the Pentagon's request to private industry this year to develop and speed new capabilities to Ukraine. The Pentagon had specifically asked for air defense, anti-tank and unmanned aerial systems and communications equipment.

2022-08-23,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/russia-losing-war-ukraine-rcna44437,Is Russia losing the war with Ukraine?,"Only a few months after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus asked a journalist, “Tell me how this ends.” As the war between Russia and Ukraine passes its sixth month, this question feels timely once again. On Monday, Russia’s FSB security agency claimed that Ukraine’s secret services had orchestrated a shocking car bomb that killed the daughter of a close Putin ally, war booster and Russian ultranationalist over the weekend. This claim, made without evidence, could well be a ploy for Russian escalation. While our crystal ball may be cloudy, the number of possible outcomes seem to be narrowing. Clearly, the situation is changing, which makes any definitive answer to this query impossible. But while our crystal ball may be cloudy, the number of possible outcomes seem to be narrowing. Importantly, war is a “means,” not an “end.” And this war was misunderstood before it even started. Many experts argued that Moscow would never go through with an invasion. Others believed the Kremlin would quickly occupy much of the country, based on Russia’s overwhelming military superiority. The strength and resilience of the Ukrainian resistance was grossly underestimated. The abilities of the Russian military were terribly overestimated. That poor read of military capability has defined the war thus far. The determination of Ukraine and its Western allies will define it in the future. The West is confronted with another “long twilight struggle,” as President John F. Kennedy called it, that will continue even after this conflict ends. Time remains a significant resource on both sides, as Moscow works to hold its population’s support together and undermine democratic values. Russian President Vladimir Putin certainly believes he is winning. He is convinced that the willpower and determination of an autocrat is superior to the patience and focus of democracies. But what has so far helped Ukraine and the West are Putin’s two enormous strategic miscalculations. He clearly believed Russia could achieve a quick victory, and also thought the West would remain divided and unable to mount a cohesive response. Ukraine pushed the Russians back from the gates of the capital, Kyiv, and they successfully defended their second-largest city, Kharkiv. Their defiant 82-day defense of Mariupol served not only as a rallying point for Ukrainian resistance but as a focal point for Russian military incompetence. It slowed the Russian westward advance, forced the Kremlin to expend substantial amounts of men and materiel, and demonstrated that Putin’s description of the invasion as a “special military technical operation” was patently false. In terms of Western resolve, Putin may have ironically done more for NATO unity than anyone since the end of the Cold War. NATO increased its forces and many member states announced significant increases in their defense budgets. At its recent summit, NATO leaders condemned Moscow, reaffirmed their support for Ukraine, and welcomed Sweden and Finland as new members. The alliance appears strong. But the human and material costs to Ukraine and Russia have been enormous. Russian forces still have a significant advantage in manpower, weapons and ammunition, but there is evidence they are running out of precision-guided weapons and modern equipment. Furthermore, the Defense Department estimates Moscow has suffered over 70,000 casualties so far. That means nearly one half of the Russian force that attacked Ukraine on Feb. 24 are either dead, wounded, captured or missing. Britain’s top intelligence officer, Richard Moore, the head of MI6, said in July it appeared Russia’s military was “about to run out of steam.” Its shortage of willing and competent soldiers is now a major challenge for the Kremlin. Putin has called for more volunteers, yet he has made no announcements about mass mobilization and expanded conscription, nor has he officially declared war or warned his citizens to prepare for more sacrifice. Ukraine’s major military challenge is a shortage of weapons. Western military equipment has been essential to Kyiv’s slowing the Russian advance, and the delivery of American High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) has had a significant impact. Still, Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly complained that more Western military aid is essential if they are to evict Russian forces from their territory. It’s possible Putin hopes to formally annex those portions of Ukraine under Russian control, at least according to U.S. intelligence reports. This includes a sizable portion of the Donbas region and the southern coast. But as the pace slows, both sides have become mired in an artillery slugfest fighting for incremental territorial gains in the Donbas region, as Ukraine appears poised for a counteroffensive in the south. Kyiv has also conducted a series of high profile special operations attacks on Russian air bases and supply line The war could certainly continue to drag along for many months, with neither side able to achieve decisive victory. It is important to acknowledge that fighting in the eastern portion of Ukraine began in 2014 following the first Russian invasion. Over the intervening eight years, over 14,000 Ukrainians were killed and fighting continued intermittently until the invasion on Feb. 24. Putin might consider escalation should a similar a stalemate occur. This could mean “horizontal escalation,” including cyberattacks or efforts to foment a crisis somewhere else. (Recent Russian threats against Lithuania and Estonia might be an example.) It could also mean “vertical escalation,” including threats to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine or the West. The number of explicit nuclear threats against the U.S. and its European allies has reached nearly three dozen. Such threats have prevented the West from direct military intervention, but they have failed to fully intimidate or deter either Kyiv or the West. Ultimately, victory for Putin must combine success on the battlefield with political aspiration. Some commentators believe if Russia can secure the Donbas, Putin could declare a cease-fire and seek negotiations. President Emmanuel Macron of France and Henry Kissinger have urged negotiations. Ukraine should prepare to cede land for peace, according to this view. But it is a short-sighted perspective. Putin’s territorial desires in the Donbas region, while important, are the least of his ambitions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy correctly argued that a cease-fire while Russia occupies Ukrainian territory would actually prolong the war and provide Putin with more time to plan a new attack. His goal to subjugate Ukraine remains. Moscow continues to “Russify” the areas it controls by introducing the ruble as local currency, appointing new political leaders, improving its ability to defend occupied territories, and declaring occupied Ukrainian territory as part of Russia. Other Russian officials, meanwhile, seem to confirm Putin’s desire to destroy Ukrainian sovereignty. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Security Council, described the goals of the invasion as the end of the Kiev government and of Ukrainian neutrality. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev wondered if Ukraine would even “exist” in two years. While Putin might accept an interim solution, he seeks — at a minimum — a new security architecture in Europe and in a broader sense a new world order. President Joe Biden and his administration must prepare both the American people and our NATO allies for dueling possibilities. The war may become a true slog; it may also end abruptly and messily. Across Europe, there is now widespread concern that Russia may reduce the export of natural gas needed to heat homes for the upcoming winter. Putin may also feel emboldened by a series of shake-ups among Western governments, and because Americans seem increasingly distracted and less interested in the war. Consequently, Biden must both at home and abroad “transform short-term unity borne of reactive shock into enduring cohesion, borne of affirmative purpose,” Ali Wyne, a senior analyst at the Eurasia Group, told The New York Times. Biden must also provide the critical leadership that will ensure that NATO keeps its promise of “unwavering support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,” as Secretary of State Antony Blinken put it more than a month before the invasion. In his inaugural address in January 1961, Kennedy observed, “Now the trumpet summons us again — not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need — not as a call to battle, though embattled we are — but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation.” For Putin and his view of the future to fail, these words must resonate once again. The drama surrounding the car bombing over the weekend, coupled with fears that Russia could be planning an imminent attack at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, highlight the global stakes of this unpredictable conflict. We may not know exactly how the war ends, but we know enough to understand why the fate of the West and Ukraine remain inextricably, dangerously intertwined."

But this year, the country’s Independence Day also marks six months since Russia launched its full-scale invasion — dual symbolism that led the United States to warn of intensified attacks against civilian and government targets. Wednesday is the 31st anniversary of Ukraine’s independence from Soviet rule, an idea that runs counter to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rejection of the nation’s right to exist and lies at the heart of the dogged defense Ukraine has mounted through half a year of war. The U.S. Embassy issued a security alert urging Americans to leave the country. The double anniversary comes just days after the killing of a Russian ultranationalist’s daughter became a new flashpoint that experts fear Moscow may use as a pretext for escalation. Russia has struck on symbolic dates before. So Ukrainians are bracing themselves."

Those fears were fueled Monday when Russia’s FSB security agency said it had swiftly solved the case and blamed Ukraine’s secret services for planting the car bomb that killed Daria Dugina outside Moscow late Saturday. It offered no direct evidence for the claim, which Kyiv dismissed as Kremlin “propaganda."" Ukraine has denied any role and experts expressed doubts that it would be involved. Speculation has swirled about who might be behind what Russian President Vladimir Putin called a “vile, cruel crime,” but most theories share a belief that her father, Alexander Dugin, a vehement supporter of the war and an ideologue sometimes referred to as “Putin's brain,” was a more likely target. NBC News looks at who Dugin is and what his daughter’s death could mean."
2022-08-21,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/dennis-rodman-says-going-russia-seek-release-brittney-griner-rcna44106,Dennis Rodman says he's going to Russia to seek release of Brittney Griner,"WASHINGTON — Former NBA player Dennis Rodman said Saturday that he plans to visit Russia to seek the release of Brittney Griner, the WNBA star who was sentenced to nine years in prison on drug charges earlier this month. ""I got permission to go to Russia to help that girl,"" Rodman told NBC News at a restaurant in D.C. ""I'm trying to go this week."" He is more likely to hurt than help, said a senior Biden administration official. “It’s public information that the administration has made a significant offer to the Russians and anything other than negotiating further through the established channel is likely to complicate and hinder release efforts,” said the official. If Rodman goes to Russia, it won't be the first time he has conducted informal diplomacy with an international leader who has strained relations with the U.S. Rodman has cultivated a relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over the past decade, making multiple visits to the hermit kingdom. He called Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cool"" after a 2014 trip to Moscow. In 2018, he showed up on the sidelines of former President Donald Trump's meeting with Kim in Singapore. And he has credited himself with helping to secure the release of American Kenneth Bae from North Korea. The U.S. has imposed stiff sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine and is aiding Ukraine’s forces. Griner's imprisonment has created an additional source of tension between the two countries — and a potential avenue for diplomacy. Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who has been involved in past hostage negotiations, told The Associated Press this month that he was optimistic about the chances for a prisoner swap that would bring Griner and another American, Paul Whelan, back to the U.S. The U.S. offer to Russia involved a swap of Griner and Whelan for imprisoned Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. Rodman, who was in Washington for a sneaker convention, does not need special permission from the U.S. to enter Russia — just a visa from Moscow. But the State Department has issued a travel advisory that strongly discourages American citizens from visiting the country. ""Do not travel to Russia,"" the State Department advises, citing a litany of reasons, including the ""unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine,"" potential ""harassment against U.S. citizens by Russian government security officials"" and the possibility of ""wrongful detention."" Though he has a much more established relationship with Kim, Rodman expressed confidence in his understanding of Russia's president. ""I know Putin too well,"" he said."

Daria Dugina “died on the spot” after the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving exploded in Bolshye Vyazemy, a small village to the southeast of Moscow, Russia’s Investigative Committee said in a statement posted to its Telegram channel. “The investigation believes that the crime was planned in advance and is of a contract nature,” the statement said, adding that investigators had “established that the explosive device was placed under the bottom of the car on the driver’s side.”"
2022-08-20,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-launches-fresh-attack-russias-black-sea-fleet-headquarters-cri-rcna44053,Drone hits Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters in Crimea,"The headquarters of Russia's Black Sea fleet was hit by a drone early Saturday, Russian officials said, as strikes continued on military targets in the annexed Crimean Peninsula. Mykhailo Razvozhaev, the Russian governor of occupied Crimea, said on his Telegram channel that he was at the building in the port city of Sevastapol when “drone flew to the roof. “Unfortunately, it was not shot down,” he said. But in a later “clarification” of the incident also posted to Telegram, he said the unmanned aerial vehicle was “shot down right above the fleet headquarters. It fell on the roof and caught fire. The defeat failed. Well done boys.” Photos and video posted online by Ukrainian politicians and media outlets appeared to show the aftermath of the attack, and a large plume of smoke could be seen rising from the fleet's headquarters. NBC News was not able to independently verify them. The attack came after a series of blasts hit military depots and airbases in the annexed peninsula over the past week, hinting at a growing ability by Ukraine’s military or its backers to strike deep behind enemy lines. Kyiv has stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility for the explosions, but a government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to disclose information about the strikes to journalists, confirmed to NBC News this week that pro-Ukrainian saboteurs were behind them. The official declined to say whether the Ukrainian military or special forces were also involved in the attacks. Elsewhere, Russia's Tass news agency reported that anti-aircraft systems shot down six Ukrainian drones over Nova Kakhova, a small town to the east of the city of Kherson. Home to about 300,000 people, Kherson is by far the largest town and first regional capital to be in Russian hands. Controlling the city also means Moscow can supply fresh water to its forces in Crimea. Elsewhere a Russian missile hit a residential area of a southern Ukrainian town not far from a nuclear power station on Saturday, wounding 12 civilians and heightening fears of a nuclear accident, Ukrainian officials said. Vitaliy Kim, governor of the Mykolaiv region, said on the Telegram messaging app that four children between the ages of 3 and 17 were among those wounded in an attack that damaged several private houses and a five-story apartment building in Voznesensk. The town is about 19 miles from the Pivdennoukrainsk Nuclear Power Plant, the second largest in Ukraine. Energoatom, Ukraine's energy company that manages all four of the country's nuclear energy generators, described the attack on Voznesensk as “another act of Russian nuclear terrorism.” “It is possible that this missile was aimed specifically at the Pivdennoukrainsk Nuclear Power Plant, which the Russian military tried to seize back at the beginning of March,” Energoatom said in a statement. Russia did not immediately respond to the accusation and NBC News was not able to independently verify the situation on the ground. The Mykolaiv strikes came after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, on Friday that shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which sits to the east of Mykolaiv, could result in a large-scale disaster. A readout of the call from Macron’s office said Putin agreed to an International Atomic Energy Agency mission to the plant."
2022-08-20,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraines-soldiers-rockets-drones-are-running-low-boots-t-shirts-rcna43902,"Ukraine’s soldiers have rockets and drones, but are running low in boots and T-shirts","ODESA, Ukraine — At a sprawling open-air market near the Black Sea, shoppers duck in and out of rusting shipping containers that have been converted to makeshift army surplus shops, scanning row upon row of uniforms, boots and tactical gear. Some are Ukrainian soldiers stocking up on supplies for the battlefield. Others, like former taxi driver Dmytro Kazmirchuk, are volunteers taking it upon themselves to outfit front-line troops who still lack the basics. “Ukraine wasn’t ready for this war. We never thought that our neighbor, who turned out to be our enemy, would resort to a full-scale invasion,” Kazmirchuk says as he picks out goggles, gloves and camouflage T-shirts for six service members he’s sponsoring in Donetsk. “Therefore, not everyone has everything.” Ukraine’s loudest pleas to its allies have been for fighter jets, air defense systems and long-range weapons to defend itself. The United States and its allies have answered many of those calls by providing billions of dollars worth of rockets, tanks, drones and artillery. Yet, as Russia’s war approaches the six-month mark, Ukraine is also burning through its stores of necessities that most modern militaries take for granted. Now, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukrainian troops and their supporters are seeking out creative solutions to crowdsource their way through the war. Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Zelenskyy, told NBC News that Ukraine’s military needs continual resupplies from allies of food, first-aid kits, vehicles, protective equipment, small arms and ammunition. At the height of Russia’s offensive, he said, it was firing up to 60,000 rounds of ammunition per day, forcing Ukraine to respond in turn. “The societies in certain partner countries do not fully understand the level of intensity of the war in Ukraine,” he said in an interview at the presidential offices in Kyiv. “This is a massive war; it is not just a minor regional conflict.” Part of the challenge in keeping Ukraine’s forces supplied is the growing number of people participating in the fight. In the run-up to the war, Ukraine’s armed forces comprised just under 200,000 active-duty troops, according to a report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based security think tank. Russia had more than four times that number, it said. Just hours after Russia invaded Feb. 24, Zelenskyy signed a decree ordering a “general mobilization” of the public, recently extended by Ukraine’s Parliament until November. Since then, hundreds of thousands of reservists, members of Ukraine’s Territorial Defense Forces and others have joined the battle. “There’s also police, and National Guard are also (serving) in the front,” said Yevheniya Kravchuk, a member of Parliament whose husband is in the national police force. “They basically have needs the same as our military.” In May, Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s armed forces had grown to 700,000-strong. That same month, he launched a national crowdfunding drive, United24, to bring in donations of cash, medical equipment and defense supplies, audited by Deloitte Ukraine. Through an online portal, donors are asked to sponsor specific items that, once purchased, are rushed to the front lines: $4,000 for a metal detector to aid in clearing land mines; $80,000 for an armored ambulance. The project is also trying to acquire an “army of drones” to help Ukraine’s military monitor the 1,200-mile-long front line. The campaign includes a drop-off site just outside New York City where donors can drop off their own hobby drones to be sent to Ukraine. With emergency medical supplies also in growing need, the project recently said it purchased 35 artificial ventilation devices, to be used by paramedics and doctors who work 24-hour shifts evacuating troops and civilians injured near the front lines. As he practiced intubating a medical dummy in his ambulance at an Odesa hospital, Dr. Eduardo Kika said the devices have helped save lives of patients injured in mine explosions, and those with lung failure or with traumatic brain injuries who can’t breathe for themselves. “Unfortunately, we do not have enough devices. We have a shortage of ventilators,” the emergency physician and anesthesiologist said through a translator. He said tourniquets, bandages and hemostatic sponges to control bleeding are also in short supply. “As for the front line, our soldiers need painkillers.” Some Ukrainians who have joined the fight are turning to family, friends and co-workers to help make up for shortages. On the main drag in the bustling capital, Kyiv, the tables at the Georgia restaurant overflow with khachapuri (Georgian cheese bread), khinkali dumplings and traditional Georgian wine. But the proprietor, Chef Alexander, is nowhere in sight. He is serving on the front lines and the restaurant declined to provide his last name to protect his safety on the battlefield. Alexander was deployed without much of the basic equipment he needed, the restaurant’s manager, Olga Rogozina, said. The restaurant now devotes 10 percent of every bill to buying him gear: First, night-vision goggles, and next, a Volkswagen to transport him and six of his troop mates. “All the Ukrainian people are helping our army,” Rogozina said. “And if they are looking for a way to help, they have this way.”"
2022-08-19,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/major-gas-pipeline-nord-stream-1-shut-three-days-placing-pressure-eu-f-rcna43980,"Major gas pipeline Nord Stream 1 to shut for three days, placing pressure on E.U. fuel supplies","FRANKFURT/BERLIN — Russia will halt natural gas supplies to Europe for three days at the end of the month via its main pipeline into the region, state energy giant Gazprom said on Friday, piling pressure on the region as it seeks to refuel ahead of winter. The unscheduled maintenance order on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which runs under the Baltic Sea to Germany, deepens an energy standoff between Moscow and Brussels which has already helped send inflation surging in the region and raised the risk of rationing and recession. Gazprom said the three-day shutdown was because the pipeline’s only remaining gas compressor requires maintenance, yet the move will bring further disruption particularly for Germany, which depends largely on deliveries from Moscow to power its industry. The latest shut-down follows a 10-day scheduled annual maintenance that took place in July, and raised fears over whether Russia would resume supplies, which have been reduced since mid-June. Germany has already had to give Uniper — its largest importer of Russian gas and the highest-profile corporate victim of Europe’s energy crisis so far — a 15 billion euro ($15.1 billion) bailout after Russia drastically cut flows, forcing it to buy gas elsewhere at much higher prices. The broader Germany economic impact was highlighted in producer price data on Friday which in July saw their highest ever increases, both year-on-year and month-on-month, as energy costs skyrocket. The Nord Stream pipeline had already been running at just a fifth of its capacity, stoking fears that Russia could halt flows completely heading into the winter heating season and make it more difficult to fill up storage facilities. Germany has made targeted efforts to fill up its storage facilities to prepare, with levels standing at 78.19% as of August 17, slightly more than the 75.89% for the European Union as a whole. After maintenance is complete, and “in the absence of technical malfunctions,” flows of 33 million cubic meters (mcm) a day — in line with current volumes — will resume, Gazprom said. This would still be just 20% of Nord Stream’s full capacity of 167 mcm per day. Gazprom said maintenance work at the remaining Trent 60 gas compressor station would be carried out together with Siemens. The Russian group has previously blamed faulty or delayed equipment for lower flows. Germany says this is a pretext to hurt its economy. Siemens Energy, which is in charge of maintaining the Nord Stream 1 turbines, declined to comment. Earlier, senior German politicians from governing parties rejected suggestions that gas shortages could be alleviated by allowing the suspended Nord Stream 2 pipeline to go into service, something the Kremlin has suggested as a solution. “I strongly suggest we spare ourselves the humiliation of always asking (Russian President Vladimir) Putin for something that we’re not going to get,” said Kevin Kuehnert, number two official in Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats. “The dependence on him has to end for once and all,” he added in an interview with website t-online."

The series of blasts hit military depots and airbases in the annexed peninsula over the past week, hinting at a growing ability by Ukraine's military or its backers to strike deep behind enemy lines, a development that could shift the dynamics of the war. Kyiv has stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility for the explosions. The government official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to disclose information about the Crimea strikes to journalists. Experts have speculated that guerrilla fighters, known colloquially as “partisans,” may have played a role, given the nature of the blasts. The official declined to say whether the Ukrainian military or special forces were also involved in the attacks. But he added, “Only thanks to the people who oppose Putin in the occupied territories and in Russia today, resistance is possible.” Explosions were reported near an airbase Thursday night in Crimea, on the southwest coast near the port city of Sevastopol, the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. On the opposite end of the peninsula, the sky was also lit up at Kerch near a huge bridge to Russia, in what Russia said was fire from its air defenses. On Tuesday, large blasts and fires were reported at a military depot in Russian-annexed Crimea, forcing more than 3,000 people to flee the region. Russia called the blasts at an ammunition storage facility in Mayskoye an “act of sabotage,” without naming suspects. Moscow has warned in the past that such attacks would be crossing a red line. But, as with last week’s explosions, speculation fell on Ukrainian forces as having staged the attacks on the region, which Russia has controlled since 2014. A U.S. official with knowledge of the matter has told NBC News that the Biden administration has placed no restrictions on Ukraine launching strikes in Crimea using U.S.-supplied long-range weapons like HIMARS. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had previously said that Ukraine had committed to not using such weapons to target sites inside Russia. The official insisted the U.S. is neither encouraging nor discouraging Ukraine to launch attacks in Crimea, but said, “simply put, the targeting decisions of where the Ukrainians strike is up to Ukraine.” Despite Moscow’s annexation of the peninsula in 2014, the U.S. and the international community still consider Crimea to be Ukrainian territory. The peninsula holds huge strategic and symbolic significance for Russia and Ukraine, and the Kremlin’s demand that Kyiv recognize it as part of Russia has been one of its key conditions for ending the fighting. Ukraine, meanwhile, has vowed to drive the Russians from the peninsula and all other occupied territories. Crimea has been a major strategic hub for Russia’s invasion of mainland Ukraine, providing important supply routes for its forces occupying the south and military bases to support its war operations. It’s also home to Russia’s Black Sea fleet. Josh Lederman reported from Dnipro, and Hyder Abbasi from London."

Amid mounting fears of a disaster and with both sides alleging the other is planning ""provocations,"" Ukraine‘s national energy company said that many staff members had been ordered to stay home and that Moscow wants to disconnect the plant from the power grid. The Russian-occupied plant is the largest in Europe, with the two countries trading blame over who is responsible for attacks on the site in recent weeks. Concerns for the safety of the nuclear reactor have sparked growing international alarm and calls for a demilitarized zone around the site, which Russia has rejected. Energoatom, the Ukrainian energy company, said early Friday that Russia is planning to switch off the power blocks at the Zaporizhzhia plant and disconnect them from Ukraine's power grid, which would deny the country a major energy source. It also said that the majority of staff members at the plant had been ordered to stay home, with only those who operate the power units allowed in. ""There is information that the Russian occupying forces are planning to stop working power units in the near future and disconnect them from the communication lines supplying power to the Ukrainian power system,” it said in a post on Telegram. The Russian military ""is looking for suppliers of fuel for diesel generators, which must be turned on after the shutdown of power units and in the absence of external power supply for nuclear fuel cooling systems."" Energoatom did not cite any evidence to support its allegations. On Thursday, Ukrainian military intelligence told NBC News that Russian staff members at the nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine had been told not to go to work Friday. This might be evidence that Russia is preparing “large-scale provocations” at the plant Friday, according to Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s Main Intelligence Directorate. Kyiv warned anew Friday that ""the probability of a major act of terror at the nuclear facility is very high."" For its part, Russia said that defense systems of the plant have been strengthened due to what it said are fears of an attack on the facility by Ukraine’s military. The comments were made by Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russian administration that is in control of the occupied region and were reported by the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Rogov, who represents the Russian-controlled area of Zaporizhzhia, also dismissed as ""irresponsible"" and ""out of the question"" calls for the Kremlin's troops to leave the plant and allow a demilitarized zone to be set up. On Thursday, Russia threatened to shut down the plant, warning that there was a risk of a human-made disaster due to alleged continued shelling by Ukraine.

This comes amid allegations and speculation from both Russia and Ukraine that an incident is being planned Friday at the plant. On Thursday, Russia threatened to shut down the plant, warning that there was a risk of a human-made disaster due to alleged continued shelling by Ukraine. But Ukraine has a completely different story, according to Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s Main Intelligence Directorate. “There is new information, it arrived about half an hour ago, that for tomorrow, August 19, there is an order for the majority of the staff not to go to work,” Yusov said, speaking exclusively to NBC News. “This is what the Russians told their people, primarily the employees of Rosatom,” he said, referring to the Russian nuclear agency. He said that this might be evidence that Russia is preparing “large-scale provocations” at the power plant Friday. “We do not rule out the possibility of massive Russian provocations on the territory of the ZNPP tomorrow. This is confirmed by their propaganda, information from our sources, and the behavior of the Russians at the station,” he added, referring to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russia refused to confirm or deny whether any Rosatom personnel are stationed at Zaporizhzhia. Earlier Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry accused Ukraine and what it called its “U.S. handlers” of trying to stage a “minor accident” at the plant in southern Ukraine on Friday in order to blame Russia. It said the “provocation” was timed to coincide with a visit to Ukraine by United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres and that it may involve a radiation leak. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear reactor complex, the largest in Europe, was captured by Russia soon after it invaded Ukraine almost six months ago and has come under repeated shelling, with both Moscow and Kyiv trading blame. Russia has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of recklessly firing at the plant, while Ukraine says Russia is deliberately using the complex as a base to launch attacks against its population. NBC News has not verified the claims of either side. A senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that the simplest solution to the situation would be for Russian forces to withdraw from the plant, remove any munitions stored there and de-mine it. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told reporters Thursday that Moscow was taking measures to ensure safety at the complex and denied it had deployed heavy weapons in and around the plant. However the ministry said a shutdown of the plant may be attempted if Ukrainian forces continued shelling it. In a briefing, Igor Kirillov, head of Russia’s radioactive, chemical and biological defense forces, said the plant’s backup support systems had been damaged as a result of shelling. Kirillov presented a slide, showing that in the event of an accident at the plant, radioactive material would cover Germany, Poland and Slovakia."

A series of blasts hit a Russian military depot in the annexed peninsula Tuesday — rocking the relaxed summer holiday destination for the second time in a week and suggesting a growing Ukrainian ability to strike deep behind enemy lines. It’s a significant development that could shift the dynamics of the war as it nears the six-month mark, and which defies warnings from Moscow against attacking a region that holds deep strategic and symbolic value for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia said “sabotage” was behind the latest explosions, a shift from its rhetoric last week that an accidental detonation of munitions caused explosions that left severe destruction at an air base in western Crimea. Videos circulating online Tuesday showed plumes of gray smoke rising over flames near the village of Mayskoye in the northern Crimean district of Dzhankoi after a series of explosions at an ammunition warehouse, and satellite imagery reviewed by NBC News showed a column of smoke near Dzhankoi."

Last month, Moscow announced plans to hold “Vostok” (East) exercises from Aug. 30 to Sept. 5, even as it wages a costly war in Ukraine. It said at the time that some foreign forces would participate, without naming them. Its last such exercises took place in 2018, when China took part for the first time. China’s defense ministry said its participation in the exercises was part of an ongoing bilateral annual cooperation agreement with Russia. “The aim is to deepen practical and friendly cooperation with the armies of participating countries, enhance the level of strategic collaboration among the participating parties, and strengthen the ability to respond to various security threats,” the statement said. Under Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, Beijing and Moscow have grown increasingly close. Shortly before Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Beijing and Moscow announced a “no limits” partnership, although U.S. officials say they have not seen China evade U.S.-led sanctions on Russia or provide it with military equipment. Russia’s eastern military district includes part of Siberia and has its headquarters in Khabarovsk, near the Chinese border."
2022-08-16,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/new-explosions-russia-crimea-ukraine-rcna43261,New blasts rock Russian sites in annexed Crimea,"Massive explosions and fires hit a military depot in Russia-annexed Crimea on Tuesday, forcing the evacuation of more than 3,000 people, the second time in recent days that the Ukraine war’s focus has turned to the contested peninsula. Russia blamed the blasts at an ammunition storage facility in Mayskoye on an “act of sabotage” without naming the perpetrators. As with last week’s explosions, they led to speculation that Ukrainian forces may have staged an attack on the peninsula, which Russia has controlled since 2014. Separately, the Russian business newspaper Kommersant quoted local residents as saying that plumes of black smoke also rose over an air base in Crimea’s Gvardeyskoye. Ukraine has stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility for any of the fires or explosions, including last week’s at another air base that destroyed a number of Russian planes. If Ukrainian forces were, in fact, responsible for any of the explosions, they would represent a significant escalation in the war. Videos posted on social media showed thick plumes of smoke rising over raging flames in Mayskoye, and a series of explosions could be heard in the background. The Russian Defense Ministry said the fires at the depot caused damage to a power plant, power lines, rail tracks and some apartment buildings. It said in a statement that “there were no serious injuries.” Earlier, Russia’s state news agency RIA Novosti reported a fire a transformer substation after “a loud thump sound” in what appeared to be a result of the blasts at the depot. Crimea holds huge strategic and symbolic significance for Russia and Ukraine. The Kremlin’s demand that Kyiv recognize the peninsula as part of Russia has been one of its key conditions for ending the fighting, while Ukraine has vowed to drive the Russians from the peninsula and all other occupied territories. The district where the blasts happened, Dzhankoi, is in the north of the peninsula, about 30 miles from the Russian-controlled region of Kherson in southern Ukraine. Kyiv has recently mounted a series of attacks on various sites in the region, targeting supply routes for the Russian military there and ammunition depots. Last week’s explosions at Saki air base sent sunbathers on nearby beaches fleeing as huge flames and pillars of smoke rose over the horizon. Ukrainian officials emphasized Tuesday that Crimea — which is a popular destination for Russian tourists — would not be spared the ravages of war experienced throughout Ukraine. Rather than a travel destination, “Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouses explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves,” Ukraine presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter, though he did not claim any Ukraine responsibility for the blasts. Crimea’s regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov, said that two people were injured and more than 3,000 evacuated from the villages of Mayskoye and Azovskoye near Dzhankoi following the munitions depot explosions. Because the explosions damaged rail tracks, some trains in northern Crimea were diverted to other lines. The Russian military blamed last week’s blasts at the Saki air base on an accidental detonation of munitions there, but it appeared to be the result of a Ukrainian attack. Ukrainian officials at the time stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility for the explosions, while mocking Russia’s explanation that a careless smoker might have caused the ammunition to catch fire. Analysts also said that explanation doesn’t make sense and that the Ukrainians could have used anti-ship missiles to strike the base. A British Defense Ministry intelligence update said vessels in Russia’s Black Sea Fleet “continue to pursue an extremely defensive posture” in the waters off Crimea, with the ships barely venturing out of sight of the coastline. Russia already lost its flagship Moskva in the Black Sea and last month the Ukrainian military retook the strategic Snake Island outpost off Ukraine’s southwestern coast. It is vital for guaranteeing sea lanes out of Odesa, Ukraine’s biggest port. The Russian fleet’s “limited effectiveness undermines Russia’s overall invasion strategy,” the British statement said. “This means Ukraine can divert resources to press Russian ground forces elsewhere.”"
2022-08-13,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraines-russia-held-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-explained-rcna42785,Ukraine's Russia-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - explained,"The horrors of Russia’s invasion have so far been visited on the Ukrainian people. But intensifying fighting around a nuclear power plant — Europe’s largest — could put swaths of the continent at risk of a radiation catastrophe. The Zaporizhzhia complex in Ukraine's southeastern town of Enerhodar was captured by Russia in the early days of the war. Still operated by Ukrainian technicians, it has fueled growing international alarm after shelling hit the plant, whose six reactors generate more power than any such facility in the United States. The West is accusing Russia of nuclear terrorism, deliberately stationing hundreds of troops and stores of weapons there to use it as a “shield” for the bombardment of nearby targets. Ukraine also says Russian forces are directly attacking the site. Many of Russia's claims during the war have stretched credulity, but Moscow is charging Kyiv with repeatedly attacking the plant. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov alleged the Ukrainian shelling is “fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for all of Europe.” As a result, officials in the city of Zaporizhzhia, which remains under Ukrainian control, have started to prepare plans to evacuate civilians in case of a radiation leak. Here’s why observers are so concerned: Built by the then-Soviet Union in the 1980s, Zaporizhzhia's six light-water reactors make it among the 10 most powerful nuclear power stations in the world. After the invasion began Feb. 24, the Kremlin war machine took a little over a week to capture the plant at Enerhodar, a city that is around a 2-hour drive southwest of the larger Zaporizhzhia."
2022-08-11,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-russia-missile-guided-tactics-war-himars-nasams-rcna42619,"Missile systems, tactics in Ukraine and what could turn the tide","The Biden administration this week promised Ukraine $1 billion in additional military aid, including ammunition for precision-guided missile systems mounted on trucks, anti-tank weapons, anti-aircraft artillery and short-range rockets, as well as medical supplies and medical vehicles. The package brings to $9.8 billion the total for U.S. military aid so far since Russia invaded its much smaller neighbor. Here’s a look at weapons systems the U.S. has pledged to send and whether experts believe they meet Kyiv’s needs as it battles a military with many times its own firepower. One of the most powerful technologies being supplied to Ukraine is the Lockheed Martin-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, used by the U.S. Army since 2007, said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a national security think tank. It has a range of 47 miles and hits targets at a precision of 20 feet. The other is the Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, or NASAMS, a surface-to-air defense system developed by Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace and Raytheon Missiles & Defense, which can detect targets 75 miles away and engage them at 19 miles. Ukraine’s government has been asking other countries for even longer-range weapons since the war began in February, and it continues to keep the pressure up. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said last week that if Russia were to continue using old Soviet technology and overwhelming Ukraine’s defenses with an avalanche of continuous shelling, Ukraine would require long-range missiles to have any chance of damaging Russian assets like ammunition warehouses. Cancian said Ukraine has to fight smartly, because it has two-thirds less ammunition than Russia, so every weapons launch has to be precisely targeted and must hit a high-value Russian target. He said Ukraine, which began the war with old Soviet weaponry, has done well, given its army has had to come to grips with complex new weapons systems while constantly under fire. “We are pushing Ukraine through training programs in a few weeks. In comparison, we take a few months to train U.S. Marine Corps infantry,” Cancian said. While the Defense Department continues to hold weekly briefings with the media, some military experts now suspect that some more sophisticated weapon technology donations given to Ukrainians are being kept a secret from the world. On Monday, the Pentagon acknowledged in a news briefing that the U.S. had sent anti-radar missiles to Ukraine for the first time. The weapons have not been mentioned in any of the military aid packages announced so far by the Biden administration. “It is what is not being talked about that could prove most important” to Ukraine’s war efforts, said Justin Crump, a 27-year veteran British army tank commander who was on the ground in Kyiv in July. “Ukraine has more aircraft than it used to and better systems — this shouldn’t be happening six months into a war with Russia,” Crump said. He said he suspected that Western governments have supplied Ukraine with the M982 Excalibur — a 155 mm precision-guided artillery shell that can be loaded into long-range M777 howitzer guns. Developed by the Arizona-based firm Raytheon Missiles & Defense, the M982 Excalibur is touted as being able to hit any target, at any range, within an extremely precise distance of just 7 feet, Cancian said. The Pentagon declined to comment on whether the U.S. was sending Ukraine weapons it has not officially announced. Ukrainian officials declined to comment on the record. On Tuesday afternoon, several explosions rocked the Saki air base in Novofedorivka, 99 miles behind the Russian front line in Crimea. The incident killed one person, the region’s Russia-appointed governor, Sergei Aksyonov, said in a statement. Videos went viral on social media as users speculated that the explosions might be caused by long-range weapons, because it would be difficult for Ukraine to attack such a faraway target with short-range artillery. Several military experts agreed in interviews. They said Ukraine was most likely using either drones or MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile Systems, also known as ATACMS, produced by the U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin, which have a range of 190 miles. “The explosions in Crimea were huge. They destroyed nine Sukhoi Su-24 and Sukhoi Su-33 Soviet aircraft and threw a steel beam through a car some way away,” said Crump, who is also the CEO of the geopolitical risk and intelligence consultancy firm Sibylline. “Ukraine is still being coy on the cause, but clearly something is up,” he added, referring to the possibility that the West has sent more weapons systems to the country than it has officially announced. Crump is leaning more toward drones. He said Western governments have so far hesitated to provide Ukraine with the longer-range ATACMS, because they fear Russia would see it as an escalation. Ukraine has also been vocal in its wishes for new state-of-the-art weaponry, such as the Iron Dome, a mobile air defense system developed by the Israeli firms Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries, which the makers say can intercept incoming missiles with a 97% success rate. But Cancian pointed out that the weapons being donated to Ukraine are not exactly old equipment being tossed out by wealthier countries: The U.S. bought several NASAMS to protect the White House in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Stacie Pettyjohn, the director of the defense program at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington, D.C.-based military think tank, does not believe the world’s latest defense innovations are critical to turning the tide in the conflict. She and Cancian said they feel much more lies in Ukraine’s ability to train up enough personnel to operate its new, often complicated missile systems, because they need to have enough mechanics to maintain the machines, on top of enough people able to staff them. “F-16 fighter jets would take years to integrate,” Cancian said. “Iron Dome could be helpful, but [even] the U.S. doesn’t really have any. We have been testing some, but we don’t have any” in the field. Ukraine must also fully shift to NATO’s standardized ammunition as soon as possible, which would enable more countries to donate compatible artillery and components for when the machines go wrong, Cancian and Pettyjohn said. “In the end it might come down to some of the more mundane, less sophisticated systems like the 155 mm artillery shell rounds,” Pettyjohn said, referring to large-caliber projectiles typically fired from armored vehicles. “Right now, Ukraine has so many pieces of equipment from so many countries that keeping them all working and having spare parts for them will be a real challenge.”"
2022-08-11,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/satellite-images-show-damage-russian-air-base-crimea-rcna42582,Satellite images show damage at Russian air base in Crimea,"New satellite images have revealed the heavy damage to a Russian air base in Crimea that was rocked by explosions earlier this week, calling into question Moscow’s ability to protect the territory it controls in Ukraine’s south. The pictures, released Thursday, added to a growing belief that the blasts may be the result of Ukrainian attacks, suggesting an ability to strike deep behind enemy lines that could help shift the course of the war. It comes as Ukraine and Russia traded accusations of new strikes on Europe’s largest nuclear plant, in a crisis that has stoked fears of a catastrophe. The United Nations is set to discuss the situation Thursday. As international leaders raised the alarm about what would be a dramatic development in the conflict, experts and analysts were assessing another. Kyiv said nine Russian warplanes were destroyed in a series of blasts at the Saki air base in annexed Crimea on Tuesday, while Russia denied any damage and said the incident stemmed from ammunition detonating. Ukraine has not publicly claimed responsibility for the blasts. But the satellite images released by Planet Labs, an American public Earth imaging company, appear to contradict Russian assertions. NBC News analysis of the imagery suggests two buildings in the northeast corner of the base burned to the ground, with what appears to be the burned-out wreckage of at least six planes visible, and several other planes damaged. NBC News could not independently verify if all the aircraft were airworthy."
2022-08-10,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-attacks-nuclear-power-plant-zaporizhzhia-employees-rcna42349,Attacks on Europe’s largest nuclear power plant leave former worker 'very scared',"ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — As Ukraine and Russia trade blame for shelling around Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, one former employee said the consequences could be catastrophic and that she is terrified for her former colleagues at the facility in the town of Enerhodar. “The mood there is very sad. It is very scary for them to work,” Alyona, 37, told NBC News on Tuesday from the city of Zaporizhzhia, which is still under Ukrainian control. NBC News isn’t revealing her last name because she still has family in parts of the Zaporizhzhia region under Russian rule and she fears repercussions. Also, her husband is in the Ukrainian army. Alyona said she stopped going to work as an engineer at the nuclear plant after Russian forces seized it in March and escaped to Zaporizhzhia soon after. She added that she is still able to call and exchange messages with some of her former co-workers at the plant, which was operated by around 11,000 people before the Russian invasion. The number of staff currently working there is unknown. “I feel really scared that they are in there,” Alyona said about the Russian forces who had taken control of the plant, adding she did not think they “generally understand what a nuclear station is and how to control it.” “They are doing such senseless things that it makes me scared,” she said. Her comments came after Kyiv and Moscow traded accusations over who is responsible for attacks on the Soviet-era site. Ukraine said Russian shelling hit the plant Friday and Saturday, damaging several buildings, putting one reactor offline and raising the threat of radiation leaks and fires. Energoatom, Ukraine’s national energy company, said in an update Wednesday that the Russian attacks have caused “a serious risk” to the safe operation of the plant, with monitoring sensors damaged and a possibility of radioactive leaks. It added that the plant remains operational and continues to produce energy for Ukraine. It added the attacks had damaged a high-voltage power line that served the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Russia has denied shelling the plant, instead accusing Ukraine’s 44th Artillery Brigade of launching attacks on it from the nearby town of Marganets. NBC News has not verified the claims of either side. Amid increasing global alarm, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement Tuesday that available radiation measurements continued to show normal levels at the site, and its experts assessed that there was no immediate threat to nuclear safety. This matched a U.S. assessment, a White House National Security Council official said. However, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in Tuesday’s statement that the shelling at the plant “breached virtually all the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars,” including those related to a plant’s physical integrity, functioning safety and security systems, staff and external power supplies. This prompted foreign ministers of the Group of Seven nations on Wednesday to urge Russia to immediately hand back control of the plant to Ukraine. They said in a statement that the staff must be able to carry out their duties “without threats or pressure,” and called for access to all of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities for international monitors. Moscow has yet to respond. Alyona said the consequences of a meltdown at the plant would be far-reaching and “much more terrible” than those from the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant near the northern Ukrainian city of Pripyat. Considered to be the worst on record, it required the evacuation of more than 100,000 people living within nearly 19 miles, and the resulting radiation was detected across Europe. “I don’t even let myself think about that,” Alyona said. While others said they were hoping for the best, Dmytro Orlov, the exiled mayor of Enerhodar, warned that his community would “cease to exist” should something go wrong. “This territory would not be livable anymore,” he said. Morgan Chesky and Erika Angulo reported from Zaporizhzhia. Yuliya Talmazan reported from London."
2022-08-10,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-crimea-blast-explosion-planes-destroyed-kyiv-says-rcna42376,"9 Russian warplanes were destroyed in Crimea blasts, Ukraine says","Nine Russian jets were destroyed in explosions at an air base in Crimea, Ukraine’s air force said Wednesday. It comes amid speculation the blasts were the result of a Ukrainian attack that would represent a significant escalation in the war. Russia denied any aircraft were damaged in Tuesday’s explosions — or that any attack took place. Ukrainian officials have stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility for the explosions, while poking fun at Russia’s explanation that munitions at the Saki air base caught fire and blew up and underscoring the importance of the peninsula that Moscow annexed eight years ago. In his nightly video address several hours after the blasts, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to retake the peninsula, saying “this Russian war against Ukraine and against all of free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea — its liberation”. On Wednesday, Russian authorities sought to downplay the explosions, saying all hotels and beaches were unaffected on the peninsula, which is a popular tourist destination for many Russians. The fireballs, which killed one person and wounded 13, sent tourists fleeing in panic as plumes of smoke towered over the nearby coastline. They smashed windows and caused other damage in some apartment buildings. Russian jets have used Saki to strike areas in Ukraine’s south on short notice, and Ukrainian social networks were abuzz with speculation that Ukrainian-fired long-range missiles hit the base. Officials in Moscow have long warned Ukraine that any attack on Crimea would trigger massive retaliation, including strikes on “decision-making centres” in Kyiv. A Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, who is more outspoken than other officials, cryptically said on Tuesday the blasts were caused either by a Ukrainian-made long-range weapon or were the work of guerrillas operating in Crimea. The base on the Black Sea peninsula that dangles off southern Ukraine is at least 125 miles away from the closest Ukrainian position — out of the range of the missiles supplied by the U.S. for use in the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems or HIMARS systems. The Ukrainian military has successfully used those missiles, with a range of 50 miles, to target ammunition and fuel depots, strategic bridges and other key targets in Russia-occupied territories. HIMARS could also fire longer-range rockets, with a range of up to about 185 miles, that Ukraine has asked for. But U.S. authorities have refrained from providing them thus far, fearing it could provoke Russia and widen the conflict. But the explosions in Saki raised speculation on social media that Ukraine might have finally got the weapons. Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said the Ukrainian forces could have struck the Russian air base with a Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missile that has a range of about 125 miles and could have been adapted for use against ground targets and fired from Ukrainian positions near Mykolaiv northwest of Crimea. The Ukrainian military might also have used Western-supplied Harpoon anti-ship missiles that can also be used against ground targets and have a range of about 185 miles, he said. “(Officially) Kyiv has kept mum about it, but unofficially the military acknowledges that it was a Ukrainian strike,” Zhdanov said. If Ukrainian forces were, in fact, responsible for the blasts, it would be the first known major attack on a Russian military site in Crimea, which the Kremlin annexed in 2014. A smaller explosion last month at the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port of Sevastopol was blamed on Ukrainian saboteurs using a makeshift drone. During the war, Russia has reported numerous fires and explosions at munitions storage sites on its territory near the Ukrainian border, blaming some of them on Ukrainian strikes. Ukrainian authorities have mostly remained silent about the incidents. Meanwhile, Russian shelling hit areas across Ukraine on Tuesday night into Wednesday, including the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, where 13 people were killed and 11 others were wounded, according to the region’s governor Valentyn Reznichenko. Reznichenko said the Russian forces fired at the city of Marganets and a nearby village. Dozens of residential buildings, two schools and several administrative buildings were damaged by the shelling. “It was a terrible night,” Reznichenko said. “It’s very hard to take bodies from under debris. We are facing a cruel enemy who engage in daily terror against our cities and villages.” The Russian forces also continued shelling the nearby city of Nikopol across the Dnieper River from the Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the power station, stoking international fears of a catastrophe."

A criminal case against Marina Ovsyannikova was also launched on the charge of spreading false information about the Russian armed forces, her lawyer said on social media. The case was launched under a law, enacted after the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, that penalizes statements against the military, lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov said. A conviction is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Zakhvatov told the independent news site Meduza that the case is likely linked to a protest Ovsyannikova staged last month, holding a banner that said Russian President Vladimir Putin “is a killer, his soldiers are fascists.” Zakhvatov said on Telegram that after the raid Ovsyannikova is expected to be brought into the Investigative Committee for questioning. Ovsyannikova used to work as a producer with Russian state-funded Channel One. She made international headlines on March 14, when she appeared behind the anchor of an evening news broadcast holding a poster that said “stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.” She was charged with disparaging the Russian military and fined 30,000 rubles ($270 at the time). After quitting her job, Ovsyannikova became somewhat of an activist, staging antiwar pickets and speaking out publicly against the conflict. She was fined two more times in recent weeks for disparaging the military in a critical Facebook post and comments she made at a court where opposition figure Ilya Yashin was remanded into custody pending trial on spreading false information about the military. According to Net Freedoms, a legal aid group focusing on free speech cases, as of Wednesday there were 79 criminal cases on charges of spreading false information about the military and up to 4,000 administrative cases on charges of disparaging the armed forces."

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for international inspectors to be given access to the sprawling nuclear site as fears of a disaster grew after the weekend strikes left the plant damaged but still operational. “Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,” he said Monday in Tokyo after a ceremony in Hiroshima to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world’s first atomic bombing. Russia and Ukraine have traded accusations over who is responsible for attacks on the plant, which is the largest in Europe."

Ukraine‘s state nuclear power firm said Russian forces damaged three radiation sensors at the facility in renewed shelling on Saturday night, wounding a worker with shrapnel. “Russian nuclear terror requires a stronger response from the international community — sanctions on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter. The plant in Russian-controlled territory was also shelled on Friday. Moscow blames Ukrainian forces for the strikes. Ukrainian nuclear company Energoatom said the latest Russian rocket attacks hit the plant’s dry storage facility, where 174 containers with spent nuclear fuel were stored in the open air. “Consequently, timely detection and response in the event of a deterioration in the radiation situation or leakage of radiation from containers of spent nuclear fuel are not yet possible,” it said. In a statement carried by Interfax news agency, the Russian-installed administration of occupied Enerhodar, where the plant’s employees live, said Ukraine had struck using a 220-mm Uragan multiple rocket launcher system. “The administrative buildings and the adjacent territory of the storage facility were damaged,” it said The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had said Friday’s shelling showed the risk of a nuclear disaster. Those shells hit a high-voltage power line, prompting the plant’s operators to disconnect a reactor despite no radioactive leak being detected. The Zaporizhzhia plant was captured by Russian forces in early March in the opening stage of the war but is still run by Ukrainian technicians."
2022-08-07,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/four-grain-ships-depart-ukraine-officials-say-rcna41890,"Four more grain ships depart Ukraine, officials say","Four ships carrying food produce sailed from Black Sea ports in Ukraine Sunday as part of a deal to unblock the country’s sea exports, Ukrainian and Turkish officials said. The four bulk carriers were loaded with more than 160,000 tons of corn and other foodstuffs. The resumption of grain exports is being overseen by a Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul where Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and United Nations personnel are working. The U.N. and Turkey brokered the deal last month after U.N. warnings of possible outbreaks of famine in parts of the world due to a halt in grain shipments from Ukraine that had squeezed supplies and sent prices soaring. Before the invasion, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports. The JCC said late on Saturday it had authorized the departure of a total of five new vessels through the Black Sea corridor: four vessels outbound from Chornomorsk and Odesa carrying 161,084 metric tons of produce, and one inbound. The ships that have left Ukrainian ports included Glory, with a cargo of 66,000 tons of corn bound for Istanbul, and Riva Wind, loaded with 44,000 tons of corn, heading for Turkey’s Iskenderun, the Turkish defense ministry said. It said the other two vessels to have left Ukraine were Star Helena, with a cargo of 45,000 tons of meal heading to China, and Mustafa Necati, carrying 6,000 tons of sunflower oil and heading for Italy. The first four ships left Ukraine last week under the agreement."
2022-08-06,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-russia-war-donetsk-evacuations-leave-rcna41465,Ukraine-Russia war: Donetsk evacuations leave some behind,"KYIV, Ukraine — Evacuate now or face the misery of a Russian onslaught as winter approaches: That’s the blunt warning Ukraine delivered to the hundreds of thousands of civilians still left in Donetsk, the eastern province that is now the heart of the country’s fight for survival. For some, the choice is made simpler by every thud of a Russian shell. For others, the prospect of giving up on their homes, potentially for good, is still inconceivable. Lyudmyla Bogomolova was born and raised in the tiny village of Pavlivka, just miles away from what are now the front lines of the battles in the industrial heartland of Ukraine’s east. Since Russia invaded in February, the math teacher has been helping to deliver humanitarian aid to those in need in her village. But with Moscow’s might focused on a push to take full control of her home province, the shelling has become hard to bear. Bogomolova, 51, and her husband, Mykola, first thought about leaving last month, she told NBC News on the phone. “It was becoming impossible to stay because of heavy shelling,” she said, her voice filled with sadness and worry. “The deep fear just didn’t go away.” Then, on July 24, a rocket attack on their village left Mykola, 54, with the bone and joint in his left hand completely crushed, Bogomolova said. Their minds were made up. “We’ll leave as soon as possible,” she said. Bogomolova, who is currently in the city of Kurakhove where Mykola is being treated in hospital for his injuries, is one of more than 200,000 people in Donetsk that the Ukrainian government is hoping to get out now — while there is still time."
2022-08-05,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/three-ships-grain-depart-ukrainian-ports-russian-blockade-rcna41681,Three more ships with grain depart Ukrainian ports after Russian blockade,"Three more ships with grain have left Ukrainian ports and are headed to Turkey for inspection, Turkey’s defense ministry said Friday, evidence that a U.N.-backed deal is working to export Ukrainian grain that has been trapped by Russia’s invasion. The three ships are loaded with over 58,000 tons of corn. Much of the grain that Ukraine exports is used as animal feed, experts say. Ukraine is one of the world’s main breadbaskets and the stocks of grain trapped were exacerbating a sharp rise of food prices and raising fears of a global hunger crisis. The departure of the ships comes after the first grain shipment since the start of the war left Ukraine earlier this week. It crossed the Black Sea under the breakthrough wartime deal and passed inspection Wednesday in Istanbul and then headed on to Lebanon. The ships that departed Friday from Ukraine are from among over a dozen bulk carriers and cargo ships that had been loaded with grain and stuck at the ports there since the start of Russia’s invasion in late February. While tens of thousands of tons of grains are now making their way out with these latest shipments, it’s still a fraction of the 20 million tons of grains which Ukraine says are trapped in the country’s silos and ports, and which must be shipped out in order to make space for this year’s harvest. Around 6 million tons of that trapped grain is wheat, and just half of that is for human consumption, said David Laborde, an expert on agriculture and trade at the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington D.C. Prices of grains peaked in the first weeks after Russia’s invasion, but some have since come down to their pre-war levels. Corn prices are running around 70% above the levels seen at the end of February 2020, before the pandemic, according to Jonathan Haines, senior analyst and data and analytics firm, Gro Intelligence. He said wheat prices are currently 63% above the levels seen at the end of February this year, when the invasion was launched. The three ships that left Ukrainian ports are the Turkish-flagged Polarnet, carrying 12,000 tons of corn, which left the Chornomorsk port bound for Karasu, Turkey. The Panama-flagged Navi Star left Odesa’s port for Ireland with 33,000 tons of corn. The Maltese-flagged Rojen left Chornomorsk for the United Kingdom carrying over 13,000 tons of corn, according to the United Nations. The U.N. said the joint coordination center overseeing the deal had authorized the three ships as the operation expands, and also inspected a ship headed for Ukraine. The Barbados-flagged Fulmar S was inspected in Istanbul and is destined for Ukraine’s Chornomorsk port. Officials from Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the U.N. make up the Joint Coordination Center that oversees the deal signed in Istanbul last month. The deal’s aim is to create safe Black Sea shipping corridors to export Ukraine’s desperately needed agricultural products. Checks on ships by inspectors seek to ensure that outbound cargo ships carry only grain, fertilizer or food and not any other commodities, and that inbound ships are not carrying weapons. The U.N. said that the humanitarian corridor had to be revised after this week’s first shipment “to allow for more efficient passage of ships while maintaining safety.”"
2022-08-05,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ready-discuss-prisoner-swap-us-griner-sentence-rcna41683,Russia ready to discuss prisoner swap after Griner jail sentence,"Russia said Friday it was ready to discuss a prisoner swap with the United States, a day after WNBA star Brittney Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison by a Russian court for a drug offense. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow was “ready to discuss this topic,” but only within the framework of a diplomatic channel that he said had been previously agreed upon by President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. “There is a special channel that has been agreed upon by the presidents, and no matter what anyone says publicly, this channel remains relevant,” he said at a news conference at a meeting with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Cambodia. Biden said Friday that he was “hopeful,” about Griner Friday. “We’re working hard,” he told reporters at the White House after a bill signing. He has previously said that his adminstration would “work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue” to bring Griner and Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16-year sentence for espionage, back home. The U.S. has proposed that Moscow release the pair in exchange for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, according to two sources familiar with the matter. But Russia has shown no sign of accepting the offer, and has decried Washington's decision to publicize it in an effort to step up the pressure for a deal. Lavrov warned the U.S. against conducting “public diplomacy” and making “loud announcements” on the issue, suggesting it could imperil the high-stakes efforts to secure a swap. “If the Americans decide to resort to public diplomacy again and make loud announcements ... this is their business, their problem,” he said Friday. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Lavrov's comments suggested Russia was ""prepared to engage through channels we've established ... and we'll be pursuing that."" He was also speaking at a news conference in Phnom Penh, but a State Department official said the countries' two top diplomats had not yet spoken face-to-face at the ASEAN summit and had no plans to do so Friday. The last time they spoke directly was during a planned phone call last week, the official said."

Describing recently declassified intelligence, a U.S. official said the United States expects Russian officials to falsify intelligence about the July 29 attack on the prison camp in Olenivka, which Kremlin-backed separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region said killed 53 and injured 75. Ahead of likely future visits by international investigators and journalists to the attack site, the official said, “We have reason to believe that Russia would go so far as to make it appear that Ukrainian HIMARS were to blame.” HIMARS refers to High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, advanced medium-range rocket launchers, which the U.S. recently provided to Ukraine. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had exchanged intelligence information with other nations corroborating Russian plans to frame Ukraine for the attack. “There was no artillery strike from any area. It was an internal detonation inside one building where our prisoners of war were moved,” Podolyak told NBC News in an interview at the presidential office in Kyiv. “Russia made this terrible cover-up to hide its war crimes.” Russia’s military has asserted that Ukraine launched the strike on its own prisoners using U.S.-provided weapons, a claim Ukraine has vehemently disputed."
2022-08-04,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/brittney-griner-sentence-russia-prison-trial-rcna41270,Brittney Griner sentenced to 9 years in Russian prison on drug charges,"WNBA star Brittney Griner was sentenced to 9 years in Russian prison after being convicted on drug charges by a Moscow court Thursday. Griner pleaded guilty last month in a lengthy trial that has underscored the frayed relations between the United States and Russia since the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. Prosecutors asked for a sentence of 9 1/2 years after closing arguments Thursday. In a final plea for leniency, an emotional Griner apologized and repeated that she never intended to break any Russian laws but that she had made “an honest mistake.” Just hours later, Judge Anna Sotnikova returned to announce she had been found guilty of drug possession and smuggling. Griner, 31, will also have to pay a fine of 1 million rubles ($16,590), but can appeal the verdict. Attention will now turn to the potential for a prisoner swap between Washington and Moscow. U.S. officials are not expecting rapid movement in the effort to get Griner released, but will keep pressing the issue, a U.S. official told NBC News. “Today, American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney,” President Joe Biden said in a statement shortly after the verdict was announced. “It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends, and teammates. My administration will continue to work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible.” Griner’s legal team said she was “very disappointed,” in a statement to reporters outside the courthouse, adding that they were “very surprised by the verdict. “The court completely ignored all the evidence of the defense, and most importantly, the guilty plea,” her lawyers said in a separate statement sent on the Telegram messaging app. They added that they will file an appeal. And Griner's WNBA team, the Phoenix Mercury, said it remained hopeful the Biden administration will secure the basketball great's freedom. ""While we knew it was never the legal process that was going to bring our friend home, today’s verdict is a sobering milestone in the 168-day nightmare being endured by our sister, BG,"" the WNBA franchise said in a statement. ""We remain heartbroken for her, as we have every day for nearly six months. We remain grateful to and confident in the public servants working every day to return her to her family and us."" Griner was detained at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport in February; Russian authorities said they found vape canisters with cannabis oil in her luggage. Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, admitted the canisters were hers. She said she took them to Russia unintentionally after packing her luggage in a hurry. The Kremlin has been accused of using Griner as a political pawn, while the Biden administration has been under growing pressure from her family and teammates to secure her release. The U.S. government has proposed that Moscow release Griner and another American, Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16-year sentence for espionage, in exchange for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, according to two sources familiar with the matter. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Monday that Russia responded in “bad faith” to the U.S. government’s offer with one of its own. “We don’t see it as a serious counteroffer,” she said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who spoke with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, last week — the highest-level diplomatic engagement between the two countries since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February — to urge the Kremlin to accept the U.S. offer. The Russians responded by urging the U.S. to refrain from speculation and pursue “quiet diplomacy” instead. In a statement after the sentencing Thursday, Blinken said that it “compounds the injustice of her wrongful detention.” “This step puts a spotlight on our significant concerns with Russia’s legal system and the Russian government’s use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda, using individuals as political pawns,” he added. In May, the State Department reclassified Griner as having been “wrongfully detained” and transferred oversight of her case to the its presidential envoy for hostage affairs. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has denied Griner is being held as a hostage. Biden spoke with Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, last month. He also sent a letter directly to Griner after she sent him a handwritten note pleading for help to get her released. On Thursday, Griner was led into a cage inside the courtroom in handcuffs, wearing a gray-colored shirt. Before the proceedings began, she displayed a photo of her teammates from the Russian club she played for in the WNBA off-season. Her lawyer Maria Blagovolina called prosecutors' requests for a strict sentence ""nonsense."" The charges carry a maximum sentence of 10 years. Her defense team called into question some of the expert analysis used in the case and said Griner did not have proper interpreter access during her arrest. They also pointed out Griner’s many athletic accomplishments, including in Russia, where the 6-foot-9 native of Houston plays for Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company Ekaterinburg. Her lawyers reiterated that Griner has only used cannabis medically, and has never used it in Russia. They asked for Griner to be acquitted or be given the most lenient sentence possible. As Griner addressed the court, her voice trembled as she apologized to her fans, family and teammates for any embarrassment or damage that she may have brought on them. She called the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, where she played, her second home. ""I never meant to hurt anybody,"" she said. ""I never meant to put in jeopardy the Russian population. I never meant to break any laws here."""
2022-08-04,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trumps-gop-adds-insult-injury-brittney-griner-remains-russia-rcna37318,Trump fans need to keep Brittney Griner's name out of their mouths,"UPDATE (Aug. 4, 2022, 11:30 a.m. ET): On Thursday, a Russian court found Brittney Griner guilty of drug smuggling and possession charges, and sentenced her to nine years in prison. On the morning of July 7, the wrongfully detained WNBA star Brittney Griner pleaded guilty to the charges she is facing in Russia. The most severe charge, equivalent to narcotics trafficking, carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Griner’s four-month-and-counting detainment in Russia has highlighted critical differences between the Russian and American legal systems — and salary imbalances between WNBA and NBA players. Adding insult to injury, her case is now being used by the GOP and its supporters to leverage Black suffering for their political benefit and worse, amusement. Fox News’s front page features stories on Griner’s wife, Cherelle, with angles focusing on the Biden administration’s failures. Since Griner’s arrest in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport in February, her plight has become a highly publicized piece of American domestic political discourse. Initially, Griner’s family and team asked for privacy as they waited for the wheels of the State Department to work toward her release. Yet in the past few weeks, as her family and supporters have increased their public pressure on the Biden administration for her freedom, Republicans and conservatives have started to take advantage of the situation. Fox News’ front page features stories on Griner’s wife, Cherelle, with angles focusing on the Biden administration’s perceived failures. Republicans in Washington, meanwhile, have used her detainment to promote themselves — and their former boss Donald Trump. The GOP members on the House Judiciary Committee tweeted an article on Phoenix Mercury coach Vanessa Nygaard — and then used Nygaard’s comments to boast that Trump would have gotten Brittney released faster. Whoever runs that account seems to have conveniently forgotten that Americans Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed were imprisoned throughout Trump’s tenure in office, and neither were released. Reed was released in April after a prisoner exchange with Russia. He has actively worked in media appearances to combat GOP attempts to leverage his ordeal in Russia for pro-Trump messaging. Even as Republicans and Trump supporters use Griner to boost their agenda, they have also indulged in some classic victim-blaming. Besides buying into the Russian charges of “narcotics trafficking,” these people have used Griner’s previous activism, particularly her critical stance on playing the national anthem before WNBA games, as a justification for her continued imprisonment in a hostile state. Popular Black conservative documentarian Errol Webber portrayed Griner as a hypocrite for turning to the American government to aide her. Conservative commentator Todd Starnes went so far as to argue that Biden should keep Griner in Russian custody until she publicly repudiates her stance on the anthem. Conservative commentator Todd Starnes went so far as to argue that Biden should keep Griner in Russian custody until she publicly repudiates her stance on the anthem. Memes abound, including one showing Griner’s mugshot, and she has been purposefully misgendered by tweets saying things like “leave him where he’s at.” In this vein, Griner slots neatly into the classic stereotype of the Black criminal — a trope that has long served the GOP. (Remember George H.W. Bush’s infamous Willie Horton ad from the 1988 election?) Such Republican and conservative opinions are clearly cruel, and wildly unhelpful. But do they matter in the larger scheme of American public discourse? I’d argue yes. Because they highlight how the GOP, like Russia, often seeks to capitalize on the suffering of Black people and other minorities for political gain. Across Twitter, people have referred to Trump’s maneuvering to get rapper A$AP Rocky released from a Swedish jail as proof that he could have done the same for Griner. They make these claims even though Sweden and Russia are two fundamentally different political systems, and the charges Griner faces are more severe. Never mind that A$AP Rocky maintains that Trump’s involvement made his release a little more difficult. Thus, Brittney Griner represents a perverse sort of Schrödinger’s minority to the GOP and their supporters. They can argue that Trump would have gotten her released on social media because there is no cost to them for doing so. They support Black and LGBTQ individuals — as long as they are not in the United States. Griner’s life matters to them because she is not in America. In reality, she is representative of multiple demographics targeted by the GOP: Black Americans, LGBTQ individuals and women. It is not a coincidence that cynical GOP tweets about Griner garner responses that are anti-Black, anti-gay and anti-trans. As Griner faces another hearing on July 14, the American public continues to litigate her case on social media and the internet. She and her legal team are fighting for her life and future in Russia while the communities she represents are fighting for their rights in her home country — and neither of them can afford to lose."
2022-08-04,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-vote-ratifying-finland-swedens-membership-nato-rcna41276,Senate votes to ratify Finland's and Sweden's membership in NATO,"WASHINGTON — The Senate passed a resolution Wednesday ratifying Finland's and Sweden's applications to join NATO as the Western military alliance seeks to strengthen its resolve against the threat posed by Russia. The measure was approved in a 95-1 vote that required support from at least two-thirds of senators present. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., cast the only vote against ratification. ""Today’s vote shows our alliance is stronger than ever,"" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor immediately before the vote. ""This is important substantively and as a signal to Russia: They cannot intimidate America or Europe."" The Biden administration is now expected to submit the ratification documents to NATO. “We will continue working to remain vigilant against any threats to our shared security, and to deter and confront aggression or the threat of aggression,” President Joe Biden said in a statement after the Senate vote. “I look forward to signing the accession protocols and welcoming Sweden and Finland, two strong democracies with highly capable militaries, into the greatest defensive alliance in history,” he added. All 30 NATO countries must ratify the applications before Finland and Sweden can become members. The two European countries are seeking to join the alliance, which would end their long-standing military neutrality, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Schumer said when he and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., met with the Finnish president and the Swedish prime minister in May, they committed to ratifying their membership in NATO before the Senate's August recess. McConnell offered his support for the resolution Wednesday ahead of the vote. “Even closer cooperation with these partners will help us counter Russia and China. Their accession will make NATO stronger and America more secure,"" McConnell said in a statement. ""This is a slam dunk for national security that deserves unanimous bipartisan support.” Hawley, the lone dissenter in Wednesday's vote, previewed his opposition earlier this week in an op-ed published in The National Interest. ""We must do less in Europe (and elsewhere) in order to prioritize China and Asia,"" he wrote. With the Senate vote, the U.S. joins other NATO member countries that have ratified the applications from Finland and Sweden. Italy's parliament gave its final approval earlier Wednesday. The last country to join NATO was North Macedonia, in 2020. Hawley voted in favor of their membership."
2022-08-03,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/un-nuclear-chief-ukraine-nuclear-plant-control-rcna41429,U.N. nuclear chief: Ukraine nuclear plant is 'out of control' ,"The U.N. nuclear chief warned that Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine “is completely out of control” and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to quickly allow experts to visit the sprawling complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident. Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press that the situation is getting more perilous every day at the Zaporizhzhia plant in the southeastern city of Enerhodar, which Russian troops seized in early March, soon after their Feb. 24. invasion of Ukraine. “Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated” at the plant, he said. “What is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous.” Grossi cited many violations of the plant’s safety, adding that it is “in a place where active war is ongoing,” near Russian-controlled territory. The physical integrity of the plant hasn’t been respected, he said, citing shelling at the beginning of the war when it was taken over and continuing information from Ukraine and Russia accusing each other of attacks at Zaporizhzhia. There is “a paradoxical situation” in which the plant is controlled by Russia, but its Ukrainian staff continues to run its nuclear operations, leading to inevitable moments of friction and alleged violence, he said. While the IAEA has some contacts with staff, they are “faulty” and “patchy,” he said. Grossi said the supply chain of equipment and spare parts has been interrupted, “so we are not sure the plant is getting all it needs.” The IAEA also needs to perform very important inspections to ensure that nuclear material is being safeguarded, “and there is a lot of nuclear material there to be inspected,” he said. “When you put this together, you have a catalog of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,” Grossi said. “And this is why I have been insisting from day one that we have to be able to go there to perform this safety and security evaluation, to do the repairs and to assist as we already did in Chernobyl.” The Russian capture of Zaporizhzhia renewed fears that the largest of Ukraine’s 15 nuclear reactors could be damaged, setting off another emergency like the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world’s worst nuclear disaster, which happened about 110 kilometers (65 miles) north of the capital Kyiv. Russian forces occupied the heavily contaminated site soon after the invasion but handed control back to the Ukrainians at the end of March. Grossi visited Chernobyl on April 27 and tweeted that the level of safety was “like a `red light’ blinking.” But he said Tuesday that the IAEA set up “an assistance mission” at Chernobyl at that time “that has been very, very successful so far.” The IAEA needs to go to Zaporizhzhia, as it did to Chernobyl, to ascertain the facts of what is actually happening there, to carry out repairs and inspections, and “to prevent a nuclear accident from happening,” Grossi said. The IAEA chief said he and his team need protection to get to the plant and the urgent cooperation of Russia and Ukraine. Each side wants this international mission to go from different sites, which is understandable in light of territorial integrity and political considerations, he said, but there’s something more urgent and that is getting the IAEA team to Zaporizhzhia. “The IAEA, by its presence, will be a deterrent to any act of violence against this nuclear power plant,” Grossi said. “So I’m pleading as an international civil servant, as the head of an international organization, I’m pleading to both sides to let this mission proceed.” Grossi was in New York to deliver a keynote speech at Monday’s opening of the long-delayed high-level meeting to review the landmark 50-year-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and eventually achieving a nuclear-free world. In the interview, the IAEA chief also spoke about efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major powers that the Trump administration abandoned in 2018 and the Biden administration has been working to renew. Grossi said there is “an ongoing effort to try to go for yet another meeting or round to explore possibilities to come to an agreement.” He said he heard the meeting “could be soon.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the NPT review conference on Monday that Iran “has either been unwilling or unable” to accept a deal to return to the 2015 agreement aimed at reining in its nuclear program. Grossi said “there are important differences among the negotiating parties” and important verification issues related to past activities that Iran needs to address. “It’s not impossible, it’s complex,” he said. If the nuclear agreement, known as the JCPOA, is not extended, he said some IAEA inspections will continue. But the JCPOA provides for additional transparency and inspections “which I deem as extremely important, very necessary, because of the breadth and depth of the nuclear program in Iran,” he said. Grossi stressed that cooperating with the IAEA, answering its questions, allowing its inspectors to go wherever they need to be, is essential for Iran to build trust and confidence. “Promises and good words will not do,” he said. On another issue, Grossi said last September’s deal in which the United States and Britain will provide Australia with nuclear reactors to power its submarines requires an agreement with the IAEA to ensure that the amount of nuclear material in the vessel when it leaves port is there when it returns. He said Australia hasn’t decided what type of vessel it will be getting, so while there have been preparatory talks, substantive talks can’t begin. Because it’s a military vessel, Grossi said, “there are lots of confidential and protection of information measures that need to be embedded into any such agreement, so it’s very complex technologically.”"
2022-08-03,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-first-grain-ship-depart-lebanon-turkey-rcna41279,First grain ship to depart Ukraine cleared to travel to Lebanon ,"The first grain ship to depart Ukraine under a wartime deal is poised to cross through the Bosporus Strait and sail to Lebanon after its cargo was checked and approved, Turkish and Ukrainian authorities said. An inspection team spent about 90 minutes conducting checks aboard the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, which was carrying Ukrainian corn and anchored off Istanbul, Turkey’s Defence Ministry said. The team included officials from Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the United Nations. The Razoni’s horn rang out as the inspectors left the ship. Pictures tweeted by the Turkish Ministry of Defence showed an inspector reaching into an open container on the Razoni and touching the grain. The Razoni, which the United Nations says is carrying 26,527 tons of corn, set sail on Monday from Odesa on Ukraine’s Black Sea coast. It is bound for Lebanon, its final destination. Ukraine’s Ministry of Infrastructure confirmed the ship had passed the inspection and said 17 other vessels “are loaded and are awaiting permission to leave”. Inspectors, some wearing white helmets, headed out to the Razoni under rain in two boats, escorted by the Turkish coast guard. Turkish media said there were about 20 inspectors. The checks aim to ensure that incoming vessels are not carrying weapons and that outgoing ones are bearing only grain, fertiliser or related food items, not any other commodities. More ships from Ukraine are expected to set out in the coming days, raising hope that world food shortages can be alleviated. Some 27 vessels have been waiting in three Ukrainian ports with cargo and signed contracts, ready to go, according to U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric. An estimated 20 million tons of grain have been stuck in Ukraine since the start of war. The U.N.-brokered agreement last month to release the grain calls for the establishment of safe corridors through the mined waters outside Ukraine’s ports. The hold-up of shipments because of the war has worsened rising food prices worldwide and threatened hunger and political instability in developing nations. Most of the grain stuck in Ukraine is to feed livestock, according to David Laborde, an expert at the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington. Only 6 million tons is wheat, and just half of that is for human consumption, Laborde said. He said the Razoni is loaded with chicken feed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the resumption of grain exports will reduce Russian authorities’ ability to extract concessions from the West. “They are losing one of the opportunities to terrorise the world,” he said in his nightly video address late on Tuesday. Russia’s war against Ukraine has also disrupted energy supplies in western Europe, with Moscow drastically cutting how much it sends amid fears it could stop sending any at all. Meanwhile, the U.N. nuclear chief warned that Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine “is completely out of control” and urgent steps are needed to avoid a nuclear accident. Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview with the Associated Press that the situation is getting more perilous every day at the Zaporizhzhia plant in the south-eastern city of Enerhodar, which Russian troops seized in early March, soon after their February 24 invasion of Ukraine. “Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated” at the plant, he said. “What is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous.” He issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to quickly allow experts to visit the sprawling complex. Meanwhile, Russian forces kept up their bombardment of the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, hitting it with shells twice over the past 24 hours, the governor of the Mykolaiv region, Vitaliy Kim, reported. The shelling damaged a pier, an industrial enterprise, residential buildings, a garage co-operative, a supermarket and a pharmacy, Mr Kim said. It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties. Mykolaiv is a southern port city, somewhat on a par with Odesa, and is located on the Black Sea. The Russians said in April they want control over not just eastern but southern Ukraine too. Taking over Odesa and Mykolaiv in the south will give them control over the entire Black Sea coast and a land corridor to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria. Amid the relentless onslaught by Moscow’s forces, Mr Zelensky issued an order to all those remaining in the country’s embattled Donetsk region to evacuate as soon as possible. The compulsory evacuation effort aims to take 200,000-220,000 people out of the eastern province by autumn, officials say."

The threat of nuclear catastrophe was also raised by the United States, Japan, Germany, the U.N. nuclear chief and many other opening speakers. Russia, which came under criticism from some speakers, didn’t give its address in its scheduled slot Monday but was expected to speak Tuesday. China’s representative was scheduled to speak Tuesday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said North Korea is preparing to conduct its seventh nuclear test, Iran “has either been unwilling or unable” to accept a deal to return to the 2015 nuclear agreement aimed at reining in its nuclear program, and Russia is “engaged in reckless, dangerous nuclear saber-rattling” in Ukraine. He cited Russian President Vladimir Putin’s warning after its Feb. 24 invasion that any attempt to interfere would lead to “consequences you have never seen,” emphasizing that his country is “one of the most potent nuclear powers.”"

Putin made the comment in a letter to participants of a conference on the nuclear nonproliferation treaty (NPT), more than five months into his war on Ukraine. “We proceed from the fact that there can be no winners in a nuclear war and it should never be unleashed, and we stand for equal and indivisible security for all members of the world community,” he said. International concern about the risk of a nuclear confrontation has heightened since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. In a speech at the time, Putin pointedly referred to Russia’s nuclear arsenal and warned outside powers against any attempt to interfere. “Whoever tries to hinder us ... should know that Russia’s response will be immediate. And it will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history,” he said. Days later, he ordered Russia’s nuclear forces to be put on high alert. The war in Ukraine has raised geopolitical tensions to levels not seen since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in March: “The prospect of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of possibility.” Politicians in both Russia and the United States have spoken publicly of the risk of World War Three. CIA director William Burns said in April that given the setbacks Russia had suffered in Ukraine, “none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons.” Russia, whose military doctrine allows for the use of nuclear weapons in the event of an existential threat to the Russian state, has accused the West of waging a “proxy war” against it by arming Ukraine and imposing sanctions on Moscow."

The breakthrough follows a United Nations-backed deal between Kyiv and Moscow last month and amid intense fighting in the east and the south of Ukraine. The departure of the first shipment will raise hopes that the impact of the war — now more than five months old — might be eased for millions facing hunger and poverty across the world, though doubts persist over Russia's commitment to any deal. Loaded with 26,000 tons of Ukrainian corn, the Sierra Leone-flagged cargo ship Razoni began its journey early Monday through heavily mined waters beyond the Black Sea toward the port of Tripoli in Lebanon, officials said. Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, said in a Facebook post that the vessel would move along a safe corridor established by the U.N. and Turkey and observed by Russia's Navy. Sixteen more ships that have been blocked since the beginning of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24 are also waiting to leave Odesa, Kubrakov added. He called the first ship’s departure “a colossal success for ensuring global food security.” In a separate video shared by Kubrakov on Twitter, the ship can be seen slowly departing the port. NBC News could not independently verify the video."

But it really needs to be done,” he added. “The more people leave Donetsk region now, the fewer people the Russian army will have time to kill,” he said. Three people died in attacks over the past day in the Donetsk region, which is partly under the control of Russian separatist forces, Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said on his Telegram channel. Pledging full financial and logistical government support to evacuate the area, Zelenskyy said: “We only need a decision from the people themselves, who have not yet made it for themselves. Leave, we will help.” His comments came as battles continued to rage around the city of Donetsk as Russia attempts to take the entire Donbas region, made up of Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk which it gained full control of earlier this month. The Kremlin has concentrated the majority of its forces in the region since failing to take over Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, at the start of the war. Less than 24 hours after his speech, a drone-borne explosive device detonated Sunday at the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, injuring six people, Russia's Black Sea Fleet’s press service said in a statement. The explosion at the headquarters in the city of Sevastopol on the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 caused cancellation of observances of Russia’s Navy Day holiday. Fighting also continued elsewhere in Ukraine. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, Mayor Oleksandr Senkevych said on his Telegram channel that two people were killed and three wounded by what he said was “probably the heaviest” Russian shelling “of all time.” Oleksiy Opanasovych Vadaturskyi, the general director of Ukraine’s largest grain trading company Nibulon, and his wife Raisa Mykhailivna Vadaturska, were killed, officials later confirmed. “Oleksiy Opanasovych did a lot for Mykolaiv region, a lot for Ukraine. His contribution to the development of the agricultural and shipbuilding industry, the development of the region, is invaluable,” the regional government said on its Telegram channel. Elsewhere in the south, the regional governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Valentyn Reznichenko, said on his Telegram channel that at least 50 rockets hit residential areas in the city of Nikopol early Sunday. The attacks came as both sides continued to trade blame for an attack that killed dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war on Friday. Russia’s defense ministry said Sunday that it had invited the United Nations and the Red Cross to investigate the site of the prison near Olenivka in Donetsk “in the interests of conducting an objective investigation.” The ministry had published a list of 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war killed and 73 wounded in what it said was a Ukrainian military strike with a U.S.-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). Kyiv vehemently denied any such strike and said Moscow was to blame, accusing the Kremlin of deliberately shelling the prison to falsely accuse Ukraine of war crimes and cover up its own. NBC News has not been able to independently verify the claims of either side. Meanwhile the U.N. had said it was prepared to send experts to investigate if it obtained consent from both parties. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was seeking access and had offered to help evacuate the wounded."

Calling the strike on a prison in a Russian-controlled territory a “war crime,” Zelenskyy said in a late-night video address that Moscow had “proven with numerous terrorist attacks that it is the biggest source of terrorism in the world today.” Kremlin-backed separatists in the Donetsk region said Friday that the attack on the detention facility in the town of Olenivka killed 53 prisoners of war, including some captured after the fall of Mariupol in May. They said 75 others were injured. Russia denied it was behind the attack and has instead accused Ukraine of using a U.S.-supplied rocket system to hit the detention facility near the eastern front lines. NBC News has not been able to independently verify the claims of either side. Ukrainian security agencies called on the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross to dispatch their representatives for an inspection mission of the site. The ICRC said, in a statement on Friday, that it was seeking access and offered its support in evacuation of the wounded, reiterating that all prisoners of war were protected under international humanitarian law, irrespective of their location. European Union High Representative Joseph Borrell also condemned Russian armed forces in a statement and accused them of violating the law. After months under siege at the Azovstal steel plant in the southern city of Mariupol, Ukrainian soldiers surrendered and were evacuated to the Russian occupied territory in Donetsk as prisoners, with the mediation of the U.N. and ICRC, which acted as guarantors of their lives. Ukraine’s security agencies accused Russia of “cynically violating” the agreement in a joint statement late Friday. The sudden transfer of prisoners to a new location as well as telephonic conversations intercepted by Ukrainians would prove the Russian involvement, the statement said. Elsewhere, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that Russia had “effectively set the U.N. charter on fire.” Moscow was reviewing plans to completely annex Kherson, Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia, in clear violation of the U.N. Charter, and with a “blatant disregard for the principles of national sovereignty,” she said. In the Kherson region, however, where Ukrainian forces have been mounting a counteroffensive in recent weeks, the country's military said Saturday it had killed scores of Russian soldiers and destroyed two ammunition dumps in the area. NBC News could not independently verify this claim. Elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school building in Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, overnight and another attack occurred about an hour later, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The bus station in the city of Sloviansk was also hit, according to Mayor Vadim Lyakh. Sloviansk is near the front line of fighting as Russian and separatist forces try to take full control of the Donetsk region, which along with Luhansk is one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states. In southern Ukraine, one person was killed and six injured in shelling that hit a residential area in Mykolaiv, a significant port city, the region’s administration said. But in a rare public statement Saturday, Richard Moore, the chief of Britain’s MI6 foreign intelligence agency, said Russia was “running out of steam.” Moore made the remark above an earlier post on Twitter by the U.K.’s defense ministry, which described the Russian government as “growing desperate” and as having lost thousands of soldiers in its invasion of Ukraine."
2022-07-29,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russian-operative-used-us-activist-groups-spread-propaganda-feds-say-rcna40715,"Russian operative used U.S. activist groups to spread propaganda, feds say ","A Russian operative backed by the Kremlin meddled in United States politics for seven years and recently tried to undermine American support for Ukraine by recruiting local activists to spread pro-Moscow propaganda, the Justice Department announced Friday. Aleksandr Viktorovich Ionov, who worked with the Russian Federal Security Service and at least three unnamed ""Russian officials,"" was charged with conspiring to have U.S. citizens act as illegal agents of the Russian government from December 2014 through March of this year, the agency said. “As court documents show, Ionov allegedly orchestrated a brazen influence campaign, turning U.S. political groups and U.S. citizens into instruments of the Russian government,” said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department’s National Security Division. The 24-page indictment against Ionov was unsealed in Tampa, Florida. Ionov, who lives in Moscow, was not in Tampa when the grand jury indictment was unsealed, and there was no immediate response to the revelations from the Russian government. Neither Ionov nor any of his alleged Russian accomplices were “duly accredited diplomatic or consular officers,” the indictment states. Ionov, founder of a nongovernmental organization called Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia, had already been on the DOJ's radar. In 2018, it was revealed his organization had been raising money to aid convicted Russian operative Maria Butina, who was deported to Moscow in 2019, an event mentioned in the indictment. The DOJ said in its statement that Ionov targeted ""political groups"" in Florida, Georgia and California. It did not identify the U.S.-based groups. But shortly after the Ionov indictment was announced, the FBI in Tampa confirmed to local media it had raided headquarters of the Uhuru Movement in St. Petersburg, Florida, in connection with the alleged conspiracy. ""The Uhuru Movement is a worldwide organization, under the leadership of African People’s Socialist Party, uniting African people as one people for liberation, social justice, self-reliance and economic development,"" the group said on its website. The DOJ did not identify the members of the three groups who “co-conspired” with Ionov, but said it was fully aware Ionov and his organization “were agents of the Russian government."" In May 2015, Ionov sent the ""leader"" of the Uhuru Movement in St. Petersburg on ""an all-expense paid trip to Russia"" and for the next seven years ""exercised direction and control over senior members,"" the DOJ said. The Uhuru Movement did not respond to requests for comment Friday, but at an earlier news conference an Uhuru leader did not deny the group's ties to Russia. “We can have relationships with whoever we want to make this revolution possible,” said Eritha “Akile” Cainion after the indictment was announced, The Tampa Bay Times reported. “We are in support of Russia.” Four of the “unindicted co-conspirators” listed but not named in the indictment are U.S. citizens living in St. Petersburg, while the others live in Atlanta and California. One of the California residents also has a home in Moscow. Based on the indictment, it appears Ionov was most active in St. Petersburg, where he allegedly tried to stoke racial resentment by having Uhuru members write a petition to the United Nations ""alleging that the United States had committed genocide against African people"" that would later be translated and disseminated across Russia. Ionov, according to the indictment, also encouraged Uhuru members in 2017 and 2019 to get involved in local St. Petersburg elections and campaign on the issue of ""reparations"" for slavery, a divisive topic in the U.S. He also helped bankroll the campaigns, the indictment said. In California, Ionov backed an unnamed group that wants the state to secede from the U.S., the indictment said. Ionov paid $500 for posters for a 2018 demonstration outside the state Capitol in Sacramento and encouraged the participants to ""physically enter the governor's office."" In March, after the Russians invaded Ukraine, Ionov worked to rally support for Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin by taking part in a video conference hosted by ""U.S. Political Group 1,"" which the FBI has identified as the Uhuru organization. During the video conference, Ionov repeated the bogus claims pushed by the Kremlin that ""Nazis were in power in Ukraine and were killing innocent people."" Ionov, the DOJ said, also paid for members of an unnamed Georgia group to travel to California and take part in a protest outside an unnamed social media company that had placed restrictions on posts supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine."
2022-07-29,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-russia-blame-strike-killing-prisoners-war-donetsk-rcna40587,"Ukraine, Russia trade blame for strike reportedly killing dozens of prisoners of war","Dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war were feared dead Friday as Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of carrying out a missile strike on a prison in Russian-controlled territory. Russia said Ukraine used a U.S.-supplied rocket system to hit a detention facility near the eastern front lines, killing at least 40 soldiers including some who had been captured after the fall of Mariupol in late May. Kyiv vehemently denied any such strike and said Moscow was to blame, accusing the Kremlin of deliberately shelling the prison to falsely accuse Ukraine of war crimes and cover up its own. NBC News has not been able to independently verify the claims from either side. Moscow-backed separatists in the Donetsk region said a Ukrainian attack on the prison in the town of Olenivka killed 53 prisoners of war and wounded 75 others. The Russian Defense Ministry said earlier that 40 had been killed, with 75 injured and eight staff members at the facility also wounded. The victims included Ukrainian troops who had mounted a final defense at Mariupol's besieged Azovstal steel plant, the ministry said, accusing Kyiv of carrying out the strike to deter its troops from laying down their weapons in the future. “Last night, the Kyiv regime purposefully committed a bloody provocation,” a statement on its official Telegram channel read Friday. The missile was launched from the American HIMARS multiple launch rocket system, the ministry said. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic said in a statement that 193 people were present in the building. Ukraine’s military denied the accusation, saying the strike had been launched by Russian forces with the intention of framing Ukraine for war crimes and to “hide the torture of prisoners and executions” at the detention site. “The Russian enemy continues its propaganda methods of conducting an information war in order to accuse the Armed Forces of Ukraine of shelling civilian infrastructure and the population, thus hiding its own insidious actions,” a statement from Ukraine's armed forces said Friday. The Security Service of Ukraine said in a Telegram post that it had intercepted communications that would prove its forces were not responsible. “The Kremlin puppets decided to commit another war crime,” said Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was seemingly referring to the Moscow-backed separatist forces in Donetsk. Ukraine’s foreign ministry, in a later statement, called for the International Criminal Court to “to immediately pay attention to the atrocities of Russian servicemen in the context of the investigation of war crimes and crimes against humanity.” Russia has consistently denied targeting civilians or civilian areas throughout the war. But accusations of atrocities committed by Russian forces have been leveled by Kyiv, its allies and human rights groups. Ukrainian service members captured during the conflict who later spoke to NBC News described physical and emotional scars from torture, beatings and neglect at the hands of Russian forces. International law provides protection for prisoners of war, with the Geneva Conventions decreeing that they must be treated humanely, protected against acts of violence, as well as intimidation and insults. The apparent deadly strike overshadowed Kyiv’s efforts to herald its efforts to export grain for the first time since the Russian invasion brought a blockade of its much-needed global food supplies. Zelenskyy visited a port in the southern Odesa region Friday to inspect a shipment being loaded onto a Turkish vessel. Meanwhile, a court in Kyiv on Friday lowered a Russian soldier’s war crimes sentence from life imprisonment to 15 years after appeal, according to The Associated Press. Vadim Shyshimarin, 21, was convicted of killing a civilian in May, in the first war crimes trial against a Russian soldier since the conflict began."
2022-07-28,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-counteroffensive-kherson-south-donbas-zelenskyy-rcna40391,Ukraine pushes to break Russia’s hold on major southern city,"Ukraine has been laying the groundwork for weeks, amassing forces and weaponry, and now it says it is making gains in the country's south. Bolstered by newly acquired long-range weapons from the West, the country's forces, which long vowed to launch a counteroffensive, have destroyed key Russian targets in the Ukrainian city of Kherson. Russian troops are “virtually cut off” by the counteroffensive, which is “gaining momentum,” the British Defense Ministry said in its daily intelligence briefing Thursday. At least three bridges on the Dnipro River have been damaged, it said, adding that the strategic Antonivsky Bridge used to transport supplies to the southern city was likely “unusable.” As a result, Russia’s 49th Army stationed west of the river was “highly vulnerable,” it said. Retaking Kherson, which was seized by President Vladimir Putin’s forces early in the invasion, would be “a major blow to the Russian war effort,” Udi Greenberg, a professor of modern European history at Dartmouth College, told NBC News on Thursday via the Signal messaging app. As a port city, he said, “it has major strategic and economic values.” Greenberg added that the counteroffensive had “the potential to be very important,” because Ukraine had “until now been mostly on the defensive” and it would “test the country’s ability to shift the balance of this military conflict.” It would be the first time a major city had been retaken by Ukrainian forces since the conflict began Feb. 24. Buoyed by the success of the recent attacks, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry has called on Russian troops in Kherson to retreat, warning that they will be “annihilated” if they remain in the city. “The choice is theirs,” the ministry tweeted Wednesday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, promised to rebuild the destroyed bridges in a late night video address posted to his Telegram channel Wednesday. But he insisted his forces were ""doing everything to ensure that the occupiers do not have any logistical opportunities on our land.” The Kremlin has not commented on the attacks, but Kirill Stremousov, who serves as the deputy head of the Russian-backed Kherson Military-Civilian Administration, denied the bridge strikes had affected supplies in the city. They would “not affect the outcome of the hostilities in any way,” he told the Russian state news agency RIA. The shift south to Kherson comes after fighting intensified in recent days in the eastern Donetsk province as Russian forces appeared to emerge from a reported “operational pause” after capturing neighboring Luhansk. Valeriy Akimenko, a senior research associate at the U.K.-based Conflict Studies Research Centre, said he did not believe that Ukraine could win back the two industrial regions that make up the Donbas. But, he said, the fighting there could “open other possibilities to tear holes in what must be a very thinly stretched Russian line in Ukraine’s south.” However, Ukrainian defense officials have warned Russia was gathering forces to meet the counteroffensive. “The enemy is now concentrating the maximum number (of forces) precisely in the Kherson direction,” Oleksiy Danilov, Ukraine’s national security and defense council secretary, said in televised remarks Wednesday, as he warned of “a very large-scale movement” of Russian troops. He added that he was “cautious” in assessing the timeline of the possible counteroffensive. “I would really like it to be much faster,” he said, adding that “the enemy is now concentrating the maximum number (of forces) precisely in the Kherson direction.” Elsewhere, Russian forces launched a missile attack on the Kyiv area for the first time in weeks Thursday and pounded the northern Chernihiv region as well, Ukrainian officials said."
2022-07-27,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-uses-new-artillery-hit-key-bridge-russians-south-kherson-rcna40179,Ukraine uses new artillery to hit key bridge for Russians in southern Kherson region,"Ukrainian artillery hit a strategic bridge essential for Moscow to supply its forces occupying Ukraine’s southern region, using a U.S.-supplied precision rocket system to deliver a morale-lifting punch. The Ukrainian military struck the Antonivskyi Bridge across the Dnieper River in southern Ukraine late Tuesday, the deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration for the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, said. He said Wednesday the bridge was still standing but its deck was pierced with holes, preventing vehicles from crossing. The 0.9-mile bridge sustained serious damage in Ukrainian shelling last week, when it took multiple hits. It was closed for trucks but had remained open for passenger vehicles until the latest strike. Ukrainian forces used U.S.-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launchers to hit the bridge, Stremousov said. The HIMARS system has precision strike capability and has added a more modern technological edge to Ukraine’s dated military assets. The HIMARS have a longer range, a much better precision and a faster rate of fire compared with Soviet-designed Smerch, Uragan and Tornado multiple rocket launchers used by both Russia and Ukraine. The billions of dollars in Western military assistance have been crucial for Ukraine’s efforts to fend off Russian attacks, but officials in Kyiv say the numbers are still too small to turn the tide of the war. While halting traffic across the bridge, at least temporarily, makes only a slight dent in the overall Russian military operation, the strike showed Russian forces are vulnerable and was a minor triumph for Ukrainians. The bridge is the main crossing across the Dnieper River in the Kherson region. The only other option is a dam at the hydroelectric plant in Kakhovka, which also came under Ukrainian fire last week but has remained open for traffic. Knocking the crossings out would make it hard for the Russian military to keep supplying its forces in the region amid repeated Ukrainian attacks."
2022-07-26,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-says-will-quit-international-space-station-ukraine-war-rcna39988,Russia says it will quit the International Space Station amid Ukraine war,"Russia said Tuesday it will withdraw from the International Space Station after 2024, signaling the end of a joint project that has served as a key symbol of post-Cold War cooperation with Washington. The move comes as Moscow and the West clash over the Kremlin's war in Ukraine, and casts new doubt over the future of global collaboration in space. Russia has intimated that it sees its future as primarily a cooperative effort with the Chinese space program rather than NASA, its main partner of the last 25 years. The head of Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, told President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday that the country would exit the ISS and focus on building its own space station, according to state media. ""The decision on withdrawal from this station after 2024 has been made,” newly appointed Roscosmos head Yuri Borisov said, according to the Tass news agency. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday afternoon that the agency plans to continue operating the orbiting outpost through the end of the decade. ""NASA is committed to the safe operation of the International Space Station through 2030, and is coordinating with our partners,"" Nelson said in a statement. ""NASA has not been made aware of decisions from any of the partners, though we are continuing to build future capabilities to assure our major presence in low-Earth orbit."" It's not yet clear what impact Russia's announcement will have on the space station's management in the coming years, said Cathleen Lewis, a curator in the Space History Department at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum. ""Does it mean they will no longer send cosmonauts or spacefarers from other nations to the space station, or will they truly detach and deorbit their components?"" she said. ""We really don't know what it means."" The way Russia handles the withdrawal will have logistical consequences for NASA and its other partners, including whether different space agencies or commercial providers step in to fill the gaps. ""It's like renting a group home with a bunch of friends and the last person out is responsible for all the cleaning,"" Lewis said. ""The devil is in the details."" Construction of the outpost in low-Earth orbit began in 1998 and was completed in 2011. It has been hailed as an example of reconciliation between the U.S. and Russia, two longtime adversaries, but that relationship has now felt the impact of a renewed earthly confrontation. The current agreement between Russia and the U.S. over the aging space station runs out in 2024. Russian officials have previously hinted that they would let the agreement expire to work on their own Russian orbital station, which they hope will be operational in 2025. On Tuesday, Borisov, who was appointed director of Russia's space agency this month, confirmed to Putin that he intended to do just that. Borisov said that Russia would fulfill its obligations to its partners before departing, according to Tass. He said that Roscosmos' main aim should be to ""raise the bar"" and provide the country with ""necessary space services,"" such as global navigation, communication and meteorological data. The space ""industry is in a difficult situation,"" Tass quoted him as saying. Russia's announcement comes as the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine threatens to affect everything from European energy supplies to global food stocks. Despite the rift, NASA and Roscosmos made a deal this month for astronauts to continue riding Russian rockets and for Russian cosmonauts to catch lifts to the space station with SpaceX beginning this fall, The Associated Press reported. That agreement ensures that the space station will always have at least one American and one Russian on board to keep both sides of the orbiting outpost running smoothly, AP said. Still, Lewis said Russia has long threatened to dissolve its partnership in the International Space Station and instead build a new outpost in low-Earth orbit. But, she added that the nation’s space agency has been operating under a constrained budget in recent years. ""Human spaceflight is very expensive,"" Lewis said. ""Where are they going to find the money? Even before the invasion of Ukraine and the consequences financially of embargoes against Russia, Roscosmos had very limited resources."" NASA and Roscosmos were the two main partners responsible for building and operating the ISS, with the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency also involved. However, tensions between Russia and the West, heightened by the invasion of Ukraine, have also soured space relations. Three Russian cosmonauts blasted off to the ISS in March. And Roscosmos published photos this month appearing to show those cosmonauts holding the flag of Luhansk, one of the self-declared republics that Russia helped split from Ukraine in 2014 and had just claimed to have fully captured in the current conflict. Former head of Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin has regularly hit out at Western sanctions against Russia, saying they could cause the ISS to crash into the United States. He also celebrated the flags of other countries being covered up on Russian-built rockets, drawing a sharp response from retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly. “Without those flags and the foreign exchange they bring in, your space program won't be worth a damn,"" Kelly tweeted to Rogozin in March. While these recent events made for rocky relations between the U.S. and Russia, Lewis said she thinks global cooperation on human spaceflight is ""inevitable,"" and will ultimately endure. ""Human spaceflight is enormously expensive and requires a multitude of viewpoints and a diversity of approaches,"" she said. ""You're going to get a more complex, richer and more robust program than one from a single nation with a single point of view with a single motivation driven largely by national prestige."""
2022-07-26,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/europe-agrees-compromise-deal-ration-gas-russia-squeezes-supply-rcna39977,Europe agrees to a compromise deal to ration gas as Russia squeezes supply,"European Union governments agreed Tuesday to ration natural gas this winter to protect themselves against any further supply cuts by Russia as Moscow pursues its invasion of Ukraine. E.U. energy ministers approved a draft European law meant to lower demand for gas by 15% from August through March. The new legislation entails voluntary national steps to reduce gas consumption and, if they yield insufficient savings, a trigger for mandatory moves in the 27-member bloc. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the move, saying in a statement that “the E.U. has taken a decisive step to face down the threat of a full gas disruption by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.” On Monday, Russian energy giant Gazprom said it would limit supplies to the E.U. through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to 20% of capacity, heightening concerns that Putin will use gas trade to challenge the bloc’s opposition to the war in Ukraine. “The winter is coming and we don’t know how cold it will be,” said Czech Industry Minister Jozef Sikela, whose policy portfolio includes energy. “But what we know for sure is that Putin will continue to play his dirty games in misusing and blackmailing by gas supplies.” The ministerial agreement was sealed in less than a week. It’s based on a proposal last Wednesday from the European Commission, the E.U.’s executive arm. Keen to maintain a common E.U. front over a conflict that shows no sign of ending, the commission said coordinated rationing would enable the bloc as a whole to get through the winter should Russia stop all gas deliveries. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February and the West protested with economic sanctions, 12 E.U. countries have faced halts to, or reductions in, Russian gas deliveries. Although it has agreed to embargo oil and coal from Russia starting later this year, the EU has refrained from sanctioning Russian natural gas because Germany, Italy and some other member states rely heavily on these imports. “Germany made a strategic error in the past with its great dependency on Russian gas and faith that it would always flow constantly and cheaply,” said German Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who is also responsible for energy and serves as the country’s vice chancellor. “But it is not just a German problem.” The disruptions in Russian energy trade with the E.U. are stoking inflation already at record levels in Europe and threatening to trigger a recession in the bloc just as it was recovering from a pandemic-induced slump. The energy squeeze is also reviving decades-old political tests for Europe over policy coordination. While the E.U. has gained centralized authority over monetary, trade, antitrust and farm policies, national sovereignty over energy matters still largely prevails. In a sign of this, the energy ministers scrapped a provision in the draft gas-rationing law that would have given the European Commission the power to decide on any move from voluntary to mandatory actions. Instead, the ministers ensured any decision on mandatory steps will be in member-state hands. They also diluted other elements of the original proposal, including with exemptions for island countries. Nonetheless, Tuesday’s deal marks another milestone in EU policy integration and crisis management. The accord comes just six days after the commission rushed out the draft law — a stark contrast to past E.U. legislative initiatives in the area of energy that often involved months or years of negotiations among national governments."
2022-07-25,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-cut-nord-stream-1-gas-20-capacity-escalating-energy-tensions-uk-rcna39866,"Russia to cut Nord Stream 1 gas to 20% of capacity, escalating energy tensions over Ukraine war  ","MOSCOW — Russia’s Gazprom said on Monday it was halting another turbine in the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany and that flows of gas would fall to the equivalent of just one fifth of normal capacity. The new blow to supply comes at a moment of high tension as Russia and the West exchange economic blows in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The European Union has accused Russia of resorting to energy blackmail, while the Kremlin says the gas disruption has been caused by maintenance issues and the effect of Western sanctions. Gazprom said it was halting the operation of another Siemens gas turbine at Nord Stream 1’s Portovaya compressor station in accordance with the instructions of the relevant watchdog, taking into account the technical condition of the engine. It said throughput from 4 a.m. GMT on Wednesday would therefore fall to 33 million cubic meters per day. That is just half of the current flows, already at just 40% of normal capacity. Politicians in Europe have repeatedly warned that Russia could cut off gas flows this winter, a step that would thrust Germany into recession and lead to soaring prices for consumers already grappling with higher prices for food and energy. Germany was forced last week to bail out Uniper, its biggest company importing gas from Russia. President Vladimir Putin warned the West this month that continued sanctions risked triggering catastrophic energy price rises for consumers around the world. Putin foreshadowed the latest cut in comments on the Nord Stream 1 compressor last week, when he said: “There are two functioning machines there, they pump 60 million cubic meters per day ... If one is not returned, there will be one, which is 30 million cubic meters.” Russia is the world’s second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the world’s largest exporter of natural gas. Europe imports about 40 percent of its gas and 30 percent of its oil from Russia. Gazprom resumed gas flows via Nord Stream 1 last week after a 10-day maintenance break, but only at 40% of the pipeline’s capacity — a level Russia has said it was forced to lower volumes to in June because of the delayed return of a turbine being serviced in Canada. European politicians have challenged that explanation, with Germany saying the turbine in question was not meant to be used until September. Gazprom said earlier on Monday it had received papers from Siemens Energy and Canada about the first turbine but added that there were still problems. “Gazprom has studied ... the documents, but has to acknowledge that they do not remove the previously identified risks and raise additional questions,” it said in a statement. “Additionally, there are still open questions from Gazprom regarding the EU and UK sanctions, the resolution of which is important for the delivery of the engine to Russia and the urgent overhaul of other gas turbine engines for the Portovaya compressor station.” The Kremlin said earlier that Moscow was not interested in a complete stoppage of Russian gas supplies to Europe, which is rushing to fill its underground storage before the winter season. It said Gazprom was not to blame for the storage risks, reiterating its line that Europeans are suffering the consequences of sanctions that they themselves imposed against Russia."
2022-07-24,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-restart-grain-exports-russian-missiles-struck-odesa-port-rcna39733,Ukraine will restart grain exports after Russian missiles struck Odesa port,"Ukraine pressed ahead on Sunday with efforts to restart grain exports from its Black Sea ports under a deal aimed at easing global food shortages but warned deliveries would suffer if Russia’s strike on Odesa was a sign of more to come. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced Saturday’s attack as “barbarism” that showed Moscow could not be trusted to implement a deal struck just one day earlier with Turkish and United Nations mediation. Public broadcaster Suspilne quoted the Ukrainian military as saying after the strike that the missiles did not hit the port’s grain storage area or cause significant damage and Kyiv said preparations to resume grain shipments were ongoing. “We continue technical preparations for the launch of exports of agricultural products from our ports,” Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said in a Facebook post on Saturday. Russia said on Sunday its forces had hit a Ukrainian warship and a weapons store in Odesa with missiles. The deal signed by Moscow and Kyiv on Friday was hailed as a diplomatic breakthrough that would help curb soaring global food prices, with U.N. officials saying it could restore Ukrainian grain shipments to pre-war levels of 5 million tons a month. But Zelenskyy’s economic advisor warned on Sunday the strike on Odesa signaled that could be out of reach. “Yesterday’s strike indicates that it will definitely not work like that,” Oleh Ustenko told Ukranian television. He said Ukraine did have the capacity to export 60 million tons of grain over the next nine months, but it would take up to 24 months if its ports could not function properly. As the war entered its sixth month on Sunday there was no sign of a let-up in the fighting. The Ukrainian military reported Russian shelling in the north, south and east, and again referred to Russian operations paving the way for an assault on Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region. Intensified Russian shelling prompted the mayor of Kharkiv to urge residents of Ukraine's second-largest city to avoid, if possible, ground transportation. “The last week has shown that the aggressor doesn’t even pretend to be firing at military targets anymore,” Ihor Terekhov wrote on Telegram on Sunday. “Use the metro system more often- as of today it is the safest way to get around.” Ukraine‘s air force command said its forces had shot down early on Sunday three Russian Kalibr cruise missiles fired from the Black Sea and aimed at the western Khmelnytskyi region. While the main theatre of combat has been the Donbas, Zelenskyy said in video on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were moving “step by step” into the occupied eastern Black Sea region of Kherson. The strikes on Odesa drew condemnation from the United Nations, the European Union, the United States, Britain, Germany and Italy. Russian news agencies quoted Russia’s defense ministry as saying that an Ukrainian warship and U.S. supplied anti-ship missiles were destroyed. “A docked Ukrainian warship and a warehouse with U.S.-supplied Harpoon anti-ship missiles were destroyed by long-range precision-guided naval missiles in Odesa seaport on the territory of a ship repair plant,” it said. On Saturday, Turkey’s defense minister said Russian officials told Ankara that Moscow had “nothing to do” with the strikes. According to the Ukrainian military, two Kalibr missiles fired from Russian warships hit the area of a pumping station at the port and two others were shot down by air defense forces. The strikes appeared to violate Friday’s deal, which would allow safe passage in and out of Ukrainian ports. Ukraine and Russia are leading global wheat exporters and a blockade of Ukrainian ports by Russia’s Black Sea fleet since Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion has trapped tens of millions of tons of grain, worsening global supply chain bottlenecks. Along with Western sanctions on Russia, it has stoked food and energy price inflation, driving some 47 million people into “acute hunger,” according to the World Food Programme. Moscow denies responsibility for the food crisis, blaming the sanctions for slowing its food and fertilizer exports and Ukraine for mining the approaches to its ports. Ukraine has mined waters near its ports as part of its war defenses but under Friday’s deal pilots will guide ships along safe channels. A Joint Coordination Center staffed by members of the four parties to the agreement are to monitor ships passing the Black Sea to Turkey’s Bosporus Strait and on to world markets. All sides agreed on Friday there would be no attacks on them. Russian President Vladimir Putin calls the war a “special military operation” aimed at demilitarizing Ukraine and rooting out dangerous nationalists. Kyiv and the West call this a baseless pretext for an aggressive land grab."
2022-07-24,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-moves-shut-agency-handling-immigration-israel-ukraine-rift-rcna39573,Russia moves to shut agency handling immigration to Israel amid Ukraine rift,"Russia has threatened to shut down a major Jewish agency that promotes immigration to Israel amid tensions between the two nations over the invasion of Ukraine. The Justice Ministry seeks to liquidate the country’s branch of the Jewish Agency for Israel, according to a notice from Moscow’s Basmanny district court, where the case will be heard Thursday. The court’s website does not say what laws the nonprofit agency had broken, and Russia’s Justice Ministry, which filed for its dissolution on July 15, did not respond to a request for comment. Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said the dissolution was related to a breach of “compliance with Russian legislation.” He refused to give further details at a news conference Friday. Acting Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said in a statement Thursday that a delegation with representatives from his office and several other ministries would travel to Russia for talks ahead of the hearing about the agency, which operates in coordination with his government. Lapid accused Russia of carrying out war crimes in Ukraine when he was foreign minister in April. Established in 1929, the Jewish Agency, or Sochnut, was instrumental in the formation of the state of Israel in 1948. It was banned by the Soviet Union, where state-sanctioned antisemitism barred Jews from many jobs and schools. Yuri Kanner, the president of the Russian Jewish Congress, told NBC News on Friday that an office opened in Russia shortly after the Soviet bloc collapsed in 1989. Since then, it has helped to advance Israel’s Law of Return, which states that any Jewish person, or a person with one or more Jewish grandparents, has the right to settle in Israel and obtain citizenship. Hundreds of thousands of people have relocated from Russia. “This is an old and reputable institution,” Kanner said, adding that it had never been embroiled in any scandals. NBC News has asked the agency for comment. Some, including Nachman Shai, Israel’s diaspora affairs minister, said the move was punishment for Israel’s stance on the war in Ukraine. “Russian Jews will not be held hostage for the war in Ukraine,” he tweeted Thursday. “The attempt to punish the Jewish Agency for Israel’s stance on the war is deplorable and offensive.” Yossi Mekelberg, a professor who is an associate fellow at the London think tank Chatham House, described the move as “a warning shot” from Russian President Vladimir Putin “to send a message to Israel” about Ukraine. “From the beginning, Israel tried to take a line which was almost impossible,” he said. Relations deteriorated further in May after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed that Adolf Hitler was Jewish when he was asked about claims that Russia was trying to “denazify” Ukraine. At the time, Lapid called Lavrov’s statement “unforgivable and scandalous and a horrible historical error.” Given close military collaboration between Russia and Israel in the Middle East, especially in Syria, Mekelberg said, Israel “didn’t want to attack Russia directly, criticize too much or outrightly support Ukraine.” “At the same time, it saw reasons to support Ukraine and NATO and the United States, its closest ally,” he said. As a result, he said, Israel was “stuck in the middle, and it was never going to work, not with something so big.” Kanner, of the Russian Jewish Congress the court’s decision “will be really important for Russian-Israeli relations.” Inside Russia, he said, the case will “certainly spur up aliyah,” or repatriation of Jewish people to Israel. “I have been observing this for a long time,” he said. “Usually waves of aliyah are associated with some form of bad news.”"
2022-07-24,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-fires-missiles-odesa-port-hours-signing-grain-export-deal-rcna39691,Russia fires missiles at Odesa port hours after signing grain export deal,"Russian missiles hit the city of Odesa on Saturday, hours after Moscow and Kyiv signed deals allowing grain exports to resume from the Black Sea port, officials in Ukraine said Saturday. The strikes were denounced by Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, as a “spit in the face” of Turkish President Recep Erdogan and United Nations Secretary General António Guterres, who helped broker the deals. “It took less than 24 hours for Russia to launch a missile attack on Odesa's port, breaking its promises and undermining its commitments before the U.N. and Turkey under the Istanbul agreement,” Nikolenko said in a statement. “In case of nonfulfillment, Russia will bear full responsibility for a global food crisis,” he added. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address late Saturday that Russia has proven it can't be trusted to honor international agreements. ""Today's Russian missile attack on our port in Odesa — a cynical one,"" the president said. ""It also turned out to be a blow to Russia's own political positions"" because they can be undermined by broken deals, he argued. Two missiles hit the port’s infrastructure and Ukrainian air defenses brought down two others, the Southern Command of Ukraine's military said in a statement. It did not specify whether there were any casualties or what damage was caused. NBC News was not able to independently verify the claims. Nikolenko called on the U.N. and Turkey to ensure that Russia complied with the commitments it made Friday. These included the establishment of a maritime “humanitarian corridor” free of naval ships, warplanes and drones, to clear the way for the shipment of millions of tons of grain from Ukraine. It also released some Russian exports of grain and fertilizer held up by the war. During a Friday signing ceremony in Istanbul, Guterres hailed the deal as “a beacon of hope, a beacon of possibility, a beacon of relief in a world that needs it more than ever.” The deal was also supposed to establish a de facto cease-fire between Ukraine and Russia along identified shipping routes, and represented a big symbolic breakthrough. U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in a statement Saturday that the attack erodes any global trust of Russia while threatening the global of food, the collapse of which will be blamed squarely on Moscow. “Just 24 hours after finalizing a deal to allow the resumption of Ukrainian agricultural exports through the Black Sea, Russia breached its commitments by attacking the historic port from which grain and agricultural exports would again be transported under this arrangement,” Blinken said. He added that the missile strike could shred the food deal just made. “This attack casts serious doubt on the credibility of Russia’s commitment to yesterday’s deal and undermines the work of the UN, Turkey, and Ukraine to get critical food to world markets,” the secretary said. Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for Russia's foreign ministry, said in a statement that Russia had destroyed military infrastructure in the port. The Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports has been in place since the invasion of the country on Feb. 24, triggering a food crisis around the globe. Before the war, Ukraine accounted for 10% of the world’s wheat exports, 14% of its corn and half its sunflower oil, and was known as the “breadbasket of the world.” Although Russia blames the global food crisis on Ukraine and NATO, their argument has been losing traction in developing countries that rely heavily on Ukrainian grain and have experienced the brunt of the food crisis. U.S. and E.U. sanctions against Russia have not banned food exports or targeted Russian fertilizer, but many private shipping and insurance companies have chosen not to do business with Moscow in the wake of the February invasion. Elsewhere, in Ukraine's central Kirovohradska region, 13 Russian missiles struck an airfield and a railway facility. Gov. Andriy Raikovych said that at least one serviceman and two guards were killed and the regional administration reported the strikes near the city of Kirovohrad, wounded another 13 people. In the southern Kherson region, which Russian troops seized early in the invasion, Ukrainian forces were also preparing for a potential counteroffensive fired rockets at Dnieper River crossings to try to disrupt supplies to the Russians. On Saturday, the U.S. State Department confirmed two Americans have died in the Donbas region of Ukraine. Their names and details regarding how they died were unavailable. NBC News has independently identified one of the U.S. citizens killed as Luke Lucyszyn. An unknown number of people, mostly with military backgrounds, have traveled from the United States to Ukraine to help the nation in its quest to repel Russian forces. The State Department has repeatedly warned Americans not to go."

NBC News confirmed one of the U.S. citizens killed was Luke Lucyszyn. The State department did not say what the men were doing in Ukraine. “Out of respect to the families during this difficult time, we have nothing further to add,” the State Department said. At least three other U.S. citizens have died since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, two of whom were killed during combat. Former U.S. Marine Willy Joseph Cancel, 22, was killed in April after agreeing to go to Ukraine as part of his work with a private military contracting company, his mother, Rebecca Cabrera, told CNN at the time. Cancel had gone to Ukraine in mid-March and was survived by his wife and their 7-month-old child, she said. The following month, Stephen Zabielski, 52, of Hernando, Florida, was killed while fighting in the village of Dorozhniank. Jim Hill of Idaho, who had been living in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, was also killed in March. The State Department has repeatedly warned U.S. citizens against traveling to Ukraine and said that any U.S. citizens still in Ukraine should leave immediately. Thousands have lost their lives in the ongoing conflict, according to the United Nations, which said Monday that more than 5,100 civilians had died since late February, more than 340 of whom were children. The true toll of civilian casualties is, however, believed to be much higher, according to the U.N. Inside Ukraine, heavy fighting has raged in the country’s south since Thursday, Britain's defense ministry said in a briefing Saturday. Ukrainian forces were continuing an offensive against Russia in the Kherson province to the west of the Dnipro River, the ministry said, adding that “supply lines of the Russian forces west of the river are increasingly at risk.” The briefing came less than 24 hours after the U.S. pledged an additional $270 million of military support for Ukraine, including drones, ammunition and rocket systems. The White House is also considering whether to send U.S.-made fighter jets to the country. There have been no significant breakthroughs on the front lines since early July, when Russian forces seized the last two Ukrainian-held cities in the eastern province of Luhansk. An unknown number of Americans, mostly with military backgrounds, have traveled to Ukraine to join the country’s foreign legion and fight alongside Ukrainian soldiers there. Veterans from several other countries have also been killed and captured by Russian forces and Moscow-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. British aid worker Paul Urey, 45, who was accused of being a mercenary, died last week, an official in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic said last week. The breakaway entity is recognized only by Russia, Syria and North Korea. Two Britons and a Moroccan man were sentenced to death last month after they were taken prisoner. Abigail Williams reported from Washington and Rhoda Kwan from Taipei, Taiwan."
2022-07-22,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/russia-agreed-lift-blockade-ukraine-grain-due-growing-global-condemnat-rcna37624,"Russia agreed to lift blockade on Ukraine grain due to growing global condemnation, senior U.S. diplomat says","Russia agreed to let Ukraine move grain shipments out of its Black Sea ports because it faced growing global condemnation over its blockade, a senior U.S. diplomat said Friday. Asked about the U.N.-backed deal signed by Russia and Ukraine on Friday to resume grain exports through the Black Sea, Victoria Nuland, State Department under secretary for political affairs, said Moscow recognized its stance risked further isolation and alienating countries outside of Europe and North America. “This came together because I think Russia ultimately felt the hot breath of global opprobrium,” Nuland said at the Aspen Security Forum. Russia has blamed the global food crisis on Ukraine and NATO, but that argument was losing traction among developing countries that rely heavily on grain from Ukraine, according to Nuland. “It was losing support,” she said. Russia has had to turn to Iran and North Korea recently for assistance, seeking drones from Tehran and workers from Pyongyang, reflecting its international isolation, according to Nuland. “Putin has to go ask for favors from the Iranians,"" she said, ""and he’s asking the North Koreans to come to Ukraine.” “So with friends like that, they had to make some moves, I think.” After invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russian ships have imposed a de facto blockade on Ukraine’s ports. That has triggered a food crisis around the world, sending food prices soaring, particularly in developing countries in Africa and the Middle East that depend on grain shipments from Ukraine. Under the deal signed Friday in Istanbul, Russia and Ukraine agreed to a maritime “humanitarian corridor” free of naval ships, warplanes or drones that would allow cargo ships with grain and other food to move out of Ukrainian ports through the Black Sea. Tens of millions of tons of grain have been stuck in Ukraine due to Russia’s invasion. The deal allows inspection teams from all parties to search ships at the entry and exit of the Bosporus to ensure there are no weapons or troops on board. Under the agreement, Russia likely will be able to revive its own exports of grain and fertilizer through the Black Sea. U.S. and EU sanctions against Russia have not banned food exports or targeted Russian fertilizer, but many shipping and insurance companies have chosen not to do business with Moscow in the wake of the February invasion. That also may have played a role in Russia’s calculation, as “it was hard for them to get shippers and insurers and others to move their grain,” Nuland said. “So they also need the money, given what else we’re doing to them.” U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres hailed the grain deal as a “beacon of hope” that would bring relief to hungry people around the world. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, ""The world’s hungry cannot wait, and we expect the implementation of today’s deal to commence swiftly and proceed without interruption or interference."" The White House on Friday welcomed the agreement but said the key now was for the agreement to be carried out. “We’re hopeful that this deal is going to make a difference,” said John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the White House National Security Council. But the U.S. remained “clear-eyed” and “we’re going to be watching very, very closely” to see if Russia abides by its commitments, Kirby said."
2022-07-22,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-grain-export-food-crisis-turkey-un-rcna39529,Russia will allow Ukraine to export grain in U.N.-brokered bid to alleviate global food crisis,"The United Nations, Russia, Ukraine and Turkey on Friday agreed to allow the export of Ukrainian grain in a bid to alleviate a global food crisis. Ukraine is one of the world’s biggest grain exporters, but the Russian invasion has blocked shipments, sending the price of food soaring and plunging millions into food insecurity worldwide. The U.N. has warned shortages could push some countries to the edge of famine. “The fact that two parties at war, and still very much at war, have been able to negotiate … these kinds of commercial agreements to help the world, which is suffering from that war, I think that’s unprecedented. It’s an extraordinary achievement,” the U.N.’s emergency relief coordinator, Martin Griffiths, said before the deal was signed. The plan represents a de facto cease-fire between Ukraine and Russia along identified shipping routes, and is a big breakthrough, symbolically at least. However, similar agreements have failed in the past amid mutual mistrust and accusations of violations, raising questions about the viability of the scheme. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the signing ceremony in Istanbul. “Today, there is a beacon on the Black Sea,” Guterres said. “A beacon of hope, a beacon of possibility, a beacon of relief in a world that needs it more than ever.” Addressing the Russian and Ukrainian representatives, he said they had “overcome obstacles and put aside differences to pave the way for an initiative that will serve the common interests of all.” Guterres added that the accord opened the way to significant volumes of commercial food exports from three key Ukrainian ports, Odesa, Chernomorsk and Yuzhny. The U.N. would set up a coordination center to monitor implementation of the deal, he added. Russia and Ukraine supply more than half of the world’s sunflower oil and about 30 percent of the world’s wheat, the U.N. says. The agreement will see Ukrainian pilot vessels lead merchant ships through minefields in and out of Ukrainian ports, allowing shipments through the Black Sea and out through the Bosporus. Operations will be overseen by a joint coordination committee in Istanbul, where U.N. and Turkish monitors would ensure vessels heading into Ukraine are not carrying weapons. The merchant ships will not have a military escort, but a minesweeper could be deployed if there are any issues with mines, U.N. officials said during a briefing before the deal was officially announced. Both Ukraine and the U.N. agreed it would not be necessary to demine the area around Ukraine’s ports, the U.N. officials said, adding that parties to the plan had consulted with the commercial sector to ensure insurance premiums would not be punitive. The plan was expected to be implemented over the coming weeks, just in time to empty Ukrainian silos of last year’s stock and make room for this year’s harvest. With large swaths of Ukrainian farmland and port infrastructure under Russian rocket fire, it is still too soon to know how much grain can be safely exported. Prices of wheat and other agricultural commodities have tumbled in recent weeks from highs set just after Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, with analysts attributing the fall to slowing economies, improved crop forecasts and the prospect of a deal to unlock Ukrainian grain exports. The spike in prices shortly after the invasion drove 71 million people worldwide into poverty, the U.N. said. Food inflation, including for staples such as bread and cooking oil, threatened to destabilize some countries and exacerbate famine in some of the world’s poorest regions. Eighteen of the world’s least developed countries import more than half their wheat from Ukraine or Russia, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said earlier this year."
2022-07-21,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/uks-top-spy-win-ukraine-china-watching-hawk-rcna39343,U.K.’s top spy: We have to win in Ukraine because China is watching 'like a hawk',"In his first public interview on foreign soil, the chief of Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service said Thursday that the West needs to ""win"" in Ukraine in part because the Chinese leadership is watching the war closely for lessons about how to achieve its goal of dominating Taiwan. “This is one of the reasons why it is so essential that we tough it out on Ukraine … and we help the Ukrainians to win, or at least negotiate from a significant position of strength,” said Richard Moore, director of MI6, the United Kingdom’s foreign intelligence agency. “It’s because Xi Jinping is watching this like a hawk.” In a wide-ranging conversation with CNN’s Jim Sciutto at the Aspen Security Forum, Moore added that Xi “underestimates U.S. resolve and power and that might lead him to miscalculate.” He said he does not believe war between China and the West is inevitable, but he said the West needs to make clear to Beijing the dire consequences that would come if it invaded Taiwan. “Clearly we need to find ways of messaging with clarity and getting the sort of deterrence in place that’s necessary to avoid that kind of miscalculation,” he said. In appraising the state of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moore echoed CIA Director William Burns, who said at the same forum Wednesday that the Russian forces had made incremental progress seizing territory in the Donbas region, now that the conflict has settled into a grinding war of attrition. But, he said, “I think they are about to run out of steam,” adding that he believes the Russian military “will have to pause in some way, and that will give the Ukrainians opportunities to strike back.” Moore said an assessment by U.S. and U.K. intelligence agencies that 15,000 Russians had been killed so far is “conservative.” He added that it would behoove the Ukrainian military to start regaining territory now, because it “will be an important reminder to the rest of Europe that this is a winnable campaign … we are about to go into a pretty tough winter,” with Europe rationing heating fuel because of sanctions on Russia. “We’re in for a tough time.” Moore noted that European governments have been cracking down on Russian spying. He said that about half the Russian intelligence officers under diplomatic cover in Europe — about 400 people — have been expelled. “That has probably reduced their ability to do their business to spy for Russia in Europe by half,” he said. Moore said that his spy agency “has never had any illusions whatsoever about communist China,” adding that countering China has now eclipsed counterterrorism as its top mission priority. On Iran, Moore said he does not believe Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is interested in rejoining the nuclear deal with the U.S. and others, echoing views expressed by American officials. Moore, who studied in the U.S. and became a Chicago sports fan, called the cooperation between American and British intelligence the “most special of all elements of our relationship. It is an extraordinarily intimate, high trust relationship … and that keeps our two countries safe.”"
2022-07-21,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-nord-stream-putin-europe-gazprom-rcna39043,Energy war looms as Europe braces for Putin to reduce natural gas exports,"Europe may still be grappling with a heat wave, but already it's bracing for President Vladimir Putin to squeeze a crucial natural gas pipeline and force millions to ration heating this winter. Governments and analysts have warned this week that the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline — Europe’s main artery for natural gas, 45% of which it gets from Russia — could be the locus of an energy war as Russia responds to Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. “Russia is blackmailing us. Russia is using energy as a weapon,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday, adding Europe had to prepare for the worst. Gas started flowing again Thursday after a routine 10-day stoppage but only at the 40% capacity of the pre-maintenance period. Unless Europe weans itself off its reliance on Russia, experts and officials say Putin will dangle this sword of Damocles over the heads of his Western neighbors — and with it the risk of economic, political and even societal unrest that would weaken the pro-Ukraine alliance. “This winter is going to be a stern test of nerves in some European capitals,” said John Lough, an associate fellow at the London think tank Chatham House, adding that Russia weaponizing gas is ""part of its hybrid war strategy to try to persuade Western countries to reduce their support for Ukraine.” The central problem, according to industry analysts, is that Europe has allowed itself to become dependent on Russia. Governments here have not allowed human rights concerns to stop multibillion-euro deals with Kremlin-controlled energy companies. Germany has engaged the most. A now infamous photo from 2011 shows then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel grinning alongside the Russian president at the time, Dmitry Medvedev, turning on the taps for the Nord Stream 1. It cost 7.4 billion euros (around the same amount in U.S. dollars at today’s rates) and has enough capacity to supply half of Germany’s gas, although some of it is sent elsewhere. Merkel's predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, went on to become a board member of Russia’s state-owned oil company Rosneft and was nominated to the board of Gazprom, the gas giant and main shareholder in Nord Stream. Schroeder, a friend of Putin's, only resigned from Rosneft and declined Gazprom's offer after months of pressure, including being stripped of his post-office parliamentary privileges. Nord Stream 1 was controversial when it opened, with Ukraine protesting that it was an attempt by Russia to bypass its former Soviet neighbors that previous pipelines had crossed. Rather than relent, in 2018 Germany granted Gazprom approval to begin construction on the Nord Stream 2 — an even bigger pipeline running in parallel. This, after Moscow invaded Crimea, increased crackdowns on political dissent and meddled in Western elections. Russian's invasion of Ukraine in late February served as a belated reckoning for European capitals. Germany suspended certification for Nord Stream 2 days earlier as Russia ramped up tensions. And Western sanctions have made it more difficult to do business with Russia, which in turn denies allegations it is deliberately squeezing supplies to hike Western bills and ramp up political and economic pressure on its rivals. With Nord Stream 2 on indefinite hold, attention turned to the older Nord Stream 1. It always goes offline for 10 days every July for maintenance, but this year Putin mused that the conduit might become less reliable because of sanctions delaying the delivery of Western-serviced parts. For months Europe has accused Russia of reducing Europe's gas supplies in an attempt to hike prices and sow political division that some worried could spill onto unrest in the streets. Norbert Röttgen, a lawmaker with Merkel's political party, tweeted that this the strategy is part of Putin's ""attack on Europe: He tries to divide and unsettle."" Some took Putin's warning on Nord Stream 1 as an open threat that he may not restart Europe's gas lifeline at all. “There’s nothing nefarious about” the maintenance itself, says Jack Sharples, a research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies think tank. “But it’s the context that has people worried.” Defending its record as a reliable supplier, Russia said the drop in capacity owed to technical problems that it blamed on sanctions. ""Gazprom has fulfilled, is fulfilling and will fulfill all its obligations,"" Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a daily news briefing Thursday. ""Any technological difficulties associated with this stem from the restrictions imposed by the European states themselves."" Klaus Mueller, president of Germany’s network regulator, was not so sanguine. ""In view of the missing 60% and the political instability, there is no reason to sound the all-clear yet,"" he tweeted Thursday. Europe has vowed to look elsewhere for its energy — easier said than done. It has attempted to bring in liquified natural gas (commonly known as LNG) from the United States and elsewhere. But that can only stretch so far, and Europe is still so reliant on Russia that if Moscow did turn off the taps Europe would have to reduce its energy use by 15%, according to an analysis by the Brussels think tank Bruegel. If there's a cold snap this winter, that Europeans may have to put on an extra sweater instead of the central heating, or take shorter showers. ""The Germans are certainly preparing for the worst case scenario, but I don’t think it’s really being communicated to the public yet what this means in practice,"" said Lough of Chatham House. ""If you end up hoping for a warm winter, you’re probably in a difficult place."""
2022-07-21,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-russia-foreign-soldiers-invasion-morale-us-veterans-rcna39268,"Foreign soldiers flocked to Ukraine after Russia invaded. Five months on, the fighting is taking a heavy toll.","After a thrilling first few months of unexpected success that boosted morale among the Ukrainian ranks, the reality of the bloodiest European conflict since World War II has taken its toll among some of the thousands of foreign fighters who traveled from abroad to battle the Russian invaders. The war has long moved past the Ukrainian victory in Kyiv’s suburbs, which are still scarred by the mass graves and blown-out buildings of the Russian occupation. Instead, after months of battle, soldiers push for excruciatingly incremental gains from trenches in the grassy plains and farm fields of the country’s east and south. It’s now a grueling artillery slugfest. Round after round hits near Ukrainian lines, filling the air with dirt, sand and ash and forcing soldiers to burrow into deep trenches. As Ukrainian troops wait for an opening or calculate the position of a potential target, explosions resonate around them with regular thuds — sometimes for 12 hours at a time. The seeming randomness of the strikes intensifies the feeling among some that survival might come down to sheer luck. An American fighting for Ukraine who served in the U.S. Army with combat tours in the Middle East described the constant Russian bombardment of the city of Severodonetsk in Ukraine’s Donbas region as “the closest thing I’ve ever seen to hell.” Ukraine Armed Forces estimate that Russia is using eight times as many artillery munitions each day, firing thousands more shells than the Ukrainians and stymying their efforts. “We lost three guys,” after fighting near Severodonetsk, the soldier said. “My commander got killed out there. A buddy of mine got killed out there. When s— like that happens, it’s hard to imagine the way forward.” The Ukrainian losses have been steep: as many as 100 to 200 casualties per day at the worst points in the war, according to Ukraine’s own estimates. These brutal losses have eroded morale within the ranks and in other units, five non-Ukrainian soldiers said in interviews over the past month. Four of the soldiers have not made their identities public and asked that their names not be used out of concern for their security and so they could speak freely about their experiences. “The number of people that are upset and have low morale has increased, and that’s partly because of the way the Russians have chosen to fight,” Ripley Rawlings, a retired U.S. Marine Corps lieutenant colonel and author, who is providing supplies to foreign fighters in Ukraine through his U.S.-based organization, Ripley’s Heroes, said. Rawlings, who traveled to Ukraine recently and is sending everything from scopes and goggles to trucks and e-bikes to the troops there, said that “about half of the units that we support have taken terrible hits lately.” Despite the challenges, fighters who spoke to NBC News remained adamant about their commitment to pushing out the Kremlin’s forces. The soldiers admitted, however, that supply shortages, delays in receiving weapons promised by the West, and communication frustrations have challenged their spirits after months of battle. Other common complaints included that counter-offensive strategies were undermined by older Ukrainian commanders sticking to Soviet tactics. They also noted poor communication among groups, with one soldier highlighting the lack of “a centralized unit that has everybody by the tail and knowing where people are.” The Kremlin alleges that there are no longer any foreign fighters in Ukraine and that any who remain are mercenaries. Ukraine’s International Legion, meanwhile, said that its soldiers must follow the same disciplinary rules as other Ukrainian soldiers. They are also paid at the same rate: around $500 per month, depending on rank, with the opportunity for bonuses. Thus they are owed the same treatment as any Ukrainian soldier if captured, said Damien Magrou, the legion’s spokesperson. Magrou, a Dutch lawyer and a corporal in the legion, said at a news conference this month that Russian disinformation has negatively affected the group’s recruitment, reputation and fundraising, and he told NBC News on Wednesday that because of recent challenges they “are exploring avenues to widen our recruitment.” As of now, legion members are required to have live combat experience and must pass background checks and a psychological exam to join. Citing security concerns, Magrou declined to say how many soldiers were in the legion or the number of casualties. “There’s been a gradual dip in the number of arrivals over the course of the last few months, which isn’t very surprising given that attention in Western media has shifted elsewhere and the more motivated fighters made their decision in the beginning,” Magrou said over WhatsApp. Magrou has said previously that more than 50 nationalities from every continent are represented in the legion and that former soldiers from the U.S. and U.K. are the most common. The Transatlantic Dialogue Center, a Kyiv-based think tank, estimated that more than 20,000 people have joined the International Legion, though it is unclear how they arrived at that figure. Many of the soldiers who spoke to NBC News said they initially joined to help train Ukrainians after seeing the early, bloody images of the war online and ended up joining the fight. Despite recent hardships, they all shared that they are beginning to see promising signals that Ukraine is working to address its weaknesses. Increased focus on training has made the once disorganized bands of Ukrainian volunteers into effective soldiers, and cycling out units on the front more often has helped keep soldiers fresh. Two soldiers said that they are seeing greater collaboration between units, particularly near Russian-controlled Kherson and Ukrainian-held Mykolaiv — two cities in the south that have been at the center of the fighting in the region. “We’re so close it’s like we can almost see Kherson, and so we’re making the moves necessary to make that happen,” one fighter said. “We have all these groups that have worked together in their own areas, but we’re bringing it all together now. It increases our ability on the battlefield on a larger scale. It’s, like, pretty cool.” That effectiveness on the battlefield appears to be buoyed by the American-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS. The arrival of high-powered military equipment promised by Western governments took months, but the recent success of the HIMAR systems has expanded Ukraine’s missile range and allowed them to strike well into Russian occupied territory. The Pentagon committed to sending four more systems on Tuesday, which would bring the total number in Ukraine to 16. The American fighter who was in Severodonetsk said he and his unit were trapped in a trench for 14 hours on the front in Ukraine’s east due to constant Russian shelling, but the next day they could see a clear horizon thanks to the truck-mounted long-range rocket launchers sent by the U.S. “Every single one of those artillery positions was destroyed, and there were no artillery barrages all day,” he said. “The Russians got it back up and running because they seem to have an endless supply of s—, but those weapons, man, they’re a game changer.” Still, none could ignore the recent reports of foreign soldiers captured, killed and sentenced to death by Russian proxies. From the U.S. alone, the State Department has confirmed the deaths of two Americans who traveled to Ukraine to join the country’s defense and the capture of two other Americans — Alexander John-Robert Drueke and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh. Another American fighter is still missing. A New Zealander fighting on Ukraine’s southern front who asked to be identified by his nickname, Obi-One, said he and his unit of international soldiers write the names of killed or missing foreign fighters on the side of Javelin missiles before they fire them at the Russians’ tanks and other vehicles. “We go hunting targets or looking for an opportunity to see if we can do something in memory of those poor guys,” said the New Zealander, who served multiple tours in Iraq. “It just pisses us off.” The State Department said Drueke and Huynh were imprisoned by the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, or DPR, a separatist group in Ukraine under the thumb of Russia. Fighters who spoke to NBC News said they are waiting for Drueke and Huynh to face the same “sham trials” and Russian “kangaroo court” that sentenced Moroccan Brahim Saadoun and British nationals Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner to death by the DPR. The DPR has appeared to take charge of foreigners who are captured, which the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe recently called “an alarming phenomena.” “The reason these trials are happening out there in the public is as a deterrent against other foreign fighters joining, and so countries have to reach out, recognize and negotiate with these separatists,” said Jeffrey Edmonds, who served as the director for Russia on the National Security Council in the Obama administration. “Given the severe manpower problem the Russians have, these guys joining with three, four, five tours in Iraq are having an outsized impact. I think Russia is concerned and sees a need to deter them by saying, ‘If you come over here, you’re not going be treated under the norms of the Geneva Convention,’” Edmonds said. While the foreign soldiers said they were committed to the fight, all openly discussed their intent to never be captured by Russian forces, even stating that they would prefer death — though one fighter admitted that these statements could be bluster. One soldier, a U.S. Army veteran, claimed he kept a small hand grenade hidden on his person with a string tied to it, and he planned to pull it if he was ever in danger of capture. Others talked of running at Russian soldiers with a knife if they ran out of ammo or said they carried an extra bullet in a separate pocket “just in case.” “I always told my guys don’t get caught fighting because they’re going to do some dastardly s— to you,” said James Vasquez, a former U.S. Army staff sergeant who fought in Ukraine and is now planning his return to the front after selling his Connecticut home. “That’s probably especially true for me because my face is out there, but you got to be ready to go out.” CORRECTION (July 21, 2022, 4:20 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated in a caption that two Americans, Alexander Drueke and Andy Huynh, had been killed while fighting in Ukraine. The State Department has confirmed that the two have been captured; their status is unknown."
2022-07-21,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/nord-stream-1-pipeline-russia-europe-restarts-10-day-break-rcna39261,Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Europe restarts after a 10-day break,"BERLIN — Natural gas started flowing through a major pipeline from Russia to Europe on Thursday after a 10-day shutdown for maintenance, the operator said. But the gas flow was expected to fall well short of full capacity. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany had been closed since July 11 for annual maintenance work. Amid growing tensions over Russia’s war in Ukraine, German officials had feared that the pipeline — the country’s main source of Russian gas, which has accounted for around a third of Germany’s gas supplies — might not reopen at all. Operator Nord Stream AG said that gas started flowing again Thursday morning but the flow would take a while to ramp up, German news agency dpa reported. Deliveries were expected to fall well below the pipeline’s full capacity. Nord Stream said a similar amount of gas was expected to that seen before maintenance. The head of Germany’s network regulator, Klaus Mueller, said on Twitter that Russia’s Gazprom had notified deliveries Thursday of only about 30% of the pipeline’s capacity. In mid-June, Russia’s state-owned Gazprom cut the flow to 40% of capacity. It cited alleged technical problems involving equipment that partner Siemens Energy sent to Canada for overhaul and couldn’t be returned because of sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Canadian government earlier this month gave permission for the turbine that powers a compressor station at the Russian end of the pipeline to be delivered to Germany. The German government has rejected Gazprom’s technical explanation for the gas reduction, charging repeatedly that it was a pretext for a political decision to sow uncertainty and further push up energy prices. It has said that the turbine was a replacement that was only supposed to be installed in September, but that it’s doing everything to deprive Russia of the pretext to reduce supplies. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that Gazprom still hadn’t received the relevant documents for the turbine’s return — a claim repeated Wednesday by Gazprom. Putin said that Gazprom was to shut another turbine for repairs in late July, and if the one that was sent to Canada wasn’t returned by then the flow of gas would ebb even more. The head of the European Union’s executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Wednesday that the turbine was “in transit” and there was “no pretext not to deliver” gas. The Commission proposed that member countries cut their gas use by 15% over the coming months as the bloc braces for a possible full Russian cutoff of gas supplies."
2022-07-20,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/putin-thinks-break-americas-will-ukraine-wrong-says-cia-director-rcna39241,"Putin thinks he'll break America's will in Ukraine, but he's wrong, says the CIA director","Vladimir Putin believes the Russian military’s scaled-down attrition strategy in Ukraine will grind down Ukrainian forces and break the will of the U.S.-led alliance — but he is wrong, CIA Director William Burns said Wednesday at the Aspen Security Forum. “Putin’s view of Americans is that we always suffer from attention deficit disorder, and we’ll get distracted by something else,” Burns said during a live-streamed interview with Andrea Mitchell of NBC News. “My own strong view is that Putin was wrong in his assumptions about breaking the alliance and breaking Ukrainian will before the war began, and I think he is just as wrong now.” After a disastrous start to the war based on a series of flawed assumptions, Russia has settled into its traditional method of war in Ukraine’s eastern region, Burns said — directing massive artillery and air strikes against cities, without regard to civilian casualties. Russia has had some success, he said, advancing six to 10 miles across a narrow strip of land in the Donbas region. But the gains have come at great cost. The U.S. estimates that as many as 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and three times as many wounded, he said. He said Ukrainian casualties are believed to be nearly as high. “In one of my recent conversations with one of my Ukrainian counterparts, he pointed out that the dumb Russians were all dead,” Burns said. “And I think what he meant by that [is]…the Russians have adapted…Putin has shrunk his objectives.” But he said Ukrainians should be able to continue resisting, “so long as we continue to support them with the weaponry and the munitions that they have used so effectively.” Putin was wrong in thinking he could fracture the NATO alliance, Burns said — instead, NATO is welcoming Finland and Sweden and has strengthened its troop deployments closer to Russian borders. “He thought he could establish his dominance over Ukraine very quickly,” Burns said. “It’s hard not to see this as a strategic failure at this point for Putin and Russia.” Burns said the CIA is aware of no evidence that Putin is debilitated mentally or physically. “There are lots of rumors about President Putin’s health and as far as we can tell, he’s entirely too healthy.” Burns offered a fairly detailed assessment of what the CIA believes China has learned from Russia’s Ukraine adventure. He said he wouldn’t underestimate Chinese President Xi Jinping’s determination to assert control over Taiwan, a self-ruling island claimed by Beijing, and he said he believes Xi is “determined to ensure that his military has the capability to undertake such an action should he decide to move in that direction.” He said Russia’s experience in Ukraine probably will not influence the timing of China’s ambitions regarding Taiwan, but may change how it decides to approach them. He added, “I think the Chinese leadership is trying to study the lessons of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and what it tells them … If there’s one lesson I think they may be drawing from Putin’s experience in Ukraine it’s you don’t achieve quick, decisive victories with underwhelming force.” The idea that 190,000 Russian troops were going to effectively occupy and control 47 million defiant Ukrainians never made any sense, Burns said. “So I suspect the lesson that the Chinese leadership and military are drawing is that you’ve got to amass overwhelming force. If you’re going to contemplate that in the future, you’ve got to control the information space. You’ve got to do everything you can to shore up your economy against the potential for sanctions, even though the Chinese economy is far stronger and more entangled with economies around the world than Russia’s ever was. ""And you’ve got to do everything you can to try to drive wedges across the Indo-Pacific between the United States and its allies.” On Iran, Burns said the U.S. does not believe Iran has resumed any effort to build a nuclear weapon, but he said Iran’s work on advance centrifuges means its breakout time — the time it would need to build a bomb — has become very short. “The trend lines are quite troubling,” he said."
2022-07-20,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-seeks-avoid-broader-war-nuclear-conflict-ukraine-air-force-chief-sa-rcna39203,"U.S. seeks to avoid broader war, nuclear conflict over Ukraine, Air Force chief says","If Russia used nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the U.S. military would provide possible “options” on how to respond but America’s goal remains to avoid a nuclear conflict with Moscow, the top general in the U.S. Air Force said Wednesday. Asked how the U.S. would react if Russia resorted to nuclear arms in Ukraine, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chief of the Air Force, said the decision would be up to the president, based on options provided by the military. “I can’t tell you how we should respond,” Brown told Courtney Kube of NBC News at the Aspen Security Forum. “Our responsibility is to provide the president options.” The U.S. has an array of nuclear arms that can be delivered from land, sea or air but the overarching objective is to deter Russia from launching a nuclear attack in Ukraine, Brown said. “It’s all about deterrence,” Brown said. “The goal is not to get into a conflict broader than the conflict that’s already going on today and definitely not into a nuclear conflict.” He added, “You want to make sure that those range of options don’t lead us down a slippery slope that we can’t recover from.” The Biden administration has not said how the U.S. would respond if Russia resorted to nuclear weapons in Ukraine. U.S. intelligence officials say they have seen no signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin is poised to employ smaller, tactical nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. Brown also spoke about plans with NATO allies to help train Ukrainian pilots and build up the country’s air force. The general said the U.S. was looking at helping Ukraine strengthen its air force with new Western aircraft, though he said it was up to Kyiv whether planes would be American made. “I can’t speculate about what aircraft they may go to,” Brown said, adding it would almost certainly not be a Russian aircraft. The U.S. has “a responsibility, like we do with all our allies and partners, to be prepared to train them in various capabilities and capacities,” Brown said. “Part of this is understanding where Ukraine wants to go, and how we meet them where they are.” Reuters first reported that the U.S. military was looking at possible training for Ukrainian pilots for a modernized air force, which until now has relied on Russian-made, Soviet-era warplanes. Brown is considered a contender to succeed Gen. Mark Milley as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the country’s top U.S. military officer. The general also addressed questions about how the Air Force would manage the needs of its personnel while abiding by a recent Supreme Court ruling overturning guaranteed abortion rights under the Constitution. “We have a responsibility to comply with the law. But we also have an obligation to take care of our airmen and their families,” Brown said, without elaborating. Taking care of families was an important element of retaining airmen and it had to be undertaken in a way that was sensitive to each family, he said. Brown cited his own family’s experience, as his oldest son is on the autism spectrum. He and his wife had to make sure they would have “the right level of support” before taking on a new assignment, Brown said. After the recent Supreme Court ruling that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, the Defense Department said the military will continue to provide abortions in cases of rape, incest or when the mother’s life is at risk. Federal law prohibits the Pentagon from performing or paying for other types of abortions, the memo states. With the Army and other branches of the U.S. military struggling with recruiting goals, Brown said he was optimistic the Air Force would meet or come close to meeting its objective. Brown is the first African American to lead one of the military’s service branches. In the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, Brown issued an emotional video message describing the racism he faced as one of a small number of African Americans in the Air Force’s ranks. “It was full of emotion, and partly because it was a conversation with my son that spurred me to do that video. But that emotion was based on my own experiences as well, that I felt throughout my Air Force career, actually throughout my life to be honest with you,” Brown said. The general said that Floyd’s death had sparked a national discussion about race relations, and a constructive discussion inside the Air Force. “I do think things are getting better,” Brown said. “And the one thing about George Floyd’s death, as tragic as it has been, is it opened up our nation to conversation. And the conversation that happened inside of our Air Force, inside of our department of Air Force with the Space Force, has been really helpful,” he said. “Because too often it was things like this we didn’t talk about. We talk about it much more openly today,” Brown said."

In an exclusive interview Wednesday with NBC News, Zelenska said she can’t get her 9-year-old son to return to “doing arts and humanities.” “Before the war, my son used to go to the folk dance ensemble. He played piano. He learned English. He of course attended sports club,” Zelenska told NBC News’ Peter Alexander through a translator. Now, she said, “the only thing he wants to do is martial arts and how to use a rifle.” Zelenska spent the day Wednesday with U.S. officials, sharing her country’s plea for more weapons to push back Russia’s invasion. She met with congressional leaders to make the ask on behalf of her husband, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who remains in Ukraine as the country enters its fifth month of war after Russia’s invasion. In her message to Congress, she described a fear, sense of danger and preoccupation with the war that has gripped Ukrainians and highlighted her desire for children to be able to again find normalcy. “And that’s what I really want to ensure, is that the childhood of my son is given back to him and that he enjoys his life to the fullest,” she told Alexander. Since Sunday, Zelenska has met with several American officials, including first lady Jill Biden, with whom she first met on the Ukrainian border on Mother’s Day, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. On Wednesday, she stood in the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center auditorium to emphasize her country’s need for more military equipment. “I’m asking for something now I would never want to ask,” Zelenska told members of Congress. “I’m asking for weapons — weapons that would not be used to wage a war on somebody else’s land, but to protect one’s home and the right to wake up alive in that home.” To highlight that need, Zelenska started her speech with a presentation filled with photos of Ukrainian children killed in Russia’s invasion and said she was “asking for air defense systems in order for rockets not to kill.” The U.S. is preparing to send four more High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems to Ukraine, which have greatly expanded the country’s missile range. That brings the total number of U.S.-provided truck-mounted long-range rocket launchers to 16. In her speech, Zelenska emphasized that these contributions mean that “while Russia kills, America saves.”"
2022-07-20,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/ukrainian-first-lady-olena-zelenska-deliver-remarks-congress-rcna39049,Ukrainian first lady pleads with Congress for more help against Russia,"WASHINGTON — Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, delivered remarks to Congress in person Wednesday as her country continues its defense against Russia's invasion, asking members for weapons to help end the conflict. ""Because we want every father and every mother to be able to tell their child go to sleep peacefully, there will be no more airstrikes, no more missile strikes. Is this too much to wish for?"" she said. Zelenska addressed lawmakers Wednesday morning in a Capitol Visitor Center auditorium — the same setting where her husband, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, spoke to Congress virtually in March, just a few weeks after Russia's military entered the country. Zelenska shared details about Russian missile attacks on the country, heavily focusing on child victims who have been killed or injured. She described one of the young victims, Lisa, as a ""cheerful, playful little rascal."" As she spoke, a video played behind her, showing Lisa walking to school with her mother pushing her own stroller. The photo to follow was Lisa's stroller knocked over by a Russian missile attack that killed the 4-year-old. ""Those are Russia's 'Hunger Games' — hunting for peaceful people in peaceful cities of Ukraine. They will never broadcast this on their news. That's why I'm showing it to you here,"" Zelenska said. She showed multiple pictures of other victims, including other young children and an entire family who have died in the war. ""This girl is Eva. She liked to draw pictures. She was only five,"" Zelenska said while showing a picture of a small lifeless body in the midst of ruins. In a letter to her colleagues Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said there have been “horrific stories about the brutal treatment of women and girls by Russian forces,” including kidnappings, deportations into Russia and rape. “When I have commented to some that it is outrageous and sickening that war produces such atrocities, I have been told these barbaric crimes are being directly ordered by Putin,” Pelosi said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Let me be clear: Rape of children cannot be a weapon of war. It is a war crime!” Zelenska spoke to Congress after having met with President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden at the White House on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters during Tuesday's meeting, Jill Biden, who visited Ukraine in May, said, ""You cannot go into a war zone and come back and not feel the sorrow and the pain of the people I met."" She added that the group at the meeting, which included several top Biden administration officials, would discuss ways to help address the mental health needs of the Ukrainian people, a subject the two first ladies discussed in their initial meeting on Mother's Day. Congress passed a $40 billion aid package for military, economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine in May. The White House said Tuesday that it has detailed information that Russia plans to annex more Ukrainian territory, including forcing residents to apply for Russian citizenship, making the ruble the official currency and taking control of telecommunications networks. Russia has continued to launch missile strikes on Ukrainian civilians, killing dozens of people in recent days."
2022-07-20,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russias-objectives-ukraine-now-go-donbas-foreign-minister-says-rcna39053,"Russia’s objectives in Ukraine now go beyond the Donbas, foreign minister says ","LONDON — Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that the geographical objectives of Moscow’s “special military operation” in Ukraine are no longer limited to the eastern Donbas region but include a number of other territories, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Lavrov added that Russia’s objectives will expand still further if the West delivers long-range weapons to Kyiv, the agency said. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics When Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, President Vladimir Putin denied any intention of occupying Ukrainian territories, saying his aim was to demilitarise and “denazify” the country — a statement dismissed by Kyiv and the West as a pretext for an imperial-style war of expansion. After being beaten back in an initial attempt to take the capital Kyiv, Russia’s defence ministry said on March 25 that the first phase of the special operation was complete and it would now focus on “achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbas”. Nearly four months later, it has taken Luhansk, one of two regions that make up the Donbas, but remains far from capturing all of the other, Donetsk. However, its forces have already seized territory way beyond Donbas, especially in the southern Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and continue to launch missile strikes on cities across Ukraine. The White House said Tuesday it has detailed information outlining Russian efforts to annex additional Ukrainian territory, including forcing residents to apply for Russian citizenship, making the ruble the official currency and taking control of telecommunications networks."

Iryna Dmitrieva and her daughter, Liza, 4, were on their way to see a speech therapist when the Russian rockets slammed into Vinnytsia, a city in west-central Ukraine, some 450 miles from the recognized front lines in the east of the country. At least twenty-four people were killed, including Liza, who was in the stroller when the missiles hit. Even as Moscow denies targeting civilians, entire Ukrainian towns and cities lie in ruins, and millions have fled their homes. Many escaped their ravaged regions and settled in cities like Vinnytsia, which is far from the epicenter of fighting in the east and was thus considered safe. No longer. From sleepy suburbs of the capital, Kyiv, to a shopping mall in central Kremenchuk and university campuses in the southern Mykolaiv, Russia has been striking deep inside Ukrainian-controlled territory, part of what officials have called Moscow’s “campaign of terror.” Its goal is clear, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after the strike on Vinnytsia — “to put pressure on you and me, on our society, to intimidate people.” Russian defense officials said the strike in Vinnytsia targeted a building where Ukraine’s army command was meeting foreign arms suppliers. But Kyiv-based psychologist Oleh Khomiak agrees with Zelenskyy, and says he believes Moscow is intent on demoralizing the entire nation. “They want to break the people of Ukraine,” he said. Khomiak believes that Russia hopes widespread fear created by seemingly indiscriminate strikes and civilian casualties will make Ukrainians push Zelenskyy and his government to end the war in any way, whether it favors Ukraine or not. Jack Watling, a military analyst at the U.K. think tank Royal United Services Institute, says that strikes deep inside Ukraine are Moscow’s way of ensuring that life never returns to normal. “If you are striking potentially anywhere in the country, and almost anything, whether it be a school or a university or a block of flats, is targetable, then you create a pervasive tension and fear in the population,” he said. “If your strategy is shifting to one in which you are trying to break down the will of your opponent to fight, there is a logic, which is to say — we’re not going to let anyone get on with their lives,” Watling said. With war fatigue setting in, Zelenskyy and regional authorities have been pleading with the population not to ignore air raid sirens and seek shelter. With more Western-supplied weapons flowing into Ukraine, Russia has been targeting ammunition depots and training bases deep within the country to try to destroy them before they reach the battlefield, Watling said. But bad intelligence and the low accuracy of the weapons that Moscow appears to be using have meant that civilian targets have also been hit."

Russian officials are reviewing plans to annex a number of regions, including Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk, by installing proxy officials to hold sham referendums on joining Russia to use as the basis for annexing the territory, said John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, during a briefing with reporters. The moves described by Kirby are similar to those taken by Russia in 2014 when it annexed Crimea. While additional annexation was largely expected, and has been unfolding to some extent in recent weeks, the White House said it was highlighting the efforts to send a signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the U.S. is aware of its plans. Kirby said that if Russia proceeds, it would become “even more of a global pariah than it is now."" “We just wanted to make very plain for the American people what we’re seeing and make it very plain to Mr. Putin that nobody’s fooled by it. We know he’s just dusting off the old playbook from 2014, and we’re going to be watching this closely,” Kirby said. “We’re also going to continue to expose the Russian plan so the world knows that any purported annexation is premeditated, illegal and illegitimate,” he said. The Kremlin is laying the groundwork for annexation, Kirby said, by setting up Russian bank branches to establish the ruble as the default currency, taking control of broadcasting towers, replacing telecommunications infrastructure and issuing Russian passports. Kirby said the U.S. would announce another military assistance package to Ukraine this week, which will include high mobility advanced rocket systems, additional multiple launch rocket systems and artillery ammunition. “The Ukrainian military will work to retake that territory,"" Kirby said. ""The Ukrainian people will resist Russian control and seek to drive Russia out as they have been doing."""

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that the Commission did not expect Nord Stream 1 to restart after its annual 10-day maintenance, quoting European Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn. “We’re working on the assumption that it doesn’t return to operation,” Hahn told reporters in Singapore, according to the Journal. Asked about those comments, the spokesperson said the Commission was basing its contingency planning for gas supplies this winter on the assumption that there could be a complete halt to Russian gas flows. “We are working on the worst possible scenario. And that scenario, and assumption therefore, is that Gazprom would no longer deliver any gas to Europe... We are basing our winter preparedness plans on the worst possible scenario,” he said. The Commission will publish plans on Wednesday for how EU countries could cut gas demand now, as Brussels braces for further drops in Russian gas deliveries and attempts to fill gas storage ahead of winter. EU officials said the Commission was also considering setting targets for countries to curb gas use — but that discussions were ongoing about whether such targets would be binding or voluntary. Reuters reported on Monday that Russia’s Gazprom had told customers in Europe it cannot guarantee gas supplies because of “extraordinary” circumstances, adding to fears that Moscow may not restart the Nord Stream 1 pipeline on Thursday."
2022-07-19,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-iran-us-ukraine-turkey-erdogan-raisi-syria-grain-rcna38855,Vladimir Putin travels to Iran amid challenge to U.S. and Europe,"TEHRAN, Iran — Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Iran starting Tuesday is intended to deepen ties with regional heavyweights as part of Moscow’s challenge to the United States and Europe amid its grinding campaign in Ukraine. In only his second trip abroad since Russian tanks rolled into its neighbor in February, Putin is scheduled to hold talks with Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about the pressing issues facing the region, including the conflict in Syria and a U.N.-backed proposal to resume exports of Ukrainian grain to ease the global food crisis. As the West heaps sanctions on Russia and the costly campaign drags on, Putin is seeking to bolster ties with Tehran, a fellow target of severe U.S. sanctions and a potential military and trade partner. In recent weeks, Russian officials visited an airfield in central Iran at least twice to review Tehran’s weapons-capable drones for possible use in Ukraine, the White House has alleged. But perhaps most crucially, the Tehran trip offers Putin a chance for a high-stakes meeting with Erdogan, who has sought to help broker talks on a peaceful settlement of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as help negotiations to unblock Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea. Turkey, a NATO member, has found itself opposite Russia in bloody conflicts in Azerbaijan, Libya and Syria. It has even sold lethal drones that Ukrainian forces have used to attack Russia. But Turkey hasn’t imposed sanctions on the Kremlin, making it a sorely needed partner for Moscow. Grappling with runaway inflation and a rapidly depreciating currency, Turkey also relies on the Russian market. The gathering has symbolic meaning for Putin’s domestic audience as well, showing off Russia’s international clout even as it grows increasingly isolated and plunges deeper into confrontation with the West. It comes just days after President Joe Biden’s visited Israel and Saudi Arabia — Tehran’s primary rivals in the region. From Jerusalem and Jeddah, Biden urged Israel and Arab countries to push back on Russian, Chinese and Iranian influence that has expanded with the perception of America’s retreat from the region. It was a tough sell. Israel maintains good relations with Putin, a necessity given Russian presence in Syria, Israel’s northeastern neighbor and frequent target of its airstrikes. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have so far declined to pump more oil beyond a plan approved by their energy alliance with Moscow. But all the countries — despite their long-standing rivalries — could agree on drawing closer to counter Iran, which has rapidly advanced its nuclear program since former President Donald Trump abandoned Tehran’s atomic accord with world powers and reimposed crushing sanctions. Talks to restore the deal have hit a deadlock. On his trip, Biden said he’d be willing to use military force against Iran as a last resort. Backed into a corner by the West and its regional rivals, the Iranian government is ramping up uranium enrichment, cracking down on dissent and grabbing headlines with optimistic, hard-line stances intended to keep the Iranian currency, the rial, from crashing. Without sanctions relief in sight, Iran’s tactical partnership with Russia has become one of survival, even as Moscow appears to be undercutting Tehran in the black market oil trade. “Iran is (the) center of dynamic diplomacy,” Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian wrote on Twitter, adding the meetings will “develop economic cooperation, focus on security of the region via political solution ... and ensure food security.” Fadahossein Maleki, a member of the Iranian parliament’s influential committee on national security and foreign policy, described Russia as Iran’s “most strategic partner” on Monday. His comments belied decades of animosity stemming from Russia’s occupation of Iran during World War II — and its refusal to leave afterward. Putin’s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov called Iran “an important partner for Russia” in a briefing Monday, saying the countries shared “a desire to take their relations to a new level of strategic partnership.” In his fifth visit to Tehran, Putin will meet Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, with whom he has a “trusting dialogue,” Ushakov said. He will also hold talks with President Raisi on issues including Tehran’s nuclear deal, of which Russia is a key signatory. The leaders met in Moscow in January and again last month in Turkmenistan. The focus of the talks among the three presidents will be the decade-old conflict in Syria, where Iran and Russia have backed President Bashar Assad’s government, while Turkey has supported armed opposition factions. Russia intervened in the conflict in 2015, pooling efforts with Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants and Iranian forces and using its air power to shore up Assad’s fledgling military and ultimately turning the tide in his favor. Ushakov said the parties will discuss efforts to encourage a political settlement, while Erdogan is expected to take up Turkey’s threats of a new military offensive in northern Syria to drive away U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters from its borders. The operation is part of Turkey’s plan to create a safe zone along its border with Syria that would encourage the voluntary return of Syrian refugees. In a meeting with Erdogan, Khamenei delivered a stern warning against the planned Turkish incursion. “Any sort of military attack in northern Syria will definitely harm Turkey, Syria and the entire region, and will benefit terrorists,” Iran’s top leader said, stressing the need to “bring the issue to an end through talks.”"

In two separate decrees Sunday, Zelenskyy dismissed Ukraine's first female prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, who has been leading the country's efforts to prosecute Russian war crimes, and the chief of the state security agency, known as SBU, Ivan Bakanov, the president's longtime friend and former business associate. The dismissals are the highest-profile political firings since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, and highlight the challenges Ukraine faces to ensure government agencies are not infiltrated by the Russians. Addressing the dismissals in a late night video message Sunday, Zelenskyy said more than 60 officials in Bakanov’s and Venediktova’s offices were working against Ukraine in Russian-occupied territory. The cases are among 651 treason and collaboration cases that had been opened against law enforcement officials in Ukraine so far, according to the president. The number of cases pose “very serious questions to the relevant leadership,” he added."

Paul Urey, 45, was captured in southeast Ukraine in late April and charged with “mercenary activities” by separatists in the DPR, a breakaway entity which is recognised only by Russia, Syria and North Korea. Presidium Network, a non-profit relief group which advised Urey on the dangers of the frontline, described him as a humanitarian volunteer. It said Britain’s Foreign Office had informed Urey’s family of his death. No immediate comment was available from the Foreign Office. Daria Morozova, who has the title of human rights ombudsman in the DPR, said on social media that Urey had been suffering from diabetes and respiratory, kidney and cardiovascular issues. “On our part, despite the severity of the alleged crime, Paul Urey was provided with appropriate medical assistance. However, given the diagnoses and stress, he passed away on July 10,” she said. Urey and another Briton, Dylan Healy, were detained at a checkpoint controlled by separatist forces in late April. The head of Presidium Network told ITV news in May that Urey had diabetes. Two other Britons and a Moroccan man who were captured while fighting for Ukraine have been sentenced to death in the DPR for mercenary activities."
2022-07-15,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/wnba-brittney-griner-trial-resumes-russia-rcna38337,WNBA star Brittney Griner trial resumes in Russia,"MOSCOW — The trial of basketball star Brittney Griner was adjourned for 11 days on Friday after her defense team asked a Moscow court for more time to prepare. A handcuffed Griner, 31, who pleaded guilty last week to drug charges stemming from a February arrest at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, was flanked by three security guards as she was led into the courtroom at Moscow’s Khimki City Court. The two-time Olympic gold medalist and center for the Phoenix Mercury was wearing a yellow and black tie-dyed Nirvana T-shirt at the hearing which began at 10 a.m. local time (3 a.m. ET). Griner has been detained since Russian authorities said they found vape canisters with cannabis oil in her luggage. She faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Her lawyer, Alexander Boikov, previously told reporters that Griner admitted that the vape canisters were hers, but said she brought them to Russia unintentionally. On Friday her defense team submitted more documents to the court, including around 20 character references from different charities and sporting organizations, as well as medical records purporting to show Griner, a 6-foot-9 native of Houston, had a history of injuries that has resulted in severe chronic pain. Her lawyers also submitted a document granting permission for the use of cannabis for medical purposes to treat severe chronic pain issued by Arizona's Department of Health, and the player’s doping test results, all of which were negative. “Among the medical documents is a doctor’s appointment for the substance that Britney Griner inadvertently left among her belongings when crossing the border,” Maria Blagovolina, one of her lawyers said in a statement after the hearing."
2022-07-14,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/wnba-brittney-griner-russian-court-guilty-plea-cannabis-oil-rcna38162,WNBA star Brittney Griner back in Russian court after last week’s guilty plea,"MOSCOW — American basketball star Brittney Griner appeared in a Russian court Thursday, a week after pleading guilty to drug charges. Griner’s abrupt plea came during a hearing near Moscow in a case that has underscored the frayed relations between Washington and Moscow amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin has been accused of using the American as a political pawn while the Biden administration has been under growing pressure from Griner’s family and teammates to secure her release. A handcuffed Griner was led into court around 3:20 p.m. (8:20 a.m. ET), wearing an olive-colored shirt and glasses. She looked calm and even smiled briefly before entering the courtroom. She was joined by her lawyers and three U.S. Embassy representatives. No filming was permitted inside the courtroom, where Griner sat in a light gray box with metal bars as she was listening to the proceedings with the help of a translator. Griner, 31, was detained in February at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport after Russian authorities said they found vape canisters with cannabis oil in her luggage. She has been in custody ever since and is facing the prospect of up to 10 years in prison. During the hearing last week, she admitted that the vape canisters were hers, but said she brought them to Russia unintentionally. One of her lawyers, Alexander Boikov, told reporters after the hearing that Griner was in a hurry as she was packing, and the vape cartridges ended up in her luggage by accident. In a statement released later, her legal team said that because of the “insignificant” amount of the substance found and because of Griner’s “positive contributions to global and Russian sport, the defense hopes that the plea will be considered by the court as a mitigating factor and there will be no severe sentence.” Griner, a 6-foot-9 native of Houston, is a two-time Olympic gold medalist and a center for the Phoenix Mercury. On Thursday, Griner’s defense called on Maxim Ryabkov, the director of UMMC — the Russian basketball club in the city of Yekaterinburg for which she played in the WNBA offseason, as a witness. Ryabkov called Griner “an outstanding player” and a responsible person. The two had a brief exchange during a break, with Ryabkov asking Griner how she was doing. Her UMMC teammate Evgenia Belyakova also testified, saying she has played with Griner for seven years and calling her “a true leader.” Belyakova called Griner’s contribution to Russian basketball “invaluable,” saying she became a role model for many. She also said she was not aware of Griner using drugs. “We miss her very much. We miss her energy,” Belyakova said, speaking to reporters outside the court later. The hearing has been postponed until Friday morning after a request from Griner’s defense team. Griner is expected to testify. In May, the State Department reclassified Griner as having been “wrongfully detained” and transferred oversight of her case to the State Department presidential envoy for hostage affairs. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has denied Griner is being held as a hostage. Last week, President Joe Biden sought to reassure her wife, Cherelle Griner, that he was working to secure her release as fast as he could amid a mounting campaign in the U.S. for his administration to do more to bring her home. Washington has not officially commented on any possible prisoner swaps for Griner, despite speculation in Russian state media in May that she could be exchanged for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence in the U.S. NBC News wasn’t able to confirm those reports. On Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow was ready to work with the U.S. on a possible exchange of prisoners, but urged Washington to abandon attempts to exert pressure on Russia and not speculate on this ""sensitive matter,"" according to the Interfax news agency. Tatyana Chistikova reported from Moscow, and Yuliya Talmazan from London."
2022-07-14,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-russia-strike-missile-kills-17-ignites-fire-rcna38165,"Russian strike kills 23 people in central Ukraine, official say","VINNYTSIA, Ukraine — Russian missiles struck a city in central Ukraine on Thursday, killing at least 23 people and wounding more than 100 others far from the front lines, Ukrainian authorities said. Ukraine’s president accused Russia of deliberately targeting civilians in locations without military value. Officials said Kalibr cruise missiles fired from a Russian ship in the Black Sea damaged a medical clinic, offices, stores and residential buildings in Vinnytsia, a city 167 miles southwest of the capital, Kyiv. Vinnytsia region Gov. Serhiy Borzov said Ukrainian air defenses downed two of the four incoming Russian missiles. National Police Chief Ihor Klymenko said only six bodies had been identified so far, while 39 people were still missing. Three children younger than 10 were among the dead. Of the 66 people hospitalized, five remained in critical condition while 34 sustained severe injuries, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said. “It was a building of a medical organization. When the first rocket hit it, glass fell from my windows,” said Vinnytsia resident Svitlana Kubas, 74. “And when the second wave came, it was so deafening that my head is still buzzing. It tore out the very outermost door, tore it right through the holes.” Borzov said 36 apartment buildings were damaged and residents have been evacuated. Along with hitting buildings, the missiles ignited a fire that spread to 50 cars in a parking lot, officials said. “These are quite high-precision missiles. ... They knew where they were hitting,” Borzov told the AP. Russia denied targeting civilians. “Russia only strikes at military targets in Ukraine. The strike on Vinnytsia targeted an officers’ residence, where preparations by Ukrainian armed forces were underway,” Evgeny Varganov, a member of Russia’s permanent U.N. mission, said in an address to the chamber."
2022-07-12,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-armed-drones-russia-ukraine-white-house-rcna37777,"Iran set to deliver armed drones to help Russia's war in Ukraine, White House says","The White House on Monday said it believes Russia is turning to Iran to provide it with “hundreds” of unmanned aerial vehicles, including weapons-capable drones, for use in its ongoing war in Ukraine. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said it was unclear whether Iran had already provided any of the unmanned systems to Russia, but said the U.S. has “information” that indicates Iran is preparing to train Russian forces to use them as soon as this month. “Our information indicates that the Iranian government is preparing to provide Russia with up to several hundred UAVs, including weapons-capable UAVs on an expedited timeline,” he told reporters Monday. Sullivan said it was proof the Russia’s overwhelming bombardments in Ukraine, which have led it to consolidate gains in the country’s east in recent weeks, was “coming at a cost to the sustainment of its own weapons.” Sullivan’s revelation comes on the eve of President Joe Biden’s trip to Israel and Saudi Arabia, where Iran’s nuclear program and malign activities in the region will be a key subject of discussion. The U.S. decision to publicly reveal that the two countries’ chief regional rival was helping to rearm Russia comes as both Israel and Saudi Arabia have resisted joining global efforts to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine due to their domestic interests. Sullivan also noted that Iran has provided similar unmanned aerial vehicles to Yemen’s Houthi rebels to attack Saudi Arabia before a ceasefire was reached earlier this year. Military analyst Samuel Bendett of the CNA think tank said Russia’s choice of Iran as a source for drones is logical because “for the last 20 years or more Iran has been refining its drone combat force. Their drones have been in more combat than the Russians’.” They are pioneers of so-called loitering munitions, the “kamikaze” drones like the Switchblade that the U.S. has provided Ukraine. Iran has “a proven track record of flying drones for hundreds of miles and hitting their targets,” Bendett added, including penetrating American-supplied air defenses and striking Saudi oil refineries. He said the Iranian drones could be very effective at striking Ukrainian power stations, refineries and other critical infrastructure. Bendett noted that before the Ukraine war, Russia had licensed drone technology for its Forpost UAV from a proven supplier: Israel. The Jewish state has remained neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, so that source is no longer available to Moscow."
2022-07-12,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/38-dead-shelled-apartment-building-eastern-ukraine-chasiv-yar-rcna37792,"38 dead, 9 pulled out alive from shelled apartment building in eastern Ukraine ","Rescuers continued shifting through the rubble Tuesday after officials said a Russian missile strike destroyed an apartment block in eastern Ukraine, killing at least 38 people. The civilian deaths hammered home the human cost of Russia’s invasion, now in its fifth month, as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces push to capture all of Ukraine’s industrial Donbas region after declaring victory in one of its two provinces this month. In the city of Chasiv Yar, rescue workers said Monday they made voice contact with two people in the wreckage of the five-storey building demolished over the weekend. Video showed them pulling survivors from the debris, where officials said up to two dozen people had been trapped. But the death toll has been steadily rising, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said, as more bodies were pulled from under ruined concrete. It said Tuesday at least 38 people, including a child, have been found dead and 9 have been pulled out alive from the rubble. One survivor, who gave her name as Venera, said she had wanted to save her two kittens. “I was thrown into the bathroom, it was all chaos, I was in shock, all covered in blood,” she said, crying. “By the time I left the bathroom, the room was full up of rubble, three floors fell down. “I never found the kittens.” Rescuers could be seen lifting one person from the ruins to a stretcher, and carrying away two bodies in white bags on Monday. Military experts say Russia is using barrages like the one on Chasiv Yar in Donetsk province to pave the way for a renewed push for territory by ground forces, after claiming victory in Luhansk province on July 4. Both have been partly controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Putin, who says he aims to hand control of Donbas to the separatists, on Monday eased rules for Ukrainians to acquire Russian citizenship. “(Russia) indeed unfortunately has a big advantage in artillery,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv on Monday alongside Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. “With all the partners who are ready to give support, I talk about artillery. There is indeed not enough.” A spokesman for Ukraine’s International Legion, a fighting unit of foreign troops, said Ukraine’s heavy artillery was outnumbered roughly eight to one by Russian guns. Reuters could not independently verify battlefield accounts. Further north in the second-largest city of Kharkiv, Russian artillery, rocket and tank attacks killed three and injured 31, including two children, regional governor Oleh Synehubov said. Kharkiv, in the northeast close to the Russian border but outside the Donbas, suffered heavy bombardment in the first few months of the war followed by a period of relative calm that has been shattered by renewed shelling in recent weeks. Moscow denies targeting civilians but many Ukrainian cities, towns and villages have been left in ruins. Since the Feb. 24 invasion, attacks on a theatre, shopping centre and railway station have caused many civilian deaths."
2022-07-12,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-little-big-ilya-prusikin-punk-rock-music-rcna36648,Russian Band Little Big on the choices faced by those against war in Ukraine ,"His songs are fabulously popular, known for their furious dance beats, absurd lyrics and tongue-in-cheek videos that poke fun at Russian stereotypes, pop culture and trappings of wealth. But in just four months, Ilya Prusikin’s life has turned upside down — he is in self-imposed exile for expressing his horror at Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He lives in fear that he will never again see his home. “They are depriving me of a right to say that I don’t agree with murder,” said Prusikin, the lead singer for the Russian band Little Big, speaking via Zoom from an apartment in Los Angeles. “Russia is my motherland. I love my motherland.” Ilya Prusikin said As Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine in late February, Little Big posted a “No War” message on its social media channels in Russian and English. Less than a week later, Prusikin, 37, along with the band’s female vocalist Sonya Tayurskaya, 31, left their home in Moscow for the U.S. They faced the stark choice that many Russians opposing the war have confronted amid an unprecedented crackdown on free speech by President Vladimir Putin’s government. For most Russians who don’t agree with the war, new draconian legislation threatening jail time for any criticism of the armed forces has meant a choice between speaking out and leaving their homeland, or staying put and facing probable arrest and imprisonment. This intensifying repression, reminiscent of the Soviet era, clashes with the Western-influenced music scene that gave birth to Little Big, a self-described “punk-pop-rave band.” The four-person band viral hit “Skibidi” spawned a dance craze in Russia and around the world in 2018, and has nearly 620 million views on YouTube — numbers on par with world stars like Beyonce and Justin Bieber. The band was also Russia’s pick to go to Eurovision in 2020. The band had not waded into Russian politics until after the war, when it released an “anti-war manifesto” — a new song and video that takes direct aim at the government. Called “Generation Cancellation” the video has been viewed more than 7 million times. In it, soldiers are moved like pawns on a chessboard, TV propaganda flows down sewage pipes into people’s brains, and a man in a power suit pushes a red button with the word “cancel” on it. “This was a scream from the heart for us,” Prusikin, sporting his signature patch of black hair on a completely blonde-dyed head, said. “We just wanted to speak out.” In a press release announcing the song’s release, the band openly condemned the actions of the Russian government and said their disgust with war propaganda had led them to “leave everything behind and start our lives from scratch.” Almost immediately, Prusikin said, they were accused of being “traitors” by pro-government media and what he calls pro-Kremlin bots on social media. They have been particularly criticised for fleeing to the United States, a country that has started wars in the past, Prusikin said. “Every country starts wars, but in the U.S., I can be against the war. I can say it,” he added. “If they allowed me to say in Russia that I am against this, I would have stayed there.”"

Some 24 people were feared buried in the rubble in Chasiv Yar in Donetsk province. Photos and a video of the aftermath of the attack showed grim-faced rescuers atop a huge pile of rubble. They sifted through broken bricks, mangled metal wiring and crumbled cement beams next to a half-collapsed building. The images were shared by Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk Oblast in the eastern Donbas region, and the Internal Affairs Ministry. “The search and rescue operation continues,” Kyrylenko told Ukrainian television on Sunday. “We have more proof of Russia’s crimes, that they shell residential areas of any community, whether it’s close to the front lines or not.”"

But more than 1,300 miles away in Ukraine, the mood could not be more different. Seen as a scandal-ridden charlatan by some opponents in London, the outgoing British prime minister is adored in Kyiv for his vociferous support of the country — and the weapons the U.K. has supplied for its fight against Russia while he's been at the helm. ""Johnson quitting is a personal tragedy for me,"" said Olha Povaliaeva, 30, a project manager from the eastern city of Donetsk, a key battleground in the conflict. The prime minister has become ""an older brother and a close friend who will always comfort, support and encourage"" Ukraine, she added. ""I’m sorry that this eminent person is going through such a difficult time right now."" That support extends from sidewalk to legislature. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Johnson a ""friend"" Thursday and said ""all Ukrainians were saddened by the news"" that he would step down. There is also a palpable nervousness about whether Johnson’s successor will be quite so bullish in their support."

The White House said Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris called Cherelle Griner ""to reassure her that he is working to secure Brittney’s release as soon as possible."" Brittney Griner pleaded in a handwritten letter that was hand-delivered to the president on Monday for his help to get her released from jail in Russia. Biden also read Cherelle Griner a draft of the letter he is sending to Brittney Griner on Wednesday, the White House said. ""The President offered his support to Cherelle and Brittney’s family, and he committed to ensuring they are provided with all possible assistance while his administration pursues every avenue to bring Brittney home,"" the White House said. Cherelle Griner said Wednesday on Instagram that she is grateful to Biden and Harris for their time and the commitment they expressed to bringing her wife home. ""While I will remain concerned and outspoken until she is back home, I am hopeful in knowing that the President read my wife’s letter and took the time to respond,"" she said. ""I know BG will be able to find comfort in knowing she has not been forgotten."" She asked for prayers for her family and the families of other people who have been wrongfully detained, as the U.S. says Brittney Griner was. ""Let’s continue to use our voices to speak the names of all the wrongfully detained Americans and support the Administration as they do what it takes to bring them home today,"" she said in the post. Cherelle Griner has spoken by phone in recent weeks and over the weekend with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, the White House said. Biden also directed his national security team to remain in regular contact with the family and with the families of other Americans detained around the world, including Paul Whelan, a former security executive who is detained in Russia. Biden had been under increasing pressure to demonstrate progress toward Griner's release as she faces a trial on drug smuggling charges. She was detained in February after authorities said she was in possession of cannabis-derived vape cartridges. Griner said in her letter to Biden that “I’m terrified I might be here forever.” Cherelle Griner also has been speaking publicly in recent days, and the Rev. Al Sharpton is calling on the Biden administration to help facilitate a visit from him and other religious leaders. (Sharpton is the host of MSNBC’s “PoliticsNation.”) A senior administration official said the U.S. doesn’t expect a resolution before Griner's trial plays out, which is likely to take weeks. At that point, the official said, the administration expects that Russian President Vladimir Putin may be ready to negotiate a deal. Vanessa Nygaard, the head coach of the Phoenix Mercury, said in an interview Wednesday on MSNBC that the team desperately wants to get Griner back to the U.S. “I mean, it must be hell,” she said. “It must be the most terrible thing possible for her to not have access to all the things she normally has access to, but we’re talking about a Russian prison. And so it couldn’t be a worse condition, I think, and we are just concerned about her and her welfare every day.” Nygaard said the team has been able to communicate with Griner through email and the State Department. “But it’s just so upsetting to know that somebody you care about is put into this terrible situation,” she said. “She’s wrongfully detained. And you know, we know in America, that we hold freedom very tight and very important to us.” Asked for comment, the National Security Council pointed to spokesperson Adrienne Watson’s statement Monday, which said: “President Biden has been clear about the need to see all U.S. nationals who are held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad released, including Brittney Griner. The U.S. government continues to work aggressively — using every available means — to bring her home.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday that the administration has been working aggressively on Griner’s release behind the scenes. She declined to say whether Biden would accept a prisoner swap as part of a deal for her freedom."

The letter, dated July 4, was signed by many prominent Black women described in the letter as intersectional and intergenerational. The group includes civil rights and faith leaders, athletes and business executives. Among the letter’s signatories are Bernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., three state senators and former NAACP president Hazel Dukes. (Joy Reid and Tiffany Cross, both MSNBC hosts, and Amber Ruffin, a Peacock host, also signed the letter.) The group chastises the Biden administration for not acting quickly enough to negotiate the release of Griner, who was detained in February. Russian authorities said she was in possession of cannabis-derived vape cartridges and charged her with drug smuggling. “We are concerned that the rhetoric does not appear to align with the actions taken to date,” the women write. “We urge you to make a deal to get Brittney back home swiftly and safely.” The group alleges Griner is “being used as a political pawn” and is being denied consular access and outside communication while suffering “inhumane conditions.” The letter also claims the State Department recently failed to put Griner in touch with her wife, Cherelle, on their wedding anniversary for their first phone conversation since she was detained. . The additional pressure comes as Griner sent a handwritten letter to Biden this week, pleading for the administration to not forget about her and other American detainees. “As I sit here in a Russian prison, alone with my thoughts and without the protection of my wife, family, friends, Olympic jersey, or any accomplishments, I’m terrified I might be here forever,” Griner wrote. Biden spoke with Cherelle Griner on the phone on Wednesday and read her the draft of the administration’s response letter to Brittney. He told Cherelle he is working to release Brittney and other Americans designated as wrongfully detained by Russian authorities as soon as possible. He said he has directed his national security team to keep in close contact with Griner’s family. Griner’s trial is expected to take several weeks, and she could face up to 10 years in Russian prison. “America cannot fail Brittney Griner,” the group wrote.

2022-07-06,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/west-help-ukraine-get-russian-made-weapons-ammo-world-think-tank-says-rcna36809,"Ukraine urgently needs Russian-made weapons, and there's a huge supply in unexpected countries","Ukraine still relies heavily on Russian-made weapons and will need to turn to other countries outside of NATO to secure enough Soviet-era arms and ammunition to keep up its fight against Moscow, according to a new report. Eastern European countries in NATO already have handed over most of their spare Soviet-origin systems to Ukraine, but there’s an untapped supply of the Russian-manufactured weapons around the world, including in countries that have publicly supported Kyiv, the report by the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies think tank said. The United States and other Western countries should help Ukraine get access to those Soviet-made weapons, including artillery rounds, air defense systems and armored vehicles, the think tank said. “Although Washington has scoured the stocks of NATO allies and the Pentagon has explored other potential options, an exhaustive search focusing on non-NATO countries reveals a robust supply of untapped Soviet- and Russian-made arms (and their attendant spare parts and ammunition) that Washington could help Kyiv expeditiously acquire,” the report said. The Foundation for Defense of Democracies calls itself a nonpartisan, nonprofit research institute focusing on national security. It tends to back a hawkish foreign policy stance, and has heavily criticized the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The think tank's report identified more than 6,300 relevant weapons systems from countries outside of NATO that Ukraine is using or employed before the Feb. 24 Russian invasion, including Mi-17 helicopters, T-80 tanks and BM-14 artillery pieces. The weapons are located in 23 countries, including South Korea, Colombia, Argentina and Kenya. The countries listed by the report as possible weapons donors met at least one of the following criteria: voted in favor of a United Nations resolution calling for a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine, voted to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council, or attended a meeting of a U.S.-led Ukraine defense contact group. The U.S. and its European allies could consider offering future arms sales or swaps with countries that provide Russian-made weapons to Ukraine, other diplomatic or economic incentives, or simply purchase the Soviet-standard systems outright, the think tank said. Some countries might prefer to keep their aid to Ukraine “out of the spotlight,” the report said. “Some of the countries will say no, some of them may play hard to get, some of them may ask a price that’s too high but, my goodness, we need to be trying,” said ‍Bradley Bowman, one of the authors of the report and a former national security adviser to members of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees. “Time is of the essence and the stakes are incredibly high,” said Bowman, now senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Ukraine has warned that it is facing shortages of ammunition for its Soviet-standard artillery and that it remains outgunned by Russian forces, which have launched unrelenting shelling attacks in an offensive in the east. Moreover, Ukraine’s capacity to repair and maintain its military equipment likely has been undermined due to Russian missile attacks targeting production sites, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. In another setback for Ukraine, Russia seized control of the eastern city of Lysychansk in recent days, giving Moscow effective control of the Luhansk province. The White House National Security Council and the Department of State did not respond to requests for comment. An administration official said that the U.S. has been approaching countries in and outside of NATO to supply Ukraine with Soviet-era and Russian-made military equipment, and non-NATO countries have pledged assistance at meetings organized to rally military support for Kyiv. “For many months, the U.S. has been working with allies and partners to facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era equipment,” the official said. “It’s been part of our bilateral conversation with countries around the world.” U.S. and Western-made weapons being delivered to Ukraine, including howitzers, drones and high mobility artillery rocket system, or HIMARS, are making a difference on the battlefield, experts say. But many of the new systems require training and Ukraine is still heavily dependent on its Russian-origin gear, said Mark Montgomery, a retired U.S. Navy admiral who served in the U.S. European Command and is now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “More than 80 percent of their gear is still Soviet-era,” he said."

After Russian forces on Sunday took control of Lysychansk, the last bastion of Ukrainian resistance in Luhansk, Ukraine’s military braced for an assault on Donetsk, with the cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk both in the Russian line of fire. Donetsk and Luhansk comprise the Donbas, the industrialized eastern part of Ukraine that has seen the biggest battle in Europe for generations. There was heavy fighting at the edge of the Luhansk region, its governor Serhiy Haidai told Ukrainian television, saying Russian regular army and reserve forces had been sent there in an apparent effort to cross the Siverskiy Donets River. Haidai earlier said Russian forces were engaged in widespread shelling as they launched their assault on Donetsk. Russia says it wants to wrest control of the entire Donbas from Ukraine on behalf of Moscow-backed separatists in two self-proclaimed people’s republics. On Tuesday, Russian forces struck a market and a residential area in Slovyansk, killing at least two people and injuring seven, local officials said. A Reuters reporter at the scene saw yellow smoke billowing from an auto supplies shop, and flames engulfing rows of market stalls as firefighters tried to extinguish the blaze. Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said Slovyansk and nearby Kramatorsk had suffered heavy shelling overnight. “There is no safe place without shelling in the Donetsk region.”"
2022-07-04,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/vladimir-putin/-terrified-brittney-griner-sends-biden-handwritten-letter-trial-russia-rcna36611,'I'm terrified': Brittney Griner sends Biden handwritten letter amid trial in Russia ,"WNBA star Brittney Griner asked President Joe Biden to bring her home from detention in Russia, where she is being tried on drug smuggling charges, telling the president in a handwritten letter: ""I'm terrified."" “As I sit here in a Russian prison, alone with my thoughts and without the protection of my wife, family, friends, Olympic jersey, or any accomplishments, I’m terrified I might be here forever,” Griner wrote. A spokesperson who released excerpts of Griner’s letter Monday said the document was delivered to the president at the White House on Monday. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. Griner, 31, a Houston native who is a center for the Phoenix Mercury, was detained in February by Russian Federal Customs Service agents at Sheremetyevo airport near Moscow. She plays for a Russian team during the WNBA's offseason. “I miss my wife! I miss my family! I miss my teammates!” she wrote to Biden. “It kills me to know they are suffering so much right now. I am grateful for whatever you can do at this moment to get me home.” Russian authorities allege that she was in possession of cannabis-derived vape cartridges. Griner's representatives haven’t addressed the technical substance of what she is alleged to have possessed, and the line between non-psychoactive cannabidiol — better known as CBD, which is popular among athletes as a possible aid in workout recovery — and psychoactive cannabis isn’t recognized in Russia. CBD is generally recognized as legal in the U.S., and the World Anti-Doping Agency removed it from its list of prohibited substances in 2018. In her letter, Griner recognized July Fourth as a time to celebrate the nation’s freedoms. ""On the 4th of July, our family normally honors the service of those who fought for our freedom, including my father who is a Vietnam War Veteran,"" Griner said. ""It hurts thinking about how I usually celebrate this day because freedom means something completely different to me this year."" She implored Biden to continue working to free her. ""I realize you are dealing with so much, but please don’t forget about me and the other American Detainees,"" she wrote. ""Please do all you can to bring us home. I voted for the first time in 2020 and I voted for you. I believe in you. I still have so much good to do with my freedom that you can help restore."" The White House has been steadfast in its stance that Griner is being wrongfully detained; officials have said they're working behind the scenes to free her. ""The U.S. government continues to work aggressively — using every available means — to bring her home,"" National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement Monday, adding that the administration is in ""regular contact"" with her family. ""National Security Advisor Sullivan has spoken twice with Brittney’s wife over the past two weeks and the White House is closely coordinating with the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, who has met with Brittney’s family, her teammates, and her support network,"" Watson added. The situation is surely complicated by the animosity between the U.S. and Russia. Griner was arrested less than a week before Russia invaded Ukraine and set in motion economic sanctions, the withdrawal of Western businesses and the shipping of arms and technology to Ukraine. On June 28, national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with reporters about Griner's situation aboard Air Force One en route to Madrid, saying the matter ""has the fullest attention of the president."" ""The Russian government should release her and allow her to be returned and reunited with her family and come home safe and sound,"" he said. Sullivan said he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to Griner's wife recently and expressed their sympathy for what the family was going through. Griner was photographed in Russian court Friday. The next hearing was scheduled for Thursday."

Seizing full control of the Luhansk region Sunday may represent not just a major public relations boost for President Vladimir Putin but also a significant battlefield development that could set the stage for decisive battles to come. Ukraine has acknowledged that its troops pulled out from the city of Lysychansk, just over a week after they withdrew from its twin city, Sievierodonetsk. Kyiv said the retreat was an effort to preserve manpower as it stares down a long war of attrition, while Moscow heralded what it said was a major victory. The fall of Lysychansk dominated Russian state media headlines Monday, as Putin held a rare televised face-to-face meeting with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to thank the troops and Ukrainian separatist forces for the capture of Luhansk. It was celebrated in propaganda videos from the battlefield and in photos taken by Russian cosmonauts in space. The Kremlin’s forces were already looking to advance farther in neighboring Donetsk, which with Luhansk makes up the industrial region known as the Donbas, so attention was turning toward what the capture might mean for the future of the Russian invasion. “The loss of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk is significant, but the Ukrainian decision to retreat buys Kyiv some time and avoids human losses that would be more critical than the loss of two cities,” said geopolitical and security analyst Michael A. Horowitz, the head of intelligence at the consultancy Le Beck. “On the ground, the war is still far from being won,” he added."
2022-07-03,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-lysychansk-key-city-brink-capture-putin-assault-rcna36486,Ukrainian army confirms withdrawal from key city in eastern Ukraine,"Ukrainian forces confirmed Sunday that they had withdrawn from a key eastern city in what amounts to a major setback in its fight against the Russian invasion. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine announced in a Facebook post that they had withdrawn from Lysychansk following heavy fighting and Russian troops' ""multiple advantage in artillery, aviation, active basefire systems, ammunition and personnel,"" and that ""continuing the city’s defense would lead to fatal consequences."" ""Unfortunately, steel will and patriotism are not enough for success — material and technical resources are needed,"" the post continued. ""Defenders of Luhansk region and other regions of our country heroically perform their civil and military duties. We will come back and win for sure!"" Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu previously told President Vladimir Putin that Lysychansk and its surrounding areas were now under Moscow’s control, according to a statement Russia’s defense ministry posted to its Telegram channel on Sunday. In an earlier statement, the ministry said that its forces had encircled the city, which was Ukraine’s last bastion in the Luhansk province. Russian troops were fighting inside the city, it said, adding that a contingent of Ukrainian forces had been trapped. Lysychansk’s capture provides the Kremlin with a major victory in the east after suffering a series of military setbacks early in the invasion, and sets up its troops for moving farther into the Donetsk region, which together with Luhansk makes up the industrial region known as the Donbas. The area has become the key focus for Putin after his troops were forced to retreat from the northern region around Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. There was no immediate reaction from Ukrainian officials to Russia’s claims about taking Lysychansk. NBC News has reached out to Ukraine’s defense ministry for comment. But earlier Sunday, Luhansk’s regional governor Serhiy Gaidai, said in a Telegram post that the Russians were entrenched in the Lysychansk area. “The city is on fire,” he said, adding that the Russians were attacking the city in “inexplicably brutal tactics.” Moscow had thrown what appears to be all of its forces at Lysychansk, he said. NBC News could not independently verify the battlefield reports. But the Institute for the Study War, a military think tank based in the U.S., said Saturday that Ukrainian forces likely conducted a deliberate withdrawal from Lysychansk, resulting in the Russian seizure of the city. In a Sunday morning update, Ukraine’s military said that the Russians were “concentrating their main efforts on securing positions” in the city and nearby areas. But it did not say that the city had been taken over. The capture of Lysychansk comes just over a week after Russian forces seized its twin city of Sievierodonetsk after weeks of intense street fighting. Elsewhere, at least four people were killed by a series of blasts in the Russian city of Belgorod, the regional governor said Sunday. Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a Telegram post that 11 apartment buildings and nearly 40 private homes were damaged. He added that three Ukrainian citizens were among the dead. Russia’s defense ministry later accused Ukraine of striking the city with ballistic missiles. It said the ​​attack was “purposefully planned and carried out against the civilian population.” There was no immediate reaction from Ukraine to Russia’s claims, but NBC News could not independently verify the reports. Moscow, however, has repeatedly accused Kyiv of attacks on Belgorod, a city of nearly 400,000 that sits some 25 miles north of the border with Ukraine, as well as on other border cities. Ukraine has never officially claimed responsibility for the attacks. Meanwhile, Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of the occupied Ukrainian city of Melitopol, said in a Telegram post Sunday, that Ukrainian forces had fired on one of four military bases in the area. The head of the Russian-installed council in the Zaporizhzhia region confirmed the strikes but said no one was killed. Despite being battered in the east, Ukrainian forces have made some advances elsewhere, including forcing Russia to withdraw from Snake Island, a key Black Sea outpost southeast of the port city of Odesa, which Moscow captured at the start of the war. Russia had used Snake Island to impose a blockade on Ukraine, one of the world’s biggest grain exporters and a major producer of seed for vegetable oils. The disruptions have helped fuel a surge in global grain and food prices. Moscow denies that it has been blockading Ukraine’s ports, blaming Kyiv for not de-mining the waters instead."
2022-07-03,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-prisoners-of-war-beaten-taunted-kyiv-rcna36225,Ukrainians taken captive by Russia say they were held in brutal conditions: ‘Everyone was beaten’,"ODESA, Ukraine — Torture, beatings and neglect: Ukrainian service members captured during Russia’s invasion may be lucky to be back home alive, but their physical and emotional scars could plague them for years. One such soldier is Mykhaylo, 20, who said he hadn’t finished his military training when attack helicopters swarmed Hostomel airport near the nation’s capital, Kyiv, where he was preparing to be deployed. It was Feb. 25, the day after Russia invaded. After an intense battle, he said his fighting group had little choice but to surrender and he was taken captive. He told NBC News that he and his comrades were held in a few locations around the airport before being transferred to a bomb shelter in a fire station. He was held with both military personnel and civilians, 34 people in total, he said. The oldest prisoner was a 70-year-old man, who had been taken captive after he admitted to having military identification, he said. “Everyone was beaten,” said Mykhaylo who, like many other soldiers, requested that his last name be withheld for security reasons because he planned to rejoin the fight once he has finished recuperating. After they were captured, he said, “food was tight” and the prisoners of war were provided with just a spoonful of oatmeal and just a few tablespoons of water a day. The Russians “explained this by the fact that they also lacked provisions,” he said at the Forest Valley rehabilitation center on the outskirts of Kyiv. Mykahlo is not alone. On Wednesday, 144 Ukrainian soldiers were released as part of a prisoner exchange -- the largest since the start of the war. There have been several prisoner exchanges, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, known by the acronym GUR, said in a statement on Telegram. While neither side will give exact numbers, both sides are believed to have captured thousands during the four-month-old war. Despite initially losing control of Hostomel airport, a key staging point for a Russian attack on Kyiv, Ukrainian forces were eventually able to retake it and then push the invading troops out of the region around the capital. But that was too late for Mykahlo, who said he had already been captured. “The peculiarity of tank shelling is that you don’t hear its coming. It’s instant.” Ukrainian marine Hlib Stryzhko “The Russians were intent on extracting information,” said Mykhaylo, who said he spent two months in captivity before he was freed in the prisoner exchange. “They wanted to know about the type of weapons they had, specifically U.S. Stinger and Javelin missiles,” he said. “But we didn’t have that.” A few days later, Mykhaylo said the prisoners were transferred to a “very cold” meat storage refrigerator before being bused to neighboring Belarus, a close ally of Russia’s, and then flown to Kursk in Russia. There, he said, they spent five nights in freezing temperatures in a tent before they were transferred to a detention facility in the city. “They took away our uniforms, beat us up, put us in cells and started to take us for interrogations,” he said, adding that every morning they were routinely made to sing the Russian national anthem. In many ways, however, Mykhaylo said he was lucky compared to some of the other prisoners, both civilians and service members, who suffered far worse punishments. He said one of his fellow prisoners told him “that they beat him on the kidneys, they beat him on the face, everywhere they could for an hour.” “When he slept, he was moaning all night long,” he added. “We wanted to help him in some way but we could not do anything.” Others who had tattoos with Ukrainian symbols “were beaten very badly,” he said. Ukrainian marine Hlib Stryzhko, 25, was among the fighters defending Mariupol, a city whose treatment at the hands of the Russian forces before it fell prompted disgust and outrage around the world and became a symbol of the Kremlin’s excesses. Speaking from his bed in the Forest Valley rehabilitation center, he said, he was defending a building April 10, when he turned his head and “saw a tank aiming at me.” “The peculiarity of tank shelling is that you don’t hear its coming,” he said. “It’s instant.” Then the “dust blinded my eyes,” he said, adding that he “started falling from the third floor to the ground and the rubble started to fall on me and cover me.” He said he broke his pelvis and jaw, and lost sight in his left eye. Although he was rescued by his comrades, with no way out of Mariupol, he said the only way to save his life was to get transferred to Russian custody. Stryzhko said he was taunted, denied medical care and given just enough food to keep him alive at the Russian medical facility. “My ward neighbors had shrapnel in their bodies. Russians even didn’t pull them out — they were just rebandaging their wounds and their limbs continued to rot,” he said. International law provides protection for prisoners of war, with the Geneva Conventions decreeing that they must be treated humanely, protected against acts of violence, as well as intimidation and insults. The detaining power is also required to supply prisoners of war who are being evacuated with sufficient food and water, and with the necessary clothing and medical attention. Russia’s Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment about the allegations of mistreatment of captured Ukrainian soldiers. Olena Vysotska, Ukraine’s deputy justice minister, said that prisoner exchanges have taken place once or twice a month. “We are very interested in such swaps, because we are very focused on the saving of lives of our military. Sometimes the people swapped are civilians, because the war is going on in our territory,” she said. Both Mykhaylo and Stryzhko were freed in late April. After being flown to a military airfield in Crimea, 18 days after he was transferred to Russia, Stryzhko said he was told he was going to be swapped before he was crudely loaded onto a military truck and taken to a hospital in Zaporizhzhia under Ukrainian control. “The driver of this truck came, knocked my chest and told us, ‘Relax guys now — you are in Ukraine,’” he said. “And at this moment, I started crying. I was very happy.”"

Video of the attack before daybreak showed the charred ruins of buildings in the small town of Serhiivka, about 31 miles from Odesa. The Ukrainian president’s office said warplanes fired three missiles that struck an apartment building and a campsite. Ukrainian authorities interpreted the attack as payback for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Snake Island a day earlier, though Moscow portrayed their departure as a “goodwill gesture” to help unblock exports of grain. Russian forces took control of the island in the opening days of the war in the apparent hope of using it as a staging ground for an assault on Odesa, Ukraine’s biggest port and the headquarters of its navy. “The occupiers cannot win on the battlefield, so they resort to vile killing of civilians,” said Ivan Bakanov, head of Ukraine’s security service, the SBU. “After the enemy was dislodged from Snake Island, he decided to respond with the cynical shelling of civilian targets.” Ukraine’s military reported late Friday on social media that two Russian Su-30 warplanes bombed Snake Island with phosphorus bombs. Black-and-white aerial video showed two blasts hitting the island. The warplanes reportedly struck from the east, from Belbek, on the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula. The Russian military did not immediately comment. Large numbers of civilians were killed in Russian bombardments earlier in the war, including at a hospital, a theater used as a shelter, and a train station. Until this week, mass casualties involving residents appeared to become less frequent as Moscow concentrated on capturing eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. Russian missiles struck the Kyiv region last weekend after weeks of relative calm around the capital and an airstrike Monday on a shopping mall in the central city of Kremenchuk killed at least 19 people."

Griner, a Houston native and a center for the Phoenix Mercury, has been detained since February, when Russian authorities allege she was found in a Moscow airport in possession of cannabis-derived vape cartridges. She has made no public statements since her detention and it's unclear what she makes of the accusations against her or what she says were the circumstances surrounding her arrest. Photos showed Griner entering the courthouse in Khimki, outside Moscow, early Friday. She appeared to look straight ahead as she walked down a stairwell, wearing a Jimi Hendrix T-shirt. Alexander Boikov, one of Griner's attorneys, told reporters the court questioned two prosecution witnesses. A Sheremetyevo Airport customs employee who searched Griner before she was detained was questioned behind closed doors about the circumstances of Griner's detention. The next hearing in Griner’s case has been scheduled for July 7 at 2:30 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. ET). “She’s worried, naturally,” Maria Blagovolina, another of Griner’s attorneys, said when asked about her client’s mood."
2022-06-30,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-withdraws-snake-island-ukraine-counteroffensive-south-kherson-rcna35874,Russia withdraws from Snake Island as Ukraine counteroffensive nears Kherson,"For weeks, the world’s attention has been fixed on the battle for Ukraine’s east, where Russian forces have been pressing a painstaking advance. But in the south, recent developments suggest Russia’s hold on territory it seized there may be increasingly fragile. Moscow's troops withdrew from a key strategic outpost off Ukraine’s southern Black Sea coast Thursday, the latest blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the area. It comes amid a nascent Ukrainian counteroffensive around Kherson as well as growing signs of partisan activity and the Kremlin straining to exert control: The south may be flying under the radar for now, but analysts say it could ultimately prove decisive in the struggle for Ukraine’s future. Russia has controlled large chunks of Ukraine’s south — including the entire Kherson region — since the early days of the war. Since late May, however, the Ukrainian army has been reporting counteroffensive operations against Russian forces, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying last week his military was “gradually liberating” the region. It has left observers wondering if Ukraine is laying the groundwork for a major counteroffensive in the south to open a new front and potentially tip the war in its favor. “Kherson is really the gateway to Ukraine’s success,” said Neil Melvin, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London. “If Ukrainians can push through Kherson, then that raises the prospect that they can begin to turn the tables on the Russian invasion in a much bigger sense.” Kherson is a strategically important city of almost 300,000 that serves as a gateway to broader control of the south. It was the first major city captured by Russia after the invasion four months ago. Located at the confluence of the Dnieper River and the Black Sea, just a two-hour drive from Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, it is critical to establishing a land corridor from Russian-controlled areas in the east all the way to Odesa in Ukraine’s southwest — which analysts have said may be one of the goals of the Kremlin’s invasion."
2022-06-30,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukrainians-left-country-escape-war-russia-are-coming-back-rcna35441,Ukrainians who left the country to escape the war with Russia are coming back,"Ukrainians who left the country to escape the war with Russia are increasingly making their way back as the fighting enters its fifth month. More than 8 million Ukrainians, out of the prewar population of 44 million, left their homes and crossed into neighboring countries such as Poland and Romania to seek safety after the invasion. But the gap between those departing and those re-entering Ukraine is narrowing, according to recent data from the United Nations. Since mid-May, that count has been particularly close, per an NBC News analysis. “We came back because we really wanted to go home,” said Julia Fedosiuk, an attorney from Kyiv who returned to Ukraine earlier this month after spending more than three months in Poland. She fled the capital Feb. 25, the day after Russia invaded.For Fedosiuk, 37, leaving her home country was a “forced measure” to keep her children, Ivan and Vera, safe, but she said she always knew they would return home. She decided to come back June 6, feeling that the security situation in Kyiv has improved since the Russian forces retreated in April. Still, Russia continues to strike cities across the country. She spoke on the same day that Ukrainian officials said two residential buildings were hit by Russian missiles in the capital, killing two people and injuring several others. While Fedosiuk has returned to work, she has been taking her children to her office in Kyiv every day, too fearful of a potential missile strike to leave them alone. “We are scared,” she said, but added that they are determined to stay in Kyiv. As Moscow’s troops began targeting civilian areas in the early days of the invasion, millions of Ukrainians packed whatever belongings they could carry and headed for safer ground in what the U.N. has called the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. Many settled in western Ukraine, which has seen the least amount of fighting, but others — mostly women and children, as men of military age are not allowed to leave the country — have moved further across Ukraine’s borders. As of June 29, the U.N. refugee agency reported the cumulative number of crossings from Ukraine into neighboring countries had reached more than 8.4 million. But with the tally for the other direction at more than 3 million, more than one-third of those who have left may have returned to their home country. Most Ukrainians have crossed into Poland since the start of the war. Since Feb. 24, more than 4.3 million Ukrainians entered the country, in which many have opened up their homes to the refugees. But since Feb. 28, more than 2.2 million have crossed back to Ukraine. Other western neighbors who have taken in Ukrainians in big numbers include Hungary (more than 860,000 crossings) and Romania (more than 736,000 crossings). To Ukraine’s east, there were more than 1.4 million border crossings into Russia. While no data is available on how many Ukrainians have since returned to Ukraine from Russia or Hungary, Romania has seen more than 418,000 crossings back into Ukraine — a number that’s more than half that of the crossings into Romania since the war started. While the gap between those departing and those entering has been shrinking since March, it narrowed to its smallest size in May, when an average of 46,000 refugees departed and 36,000 refugees returned, according to U.N. data. The latest numbers, current as of Wednesday, show an average of 56,000 people leaving and 37,000 returning. This flow could change depending on the progress on the battlefield. Ukraine’s eastern region of the Donbas has seen the most intense fighting as Moscow tries to get full control of the area in what many observers say is turning into a war of attrition, with the Russian forces continuing to use heavy artillery to strike cities in the east and throughout the country. Fedosiuk said many of her friends who have returned to Kyiv from Poland and other countries were not forced to leave and had the means to stay longer, but the majority just wanted to come home despite the continued fighting. “It’s emotionally difficult to stay in another country for a long time,” she said. More importantly, Fedosiuk said, there is a great desire to be of use in Ukraine. “I think most people return precisely for the reason that we feel better here at home, even as there is a war going on,” she said."
2022-06-29,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/nato-invites-finland-sweden-join-putin-threat-ukraine-biden-troops-rcna35851,"NATO invites Finland, Sweden to join and eyes 'direct threat' from Putin amid Ukraine war","LONDON — Permanent American forces stationed in Poland, hundreds of thousands of troops on high alert, and a formal invite for two new Nordic members: If Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in part to ward off NATO, Wednesday made clear his war has achieved the opposite. NATO has now officially invited Finland and Sweden to join the alliance, a sign of just how dramatically the Kremlin's war has upended the previous military landscape in Europe. Earlier in the day, at the start of a summit in Madrid, President Joe Biden announced an increased U.S. military presence in Europe headlined by the first permanent American forces on NATO’s eastern flank and more rotating troops in the Baltic states. The Western alliance also called Russia its ""most significant and direct threat"" in a joint statement, a notable shift from its description of Moscow as a ""strategic partner"" a decade ago. Jonathan Eyal, an associate director at the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank, said these developments were prompted by a sense of alarm in Europe at seeing the Kremlin launch an unprovoked assault on a sovereign democracy. ""Now that the Russians have shown they are perfectly willing to invade a country and use force, the West cannot rely on the old system that said countries who were attacked would be helped later on,"" he said, referring to NATO's central Article 5 clause, which assumes allies will defend any member that’s attacked. ""You have to have the troops on the ground there and then,"" he said. ""So in that respect, it's an acknowledgement about how the security in Europe has changed."" Biden said NATO was sending an “unmistakable message” that the alliance “is strong, united, and the steps we’re taking during this summit are going to further augment our collective strength.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday the Madrid summit would chart a blueprint for the alliance “in a more dangerous and unpredictable world.” That blueprint appears to be designed around projecting greater strength in order to stand against Russia. The military club has undergone a marked shift these past four months, even as the conflict has presented new points of contention over sanctions against Moscow and support for Kyiv. For years NATO has been tortured by accusations, led by former President Donald Trump, that some member states are not pulling their financial weight. It has also struggled for a grander sense of purpose in a post-Cold War world. Russia's invasion four months ago changed all that, sending disquiet through the continent and prompting its nations to contribute an extra 200 billion euros (around $210 billion) for defense since then. That anxiety has been palpable in Sweden and Finland, two Nordic nations that for decades have practiced an official nonaligned status between the West and Moscow."
2022-06-29,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/turkey-sweden-finland-nato-membership-is-bad-for-us-rcna35786,Turkey allows Sweden-Finland NATO membership. That's too bad for the U.S.,"When NATO alliance members meet in Madrid this week, one of the featured agenda items is Finland and Sweden’s request to officially join the alliance. The NATO leadership has welcomed their ascension, with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg saying the two countries’ “membership in NATO would increase our shared security.” Though member state Turkey originally signaled it objected to the idea, it lifted its opposition after a breakthrough on Tuesday that clears the way for the Nordic states. While enlarging NATO might seem like a wise thing to do in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it doesn’t take much sober analysis to conclude that adding yet more NATO members is likely to have the opposite effect of what the secretary general hopes. Instead of lowering the chances of war, the membership of Finland and Sweden would increase the risk of future conflict for the entire alliance; adding two more triggers for Article 5 — the provision in the NATO charter that stipulates that an attack on one is an attack on all — would add to the risk of war for the entire alliance. That would be an unwise course in any case, but it’s particularly ill-advised given that it would make Finland and Sweden more vulnerable, as well. Russia poses no realistic threat to Sweden or Finland. Since World War II, Russia hasn’t exhibited the slightest interest in territorial acquisition in either country, and in fact, Finland and Russia were on friendly terms during the Cold War. In contrast, Russia was consistently and emphatically clear for 15 years that it regarded any NATO expansion along its border in either Ukraine or Georgia as an existential threat that it would use force to prevent — and in fact has done so twice (Georgia 2008 and Ukraine 2014). Thus Georgia and Ukraine had reason to fear a Russian attack. Finland and Sweden don’t. Extending NATO membership to these two countries wouldn’t only burden the U.S., which would be expected to go to war on behalf of these two Nordic states if they are attacked. It would saddle Helsinki and Stockholm with troubles, as well. Up to now, if a war ever broke out between NATO and Russia, both Finland and Sweden would have been protected by their neutral status. If membership were extended to both, that protection would be gone. If the two became NATO members and the alliance went to war with Russia in the future, both countries would be thrust almost immediately into an armed conflict whether they wanted to be or not — and even if their national interests weren’t otherwise threatened. Given their status as NATO members, the Kremlin would almost certainly attack airfields and ports in both countries to prevent other allies from using their facilities to stage attacks against Russia. But there is an even more fundamental reason to oppose expanding the alliance at present: It isn’t needed. Russia has exposed itself as being shockingly weak in conventional military power, and it is now clear, beyond any question, that Russian ground forces don’t even possess the capacity to invade the NATO alliance. It isn’t entirely clear that Moscow will be able to capture the entirety of the Donbas region, in the single country of Ukraine, directly on its border. Russia is constrained in its ability to project power beyond its country by systemic flaws in its logistics system. It is very difficult to get supplies beyond more than 180 miles away and virtually impossible beyond that without dedicated rail links. It is understandable that people who live near Russia would be afraid that one day Russia might invade them as it invaded Ukraine, and that, no doubt, led Sweden and Finland to make a sudden U-turn on their long-held preferences for neutrality. But an unemotional evaluation of their neighborhood shows their fears are misplaced. Sweden and Finland are at no clearer risk of an attack from Moscow than they have been for the past 70 years. Though the U.S. has also recently shown itself eager to expand the alliance to these countries, the accession of Sweden and, especially, Finland could hardly be said to further the American national interest. Finland shares a roughly 800-mile border with Russia that NATO would be committed to defend, and this defense — or the stationing of NATO military infrastructure in Finland — would risk antagonizing Russia. Washington should at least be clear that if Finland becomes a NATO member, it expects that the Europeans would be tasked with defending Finland’s border, as the U.S. itself is already doing too much for the defense of wealthy and capable European countries. None of this is to say that Russia doesn’t pose a danger to Europe, however. It does. But the nature of the threat isn’t conventional military power; it’s the massive Russian nuclear arsenal that could nearly wipe out the U.S. and Europe in an Armageddon-type scenario. Author Harry Kazianis participated in a 2019 U.S. government exercise in which NATO and Russia eventually came to nuclear blows during a Ukraine war scenario — and the study predicted that at least 1 billion people would be killed in the ensuing exchange (no matter who fired the first shot). The conventional Russian military has now been exposed as too weak to significantly threaten NATO in its current composition, and Finland and Sweden are under no apparent threat from Moscow if they remain outside the alliance — while the risk of nuclear escalation if they join could destroy our country and theirs. The U.S. has a great incentive to resist the knee-jerk emotional desire to expand NATO at this time. The risk to our national security is great, while the benefit is nonexistent. Related:"
2022-06-29,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/biden-seeks-united-front-nato-summit-deal-add-finland-sweden-rcna35718,"U.S. to boost land, sea and air power in Europe in response to invasion of Ukraine","MADRID — President Joe Biden on Wednesday pledged to boost American military operations in Europe as he seeks to project a picture of strength and unity among NATO members while they grapple with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Speaking on the first full day of the alliance's summit, Biden said the U.S. will deploy additional troops to Romania on a rotating basis and enhance other rotational deployments in the Baltic states. He said the United States would maintain a permanent headquarters for the U.S. 5th Army Corps in Poland, a move that was originally planned by the Trump administration. The U.S. will also send two F-35 squadrons to the United Kingdom, stage additional air defense and other capabilities in Germany and Italy, and build up naval operations in Spain, increasing the number of destroyers stationed there to six, from four. Biden said the moves were intended to make sure NATO is ready to meet potential threats from air, land and sea. The announcement comes as NATO leaders meet in Madrid in what could be one of the most consequential gatherings in the military alliance's 73-year history. ""In a moment when Putin has shattered peace in Europe and attacked the very, very tenets of rule-based order,"" Biden said, ""the United States and our allies are stepping up, proving NATO is more needed now than it ever has been, and it's as important as it has ever been."" Earlier this year, the U.S. sent 20,000 additional troops to Europe, bringing the total U.S. armed forces on the continent to 100,000. The Department of Defense declined to detail how many additional troops would be sent to Europe and where those troops would be coming for operational security and planning reasons, said Celeste Wallander, assistant secretary of defense for international affairs. Former President Donald Trump had announced in 2018 that the U.S. would open a military base in Poland. Troops were deployed there in October 2020 on a temporary basis; Biden's move on Wednesday will make that troop presence permanent, said a Defense Department official. ""NATO is strong, united and the steps we're taking during this summer will further augment our collective strength,"" Biden said. Biden was able to help get one contentious issue off the table before arriving at the summit, urging Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to drop his opposition to Finland and Sweden joining NATO. The three countries’ foreign ministers signed a memorandum Tuesday to confirm that Turkey will back Sweden and Finland’s NATO bids, removing the last clear barrier to their entry. Biden spoke with Erdoğan on Tuesday morning, encouraging him to “seize this moment and get this done in Madrid,” a senior administration official said. While the U.S. didn’t directly broker the deal, Biden tried “to help put a thumb on the scale to get this across the finish line,” the official said. Biden thanked Erdoğan for working with Finland and Sweden on the deal ahead of a meeting the two had Wednesday. The agreement to expand NATO and announcements about increasing the number of troops in the east are intended to greatly bolster the alliance's abilities to fend off any potential Russian aggression toward its member states."
2022-06-28,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/turkey-lifts-objections-finland-sweden-joining-nato-rcna35772,Turkey lifts objections to Finland and Sweden joining NATO,"MADRID — Turkey agreed Tuesday to lift its opposition to Sweden and Finland joining NATO, a breakthrough in an impasse clouding a leaders’ summit in Madrid amid Europe’s worst security crisis in decades triggered by the war in Ukraine. After urgent top-level talks, alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said “we now have an agreement that paves the way for Finland and Sweden to join NATO.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted Sweden and Finland to abandon their long-held nonaligned status and apply to join NATO. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had blocked the move, insisting the Nordic pair change their stance on Kurdish rebel groups that Turkey considers terrorists. Finnish President Sauli Niinistö said the three countries’ leaders signed a joint agreement after talks on Tuesday. Turkey said it had “got what it wanted” including “full cooperation ... in the fight against” the rebel groups. The agreement comes at the opening of a crucial summit dominated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden and other NATO leaders arrived in Madrid for a summit that will set the course of the alliance for the coming years. The summit was kicking off with a leaders’ dinner hosted by Spain’s King Felipe VI at the 18th-century Royal Palace of Madrid. Stoltenberg said the meeting would chart a blueprint for the alliance “in a more dangerous and unpredictable world.” “To be able to defend in a more dangerous world we have to invest more in our defense,” Stoltenberg said. Just nine of NATO’s 30 members meet the organization’s target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense. Spain, which is hosting the summit, spends just half that. Top of the agenda for leaders in meetings Wednesday and Thursday is strengthening defenses against Russia and supporting Ukraine. Biden, who arrived with the aim of stiffening the resolve of any wavering allies, said NATO was “as united and galvanized as I think we have ever been.” Moscow’s invasion on Feb. 24 shattered European security and brought shelling of cities and bloody ground battles back to the continent. NATO, which had begun to turn its focus to terrorism and other non-state threats, has had to confront an adversarial Russia once again. “Ukraine now faces a brutality which we haven’t seen in Europe since the Second World War,” Stoltenberg said. Diplomats and leaders from Tuekey, Sweden and Finland earlier held a flurry of talks in an attempt to break the impasse over Turkey’s opposition to expansion. The three countries’ leaders met for more than two hours alongside Stoltenberg on Tuesday before the agreement was announced. Erdoğan is critical of what he considers the lax approach of Sweden and Finland toward groups that Ankara deems national security threats, including the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, and its Syrian extension. American support for Syrian Kurdish fighters in combatting the Islamic State group has also enraged Turkey for years. Turkey has demanded that Finland and Sweden extradite wanted individuals and lift arms restrictions imposed after Turkey’s 2019 military incursion into northeast Syria. Ending the deadlock will allow NATO leaders to focus on their key issue: an increasingly unpredictable and aggressive Russia. A Russian missile strike Monday on a shopping mall in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk was a grim reminder of the war’s horrors. Some saw the timing, as Group of Seven leaders met in Germany and just ahead of NATO, as a message from Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is due to address NATO leaders by video on Wednesday, called the strike on the mall a “terrorist” act. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko traveled to Madrid to urge the alliance to provide his country with “whatever it takes” to stop the war. “Wake up, guys. This is happening now. You are going to be next, this is going to be knocking on your door just in the blink of an eye,” Klitschko told reporters at the summit venue. Stoltenberg said Monday that NATO allies will agree at the summit to increase the strength of the alliance’s rapid reaction force nearly eightfold, from 40,000 to 300,000 troops. The troops will be based in their home nations, but dedicated to specific countries on NATO’s eastern flank, where the alliance plans to build up stocks of equipment and ammunition. Beneath the surface, there are tensions within NATO over how the war will end and what, if any, concessions Ukraine should make to end the fighting. There are also differences on how hard a line to take on China in NATO’s new Strategic Concept — its once-a-decade set of priorities and goals. The last document, published in 2010, didn’t mention China at all. The new concept is expected to set out NATO’s approach on issues from cybersecurity to climate change — and the growing economic and military reach of China, and the rising importance and power of the Indo-Pacific region. For the first time, the leaders of Japan, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand are attending the summit as guests. Some European members are wary of the tough U.S. line on Beijing and don’t want China cast as an opponent. In the Strategic Concept, NATO is set to declare Russia its number one threat. Russia’s state space agency, Roscosmos marked the summit’s opening by releasing satellite images and coordinates of the Madrid conference hall where it is being held, along with those of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin. The agency said NATO was set to declare Russia an enemy at the summit, adding that it was publishing precise coordinates “just in case.”"
2022-06-28,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/kremenchuk-shopping-mall-strike-ukraine-world-condemns-russia-attack-rcna35637,Russian missile strike on Ukraine mall condemned by G-7 leaders as Kremenchuk counts dead,"KREMENCHUK, Ukraine — Exhausted rescue workers picked through the smoldering rubble of what had been a busy shopping mall in central Ukraine on Tuesday, still searching for survivors after a deadly Russian missile strike once again left the country reeling and pleading with its international allies for tougher action. In this industrial city and across Ukraine, the attack relatively far from the artillery battles at the front lines was a jarring reminder that Russia's assault could arrive at their doorsteps at any time. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Moscow of carrying out “one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history” on the site in Kremenchuk, which he said was packed with hundreds of civilians. The death toll rose to at least 18 Tuesday, Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi told reporters, with nearly 60 others injured, including a child. More than 20 people were reported missing, Monastyrskyi said, adding that most of the bodies had not been identified because they were so severely burned. More than 1,000 people were reportedly shopping or working at the mall when air raid sirens sounded, leading many to evacuate and helping to hold down the number of potential deaths. Still, hope faded that anyone else might be found alive, and global outrage mounted. Leaders of the Group of Seven nations, which include the U.S., condemned what they called an “abominable attack.” They wrapped up a summit focused on the war with a pledge to impose economic pain on the Kremlin and support Ukraine for “as long as it takes.” The shopping center strike and the accompanying images of fiery wreckage brought renewed focus to the severe civilian toll of the Kremlin’s war after weeks of updates on the grinding battle for control of eastern Ukraine. Cherry pickers and cranes picked up large beams as workers toiled through mangled metal and debris inside the charred ruins of the shopping center. A strong smell of fire permeated the space. Speaking to NBC News at the site, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said the attack will be investigated as a possible war crime. Yurii Ruseniuk, the head of the surgical department at a local hospital, said the facility had handled 26 of the injured from the shopping center. Ruseniuk said he treated three patients, two of whom were working at the mall. The other had simply stopped by to use the mall’s ATM when the attack took place. Oleg Kovalenko, 56, who works as a mechanic at the local train station, said he was walking to his daughter's birthday party through a park next to the mall when he heard a clap and a second sound that left his ears buzzing for hours. The shock wave made his head spin, and it took a moment for him to realize he had been flung from his feet by the blast. Kovalenko, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, said he had heard similar sounds before. ""Everyone was on the ground: One grandma fell over the bench, another one fell as she was chasing her grandchild,"" he said as he swept up glass shards close to the attack. ""All of them were alive but still lying on the floor or awkwardly crouching towards each other. I stood up and saw a column of black smoke rising."" The region’s governor, Dmytro Lunin, said it was “the most tragic day” for the Poltava area in more than four months of the war as he declared a regionwide day of mourning for the victims. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy denounced what he called “a calculated Russian strike.” The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed the strike but said it hit a legitimate military target in Kremenchuk on Monday, describing it as a depot that harbored weapons and ammunition supplied by the U.S. and its European partners. The detonation of the ammunition, the ministry said Tuesday, caused a fire in what it said was an empty and disused shopping mall nearby — despite accounts from survivors and the presence of worried families fearing their loved ones may be among the dead. Russia has consistently denied deliberately targeting civilians in Ukraine, but local residents highlighted that the mall could not be confused for anything else. Kremenchuk is an industrial city with oil refineries, heavy machinery and chemical plants. The Amstor mall was a popular gathering place for residents, a site where younger people bought the latest gadgets at tech stores and older folks walked laps in its interior. Its supermarket was considered the mall's crown jewel, offering products that were otherwise difficult to find during the war — meats, foreign spices, oils and rare liquors — which allowed residents to celebrate special occasions or break from tradition. Natalia Katysheva, 47, a chemist at a municipal water treatment facility in the city, was a frequent shopper at the mall. She said that the attack happened on her way home from work and that her bus dropped her off 200 meters from the site of the blaze. She and other riders watched as the smoke unfurled across the blue sky, smelling burning plastic and feeling the scorching heat emanating from the mall — even from that distance. ""You know when you visit the store often the shopkeepers start noticing you. Maybe you don’t know their names and they don’t know your name, but there emerges some kind of a bond between you when you frequent the store,"" Katysheva said. ""I was thinking about the people who were in Amstor at the time of attack. Maybe I did not know them like other people did, but I felt for them."""
2022-06-28,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/russia-ukraine-war-putin-new-weapon-food-rcna35629,"In Russia-Ukraine war, Putin has a new weapon: Food","Update (June 28, 10:50 a.m. ET): This piece has been updated throughout to reflect the G-7's pledge of $4.5 billion in aid to address the global food crisis. A frustrated Russian President Vladimir Putin is holding Ukrainian agriculture hostage. He’s blockading Black Sea routes, bombing silos and infrastructure and otherwise manipulating Ukraine’s consumption and sale of wheat and other staples. It’s clear that, in his desperation, he is prepared to employ a new instrument of war that could devastate civilian populations: food. Russia is attempting to remove a major source of Ukrainian trade and raise the cost of grain, while stepping in to provide purloined supplies to portions of the world desperate for wheat from whatever source. Thankfully at the G-7 summit on Tuesday, the U.S and Europe began to challenge Putin directly in his efforts to weaponize food. Leaders of the G-7 nations pledged to spend $4.5 billion to help alleviate the international food shortage fueled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. There is still no lifting of the Russian embargo or a stop to the hijacked loads of Ukraine’s grain that Russia has apparently been peddling to starving nations. But there will be far less motivation for Putin to withhold or purloin the vast stocks of grain that remain bottled up in mined Ukrainian ports or in silos that Russian missiles have attacked with impunity. The other prong of Russia’s weaponization of food is more malicious and complex — dribbling out precious grain supplies to willing, even eager nations, whose people may be on the brink of starvation. At the same time, countries threatened with famine will get more of the relief they need. Now, it will be up to countries across Africa, South Asia and the Middle East in particular to choose sides on what is suddenly a more level battlefield. These are the parts of the world most desperate for the bounty of grain found in Ukraine, one of the world’s greatest breadbaskets. For centuries, Ukraine has used ports on the Black Sea to transfer vast amounts of agricultural products to international markets, especially in Africa. Before the war, Ukraine accounted for 10% of the world’s wheat exports, 14% of its corn and half its sunflower oil. But Russia has blockaded Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, by either seizing them outright or mining them. At the same time, it has attacked vast stockpiles of Ukrainian grain sitting in those blockaded ports or elsewhere in packed silos and warehouses, awaiting shipment to parts of the world in dire need of these crops. Already, in the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv, two large grain terminals— one owned by Missouri-based Bunge Ltd., the other by Canada’s Viterra — were hit by Russia, whose missile strikes also targeted a bridge Ukrainian farmers use to reach a key Romanian port. The other prong of Russia’s weaponization of food is more malicious and complex — dribbling out precious grain supplies to willing, even eager nations, whose people may be on the brink of starvation. As many as 10 Russian-flagged bulk carriers have allegedly been pressed into service transporting stolen Ukrainian grain to ports including Syria and Turkey, according to an intelligence report from London-based Lloyd’s List using vessel-tracking data. This could total as much as 400,000 tons of grain. One of them, the Matros Pozynich, is among three ships singled out by the State Department as being involved in this illegal trade. During one recent voyage, the ship turned off its transponder, making its track impossible to follow. The carrier, believed to be filled with stolen Ukrainian grain, was then spotted by Maxar satellite imagery arriving and being offloaded in Syria. There have been allegations that Turkey, a NATO member, is trafficking in Ukrainian agricultural products, though Turkish officials have said they have found no evidence to back up this claim. Still, the Matros Pozynich certainly docked in Turkey. The Ukraine-based SeaKrime Project said other probes show that Russian ships carrying Ukrainian grain have unloaded in Turkey and attempted delivery to the Egyptian port of Alexandria. Unlike Turkey, Egypt refused entry, and the ship wound up in Syria. “Russia is shamelessly stealing Ukrainian grains and getting it out from the invaded Crimea,” claimed Kyiv’s ambassador to Ankara, Vasyl Bodnar. He wants Interpol to investigate. Still, any number of other countries are said to be willing to take grain supplied by Russia from any sources to feed their people. Reuters reported last week that Bangladesh is seeking to buy at least 200,000 tons from Russian sources. Earlier in the month, Senegalese President Macky Sall, chairman of the African Union, met with Putin at his vacation retreat in Sochi, in pursuit of grain shipments to Africa. Sall referred to the “strong, fraternal relations” between Russia and Africa. “We, the most feeble, what do we do?” Sall asked after the visit. “We are not truly in the debate about who is wrong, who is right. We want simply to have access to grain.” Indeed, pre-war, nearly half of all African countries were dependent on wheat imports from Russia and Ukraine. Last month, the U.S. alerted 14 countries, most of them in Africa, that Russia would be seeking customers for wheat it had plundered in Ukraine. Fortunately, the U.S. is doing more than warning countries against getting food from Russia. Rep. Greg Meeks, D-N.Y., chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, has introduced a bill to punish African countries that buy grain seized from Ukraine or side in any fashion with Russia. It passed the House 419-9 and is awaiting Senate action. For years, of course, Russia (as well as China) has been carefully cultivating Africa — doing business and building wealth both financially and diplomatically, while the U.S. has shunned much of the continent. That dynamic accelerated under former President Donald Trump, who relegated these nations to the single phrase “shithole countries.” That continues to smart. Europe, too, has ceded much of the continent to Russian designs. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in February that his country would pull its forces out of a large stretch of the Sahel, where it long maintained order in the face of accelerating jihadist activities as coups and other government action made their position increasingly untenable. They were replaced by the Kremlin’s personal mercenary force, the Wagner Group. With much of the continent now threatened with starvation, Russia offers grain. The West cannot allow Africa to take food from Russia. Though the G-7 chairman, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, invited Sall, as chair of the African Union, to be present as a witness in discussion of food security at the G-7 meetings, Sall’s leanings toward Putin suggest that diplomacy will not be enough. That’s why Tuesday’s announcement of billions in food aid was so crucial. It appears the West is starting to heed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s call, delivered as part of a video address to the G-7 earlier in the summit, for help in breaking the Russian stranglehold on grain shipments from his country. Beyond the aid, Britain and the European Union have shut Russia out of the Lloyd’s of London insurance market for ships carrying sanctioned Russian crude oil. Expanding that to ships carrying agricultural products should be next. On the other side of the equation, shunning Russia’s seductive proposals when your people are looking at mass starvation is an excruciating decision. With other food coming their way, these countries must understand they have no real choice but to turn toward the West. Given Russia’s pariah status, among other dynamics, siding with Russia is not a long-term recipe for growth and development in their countries. Russia has long been seen as an appropriate counterbalance to Western indifference toward Africa and other parts of the nonaligned world. But the West must engage with the continent and other nations in need of sustenance to remind them that a central cause of the food shortages they are suffering is Russia’s very actions. Nations in Africa, South Asia and the Middle East need to understand that their long-term interests do not lie with pandering to Russia’s militant aims but with opposing them."
2022-06-28,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/g-7-leaders-pledge-combat-food-crisis-russia-ukraine-war-blockade-rcna35636,G-7 leaders pledge $4.5 billion to combat food crisis stoked by Russia-Ukraine war,"TELFS, Austria — The Group of Seven nations on Tuesday pledged to spend $4.5 billion to address a global food crisis fueled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The commitment came as leaders of the world's major developed economies, including President Joe Biden, wrapped up a three-day summit in Germany focused on supporting Kyiv and combating Moscow. But Russian President Vladimir Putin's war has also stoked a growing global food crisis that has impacted vulnerable people from the Middle East to the Horn of Africa, with the United States and its allies accusing the Kremlin of deliberately using hunger as a weapon. Of the total committed by the G-7, the U.S. will commit $2.76 billion, which will come from the Ukraine aid package passed by Congress earlier this year, a senior U.S. administration official said. The funding will support efforts in more than 47 countries and regional organizations. “Putin’s actions have been at the core and the thing from which you can draw a direct line to all of the vulnerability that we’re seeing around the world in terms of food security,” the official said. “His actions have strangled food and agricultural production, and used food as a weapon of war.” Of the U.S. funds, $2 billion will go to immediate direct humanitarian interventions and $760 million will be used to help improve resilience and productivity of the global food system, the official said. ""We, the leaders of the G-7, will spare no effort to increase global food and nutrition security and to protect the most vulnerable, whom the food crisis threatens to hit the hardest,"" the leaders said in a statement Tuesday. While the leaders said addressing food shortages was a top priority at the meeting, they had no solution for how to get Ukraine's grain out of the country. “We’re working on it,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said when a reporter asked the leaders about a plan. Ukraine has been a major supplier of wheat, corn and sunflower oil for many of the world’s poorest countries, but its exports have ground to a halt as a result of a Russian blockade of Black Sea ports and the destruction of agricultural facilities and equipment. That has led to a surge in prices for those commodities, putting them out of reach for many lower-income countries. The U.S. Agency for International Development estimates 750,000 people are at immediate risk of starvation around the world as a result of the war in Ukraine. There have been widespread protests in recent weeks around the world over the soaring cost of food. In Ecuador, protests over the rising prices of food and fuel have ensnared the country’s capital for weeks and threaten to unseat its president. The pledge on food security came as the G-7 leaders ended their summit Tuesday, with Biden heading to a NATO summit in Madrid. The gathering focused heavily on coordinating the countries' assistance to Ukraine and efforts to put pressure on Russia to end the conflict, but China was also a major area of discussion during the three days of meetings. In the group's communique released at the end of the summit, the leaders criticized China for its military, humanitarian and labor actions. The leaders specifically called on China to press Russia to ""stop its military aggression — and immediately and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine."" At the same time, the leaders raised their own concerns over China's military activity. They said they remain ""seriously concerned"" about the situation in the East China Sea and the South China Sea and stressed there is ""no legal basis for China’s expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea."" Human rights abuses were another concern the leaders raised on China. ""We are gravely concerned about the human rights situation in China,"" the communique said. ""We will continue to promote universal values, including by calling on China to respect universal human rights and fundamental freedoms, including in Tibet and in Xinjiang where forced labour is of major concern to us.

More than 1,000 people were inside at the time of the rocket attack, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. “The number of victims is impossible to imagine,” he added in a post on the Telegram messaging app, sharing video that showed plumes of smoke rising above a building consumed in flames as people and first responders ran in front of it. The attack hit a shopping center in Kremenchuk, a city in the Poltava region on the banks of Ukraine’s Dnieper River. Serhiy Kruk, the head of Ukraine’s emergency service, said that so far 16 people have been confirmed dead and 59 injured. Standing inside the rubble of what was once a supermarket, Anton Herashchenko, an adviser for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, said rescuers were digging to find potential survivors. ""Rescue workers are underway to save people who just came to buy groceries,"" he said, lifting the camera to show dozens of people frantically shoveling and sawing in to the blackened debris."

The changes to the U.S. troop footprint could affect countries such as Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. To the extent that new troops could be deploying to the region more permanently, officials said the number would be minimal but that several hundred could remain in Poland on a more permanent basis. The White House declined to comment. Administration officials signaled before the trip that Biden could announce U.S. troop changes and that NATO allies could disclose changes in their force postures, as well. Biden is in Germany for the summit of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries and then heads to the NATO summit in Spain. Biden could also announce that the U.S. Navy presence at Naval Station Rota in Spain could increase by two ships over the next few years, officials said. The potential announcements would follow a new $450 million U.S. military aid package for Ukraine, which the administration made public Thursday, and plans for the administration to provide Ukraine with a new surface-to-air missile system. The changes in U.S. troop posture in Eastern Europe would also come amid questions about how long it will be before Ukraine and Russia determine it is time to negotiate an agreement to end the conflict. In a preview of the NATO summit this week, a senior administration official said leaders of countries that are part of the alliance “will announce new force posture commitments to strengthen NATO’s defense and deterrent posture.” “As we have seen in the last number of months, the United States was very quick to surge additional forces to NATO to reassure our allies, especially those on the eastern flank,” the official said."

The State Tax Inspectorate and Migration Department were also among the public agencies forced to suspend online services for several hours. They came online again later the same day. The incident came a week after Russian officials threatened to retaliate because Lithuania restricted the transit of steel and ferrous metals under E.U. sanctions. The ban on goods under European Union sanctions was announced by Lithuanian authorities earlier this month and prompted a flurry of angry retorts from Moscow, with the Kremlin denouncing the move as unprecedented and unlawful. Moscow has accused Lithuania and the E.U. of violating international agreements, threatening a “non-diplomatic” response. Local authorities in Lithuania had warned that cyberattacks were likely to follow. The ministry didn’t name the hackers but the Baltic News Service said the pro-Kremlin group “Killnet” had claimed the attack."
2022-06-27,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/nato-increase-high-readiness-forces-russia-ukraine-war-rcna35450,NATO to increase high-readiness forces amid Russia-Ukraine war,"NATO will increase the number of its forces at high readiness massively to over 300,000 amid Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday. “We will transform the NATO response force and increase the number of our high readiness forces to well over 300,000,” he told reporters ahead of a NATO summit in Madrid later this week. NATO’s quick reaction force, the NATO response force, so far has some 40,000 troops. At the Madrid summit, NATO will also change its language on Russia that in the alliance’s last strategy from 2010 was still described as a strategic partner. “That will not be the case in the strategic concept that we will agree in Madrid,” Stoltenberg said. “I expect that allies will state clearly that Russia poses a direct threat to our security, to our values, to the rules-based international order.”"
2022-06-27,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-defaults-foreign-debt-ukraine-war-sanctions-rcna35420,Russia defaults on foreign debt for first time in more than a century,"Russia has defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, as sweeping sanctions over its war in Ukraine effectively cut the country off from the global financial system and rendered its assets untouchable to many investors. Russia faced a deadline of Sunday night to meet a 30-day grace period on interest payments originally due May 27. Some bondholders said they had not received the overdue interest on Monday following the expiry of the key payment deadline. The Kremlin, which has the money to make payments thanks to oil and gas revenues, swiftly rejected the claims, and it has accused the West of driving it into an artificial default. The U.S. Treasury Department ended Russia’s ability to pay its billions in debt back to international investors through U.S. banks this year. A Treasury Department spokesperson told Reuters at the time that the action was meant to force Russia to draw down its domestic dollar reserves to further curtail its spending on its war against Ukraine. Russia says that any default is artificial because it has the money to pay its debts but that sanctions have frozen its foreign currency reserves held abroad. Russia’s Finance Ministry said it made the payments to its onshore National Settlement Depository in euros and dollars, adding it had fulfilled obligations. In a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the fact that payments had been blocked because of Western sanctions on Russia was “not our problem.” But Tim Ash, senior emerging market sovereign analyst at BlueBay Asset Management, tweeted that the default “is clearly not” beyond Russia’s control, saying sanctions are preventing it from paying its debts because it invaded Ukraine. Investors have expected Russia to default for months. Insurance contracts that cover Russian debt have priced an 80% likelihood of default for weeks, and rating agencies like Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s have placed the country’s debt deep into junk territory. Russia owes about $40 billion in foreign bonds, about half of that to foreigners. Before the start of the war, Russia had around $640 billion in foreign currency and gold reserves, much of which was held overseas and is now frozen. The Kremlin can still borrow rubles at home, where it mostly relies on Russian banks to buy its bonds. Russia hasn’t defaulted on its international debts since the Bolshevik Revolution more than a century ago, when the Russian Empire collapsed and the Soviet Union was created. Russia defaulted on its domestic debts in the late 1990s but was able to recover with the help of international aid. In normal circumstances, investors and the defaulting government typically negotiate a settlement in which bondholders are given new bonds that are worth less but that at least give them some partial compensation. But sanctions bar dealings with Russia’s Finance Ministry. And no one knows when the war will end or how much defaulted bonds could wind up being worth. In this case, declaring default and suing “might not be the wisest choice,” Jay S. Auslander, a top sovereign debt lawyer at the firm of Wilk Auslander in New York, told The Associated Press. It’s not possible to negotiate with Russia, and there are so many unknowns, so creditors may decide to “hang tight for now.”"
2022-06-27,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/zelenskyy-joins-g7-summit-allies-mull-moves-conflict-rcna35368,Zelenskyy joins G-7 summit as U.S. plans to send Ukraine new missile defense system,"TELFS, Austria — World leaders at the Group of Seven summit in Germany on Monday vowed to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes” after meeting virtually with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as the United States and its allies readied new efforts to aid Kyiv’s defense against Russia. Washington was preparing to send new military assistance while President Joe Biden and the leaders of the other major global economies sought to illustrate their long-term commitment to Ukraine’s cause by finalizing plans to pursue a price cap on Russian oil, impose new sanctions on the Kremlin and raise tariffs on Russian goods. The U.S. is planning to provide a medium- to long-range surface-to-air missile system for Ukraine that would increase its capabilities to combat Russian strikes from a further distance along with other security assistance, including additional artillery ammunition and counter-battery radars, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a briefing with reporters. The U.S. will likely announce the purchase of the system this week along with the other equipment, an administration official familiar with the plans said. Zelenskyy has been pleading with the G-7 leaders to speed the support they have pledged, increase the weaponry they are supplying and cut off Russian energy imports. His remarks to the group come as Ukrainian forces struggle to hang on to the key eastern region of Luhansk in the face of Russian forces' advance. Hours before the summit began Sunday, Russian missiles struck a residential building in Kyiv. During the meeting, Sullivan said Zelenskyy told the G-7 that he wanted “additional air defense capabilities that could shoot down missiles out of the sky” and that he believes the next few months will be crucial. “He believes that a grinding conflict is not in the interest of the Ukrainian people for obvious reasons,"" Sullivan said. ""So he would like to see his military and those in the West who are supporting his military and making maximum use of the next few months to put Ukraine in as good a position as they can possibly be in.” Following the meeting with Zelenskyy, the G-7 leaders put out a joint statement of support for Ukraine saying they will continue to provide defense and humanitarian assistance to the country and push to hold Russia accountable for its invasion. ""We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" the statement said. ""As we do so, we commit to demonstrate global responsibility and solidarity through working to address the international impacts of Russia’s aggression, especially on the most vulnerable."" While the heads of state intended to show a united front at the summit, diverging views have started to emerge among European leaders in recent months over whether or not Ukraine should cede some territory to Russia to end the war. In the statement Monday, the group said it will be up to Ukraine to determine how to resolve the conflict. ""It is up to Ukraine to decide on a future peace settlement, free from external pressure or influence,"" the group said. “Ukraine feels the support of the G-7 states. Thank you for your defense and financial assistance to our country in the fight against the Russian invasion,” Zelenskyy said in a statement posted by his office after his video address. “For us, the consistent position of the G-7 countries on sanctions is also important. They should continue to increase, in particular by limiting the price of oil exported by the aggressor.”"
2022-06-27,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/sri-lanka-sends-2-ministers-russia-oil-fuel-shortages-rcna35427,Sri Lanka sends 2 ministers to Russia for oil amid fuel shortages,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka is sending two ministers to Russia to negotiate for fuel, one of the necessities that the South Asian island nation has almost run out of amid its ongoing economic crisis. Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said two ministers were scheduled to leave for Russia on Monday to continue in-person talks that Sri Lanka has been having with Russian authorities to directly purchase fuel, among other related issues. He urged people Saturday not to line up for fuel, saying new shipments would be delayed due to “banking and logistics reasons.” Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics He said limited stocks of fuel would be distributed to limited stations throughout next week. He said until the next shipments arrive, “public transport, power generators and industries will be given a priority.” Residents have had to line up for hours and sometimes days to get fuel, sometimes resorting to burning charcoal or palm fronds for cooking. Wijesekera’s comments come while a high-level U.S. delegation is visiting Sri Lanka, seeking ways to help the island nation cope with an unprecedented economic crisis and severe shortages of essential supplies. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, global oil prices have skyrocketed. While Washington and its allies are trying to cut financial flows supporting Moscow’s war effort, Russia is offering its crude at a steep discount, making it extremely enticing to a number of countries. Like some other South Asian nations, Sri Lanka has remained neutral on the war in Europe. However, Wijesekera said the foreign ministry and the Sri Lankan ambassador in Russia have been making arrangements for a fuel sale. “There is an advantage for us if we cold buy oil directly from the Russian government or the Russian firms. There are talks going on,” he told reporters Sunday. The shortages have led to protests against the government, recently to demand fuel. Sri Lanka says it’s unable to repay $7 billion in foreign debt due this year, pending the outcome of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on a rescue package. It must pay $5 billion on average annually until 2026. Authorities have asked the IMF to lead a conference to unite Sri Lanka’s lenders. Last month, the country bought a 99,000-ton shipment of Russian crude to restart its only refinery, Wijesekera said. In an interview with the Associated Press in mid-June, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka would be compelled to buy oil from Russia, adding that his country desperately needs fuel, and was trying to get oil and coal from the country’s traditional suppliers in the Middle East. “If we can get from any other sources, we will get from there. Otherwise (we) may have to go to Russia again,” he said. Wickremesinghe also said last week that the state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation was $700 million in debt and as a result, no country or organization was willing to provide fuel. Protesters have occupied the entrance to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s office for more than two months demanding his resignation, saying the primary responsibility for the crisis rests with him and his family, whom they accuse of corruption and mismanagement. The U.S. delegation led by Robert Kaproth, deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury for Asia, and Kelly Keiderling, deputy assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, began its visit Sunday and is scheduled to meet top Sri Lankan officials during their stay until Wednesday."
2022-06-26,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-strikes-kyiv-troops-consolidate-gains-east-rcna35370,2 reported killed as Russian missiles strike Kyiv for first time in weeks,"Russia attacked the Ukrainian capital in the early hours of Sunday, striking at least two residential buildings, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said, as elsewhere Russian troops consolidated their gains in the east. Klitschko said the missiles hit at least two residential buildings, and President Volodymr Zelenskyy said a 37-year-old man was killed and his 7-year-old daughter and wife were injured. Associated Press journalists saw emergency workers battling flames and rescuing civilians. The strikes also damaged a nearby kindergarten, where a crater pocked the courtyard. President Joe Biden said the attacks were “barbarism” after he arrived in Germany for a Group of Seven summit. Later Sunday, a local official reported a second death, telling the Unian news agency that a railroad worker was killed and several others were injured while servicing rail infrastructure. Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said the missiles, the first air-launched weapons to have successfully targeted the capital since June 5, were Kh-101 cruise missiles fired from warplanes over the Caspian Sea, more than 930 miles away. Klitschko told journalists that he believed “it is maybe a symbolic attack” ahead of this week’s NATO summit in Madrid. “Russia is saying: ‘We can do this all day long. You guys are powerless to stop us,’” said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commanding general of U.S. Army forces in Europe. “The Russians are humiliating the leaders of the West.” President Joe Biden, asked for his reaction, said, “It’s more of their barbarism,” as he stood with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz as he greeted leaders arriving to open the Group of Seven summit. Biden also said the U.S. and other G7 nations intend to announce a ban on imports of gold from Russia. They hope the measure will further isolate Russia economically. Senior Biden administration officials said gold is Moscow’s second largest export after energy and that banning imports would make it more difficult for Russia to participate in global markets. Zelenskyy, speaking in his nightly video address, appealed to the G-7 leaders for more help, saying stopping Russian aggression “is possible only if we get everything we ask for and in the time we need it — weapons, financial support and sanctions against Russia.” A Ukrainian Parliament member, Oleksiy Goncharenko, wrote on the Telegram messaging app that preliminary information indicated that Russia launched 14 missiles toward the capital region and Kyiv itself. Zelenskyy said some were intercepted, and he vowed revenge against “all pilots, dispatchers, technicians and other people who ensure the launch of missiles in Ukraine.” “We will find you all. Each of you will be responsible for these blows,” Zelenskyy vowed. “And if someone thinks he will evade responsibility by saying that this was an order, you are wrong. When your missiles hit homes, it’s a war crime. The court is what awaits you all. And you will not hide anywhere — neither on the shores of the Caspian Sea, over which your missiles are launched, nor in Belarus ... nowhere.” In a phone interview, Hodges, the retired U.S. general, told The Associated Press that Russia has a limited stock of precision missiles and that “if they are using them, it’s going to be for a special purpose,” Russia has denied targeting civilians during the four-month war, and Hodges said it was hard to know whether the missiles launched Sunday were intended to strike the apartments buildings. Meanwhile, Russian forces have been seeking to swallow up the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in the eastern Luhansk region, pressing their momentum after taking full control Saturday of the charred ruins of Sievierodonetsk and the chemical plant where hundreds of Ukrainian troops and civilians had been holed up. Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region, which includes Sievierodonetsk, said Sunday that Russia was conducting intense airstrikes on the adjacent city of Lysychansk, destroying its television tower and seriously damaging a road bridge. “There’s very much destruction — Lysychansk is almost unrecognizable,” he wrote on Facebook. His comments came after Russia also launched dozens of missiles on several areas across the country far from the heart of the eastern battles. Some of the missiles were fired from Russian long-range Tu-22 bombers deployed from Belarus for the first time, Ukraine’s air command said. The bombardment preceded a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, during which Putin announced that Russia planned to supply Belarus with the Iskander-M missile system. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said late Saturday that Russian and Moscow-backed separatist forces now control Sievierodonetsk and the villages surrounding it. He said the attempt by Ukrainian forces to turn the Azot plant into a “stubborn center of resistance” had been thwarted. Haidai confirmed Saturday that Sievierodonetsk had fallen to Russian and separatist fighters, who he said were now trying to blockade Lysychansk from the south. Russia’s Interfax news agency quoted a spokesman for the separatist forces, Andrei Marochko, as saying Russian troops and separatist fighters had entered Lysychansk and that fighting was taking place in the heart of the city. There was no immediate comment on the claim from the Ukrainian side. Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk have been the focal points of a Russian offensive to capture all of the Donbas and destroy the Ukrainian military defending it — the most capable and battle-hardened segment of the country’s armed forces. Capturing Lysychansk would give Russian forces control of every major settlement in the province, a significant step toward Russia’s aim of capturing the entire Donbas. The Russians and separatists control about half of Donetsk, the second province in the Donbas."

The retreat from Sievierodonetsk, if confirmed, would bring Moscow close to full control of Luhansk, with Ukrainian troops in the province largely holding out only in Sievierodonetsk’s twin city Lysychansk, across the Siverskyi Donets river. “Unfortunately, they have almost left the city,” Mayor Oleksandr Stryuk said on national television. He did not confirm whether a full withdrawal was underway after regional authorities said on Friday that Ukraine was set to withdraw its troops from there. Russia’s pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper said one of its correspondents had arrived in the Azot industrial zone of Sievierodonetsk, where Ukrainian forces had been making a stand in recent weeks. Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia’s Chechnya region which has troops fighting alongside regular Russian army units in Ukraine, said on social media on Saturday that Sievierodonetsk’s industrial zone and airport had been “fully liberated.” The capture of Sievierodonetsk would be likely to seen by Russia as vindication for its switch from its early, failed attempt at “lightning warfare” to a slower grinding offensive which relies more on long-range shelling. Moscow has recognized Luhansk and Donetsk as independent countries and demanded Ukraine cede the entire territory of the two provinces to separatist administrations. Kharatin Starskyi, the press officer of a Ukrainian National Guard brigade, said on television on Saturday that the flow of information about the withdrawal from Sievierodonetsk had been delayed to protect troops on the ground. “During the last (several) days, an operation was conducted to withdraw our troops,” Starskyi said. Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region, said Russian forces had attacked Sievierodonetsk’s industrial zone on Friday and also attempted to enter and blockade Lysychansk. Elsewhere in Ukraine, governors of western and northern regions reported multiple missile attacks, indicating that Russia was not limiting its assault to eastern territories. “48 cruise missiles. At night. Throughout whole Ukraine,” Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter. “Russia is still trying to intimidate Ukraine, cause panic and make people be afraid.” The governor of Lviv region in western Ukraine, Maxim Kozytskyi, said in a video posted online that six missiles were fired from the Black Sea at the Yavoriv base near the border with Poland. Four hit the target but two were destroyed. In the north, Vitaliy Bunechko, governor of the Zhytomyr region, said strikes on a military target killed at least one soldier, adding that nearly 10 missiles had been intercepted and destroyed. In the south, Oleksandr Senkevych, mayor of Mykolaiv near the Black Sea, said five cruise missiles hit the city and nearby areas on Saturday. The number of casualties was being clarified. Reuters was not able to independently confirm the various reports. Russia denies targeting civilians. Kyiv and the West say Russian forces have committed war crimes against civilians. Ukraine’s top general Valeriy Zaluzhnyy wrote on the Telegram app on Saturday that U.S.-supplied HIMARS rocket systems are now working and hitting targets in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine. Leaders of the Group of Seven rich democracies are expected to demonstrate long-term support for Ukraine and discuss how to tighten the screws on Russia at a three day summit in Germany starting on Sunday. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who will take part, said he feared Ukraine could face pressure to agree a peace deal with Russia and that the consequences of Putin getting his way in Ukraine would be dangerous to international security. In a major sign of support, European Union leaders this week approved Ukraine’s formal candidacy to join the bloc — a decision that Russia said on Friday amounted to the E.U.’s “enslaving” of neighboring countries."
2022-06-24,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/zelenskyy-return-americans-captured-fighting-russia-war-rcna35139,Zelenskyy pledges to fight for return of Americans captured by Russia to their families,"KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed to fight for the release of two American military veterans captured in Ukraine, telling NBC News on Friday the men were “heroes.” Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, were reported missing last week while fighting in eastern Ukraine. The Kremlin has not confirmed where the men are being held but has refused to rule out the death penalty. “What can I say? They are heroes, and for me they are the same like Ukrainians because they give the main things they had: their lives,” Zelenskyy said in an interview as part of the Aspen Ideas Festival, of which NBCUniversal News Group is the media partner. Zelenskyy was not suggesting the men have been killed. “I’m sure we’ll fight for them and get them back, and of course they will come back to their families,” he said in the interview, the full version of which will air at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Tuesday. He added, “To me, it is a great honor that in the world there are some soldiers that are not afraid, and they came to support us and our sovereignty and independence.” Earlier this week, Dmitry Peskov, spokesman to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said in an interview that he could not rule out the American veterans getting the same treatment as two British citizens and a Moroccan, who were sentenced to death by Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine this month. The White House views the comments as “appalling” and “alarming,” said John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications. He said U.S. officials are still seeking more information about the detained Americans and are in touch with their families. Zelenskyy has gone from being the president of an eastern European country to a world leader whose words resonate globally. His leadership style is lauded as one of the reasons for Ukraine’s early successes against the Russian war machine, putting iron in the spine of front-line troops who were able to push back the Kremlin’s initially botched invasion. On Thursday the Ukrainian president touted a political victory as European Union leaders approved his country’s official status as a candidate to join the bloc. Zelenskyy called it “a unique and historic moment” and said that “Ukraine’s future is in the E.U.” But in recent weeks, Russia has had far more success focusing its military efforts on eastern Ukraine, where it has gained ground and subjected Ukraine to heavy losses in the fight for the Donbas. Richard Engel reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Alexander Smith reported from London."

The regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, previously said troops defending Sievierodonetsk would “fight for every inch.” But they had been pinned back to a factory on the edge of the city and battered by Russian artillery. Early Friday, he conceded the battle was lost and said Ukrainian troops would have to pull back. “Unfortunately, we will have to withdraw our servicemen from Sievierodonetsk because it makes no sense to be in broken positions,” he wrote in a post on the messaging app Telegram. “The number of dead is growing.” In a post on Twitter, he said that the troops ""will move away from the city to new, more fortified positions."""
2022-06-23,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-candidate-status-european-union-membership-putin-rcna35062,Ukraine granted candidate status for European Union membership in blow to Putin,"The European Union has agreed to make Ukraine a candidate for membership of the bloc, setting in motion a potentially yearslong process that could pull the embattled country further away from Russia’s influence and bind it more closely to the West. Ukraine applied for E.U. membership less than a week after Moscow invaded on Feb. 24. The decision by the leaders of the 27-nation bloc to grant Ukraine candidate status Thursday was uncharacteristically rapid for the E.U. But the war and Ukraine’s request for fast-track consideration lent urgency to its cause. The E.U. also granted candidate status to Moldova, which borders Ukraine. Gaining membership could take years or even decades. Countries must meet a detailed host of economic and political conditions, including a commitment to the rule of law and other democratic principles. Ukraine will have to curb government corruption and adopt other reforms. “It will strengthen Ukraine, it will strengthen Europe. It is a decision for freedom and democracy and puts us on the right side of history,” European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said ahead of the announcement. His comments came after it passed a resolution that called on governments to “move without delay” and “live up to their historical responsibility.” The E.U.’s nations have been united in backing Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion with money and weapons, adopting unprecedented economic sanctions against the Kremlin. E.U. candidate status doesn’t give an automatic right to join the bloc and does not provide any immediate security guarantees. Once a country gains membership, however, it is covered under an E.U. treaty clause that says if a member falls victim to armed aggression, the other E.U. countries are obligated to assist it by all the means in their power. The main benefits of E.U. membership, though, are economic, since it gives access to a market of 450 million consumers with free movement of labor, goods, services and capital. Ukraine has long aspired to join NATO, too, but the military alliance is not about to offer an invitation, in part because of governmental corruption, shortcomings in the country’s defense establishment, and its contested borders. Before the war, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that Ukraine never be allowed to join NATO, which he has condemned for its eastward spread toward Russia’s flank. But earlier this month, he did not seem bothered by Ukraine’s determination to get closer to the E.U., saying it is not a military pact and thus “we have no objections.”"
2022-06-23,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-casualties-spike-frustration-rcna33268,Ukrainian frustration grows as casualties spike and Russia takes more territory,"KYIV, Ukraine — Russia’s invasion in February prompted a wave of public support for the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as millions of Ukrainians raced to help defend their homeland. Four months later — amid Russian advances and spiking casualties — anger and frustration over the handling of the war is swelling. In interviews with Ukrainians who have family members fighting the invaders, many said they were upset with the military leadership for deploying inexperienced people to the front lines, and at times sending them into battle without as much as a medical or a psychological examination. “I am ready to protest,” said Viktoriia Bilan-Rashchuk, 43, of Kyiv, whose husband, Volodymyr, a theater actor with no previous military experience, is fighting on the eastern front line in Sievierodonetsk. Last month, she said, she sent his unit protective headphones — standard military equipment used to prevent hearing loss for soldiers firing off rocket systems. “No one even taught him how to shoot.” Olena Zhabyak-Sheremet “The government isn’t doing enough to support them. The longer this goes on, the more people will become upset,” Bilan-Rashchuk said in Ukrainian, speaking through a translator. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Since Russia invaded in February, thousands of Ukrainians with no military background have volunteered to fight. To boost its war efforts, the Ukrainian government has also banned men ages 18 to 60 from leaving the country in case it needs to start a draft. In May, Zelenskyy said the country’s military had 700,000 service members, including women. Through a relentless campaign of appearances, interviews and statements, Zelenskyy has fought to keep morale high among troops and the general public and plead the country’s case to the international community. But Russian artillery attacks have intensified in the east in recent months, pushing the Ukrainian military death toll to between 100 and 200 soldiers a day in combat, with another 500 injured every day, according to Ukrainian officials, the BBC reported earlier this month. In his daily address June 14, Zelenskyy called the losses “painful” but said Ukrainians “have to hold on.” Despite the high death toll, Ukrainian officials have maintained that troops are well taken care of, with sufficient training, food, equipment and rest. But as the war grinds on, what makes some Ukrainians especially angry is the lack of basic military equipment for those on the front lines. Some military families have been forced to organize donation drives to send medical supplies and military equipment to the front lines. Svitlana Lukianenko, whose husband worked as a sales manager before the war but is now fighting near Sievierodonetsk, worries the Ukrainian military is not replacing the dead and injured soldiers fast enough, leaving her husband at greater risk with each passing day. “The government needs to mobilize more people, but they also need to train them. There’s not enough training, and it’s a big problem,” she said. “That’s why we have such a high death toll.” “We are angry for them,” Lukianenko added. Zelenskyy has also dismissed reports that some front-line troops had poor protective equipment. “The reports I receive are significantly different from what is discussed by society,” he said in the same address. “Today, everyone in the areas of hostilities must have everything they need to protect themselves,” he said. “The state provides such supplies.” Luiza Dorner, 25, of Kyiv, whose husband is fighting in the Donbas region, said statements from Zelenskyy and other government officials have started to ring hollow. When she talks to her husband on the phone, she said, she can hear the fear and exhaustion in his voice."
2022-06-22,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/russian-cyberspying-targets-42-ukraine-allies-microsoft-says-rcna34856,"Russian cyberspying targets 42 Ukraine allies, Microsoft says","Coinciding with unrelenting cyberattacks against Ukraine, state-backed Russian hackers have engaged in “strategic espionage” against governments, think tanks, businesses and aid groups in 42 countries supporting Kyiv, Microsoft said in a report Wednesday. “Since the start of the war, the Russian targeting (of Ukraine’s allies) has been successful 29 percent of the time,” Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote, with data stolen in at least one-quarter of the successful network intrusions, “As a coalition of countries has come together to defend Ukraine, Russian intelligence agencies have stepped up network penetration and espionage activities targeting allied governments outside Ukraine,” Smith said. Nearly two-thirds of the cyberespionage targets involved NATO members. The United States was the prime target and Poland, the main conduit for military assistance flowing to Ukraine, was No. 2. In the past two months, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden and Turkey have seen stepped-up targeting, A striking exception is Estonia, where Microsoft said it has detected no Russian cyberintrusions since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. The company credited Estonia’s adoption of cloud computing, where it’s easier to detect intruders. “Significant collective defensive weaknesses remain” among some other European governments, Microsoft said, without identifying them. Half of the 128 organizations targeted are government agencies and 12% are nongovernmental agencies, typically think tanks or humanitarian groups, according to the 28-page report. Other targets include telecommunications, energy and defense companies. Microsoft said Ukraine’s cyber defenses “have proven stronger” overall than Russia’s capabilities in “waves of destructive cyberattacks against 48 distinct Ukrainian agencies and enterprises.” Moscow’s military hackers have been cautious not to unleash destructive data-destroying worms that could spread outside Ukraine, as the NotPetya virus did in 2017, the report noted. “During the past month, as the Russian military moved to concentrate its attacks in the Donbas region, the number of destructive attacks has fallen,” according to the report, “Defending Ukraine: Early Lessons from the Cyber War.” The Redmond, Washington, company has unique insight in the domain due to the ubiquity of its software and threat detection teams. Microsoft said Ukraine has also set an example in data safeguarding. Ukraine went from storing its data locally on servers in government buildings a week before the Russian invasion — making them vulnerable to aerial attack — to dispersing that data in the cloud, hosted in data centers across Europe. The report also assessed Russian disinformation and propaganda aimed at “undermining Western unity and deflecting criticism of Russian military war crimes” and wooing people in nonaligned countries. Using artificial intelligence tools, Microsoft said, it estimated “Russian cyber influence operations successfully increased the spread of Russian propaganda after the war began by 216 percent in Ukraine and 82 percent in the United States.”"

In recent days, Russian forces have gained ground around Lysychansk, according to Ukrainian officials and Western military analysts, closing in on the city while fighting for full control of its battle-scarred twin, Sievierodonetsk. The advance puts Russia in sight of capturing or surrounding the last two holdout cities in Luhansk province, which, together with neighboring Donetsk, form the eastern industrial region of the Donbas, which has become the focal point of the war. This phase of the conflict has been marked by brutal artillery exchanges, with Kyiv urging the U.S. and its Western allies to send more of the heavy firepower it needs to counter Moscow’s forces."

The death was first announced in an obituary published in The Recorder, an upstate New York newspaper, with the slain American identified as Stephen Zabielski, 52, of Hernando, Florida. He previously lived in Cranesville, New York, the newspaper reported. According to the obituary, Zabielski was killed May 15 while fighting in the village of Dorozhniank, Ukraine. The obituary described Zabielski as someone who “enjoyed life to the fullest.” “He enjoyed hunting, fishing, & riding his Harley. Steve will be missed by all who knew and loved him,” it said, adding that he had worked in the construction industry for over 30 years. Zabielski is survived by his wife, five stepchildren, seven siblings and other family members. The State Department confirmed his death in a statement shared with NBC News. It said it had already been in touch with Zabielski’s family and provided all possible consular assistance. The State Department also repeated warnings advising U.S. citizens against traveling to Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion, which was launched on Feb. 24. It said that any U.S. citizens still in Ukraine should leave immediately. Zabielski is the second U.S. citizen killed in combat in Ukraine since the war began. Willy Joseph Cancel, a 22-year-old former U.S. Marine, was killed in April after agreeing to go to Ukraine as part of his work with a private military contracting company, his mother, Rebecca Cabrera, told CNN at the time. Cancel had gone to Ukraine in mid-March and was survived by his wife and their 7-month-old child, she said. Since the war began, a number of U.S. citizens have volunteered to fight alongside Ukrainian forces, joining volunteers from around the world. Earlier this month, two U.S. military veterans, Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, were captured by Russian forces while fighting in Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told NBC News in an exclusive interview that he could not guarantee the two veterans would not face the death penalty following their capture. Asked by NBC News senior international correspondent Keir Simmons if Drueke and Huynh could “face the same fate” as two British citizens and a Moroccan who were sentenced to death by Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine this month, Peskov said: “It depends on the investigation.” He said Drueke and Huynh were “involved in illegal activities” in Ukraine, firing on Russian troops. “Those guys on the battlefield were firing at our military guys. They were endangering their lives,” he said, adding that there “will be a court, and there will be a court decision.” However, he said he believed “they should be punished,” as he called Drueke and Huynh “soldiers of fortune.”"

The comedy star praised the Ukrainian president — himself a former comedian and actor — as a hero during the meeting, telling him: “You’re amazing.” Stiller visited Zelenskyy in his role as an ambassador for the United Nations refugee agency. It comes as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to force millions of people to flee the war-torn country, exacerbating a growing global crisis that has seen the number of displaced people pass 100 million for the first time on record. ""It's a great honor for me,"" Stiller, who was appointed a UNHCR goodwill ambassador in July 2018, said in video capturing the meeting. ""It's really wonderful, you're my hero.

The families of Drueke, 39, and Huynh, 27, reported them missing last week. The White House views the comments as ""appalling"" and ""alarming,"" said John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications. He said U.S. officials are still seeking more information about the detained Americans and are in touch with their families. “It is equally alarming whether they actually mean what they’re saying here, and that this could be an outcome — that they could levy a death penalty against two Americans that were fighting in Ukraine — or that they just feel it’s a responsible thing for a major power to talk about doing this as a way of signaling to the president of the United States and the American people,"" Kirby said at a press briefing. ""Either one of them is equally alarming. And that's why, again, we find it appalling."" Simmons interviewed Peskov in Moscow, where the government is cracking down on journalists and limiting what reporters can say under threat of imprisonment. Peskov said Drueke and Huynh were “involved in illegal activities” in Ukraine, firing on Russian troops. “Those guys on the battlefield were firing at our military guys. They were endangering their lives,” he said. “There will be a court, and there will be a court decision,” Peskov said. “They should be punished,” he added, calling Drueke and Huynh “soldiers of fortune.” The Ukrainian government said in early March that 20,000 people from 52 countries volunteered to fight with the International Legion of Ukraine after the government put out a call for foreigners to join its fight against Russia. It isn’t known how many are in the country now. Damien Magrou, a spokesman for the foreign legion, said he couldn’t “confirm or deny” whether Drueke and Huynh were with the force. Peskov also didn’t say whether the men were being held in Russia or by pro-Russian forces fighting the Ukrainians in the east of the country. He added that they weren’t likely to be covered by Geneva Conventions that afford protections to prisoners of war because they weren’t part of Ukraine’s regular army. Drueke’s mother said in an interview last week that her son wasn’t in Ukraine to fight and that he was there in more of an advisory capacity, while Huynh’s fiancée said they had talked about his going to fight before they got engaged in late March. On Friday, videos of Huynh and Drueke were broadcast by RT, a Russian state-controlled international television network, which reported that the two were being held captive by separatists. Peskov, who spoke with NBC News as Russia made gains in Ukraine’s east, said he had no information about Grady Kurpasi, the third former U.S. service member who has also been reported missing in Ukraine by his family. Peskov also denied that American WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was detained at a Russian airport in February after authorities there said she was carrying vape cartridges containing hashish oil, was being held as a “hostage.” He repeated the Kremlin’s claim that aggressive Western sanctions are having little effect on the Russian economy as Moscow refocuses on replacing restricted imports with domestic production. He also reiterated that NATO and the U.S. left Russia with “no choice” but to launch its operation in Ukraine after its security concerns about the military bloc’s perceived encroachment on its borders weren’t heard."
2022-06-20,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/ukraines-children-desperately-need-more-than-shelter-food-rcna34239,Why Ukraine's children desperately need more than shelter and food,"There are two things that Ukraine needs right now. First, this deadly war of attrition and destruction must end. Second, the younger generations of Ukrainians must be healthy, educated, resilient and ready to take on the enormous task of rebuilding their country. I can’t comment on what it would take to bring lasting peace to the region, though my friends with relevant expertise say it’s at least possible. But I do know a good deal about what Ukraine’s children and youth will need, starting right now. The tough reality is that the region’s health care and rehabilitation systems, its schools and social support capacities, which were stretched prior to the war, are struggling to keep up with needs. Since the war began, UNICEF estimates that nearly two-thirds of Ukraine’s children have been evacuated from eastern cities under siege to relatively safe havens like Lviv in the west of the country or outside Ukraine altogether in host countries, predominantly Poland. I traveled to the region in April and May, eager to see for myself what it’s like on the ground in this very grave crisis for millions of Ukrainian children. First on the agenda in Lviv was visiting a hospital caring for child victims of war. Even being a director of a pediatric intensive care unit early in my career didn’t quite prepare me for the level of pediatric trauma that I saw in a matter of several hours in that facility. I saw a 10-year-old girl with severe shrapnel injuries to her head and right shoulder. Her physical recovery was progressing, but she had seen her parents killed by Russian soldiers just outside their apartment building in a suburb of Odesa. I can’t begin to guess how or when her psychological recovery will happen. And then there were 11-year-old twins, beautiful kids who were among the scores injured or killed when, according to Ukrainian officials, a Russian missile hit the train station in Kramatorsk as people waited to evacuate. The boy had gone to get snacks for the trip and was essentially unharmed, but his sister lost both legs. Their mom had lost a leg and sustained severe injuries to her arm. These stories are heartbreaking, but just outside the hospital walls is a different set of challenges for the child survivors of the war that may actually sabotage Ukraine’s long-term future. Too many children are stressed, grieving and disoriented, and many have not been in school since the invasion began. Shelters for refugee children and families in Warsaw, Poland, and internally displaced children in Lviv are filled with kids languishing in unfamiliar settings. Most dads are off fighting, leaving moms struggling to keep up spirits and figure out how to provide basic necessities for the long haul, knowing that many of the cities they fled could well be uninhabitable for years, if not decades. To be clear, the staff members serving these families in both cities are wonderfully caring, but internal strength is not inexhaustible even for the most resilient mothers and children. Time eventually erodes the capacity of almost anybody to cope with persistent adversity. The tough reality is that the region’s health care and rehabilitation systems, its schools and social support capacities, which were stretched prior to the war, are struggling to keep up with needs. The Lviv region now needs to provide for the nearly 2 million internally displaced children and adults who have been sheltering there since late February. Warsaw alone has welcomed at least 300,000 Ukrainians, swelling its population by 17% in the past three months. While I am hopeful that the immediate priorities of food, acute health care, protection and shelter will be taken care of, thanks to humanitarian response organizations such as UNICEF, Save the Children, International Medical Corps and the like, how and where displaced Ukrainian children will get the mental health care they need is not clear. And what about educational continuity? Can the schools of Lviv or Warsaw and the other host communities accommodate the hundreds of thousands of children who have arrived from eastern Ukraine? In the refugee havens outside Ukraine, language barriers, not just available classroom space and the number of teachers, are yet another challenge. Internet-based distance learning systems, which children have been using during the war, can certainly help. But many kids do not have access to tablets or laptops. Even for those with the hardware, there is little evidence to document the uptake and effectiveness of distance learning as a replacement for in-classroom learning. As far as mental health support is concerned, every teacher, health care worker and political leader I spoke to in Lviv expressed concern that so many of the internally displaced children who are now being sheltered in the region have suffered psychological trauma. The children had fled in fear for their lives from Russian brutality, lost loved ones and friends, and missed the dads who were off fighting. Although the challenges facing Ukraine’s children are formidable, it’s worth reminding ourselves that they are not insurmountable. And in a Warsaw high school, I met Ukrainian teenagers who clearly were suffering in silence, already displaying evidence of post-traumatic stress, such as difficulty sleeping, disassociation from others and depression. A big problem with the inevitable disruption caused by war is that children who lose ground academically or suffer from persistent, untreated psychological trauma (or both) may have significant challenges to the possibility of leading productive, successful lives in the future. That’s a worry because once the war is over, in addition to the massive and costly need to physically rebuild Ukraine, all Ukrainians must be ready and able to assume responsibility for its recovery. Although the challenges facing Ukraine’s children are formidable, it’s worth reminding ourselves that they are not insurmountable. A new organization Ukraine Children’s Action Project, which I’ve co-founded along with my wife, Karen, is working with leaders in Warsaw and Lviv to think through strategies that can make a difference for children who, through no choice of their own, have been thrust into a world of disorientation, fear and stress. But I should underscore that these challenges must be met by international organizations collaborating with local efforts. I have met extensively with the mayors of Lviv and Warsaw, along with members of their administrations. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi is working on a plethora of impressive plans to accommodate the displaced Ukrainians who have sought refuge in his city. And the dynamic mayor of Warsaw, Rafal Trzaskowski, is determined to provide proper support for the Ukrainian refugees -especially children — who have settled there. So here’s what needs to be done going forward. To begin with, there is broad agreement that more teachers and mental health professionals must be identified and hired. However, all such professionals need to be fluent in Ukrainian and specifically trained to deal with children who have been psychologically traumatized. Second, every school-age displaced Ukrainian child must be enrolled in school or a good quality remote learning program. Ukraine Children’s Action Project will be supporting the development of special schools in Warsaw and Lviv designed to provide a full range of “wraparound” support (social services, counseling, nutrition and so on) for displaced children. In addition, supportive summer programs with the same mission as the specially designed schools would benefit many children. Finally, many children who have been evacuated to safety from war zones may have undiagnosed or undertreated health problems that interfere with learning. Such concerns include visual problems, behavioral issues and even hunger. The good news here is that the programs being used for the Ukraine Children’s Action Project are among the ones that Karen and I developed over 35 years as part of the Children’s Health Fund. In other words, we already have initiatives designed to identify and mitigate so-designated “health barriers to learning.” But does this remain an ambitious agenda? Yes. However, as the more immediate needs of Ukrainian children are understandably being prioritized, addressing their mental health and access to education will prove just as crucial. Ukraine cannot afford to lose a generation of children if it is to secure a post-war future of hope and possibility."

In Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region, which in recent weeks has become the focal point of Moscow’s attempt to impose its will on its neighbor, battles raged for the control of multiple villages, the local governor said. The villages are around Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, two cities in the Luhansk region yet to be captured by the Russians, according to Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai. Russian shelling and airstrikes on the industrial outskirts of Sievierodonetsk have intensified, he said. Haidai told The Associated Press on Monday that the situation in Sievierodonetsk was “very difficult,” with the Ukrainian forces maintaining control over just one area — the Azot chemical plant, where a number of Ukrainian fighters, along with about 500 civilians, are taking shelter. The Russians keep deploying additional troops and equipment in the area, he said. “It’s just hell there. Everything is engulfed in fire, the shelling doesn’t stop even for an hour,” Haidai said in written comments. Only a fraction of the 100,000 people who used to live in Sievierodonetsk before the war remain in the city, with no electricity, communications, food or medicine. Even so, Haidai said, the staunch Ukrainian resistance is preventing Moscow from deploying its resources to other parts of the country. The British defense ministry noted that the war is not going all Russia’s way, despite its superior military assets. Russian ground troops are “exhausted,” the defense ministry said in an intelligence report Monday. It blamed poor air support for Russia’s difficulty in making swifter progress on the ground."

Grady Kurpasi, 49, has not been heard from since April 23, the spokesperson, Don Turner, said Saturday, adding that the family want answers about what happened to him. When Kurpasi spoke with his family from Ukraine, Turner said, he was “in good spirits” and “felt like he was doing the right thing.” He added that Kurpasi, who did three combat deployments in Iraq, had traveled to Ukraine for “humanitarian” reasons. Kurpasi, he said, was “just trying to help people in any which way possible.” His family believe “there is a good possibility he is a POW right now,” Turner said, adding that they think he has already been moved from where they think he was working in southern Ukraine. Although the family say they have not gotten “substantial” updates from the State Department about Kurpasi’s whereabouts, Turner said they have been conducting their own research to try to track Kurpasi down using “open source networking and just digging and calling people and asking questions.” Asked what he would say to the Russians if they were holding Kurpasi captive, Turner replied: “I think what the family would ask is just give us an answer.” As to a message for Kurpasi himself, Turner said: “We know you are a strong bastard. Keep it up.” NBC News has asked the Ukrainian and the Russian defense ministries for comment. Kurpasi and two other U.S. citizens have been reported missing in Ukraine in a week. Andy Huynh, 27, and Alexander Drueke, 39, both from Alabama, were reported missing by their families last week. Huynh’s fiancée, Joy Black, 21, said Thursday that he is a former Marine who left the service in 2018. Drueke’s mom, Lois, said her son served two tours in Iraq, the last as a lead gunner in Baghdad in 2008-09. Videos of Huynh and Drueke were shown Friday on RT, a Russian state-controlled international television network, confirming their families’ fears that the men had been captured. The broadcaster said they were being held captive by the Moscow-backed separatist forces in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, The Associated Press reported. NBC News has asked the State Department for comment on Kurpasi’s case. A State Department spokesperson said Friday that U.S. officials were “monitoring the situation closely.” The spokesperson also reiterated President Joe Biden’s earlier call that U.S. citizens “should not travel to Ukraine due to the active armed conflict.” The U.S. has insisted that the Russians have an obligation to treat captive Ukrainian soldiers, as well as volunteers from other countries incorporated into the Ukrainian armed forces, as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions. But two British citizens and a Moroccan, whom Russian officials have labeled “mercenaries,” were sentenced to death this month by pro-Moscow separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine."

Andy Huynh, 27, and Alexander Drueke, 39, went missing near the northeastern border city of Kharkiv, Huynh's fiancee, Joy Black, 21, told NBC News Thursday. She said that one of his friends had informed her that the two got separated on a mission and did not make their rendezvous point. She added that Hyunh was a former U.S. Marine who left the service in 2018. Their fate was unknown until Friday, when the video was broadcast on RT, a state-controlled international television network, which reported that the two were being held captive by the Moscow-backed separatist forces in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Speaking from what appeared to be an office, Drueke sent a message to his mother, Lois, mentioning his dog, a mastiff called Diesel, before signing off with a wink. “Mom, I just want to let you know that I’m alive and I hope to be back home as soon as I can be. So, love Diesel for me. Love you.” Drueke’s aunt Diana Shaw told The Associated Press that the video included a keyword and a gesture that he had set up with her beforehand so she would know that it was indeed him and that he was OK. Lois Drueke told NBC News on Wednesday that she last time she heard from her son was on June 8. She said that Drueke had served two tours in Iraq, the last as a lead gunner in Baghdad in 2008-2009. A spokesperson for the State Department said Friday that U.S. officials had “seen the photos and videos of these two U.S. citizens reportedly captured by Russia’s military forces in Ukraine. “We are closely monitoring the situation and our hearts go out to their families during this difficult time,” the spokesperson said. “We are in contact with Ukrainian authorities, the International Committee of the Red Cross and with the families themselves.” The State Department spokesperson also reiterated an earlier call from President Joe Biden that U.S. citizens “should not travel to Ukraine due to the active armed conflict.” The U.S. has insisted that anyone captured must be considered a prisoner of war and be guaranteed fair trials and humane treatment. However, the Russian military said it considers foreigners fighting in Ukraine as mercenaries, and thus not protected as combatants under the Geneva Conventions. Moscow has not commented on the video. But Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Thursday that the U.S. had not yet contacted the ministry in connection with the media reports about “two American mercenaries detained in the suburbs of Kharkiv,” the state news agency RIA reported. There has been no word about a third veteran, Grady Kurpasi, who went missing while fighting in the Eastern European nation, according to a report in The Washington Post, which cited his wife, Heeson Kim. George Heath, a representative for Kurpasi’s family, told the newspaper that Kurpasi, 49. was last heard from on April 26, when he was tasked with holding an observation post in the Kherson region so civilians there could evacuate. This month three men, two from the U.K. and one from Morocco, were sentenced by a Russian-backed separatist court in Donetsk to be executed by firing squad. The three — Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Saaudun Brahim — had been captured while fighting for Ukraine and found guilty of working toward a violent overthrow of power, as well as of mercenary activities and terrorism. The Kremlin said Tuesday that it would be ready to consider an appeal by the U.K. over the fate of its citizens."
2022-06-18,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/big-sanction-big-russian-bank-still-operates-freely-global-economy-hel-rcna34123,Too big to sanction? A big Russian bank still operates freely in the global economy because it helps Europe get Russian gas,"Ukraine is urging the United States and the European Union to slap tougher sanctions on one of Russia’s largest banks, Gazprombank, which is still able to operate freely around the world because of its central role in Moscow’s gas trade. Ukraine’s government says the bank, which was set up to service Russia’s state-owned gas company Gazprom, is helping to bankroll the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine. “The U.S. and Europe should sanction Gazprombank, not just for its role in helping Russia accrue revenue from its energy sales, but because Gazprombank is directly involved in supporting Russia’s military, state-owned companies, and other institutions that are sustaining the invasion of Ukraine,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, told NBC News. Gazprombank, Russia’s third largest bank, has been spared the kind of severe restrictions facing many other Russian lenders. It continues to oversee transactions in dollars and euros, and remains part of the international SWIFT bank messaging system. The question of whether to tighten sanctions on Gazprombank illustrates the dilemma facing Western governments as they try to squeeze Russia’s economy in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. Europe still relies heavily on Russian natural gas, and uses Gazprombank to handle payments for its gas imports. Most European governments remain reluctant to penalize the bank and risk cutting off the flow of natural gas completely, Western officials and experts say. Ukraine has been pressing the U.S. to expand sanctions and has shared intelligence about alleged Russian actions with U.S. officials as part of that campaign. According to Ukraine’s intelligence services, Gazprombank handles the payment of wages to at least some Russian troops taking part in the invasion of Ukraine, as well as payments to families of troops killed in the war. Ukraine says there are also indications the bank is linked to purchases of military gear. In one case, a Russian military officer from a tank division operating in eastern Ukraine used Gazprombank to arrange the purchase of two drone quadcopters, according to Ukrainian intelligence reporting obtained by NBC News. Gazprombank, which has representative offices in China, India and in Europe, may also be involved in efforts to circumvent Western sanctions, possibly helping other entities gain access to foreign currency or enable the purchase of equipment that could be used for potentially military purposes, according to Ukrainian intelligence services. They have relayed those concerns to U.S. officials. The Russian federal agency that manages civilian foreign aid and cultural exchange, or Rossotrudnichestvo, has explored the possibility of using Gazprombank to arrange cash transfers to one of its offices in Portugal, according to the intelligence services. Rossotrudnichestvo did not respond to a request for comment. The Biden administration declined to comment on the information cited by the Ukrainian intelligence services. Gazprombank did not respond to a request for comment. A Department of Treasury official said the Biden administration is tracking Gazprombank’s activities and has not ruled out any future actions against the bank. “We continue to monitor Gazprombank to see if they are doing business with sanctioned entities,” the official said. “To date, I think we haven’t made the decision to place full blocking sanctions on Gazprombank,” the official said, adding that a range of options remain open. The aim of U.S. financial sanctions is “to deny Russia access to revenue they need to prop up their economy and build up their military industrial complex” and to disrupt supply chains for the country’s defense industry “in order to make it harder for them to project power today and to project power in the future,” the Treasury official said. Agathe Demarais, a former French treasury official, said Europe would be in “a tricky position” if Gazprombank were shut out of the international financial system. “The U.S. knows if it were to put Gazprombank under U.S. sanctions, it would cause huge issues in the E.U., it would send the eurozone into a deep recession, and it would create a big rift between the E.U. and the U.S. on the sanctions front,"" said Demarais, now the global forecasting director at the Economist Intelligence Unit. And the Biden administration is keen to avoid a clash with its European allies, she said. Some sanctions experts said Gazprombank might try to avoid risky transactions that could attract the attention of U.S. or European authorities and jeopardize its crucial link for channeling natural gas revenue to Moscow. Although Washington has not frozen the bank’s assets or blocked dollar transactions, the Treasury Department last month imposed sanctions on 27 of its executives. In February, the U.S. introduced sanctions on a Gazprombank board member, Sergei Sergeevich Ivanov, head of a Russian state-owned diamond mining company. He is also the son of a close Putin ally and senior Russian government official, according to the Treasury Department. In 2014, after Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, the U.S. placed limited restrictions on Gazprombank, banning U.S. banks from providing medium- or long-term financing to the lender. In Switzerland, financial authorities in 2018 banned Gazprombank’s Swiss affiliate from accepting new private clients, citing the bank’s breach of anti-money laundering rules and its failure to vet transactions. FINMA, the Swiss financial regulator, said it continues to monitor Gazprombank Switzerland but declined to comment further. “We can confirm that we are in close contact with Gazprombank Switzerland,” said Vinzenz Mathys, spokesperson, said. Last year, Europe relied on Russia for about 45 percent of its natural gas. Europe has reduced imports of Russian gas this year and the E.U. has set a goal of cutting the imports by two-thirds by the end of the year. But Europe remains heavily dependent on Russia’s gas and, this week, Moscow slashed deliveries of natural gas to Europe, prompting calls for conservation measures as governments prepare for the winter. Russian officials said the supply reductions were due to maintenance problems, but Germany accused the Kremlin of using energy as a political weapon. “Sanctions on Gazprombank would be equal to an embargo on Russian gas, which is now not in the cards,” said Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a Belgium-based think tank focusing on Europe’s economy. “The E.U. first needs to implement its embargo on Russian oil, which will start at the end of the year.” The E.U. plans to cut off 90 percent of its Russian oil imports by the close of 2022."

An unknown number of Americans, mostly with military backgrounds, have traveled to Ukraine to join the country's foreign legion and fight alongside Ukrainian soldiers there."
2022-06-17,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/russia-pressures-europe-slashing-natural-gas-supply-rcna34122,Russia pressures Europe by slashing its natural gas supply,"Russia has slashed the flow of natural gas to Europe in a move European leaders called a clear attempt to strike back at Western countries for their support of Ukraine. Russia on Friday reduced natural gas deliveries by half to Italy and Slovakia and cut off France entirely, marking a third consecutive day of gas reductions in a growing economic confrontation between Moscow and the West. Moscow had previously cut off all natural gas flow to Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, the Netherlands and Denmark. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the European Union joined the U.S. in imposing sweeping financial sanctions on Russia. But European governments have been bracing for economic retaliation from the Kremlin and officials portrayed this week’s squeeze on natural gas supplies as an effort by Moscow to exert political pressure and push energy prices up. Russia’s cuts prompted a rise in natural gas prices that were already high and led the German government to appeal to citizens to conserve energy. Short-term gas prices remained high on Friday, up about 50% since Monday at 126 euros ($132) per megawatt for month-ahead gas futures. “Every kilowatt hour helps in this situation. It is a situation that is serious, but not a situation that endangers supply security in Germany,” said German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck in a video posted Wednesday. Germany gets about 35 percent of its natural gas from Russia. Habeck said Russian President Vladimir Putin “is doing what was to be feared from the beginning: He is reducing the volume of gas, not in one go but step by step.” The Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom announced cuts to natural gas flows to Germany and Italy this week. To Germany, the company blamed the cut on maintenance repairs for the Nord Stream 1 pipeline under the Baltic Sea, saying needed equipment had been held up in Canada because of Western sanctions. But Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi dismissed the explanation, saying it was a political decision. “Both we and Germany and others maintain it’s a lie, there’s a political use of gas,” Draghi said at a news conference during a visit with German and French leaders to Kyiv. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called the cutbacks “blackmail (against) both individual countries and Europe as a whole."" Gazprom did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Europe has sought to reduce its dependence on Russian oil and gas, announcing plans to cut off 90 percent of its Russian oil imports and two-thirds of its Russian gas imports by the end of the year. The Biden administration has promised to help Europe secure more natural gas from U.S. exporters. European governments are buying gas on the spot market and trying to secure alternative sources, including importing liquefied natural gas from the United States and elsewhere. But Europe still has limited infrastructure to receive LNG shipments and a fire at a key U.S. export depot in Freeport, Texas, undercut U.S. gas export capacity and highlighted Europe’s vulnerable position, experts said. “Europe must not to be complacent and urgently scale-up coordination so the continent is prepared for a possibly difficult winter ahead,” said Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a think tank in Belgium."
2022-06-17,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-missing-veterans-andy-huynh-alexander-drueke-rcna34098,Fiancé of U.S. veteran missing in Ukraine: ‘I just want to get him home’,"They got engaged just before he volunteered to join Ukraine’s fight against Russia. Now Joy Black just wants to give “a big hug” to her fiancé, Andy Huynh, who went missing this month near the northeastern border city of Kharkiv and is feared captured along with fellow Alabama native Alexander Drueke, 39. Black, 21, from Huntsville, Alabama, said in an interview with NBC News on Thursday that she was “scared” for Huynh, 27, who she said was a former U.S. Marine who left the service in 2018. She said that they had talked about him going to fight before they got engaged in late March. He departed on April 8. “He’s doing what’s right because those people need help,” she said. “You can’t just sit idly by and just let these people suffer and do nothing about it. So, you know, I support him very strongly. And now I just want to get him home.” Black said she had an inkling something was wrong last Friday, although Huynh had told her he would be unreachable for two or three days and it was the second day of his mission. Although he “didn’t specify” what he was doing, she said he told her he would be “super busy.” On Monday she woke to a text from one of his friends asking her to call. “He told me how during an operation they got separated and that Andy and Alex did not make their rendezvous point,” she said. “My mom has this big pillow on her bed and I just fell on it and cried a lot,” she added. Drueke’s mom, Lois, told NBC News on Wednesday that she last heard from her son on June 8. “I wrote back, ‘Stay safe and I love you.’ And he wrote back, ‘I love you, too,’ and that’s the last I heard from him.” She said that Drueke served two tours in Iraq, the last as a lead gunner in Baghdad in 2008-09, and that he had never been married and had no children. “He asked, not my permission, but my blessing to go. And I said, ‘Well, Alex, as a mother, it’s my duty to keep my children safe. But I also want you to be happy and I know that, that this is giving you a purpose in life. I’m so proud of you for being willing to risk your life.’” Both Drueke and Black said that the two men did not know each other before meeting in Ukraine. The Washington Post also reports that a third veteran, Grady Kurpasi, has also gone missing while fighting in the eastern European nation, citing his wife, Heeson Kim. George Heath, a representative for Kurpasi's family, told the newspaper that the 49-year-old was last heard from on April 26, when he was tasked with holding an observation post in the Kherson region so civilians there could evacuate. If the men have been captured, they would be the first confirmed U.S. citizens to have been taken as prisoners of war in the conflict that began on Feb. 24 with Russian President Vladimir Putin ordering an invasion of its neighbor. President Joe Biden said Friday that the U.S. doesn’t know the whereabouts of the three men and urged others not to travel to the country. “I have been briefed, we don’t know where they are,” Biden told reporters Friday. “I want to reiterate, Americans should not be going to Ukraine now. I’ll say it again, Americans should not be going to Ukraine now.” An unknown number of Americans, mostly with military backgrounds, have traveled to Ukraine to join the country’s foreign legion and fight alongside Ukrainian soldiers there. Biden's comments came after Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Thursday that the U.S. had not contacted the Kremlin about the missing men. “We make all information about the fate of detained mercenaries or those sentenced to trial public,” the RIA news agency reported Zakharova as saying. This month two British men and one Moroccan man were sentenced by a Russian-backed separatist court in Donetsk to be executed by firing squad. The three — Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Saaudun Brahim — had been captured while fighting for Ukraine. While she waits for word on his whereabouts, Black said she was praying for her fiance’s safe return. “We really miss you and love you and I know you’re doing your best,” she said. “Stay safe and come home.”"
2022-06-17,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-economy-speech-ukraine-west-collapsing-russia-sanctions-rcna34062,"Putin attacks U.S., says Western order collapsing and Ukraine sanctions failed","A defiant Vladimir Putin declared Friday that the Western order was collapsing, brushing aside the economic and diplomatic fallout from his invasion of Ukraine in a speech the Kremlin billed as “extremely important."" The Russian president offered a wide-ranging denunciation of the United States and a defense of his financial policies but largely steered clear of discussing the war in his address to Russia’s showpiece economic forum, which was delayed by an apparent cyberattack. Putin argued that the era of America's global dominance was at an end and claimed that the sanctions ""blitzkrieg"" imposed on Moscow's economy by Washington and its allies had failed. ""The previous world order is finished — irrespective of all the efforts to preserve it, it's a natural way of history,"" he told the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, an annual business meeting launched in 1997 as a Russian alternative to the World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland. A situation with ""One strong power with a limited circle of countries [in support]"" was ""not stable,"" he said, adding that it was a mistake for the U.S. to have claimed victory in the Cold War and to have treated other countries ""like colonies."" Putin said the war in Ukraine, which he maintains was launched to protect Russian-speaking people in the country's east, was “the decision of a sovereign country based on the right to defend its security.” “All the objectives of the special military operation will be implemented, there’s no doubt about it,” he added. The U.S. has helped build an alliance to aid Ukraine's defensive war with military supplies while hitting Russia's economy with severe sanctions. Putin said his country was withstanding those efforts and pointed to increasing price inflation and energy costs across the West as evidence that those sanctions had backfired. Costs were rising in the West ""long before we launched the special military operation in the Donbas,"" he added, scoffing at the idea of a ""Putin price rise"" and sticking to his own narrow definition of the war that has now brought nearly four months of death and destruction to Russia's democratic neighbor. As he spoke, Russian forces were pressing their attacks on cities in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, an offensive that has seen Moscow's troops make painstaking gains behind a heavy artillery assault. But even with the battlefield advances, the Kremlin was dealt another diplomatic setback on Friday as the European Union's executive recommended putting Kyiv on a path to membership of the bloc. Ahead of the speech, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin's address would be ""extremely important,"" according to Russian state-run news agency Tass. But the speech was delayed by more than 90 minutes because of a DDoS attack in which hackers flood websites with traffic in an effort to disrupt their operations or knock them offline, according to Peskov. Because major DDoS attacks are usually conducted with a large number of hacked devices all visiting the same site in unison, it’s usually impossible to definitively say who’s responsible for them. But the IT Army of Ukraine, an international group of volunteer hackers endorsed by the country’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, had encouraged its members to attack the event in a post on its Telegram channel. It later posted headlines from Russian news coverage of the delay and posted in English: “You did a very good job today!” The forum’s organizers said that 13,500 people from 141 countries attended last year’s forum, which was held online due to the pandemic. Many nations have shunned Russian since it launched a brutal invasion of Ukraine in February — but Egypt is participating in the forum this year as a “guest country.” St. Petersburg has added significance for Putin. As well as being his home city, it is named after Peter the Great, the 18th-century modernizing but militant czar to whom Putin favorably compared himself to this month."
2022-06-17,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/eu-backs-ukraine-candidate-status-russias-war-brings-huge-shift-rcna34064,E.U. backs Ukraine candidate status as Russia's war brings huge shift,"The executive arm of the European Union recommended Friday that Ukraine be granted candidate status to one day join the 27-nation bloc. The promise of membership in a union created to safeguard peace on the continent holds deep symbolism for the nation at war. But it is only the first step in a process that could take decades. In another show of Western support, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrived in Kyiv to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to offer continued aid and military training, adding that evidence points to Russia “taking heavy casualties” in the invasion. His trip followed one a day earlier by the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania, who vowed to support Ukraine’s fight without asking it to make any territorial concessions to Russia. “We are with you to give you the strategic endurance that you will need,” Johnson said on his second visit to the country since the Feb. 24 start of the war. Although he did not detail the aid, he said Britain would lead a program that could train up to 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers every 120 days in an unspecified location outside the country The latest embrace of Ukraine by its European allies also marks another setback for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched his war nearly four months ago, hoping to pull his ex-Soviet neighbor back into Russia’s sphere of influence. The European Commission’s recommendation that Ukraine become a candidate for membership will be discussed by leaders of the 27-nation bloc during a summit next week in Brussels. The war has increased pressure on E.U. governments to fast-track Ukraine’s candidate status. But the process is expected to take years, and E.U. members remain divided over how quickly and fully to open their arms to new members. Support for Ukraine from Western countries — both political and military — has been key to its surprising success in the face of larger and better equipped Russian forces. Zelenskyy has also clamored for more immediate support in the form of more and better weapons to turn the tide in the country’s eastern Donbas region. Russia pressed its offensive there Friday, leaving desperate residents struggling to make sense of what the future holds for them. “We are old people, we do not have a place to go. Where will I go?” asked Vira Miedientseva, one of the elderly residents grappling with the aftermath of an attack Thursday in Lysychansk, which lies just across the river from Sievierodonetsk, a key focus of battles in recent weeks that Russians have nearly captured. After a series setbacks early in the war, including the failure to seize Ukraine’s capital, Russian forces have switched their focus to the Donbas, pressing a grinding offensive. In recent weeks, they have moved in on Sievierodonetsk and surrounding villages — the last pocket of the Luhansk region not yet claimed by Russia or its allies. “The Russians are pouring fire on the city,” said Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai. “It’s getting harder and harder for us to fight in Sievierodonetsk, because the Russians outnumber us in artillery and manpower, and it’s very difficult for us to resist this barrage of fire.” The constant shelling made it impossible for 568 people, including 38 children, sheltering in the Azot chemical plant in the city to escape, he said. Russian forces have destroyed all three bridges leading out of the city, but Haidai said it still had not been fully blocked off."
