2022-09-08,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/cia-director-burns-defends-declassifying-intel-expose-russias-actions-rcna46876,,"CIA Director William Burns said Thursday that the Biden administration’s decision to declassify some intelligence to expose Russia’s actions and plans in Ukraine has proven “effective.” Burns defended the administration’s unprecedented strategy of releasing intelligence reports on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying it has been carried out in a carefully calibrated way designed to protect intelligence sources. Decisions to declassify intelligence are “always very complicated ones,” Burns said at the Billington Cybersecurity annual summit in Washington, D.C. “But I think when President Biden has decided very carefully and very selectively to, you know, make public some of our secrets, it’s played a very effective role over the course of the last six months,” Burns said. The CIA director said he expected the practice to continue “if we make it the exception, not the rule because the surest way, I’ve certainly found in a year and a half now as director of CIA, to lose access to good intelligence is to be reckless about how you handle it.” Burns added that U.S. intelligence will continue to play a role in “ensuring that Putin fails in Ukraine.” Burns did not mention the current legal and political battle over an FBI search that found classified and sensitive government documents at former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The director’s comments came the same week that the Biden administration shared intelligence alleging Russia had turned to North Korea to buy millions of artillery rounds and that Moscow had orchestrated the forcible deportation of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to Russia. The accounts were the latest in a series of publicly released intelligence reports that the White House has released during the course of the six-month-old war in Ukraine, starting with U.S. warnings that Russia planned to invade its neighbor. The administration often has used the declassified intelligence to warn of possible Russian actions and draw attention to Russian military failings. The strategy has won praise from both sides of the aisle in Congress. At a congressional hearing earlier this year, Burns, a former ambassador to Russia, told lawmakers that “in all the years I spent as a career diplomat, I saw too many instances in which we lost information wars with the Russians.” Now, Burns said, “by being careful about this we have stripped away the pretext that Putin, in particular, often uses.” “That has been a real benefit, I think, to Ukrainians,” he said. At the cybersecurity event Thursday, Burns said the U.S. intelligence agencies had a clear picture of Russia’s invasion planning last fall, citing what he called Putin’s “sense of destiny and his appetite for risk.” “And nowhere was that sense of destiny or that risk appetite greater than on his fixation with controlling Ukraine,” Burns said. The CIA director, a career diplomat who rose to senior positions in previous administrations, said Putin misjudged Ukraine, wrongly assumed Washington would lose interest in Ukraine and was “profoundly wrong in his assumptions.”"
2022-09-08,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/blinken-makes-unannounced-trip-ukraine-nuclear-fears-rise-rcna46766,,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Ukraine Thursday for an undisclosed trip, his third visit to the country since Russia launched its invasion in late February. He landed in the country after an overnight flight and met with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, just hours after Ukraine’s military chief publicly warned of the threat of Russia using nuclear weapons in the conflict. Later in the day, Blinken met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who presented him with a special medal awarded to people for distinguished service of the state. During the meeting, Blinken announced a $675 million drawdown of U.S. arms and equipment for Ukraine, confirmed by a senior Department of State official earlier in the day. The 20th drawdown since September 2021, which Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin mentioned in remarks to allies in Germany earlier Thursday, includes additional arms, munitions and equipment from U.S. military inventories. Blinken also announced that the State Department is notifying Congress that it will make $2 billion available in long-term investments to strengthen the security of Ukraine and 18 other neighboring countries, including many NATO allies. ""In total, the secretary will announce $2.6 billion in additional security assistance for Ukraine and its neighbors today. These announcements will bring the total U.S. military assistance for Ukraine to approximately $15.2 billion since the beginning of this administration,"" the State Department official said. In the city of Irpin, located near Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv, Blinken shook hands and spoke with local leaders near bombed-out, deserted apartment buildings. Khrystyna Podyryaka, director of the National Police of Ukraine's War Crimes Investigation Unit, told Blinken that they were investigating 30,000 recorded war crimes, including 20,000 that directly involve the civilian population. Blinken reiterated the importance of holding Russia accountable and investigating war crimes. Blinken’s visit comes on the heels of a call last month with Kuleba, in which he reinforced U.S. support for Ukraine’s defense needs. President Joe Biden later announced a $3 billion package to train and equip Ukrainian armed forces. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has mocked the West’s response to the war, saying Wednesday that his nation had “not lost anything” amid a host of sanctions that targeted elites and services that helped finance the ongoing invasion. Ukraine also faces nuclear concerns regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest. On Wednesday, Ukraine called for the residents of Russian-occupied areas around the power plant to evacuate for their own safety. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the nuclear plant, risking a nuclear disaster. Blinken’s trip comes roughly four months after he visited Ukraine with Austin. At the time, Blinken said they weren’t able to visit much of Kyiv or speak to many people due to security concerns."
2022-09-08,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-forced-deportations-russia-un-filtration-rcna46804,,"The United States said Wednesday it has evidence that “hundreds of thousands” of Ukrainian citizens have been interrogated, detained and forcibly deported to Russia in “a series of horrors” overseen by officials from Russia’s presidency. Russia immediately dismissed the allegation as “fantasy,” calling it the latest invention in a Western disinformation campaign. NBC News has not verified the claims. The charge came during a Security Council meeting called by the United States and Albania to discuss Russia’s “filtration operations.” That involves Ukrainians voluntarily fleeing the war in their homeland and those forcibly being moved to Russia passing through a series of “filtration points” where treatment allegedly ranges from interrogations, data collection and strip searches to being yanked aside, tortured, sent to a detention center in Russia and never seen again. US. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said estimates from a variety of sources, including the Russian government, indicate that Russian authorities have interrogated, detained and forcibly deported between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainians. She said they are sent to Russia, often to isolated regions in its far eastern regions. “These operations aim to identify individuals Russia deems insufficiently compliant or compatible to its control,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “And there is mounting and credible evidence that those considered threatening to Russian control because of perceived pro-Ukrainian leanings are `disappeared’ or further detained.” Russia’s presidency is not only coordinating filtration operations but is providing lists of Ukrainians to be targeted for filtration, she added. She said estimates indicate thousands of children have been subject to filtration, “some separated from their families and taken from orphanages before being put up for adoption in Russia.” According to U.S. information, “more than 1,800 children were transferred from Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine to Russia” just in July, she said."
2022-09-07,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/zaporizhzhia-ukraine-evacuation-russia-occupied-nuclear-plant-town-rcna46675,,"Ukraine on Wednesday called for the residents of Russian-occupied areas around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to evacuate for their own safety. Moscow and Kyiv accuse each other of shelling the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, risking a nuclear disaster. “I appeal to the residents of the districts adjacent to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant .... evacuate! Find a way to get to (Ukrainian) controlled territory,” Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a post on the Telegram messaging service. The exiled Ukrainian mayor of Enerhodar, the main town serving the plant, said in a separate Telegram post that it was under fire from Russian forces and that it had no electrical supply. “The intervals between provocations are becoming shorter and shorter,” Dmytro Orlov, the mayor, wrote. He said the plant’s employees did not have time to repair the installation “as another shelling nullifies their work and they have to start all over again.” Orlov added that residents should stockpile drinking water and food that did not require cooking. It is now impossible to predict the timing of the restoration of electricity supply. Russia denies targeting civilians and accuses Kyiv of shelling the nuclear plant. The call to evacuate followed a warning from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which said on Tuesday that there was an “urgent” need to establish a “security protection zone” at the Russian-held power plant in order to prevent a nuclear catastrophe. “The situation in Ukraine is unprecedented,” the United Nations nuclear watchdog warned. “It is the first time a military conflict has occurred amid the facilities of a large, established nuclear power” program, it said in a report. A nuclear accident would be a disaster not just for Ukraine, but also for the countries “beyond its borders,” it said. “We in this case have the historical, ethical imperative to prevent something from happening,” Rafael Grossi, head of the IAEA, later told the U.N. Security Council. “We can agree on a very simple but incredibly necessary protective mechanism to avoid what is happening now, as we speak, which is the shelling of a nuclear power plant,” he added."
2022-09-07,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/runaway-chimpanzee-kharkiv-zoo-escape-ukraine-raincoat-rcna46595,,"KYIV, Ukraine — The risks of wandering in war-torn Kharkiv alone did not seem to faze Chichi, the runaway chimpanzee whose escapades this week have made her famous on social media. It was not until a timely intervention from the heavens in the form of rain that her Ukrainian zookeepers were able to persuade her to return home — with a little help from a raincoat and a bicycle. The 13-year-old female chimpanzee escaped from Kharkiv Zoo on Monday, with zookeepers tracking her down about two hours later in the northeastern city’s Freedom Square, not far away. Video shows Chichi eventually being persuaded to put on a yellow hooded rain jacket, before being returned home perched on a bicycle, after briefly roaming through Ukraine's second largest city. Videos of the incident have been shared widely, offering both a rare moment of levity in the thick of Russia's war and an insight into the plight of animals in Ukraine whose homes have also come under bombardment. “Chimpanzees are highly intellectual creatures, it wasn’t difficult to her to break the fence and leave,” Victoria Kozyreva, the zookeeper at Kharkiv Zoo who helped persuade Chichi to return home, told NBC News on Wednesday. ""After I heard that she left, I followed her to the square and began to talk to her."" Kozyreva, who has known Chichi since the primate's childhood, can be seen approaching her and helping her put on the yellow jacket in the video. It took careful negotiations, she said, to overcome the chimp's initial skepticism. ""It wasn’t difficult to convince her. All that's needed is negotiations,” the 45-year-old zookeeper said. ""There was rain. I talked to her and invited with my jacket, helped to put it on and gave her a hug."" Chichi, who once resided at the Feldman Ecopark in the city’s northern suburbs, was relocated to Kharkiv Zoo after heavy fighting in early March, shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country. The ecopark has since permanently closed due to the conflict, which has seen Kharkiv continue to face deadly shelling. Chichi's escape from her enclosure at Kharkiv Zoo was likely made easier by the fact that she used to be kept behind an electric fence at her home before the war, said Serhii Kuvshar, who was Chichi’s caretaker at the ecopark and has also known her since childhood. He speculated that Chichi may have escaped from her enclosure because she was bored, given the lack of recent attention from a public understandably distracted by their own shattered lives. ""They are fed up and bored to see zookeepers only,"" Kuvshar said of chimpanzees in Ukraine. ""They do like to boast in front of the people about what they can do, they like when people admire them, it is a great joy for them to communicate with people,"" he said. Around 4,000 animals from the ecopark were evacuated to other sanctuaries across Ukraine at the beginning of the invasion, according to the zoo. Six zoo personnel were killed in the shelling, it said. While Chichi's adventure ended happily, Kozyreva said many of the primates were suffering due to the war. “All of them have PTSD now, they experienced real hell, they saw how their relatives died,"" she said, referring to post-traumatic stress disorder. ""They understand everything."" Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv, Rhoda Kwan reported from Taipei, Taiwan, and Matteo Moschella reported from London."
2022-09-07,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-mocks-west-russia-sanctions-ukraine-war-china-xi-rcna46598,,"Russian President Vladimir Putin mocked the West’s response to his invasion of Ukraine on Wednesday, insisting that his country had “not lost anything” after the “sanctions frenzy.” Vowing that Moscow would press on with its military action, he said that Russia had “resisted the economic, financial and technological aggression of the West.” “I’m sure that we haven’t lost anything and we won’t lose anything,” Putin told an annual economic forum in Russia’s far-eastern port city of Vladivostok. “The most important gain is the strengthening of our sovereignty, it’s an inevitable result of what’s going on.” He added that the economic and financial situation in Russia had stabilized, consumer prices inflation had slowed down and unemployment has remained low. Putin said that “a certain polarization is taking place, both in the world and inside the country,” something he said he thought was “only for the best.” “Everything unnecessary, harmful and everything that keeps us from moving forward will be abandoned,” he said, adding that Western sanctions were “a danger to the entire world.” Taking aim at foreign corporations that have pulled out of Russia since the invasion, Putin said that many European companies were now folding because of their choice to leave. He added that Western attempts to cap prices for Russian oil and gas were “stupid” and Moscow will have enough customers in Asia. “The demand is so high on global markets that we won’t have any problem selling it,” Putin said. “Any attempt to limit prices by administrative means is just ravings, it’s sheer nonsense,” he added. “It will only lead to a hike in prices.” The confrontation with the West over Ukraine has prompted Russia to embark on a hurried tilt toward Asia, and particularly China, once a junior partner of the former Soviet Union and now the world’s second largest economy. “Emerging states and regions around the world, primarily, of course, in the Asia-Pacific region, now play a substantially bigger role,” he said. Putin said that the West was failing because a futile and aggressive attempt to isolate Russia with sanctions was destroying the global economy just as Asia was rising to claim the future. Putin and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, will meet next week at a summit in Uzbekistan, a Russian official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. If it goes ahead, it will be Xi’s first foreign trip in 2½ years. The pair last met in Beijing in February, weeks before the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine. Putin also rejected the European Union’s argument that Russia was using energy as a weapon by suspending gas supplies via the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline to Germany. He reaffirmed the Russian argument that Western sanctions have hampered maintenance of the last turbine that remains in operation, forcing its shutdown. Putin repeated that Moscow stands ready to “press the button” and start pumping gas “as early as tomorrow” through the Nord Stream 2, which has been put on hold by the German authorities."
2022-09-07,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/un-nuclear-watchdog-calls-security-protection-zone-russian-held-zapori-rcna46446,,"There is an ""urgent"" need to establish a ""security protection zone"" at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine to prevent a nuclear catastrophe, the International Atomic Energy Agency declared Tuesday. ""The situation in Ukraine is unprecedented,"" the United Nations nuclear watchdog warned. ""It is the first time a military conflict has occurred amid the facilities of a large, established nuclear power"" program, it said in a report. A nuclear accident would be a disaster not just for Ukraine, but also for the countries ""beyond its borders."" ""The IAEA is ready to start immediately the consultations leading to the urgent establishment of such a nuclear safety and security protection zone"" at the plant, the IAEA said. The dire warning from the Vienna-based organization that is not given to hyperbole came just 24 hours after the Ukrainian energy company that runs the Zaporizhzhia complex reported that the last line connecting the power plant to the Ukrainian electrical grid was disconnected after days of ""intensive shelling."" The three other lines went down earlier in the war. “We are playing with fire, and something very, very catastrophic could take place,” Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, warned the U.N. Security Council, days after leading an inspection visit to the plant. At the Security Council meeting, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres likewise demanded that Russian and Ukrainian forces commit to halting all military activity around the plant and agree on a “demilitarized perimeter.” ""The current situation is untenable and the best action to ensure the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and its people would be for this armed conflict to end now,"" the IAEA report states. “The world is once again on the brink of a nuclear disaster,” Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko said earlier on Facebook. The Zaporizhzhia plant in the southeastern Ukrainian town of Enerhodar went online in the 1980s when the country was part of the then-Soviet Union and provided up to 20% of Ukraine's power after independence. Its six reactors generate more power than any such facility in the United States. But it was captured in the early days of the Russian invasion, which began in February. The IAEA inspectors made it to the Zaporizhzhia plant Sept. 1 and since then they have been evaluating the damage at the site, assessing its safety and security systems, and interviewing the Ukrainian staffers who have kept the facility going. Before the war, the Ukrainian plant employed 11,000 staffers. How many remain was not immediately clear. But the IAEA has left two inspectors at the plant. ""The IAEA is still gravely concerned about the situation at the ZNPP — this hasn’t changed,"" the watchdog group said in its report, referring to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. ""The Seven Pillars have all been compromised at the site."" The Seven Pillars refers to the IAEA's seven core nuclear safety standards, the first of which states: ""The physical integrity of the facilities — whether it is the reactors, fuel ponds, or radioactive waste stores — must be maintained."" The West has accused Russia of heightening the risk of a nuclear disaster by using the plant as a ""shield"" where it stations troops and weapons — and launches attacks on other Ukrainian targets from the site. Russia has denied the accusations and has, in turn, accused Ukraine of repeatedly attacking the plant. The IAEA has warned that the consequences of a war-induced meltdown at the plant would be far-reaching and “much more terrible” than those from the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant near the northern Ukrainian city of Pripyat. That catastrophe sparked the evacuation of more than 100,000 people living near the plant and resulted in a radioactive cloud that drifted across most of Europe and was blamed for cancer spikes — especially in children — in both Ukraine and neighboring Belarus. The Zaporizhzhia plant is almost twice the size of Chernobyl, although its reactors are more modern, experts told NBC News earlier."
2022-09-06,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-buying-north-korean-rockets-artillery-use-ukraine-rcna46382,,"Russia is in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to use in Ukraine, a senior U.S. defense official said, an indication that Western sanctions are severely hampering Moscow's military supply effort. Russia is seeking help from Kim Jong Un's regime at a time when it is also leaning on Iran for military supplies. U.S. officials disclosed late last month that Russia received shipments of Iranian-produced drones. Russian cargo planes loaded up Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles over several days last month at an Iranian airfield and then ferried the drones to Russia, three U.S. officials told NBC News. The delivery is part of Russia’s plans to import “hundreds” of drones from Iran, they said. But the drones transferred to Russia have already experienced “numerous failures,” the U.S. officials said. They did not offer more details about the nature of the technical problems. The Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of economic sanctions from Washington and its European allies, placing Moscow in a position similar to Iran, which for years has been shut out of Western economies and the international financial system. Since the war began, Iran has become the top purchaser of Russia’s grain, and the two countries have announced agreements to bolster trade, including a $40 billion deal to enlist Russian help to develop Iran’s gas fields. With the war in Ukraine dragging on and Russia expending thousands of rounds of ammunition every week, it will likely seek to purchase additional military equipment from North Korea, defense officials said. The New York Times was the first to report the purchase."
2022-09-05,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-russia-shelling-grid-rcna46303,,"The last reserve line connecting the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to the Ukrainian energy grid was disconnected Monday after days of “intensive shelling,” the national energy company that runs the plant said. A fire caused by the shelling left transmission lines “damaged and disconnected,” Energoatom said in a statement. As a result, power from unit No. 6, which supplies the plant's own needs, was disconnected from the network. The company said in a later statement that the sixth power supply unit was “operational” but only to cool reactor cores and waste. It said that no power was going out of the plant and that generators had not been activated in response. German Galushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister, said on Facebook that any immediate repair work on the lines was impossible because of the fighting around the plant. “The world is once again on the brink of a nuclear disaster. The de-occupation of the ZNPP and the creation of a demilitarized zone around it is the only way to ensure nuclear safety,” Galushchenko said. The International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, said it had been informed that the line was deliberately disconnected to extinguish a fire. ""The line itself is not damaged, and it will be re-connected once the fire is extinguished,"" the agency said in a statement. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the IAEA, said Saturday that the plant had lost external power, with Ukrainian staff members telling the United Nations watchdog’s inspectors that the fourth and last operational line was down. Three more were lost earlier in the war. At the time, the IAEA said only one out of six nuclear reactors at the site was operational. Fears of a possible nuclear disaster have grown since Russia invaded Ukraine, and concerns deepened after the plant was completely disconnected for the first time in its 40-year history on Aug. 25. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame for problems caused by the intense fighting around the plant. World leaders, meanwhile, have called for a demilitarized zone. After he traveled to Ukraine over the past week to inspect the installation and determine whether it could continue to run safely, Grossi warned that the “physical integrity of the plant has been violated.” He said the IAEA would establish a “continued presence” of experts at the plant “so they can provide me and all of us with an impartial, neutral, technical, sound assessment of whatever may be happening there.” He added that he would “continue to worry about the plant until we have a situation that is more stable.”"
2022-09-04,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/us-ambassador-russia-leaving-post-ukraine-war-drags-rcna46246,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, ended his tenure as America’s top diplomat in Moscow on Sunday after nearly three years, spanning the Trump and Biden administrations, and will retire from a lengthy career in government service, the embassy announced. His departure comes as Russia’s war with Ukraine is in its seventh month. His four-decade public service career included postings as deputy secretary of state and senior positions in the departments of Justice, Defense and Commerce. Elizabeth Rood, the deputy chief of mission to Russia, will be the top U.S. diplomat in Moscow until a successor nominated by President Joe Biden replaces Sullivan. On Saturday, Sullivan attended a farewell ceremony in Moscow for former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who died Tuesday. The departure comes as U.S.-Russian relations remain tense. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the war has slowed to a grind with both sides trading combat strikes and small advances in the east and south. Both Russian and Ukraine have seen thousands of troops killed and injured, and Russia’s bombardment of cities has killed countless innocent civilians. The U.S. has imposed numerous waves of sanctions on Russia and provided billions of dollars worth of military assistance to Ukraine, shifting to a longer-term support strategy in recent weeks. In April 2021, Sullivan headed back to the U.S. for consultations after officials in Moscow “suggested” he follow the example of the Russian ambassador to Washington who was recalled from Washington after Biden described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “killer.” A Boston native, Sullivan was nominated by President Donald Trump and confirmed by the Senate with unusually strong bipartisan support as ambassador to Russia in December 2019. Biden asked him to remain in the post when Biden took office last year."
2022-09-04,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-nord-stream-zelesnkyy-energy-war-europe-germany-rcna46229,,"The Kremlin is preparing an “energy attack” on Europe, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday, a day after Russian energy giant Gazprom indefinitely suspended natural gas supplies to Germany through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. “Where Russia cannot do it by force of conventional weapons, it does so by force of energy weapons,” Zelenskyy said in a video address. “Russia is preparing for a decisive energy attack on all Europeans,” he said. His comments came after Gazprom, the state-controlled company with a monopoly on Russian gas exports through the key pipeline, said Friday that it could no longer provide a time frame for restarting deliveries through Nord Stream 1. It said an oil leak meant a pipeline turbine could not run safely and that it could not safely resume operations until all malfunctions had been resolved. Siemens, the German manufacturer of the turbines, however, said in a statement that such leakages “do not usually affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site,” adding that it had never suspended operations in the past. Despite the leak, there were additional turbines to operate the pipeline, the statement said. The pipeline, which runs under the Baltic Sea to Germany, has historically supplied about a third of the gas exported from Russia to Europe, but it was already running at only 20% of capacity before flows were halted last week for maintenance. Lower gas flows have already pushed up European prices by nearly 400% over the past year, sending electricity costs soaring and leading to accusations that Russia is weaponizing energy supplies. Moscow blames Western sanctions and technical issues for supply disruptions. Zelenskyy said Russia was trying to attack with “poverty and political chaos where it cannot yet attack with missiles.” The announcement about the pipeline came after finance ministers from the Group of Seven countries — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States — agreed to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil, which they said would reduce Moscow’s “ability to fund its war.” Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian shelling hit the southern port city of Mykolaiv during the night, damaging a medical treatment facility, the city’s mayor said in a statement on his Telegram channel. Oleksandr Senkevych did not specify whether there were any injuries in the overnight attack, which he said also damaged some residences. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaphorizhzhia also continued to be caught in the crossfire at the frontlines of the war, fueling fears of a nuclear disaster. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency said Saturday that the plant had lost external power. Ukrainian staff operating the plant told the IAEA inspectors that the fourth and last operational line was down. The other three were lost earlier in the war. Only one out of six nuclear reactors at the site was in operation, the IAEA said in a statement Saturday. The sole reactor was producing electricity for cooling and powering households, with a reserve line supplying electricity to the facility. Russian forces captured the plant shortly after they moved into Ukraine, and the two sides have exchanged accusations about shelling the plant. Zelenskyy blamed Russian shelling for an Aug. 25 shutdown that severed the Zaphorizhzhia plant from the national grid, narrowly avoiding a radiation leak and prompting blackouts across Ukraine. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Ukrainian troops launched another attempt to seize the plant late Friday, despite the IAEA tour. NBC News has not been able to verify the claims from either side. The IAEA, whose experts have been stationed at the plant since Thursday, said a “secure off-site power supply” as well as backup systems were essential for nuclear safety, adding that their presence at the plant was a “game changer.” Grossi is set to brief the U.N. Security Council next week following the inspection of the plant."
2022-09-03,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-mikhail-gorbachev-funeral-vladimir-putin-snub-thousands-line-up-rcna46189,,"Thousands of people lined the streets of Moscow to pay their respects to Mikhail Gorbachev ahead of his funeral on Saturday — a farewell snubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Gorbachev, who died on Tuesday at the age of 91, was buried without state honors next to his wife, Raisa, after a farewell ceremony at the Pillar Hall of the House of the Unions, an opulent 18th-century mansion near the Kremlin that has served as the venue for state funerals since Soviet times. At the ceremony, mourners filed by Gorbachev’s open coffin, laying flowers as music, including the melancholic score from the movie “Schindler’s List,” played in the background. Gorbachev’s daughter, Irina, and his two granddaughters sat beside the coffin that was flanked by honorary guards. The turnout was large enough that the viewing was extended for two more hours beyond the stated two hour schedule. Lauded in the West and by many liberal Russians for bringing down the Iron Curtain and instigating greater social and economic freedoms in the Soviet Union, the Nobel Peace Prize winner has been strongly criticized by others at home for precipitating the end of the Soviet empire and the ensuing economic meltdown that plunged millions into poverty. Reflecting the uneasiness of his legacy in Russia, the government stopped just short of offering Gorbachev a state funeral, although Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it would have “elements” of one and the government would help to organize it. In a private ceremony on Thursday, Putin laid flowers at Gorbachev’s coffin at the Moscow hospital where Gorbachev had died two days before, but the Kremlin said that his busy schedule would keep him from attending the funeral. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Saturday that the president would have a series of working meetings and an international phone call, and needed to prepare for a business forum in the Russian Far East he was scheduled to attend next week. The Kremlin’s ambivalence about Gorbachev was reflected in state television broadcasts, which described his worldwide acclaim and grand expectations generated by his reforms but held him responsible for plunging the country into political turmoil and economic woes, and for failing to properly defend the country’s interests in talks with the West. Putin's attendance would have been required for it to be a full state funeral, and it would have necessitated invitations to world leaders who the Russian leader has been busy avoiding since his invasion of Ukraine in late February. Putin, a longtime KGB intelligence officer who has called the Soviet Union’s collapse a “geopolitical catastrophe” has avoided criticizing Gorbachev since his death but has in the past repeatedly blamed him for failing to secure written commitments from the West that would rule out NATO's expansion eastward. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a conservative nationalist and one of the few European leaders to still enjoy a cordial relationship with Putin, did attend the ceremony. The U.S., British, German and other Western ambassadors were also present, along with several Russian cultural figures. The modest event contrasted with the lavish 2007 state funeral for Boris Yeltsin, Russia’s first post-Soviet leader who sidelined Gorbachev as the Soviet Union fell apart, and later hand-picked Putin as his political successor. Yeltsin, however, was also buried at Novodevichy Cemetery, a burial ground that survived the monastic and holy destructions of the Stalinist era. Novodevichy is also the final resting place of former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev."

Lukoil, Russia’s largest private oil company, said its chairman Ravil Maganov “passed away following a severe illness,” Thursday at age 67. But citing two sources familiar with his death, Reuters reported that he died after falling from the window of the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow. Several Russian media outlets, citing sources from law enforcement agencies, have also suggested that he was trying to smoke when he plunged to his death. NBC News has not verified how he died and Maganov’s family has remained silent on the matter. The hospital and police declined to comment, and Russia’s Investigative Committee did not return requests for comment. However, several Western commentators have noted that Lukoil, the country’s second largest oil producer, came out against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war a few days after his forces invaded Ukraine, calling for it to end. And while no political link to Maganov’s death has been established, several people who have chosen to cross the Kremlin have died suddenly and in unexplained circumstances. “There has been a remarkable number of suspicious deaths in recent months of senior executives connected with the oil and gas industry,” John Lough, an associate fellow at London’s Chatham House think tank, told NBC News via email Thursday. “It is reminiscent of the banditry of the 1990s in Russia during the first phase of privatization after the collapse of the USSR,” added Lough, who specializes in Russian affairs. Maganov’s death follows the passing of seven other senior Russian energy executives since the start of the year. Among them was his former top Lukoil executive Alexander Subbotin, whose body was discovered in the basement of a country house in the Moscow region in May, police in the city said. Other senior executives from natural gas giants Gazprom and Novatek, as well as Vladislav Avayev, the former vice president of Russia’ third largest bank Gazprombank, have also died. “This suggests there is some serious infighting taking place in the sector connected to access to financial flows,” Lough said. Olga Oliker, the program director for Europe and Central Asia at the International Crisis Group in Brussels, said that “trend” was the wrong word to describe the deaths She said there were enough incidents to argue that Russian state policy either allows for political assassinations or that it lacks control over its security services and does not have the capacity to prevent them. “There are enough incidents that those who run afoul of Russian leadership, or appear to, may well worry about potential threats to their lives,” she said. Former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov was gunned down on a bridge near the Kremlin in February 2015, police said, a day before a planned protest against Putin’s rule. Nemtsov was a sharp critic of Putin, assailing his government’s inefficiency, rampant corruption and the Kremlin’s policy on Ukraine. A report he was working on about Russia’s military involvement in the war in eastern Ukraine and in the annexation of Crimea was released after his death. Five men were found guilty and jailed for his murder, but Nemtsov’s death left the country’s opposition without a central figure and ignited fury among critics who assailed the Kremlin for creating an atmosphere of intolerance of any dissent and called the killing an assassination. His death was likened by Kremlin critics and Western commentators to that of the prominent investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was shot to death in October 2006. Known for her critical coverage of the war in Chechnya, despite numerous acts of intimidation and violence, Politkovskaya had written a critical book about Putin and his campaign in the region, documenting widespread abuse of civilians by government troops. Police investigated her death as a murder, but it remains unsolved and the Kremlin has denied any connection to both her death and that of Nemtsov. Just over a month after Politkovskaya’s killing, former Russian spy turned dissident Alexander Litvinenko suffered an agonizing death in London in 2006 after drinking tea laced with an extremely rare radioactive substance called “polonium-210,” British police said. The haunting image of Litvinenko in his hospital bed became world famous as the face of tortured suffering. After about three weeks of misery, he lapsed into a coma and died, at age 43, after claiming on his deathbed that Putin likely ordered his killing. A decorated KGB and FSB officer, Litvinenko defected from Russia in 2000 and settled in the United Kingdom, where he became an outspoken critic of the Kremlin and Putin."
2022-09-02,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/gazprom-keeps-pipeline-germany-switched-g7-caps-russian-oil-prices-rcna46132,,"Europe’s energy crisis loomed larger Friday after Russian energy giant Gazprom said it couldn’t resume the supply of natural gas through a key pipeline to Germany for now, citing what it said was a need for urgent maintenance work to repair key components, just hours before it was due to restart deliveries. The Russian state-run energy company had shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline on Wednesday for what it said would be three days of maintenance. It said in a social media post Friday evening that it had identified “malfunctions” of a turbine and added that the pipeline would not work unless those were eliminated. It was the latest development in a saga in which Gazprom has advanced technical problems as the reason for reducing gas flows through Nord Stream 1 — explanations that German officials have rejected as a cover for a political power play following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It came after finance ministers from the Group of Seven wealthy democracies — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States — said a cap on the price of Russian oil was meant to “reduce ... Russia's ability to fund its war of aggression whilst limiting the impact of Russia's war on global energy prices” which have soared. European utilities have scrambled to find additional supply during the summer months to get ready for the winter’s heating demands, buying expensive liquefied gas that comes by ship, while additional supplies have come by pipeline from Norway and Azerbaijan. Fears of a winter shortage have eased somewhat as storage has progressed, but a complete cutoff could present Europe with serious difficulties, analysts say. The European Union needs to step up efforts to reduce gas consumption, said energy policy expert Simone Tagliapietra at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. The continuing interruptions from Gazrpom mean that “a winter with zero Russian gas is the central scenario for Europe.” he said. “There is only one way to prepare for that: reducing gas and electricity demand.” Gazprom said it had identified oil leaks from four turbines at the Portovaya compressor station at the Russian end of the pipeline, including the sole operational one. It claimed to have received warnings from Russia’s industrial safety watchdog that the leaks “do not allow for safe, trouble-free operation of the gas turbine engine.” “In connection with this, it is necessary to take appropriate measures and suspend further operation of the . gas compressor unit in connection with the identified gross (safety) violations,” the company said. Gazprom started cutting supplies through Nord Stream 1 in mid-June, blaming delays to the delivery of a turbine that had been sent to Canada for repair. Canada has since allowed the turbine’s delivery to Germany, which has said that nothing stands in the way of it being sent to Russia other than Russia saying it wants the part. In recent weeks, Nord Stream 1 has been running at only 20% of capacity. Russia, which before the reductions started accounted for a bit more than a third of Germany’s gas supplies, has also reduced the flow of gas to other European countries which have sided with Ukraine in the war. Natural gas is used to power industry, heat homes and offices, and generate electricity. Increasing the amount in reserve has been a key focus of the German government since Russia invaded Ukraine, to avoid rationing for industry as demand rises in the winter. Germany’s storage facilities are now over 84% full. The head of Germany’s network regulatory agency, Klaus Mueller, tweeted that the Russian decision to keep Nord Stream 1 switched off for now increases the significance of new liquefied natural gas terminals that Germany plans to start running this winter, gas storage and “significant needs to save” gas. It is “good that Germany is now better prepared, but now it comes down to everyone,” Mueller added. Germany’s Economy Ministry said it had “taken note” of Gazprom’s latest announcement and wouldn’t comment on it directly, but added that “we have already seen Russia’s unreliability in recent weeks” and continued efforts to reduce the country’s reliance on Russian energy imports. “Of course these are difficult times but we will continue to strengthen provisions consistently,” the ministry said in a statement. “Great efforts are still needed but we are on a good path to coping with the situation.” The European Union has just reached its goal of filling its gas storage to 80%, ahead of a Nov. 1 deadline, despite Russian supply cutbacks."
2022-09-02,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/un-inspectors-assess-damage-ukrainian-nuclear-plant-rcna46005,,"Ukraine and Russia traded accusations over each others’ actions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Friday as a team of inspectors from the United Nations nuclear watchdog tried to check the safety of the facility and avert a potential disaster. Ukraine’s state nuclear company said the International Atomic Energy Agency mission had not been allowed to enter the plant’s crisis center, where Ukraine says Russian troops are stationed, and would struggle to make an impartial assessment. The Kremlin said Ukraine was continuing to shell the plant, raising the risk of a nuclear catastrophe. NBC News has not verified the claims of either side."
2022-09-01,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russian-lukoil-exec-dies-falling-hospital-window-reports-say-rcna45823,,"The head of a Russian oil giant that criticized President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine died Thursday after reportedly falling out of his hospital window. Lukoil Chairman Ravil Maganov died after falling from a window of the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow, Reuters reported, citing two sources familiar with the situation. The company issued a statement early Thursday confirming the death of Maganov, 67, ""after a severe illness,"" but did not specify the cause. “Ravil Maganov immensely contributed to the development of not only the Company, but of the entire Russian oil and gas sector,” the statement read. NBC News has not verified how he died. The hospital declined to comment and referred comment to the police, who declined to comment. Lukoil is Russia’s second-largest oil producer. It was a rare Russian business to come out against Putin’s war in Ukraine, which the Kremlin insists on calling its “special military operation.” The company’s board of directors called for an end to the war in early March, within days of the full-scale invasion of Russia's neighbor. “Calling for the soonest termination of the armed conflict, we express our sincere empathy for all victims, who are affected by this tragedy,” a statement from its board of directors read. The Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow frequently treats Russia's political and business elites, and was where the final Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev passed away earlier this week. Maganov had served on Lukoil’s board of directors since 2020, and served as the company’s first executive vice president since 1994. His death raised eyebrows given the company's opposition to the war and similar unexplained deaths in recent years. Alexander Subbotin, a former Lukoil manager, was found dead in his basement outside Moscow in May, according to Reuters, citing local media. In November 2021, a Russian diplomat was found dead on the streets of Berlin after falling from an upper floor of the embassy, the German outlet Der Spiegel reported, citing security sources. Investigative journalist Maxim Borodin, who wrote stories about corrupt officials and the Russian military, died in 2018 after falling from his fifth-story balcony, according to the news agency for which he worked."
2022-09-01,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-nuclear-plant-inspectors-shelling-zaporizhzhia-russia-rcna45811,,"A team of international inspectors arrived at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant Thursday despite renewed shelling that underscored fears of a radiation disaster. Ukraine and Russia traded fresh accusations that the other side was endangering the United Nations team, as well as the Zaporizhzhia plant’s nuclear reactors, to disrupt the risky mission to secure the plant's safety. But the experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, pressed on despite the fighting. Kyiv accused Moscow's forces early Thursday of shelling the occupied nuclear power plant — and the route the IAEA inspectors were taking. Russian officials blamed Kyiv for the fierce fighting around the site. Its Defense Ministry said Ukrainian troops had tried a daring amphibious landing to seize back control of the plant. NBC News could not immediately verify either side’s claims. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told reporters that he had been able to tour the whole site. “I went into the units. I could visit the emergency systems, the diesel generators, the different parts. So we have the control rooms of some of the nuclear power plants there, so we chose three or four key areas we needed to see firsthand, and I was able to do that,” he said. He said he had spoken “to the staff a lot and the people of Enerhodar, the people from the village who came to meet with me and to see me and to get the support that they deserve from the IAEA.” Grossi said the IAEA would establish a “continued presence” of experts at the plant “so they can provide me and all of us with an impartial, neutral, technical, sound assessment of whatever may be happening there.” He added that he would “continue to worry about the plant until we have a situation that is more stable” and that it was “obvious” that the integrity of the plant has been “violated.” Earlier, the nuclear agency said the mission was delayed on the Ukrainian-controlled side for about three hours. Grossi told Reuters the inspectors would spend “several days” at the plant before it reports back to an increasingly alarmed international community."
2022-08-31,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/un-inspectors-heading-ukrainian-nuclear-plant-zaporizhzhia-rcna45590,,"ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — A team of international inspectors arrived Wednesday in Zaporizhzhia ahead of its unprecedented mission to try to restore stability and avert a potential nuclear catastrophe at a nearby Russian-occupied power plant. The visit comes as Ukrainian forces appeared to make some progress after launching a long-awaited counteroffensive to retake territory in the country's south that was seized by Russian forces early in the invasion. During their visit to the plant, which has seen weeks of shelling that Russia and Ukraine have blamed on each other, the United Nations nuclear experts plan to assess damage and evaluate whether safety systems are still intact. They also intend to speak with Ukrainian workers operating the plant, some of whom have reported being tortured by Russian troops occupying the site. “We are going to a war zone,” International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told reporters before departing the capital, Kyiv, at dawn. Grossi said the inspectors would spend “several days” at the power plant, before reporting back to an increasingly alarmed international community. Yet, even as the team's armored convoy arrived in Zaporizhzhia, it remained unclear how and when they would be able to safely reach the plant in nearby Enerhodar. Advisers to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russian forces were shelling the route the inspectors would take to the plant to force them to instead travel there through Russian-held territory, while Russia accused Ukraine’s forces of firing on the plant overnight. Ukrainian officials said it was actually Russian troops firing on the plant from a nearby town across the Dnieper River. NBC News has not verified the claims of either side. On arrival in Zaporizhzhia, Grossi said he was confident the mission could be carried out safely. Elsewhere in southern Ukraine, the country’s apparent counteroffensive to try and take back Russian-occupied areas was making progress, according to Britain’s defense ministry. “Ukrainian armored forces have continued to assault Russia’s Southern Grouping of Forces on several axes across the south of the country since Monday,” it said in an intelligence update Wednesday. ""Ukrainian formations have pushed the front-line back some distance in places, exploiting relatively thinly held Russian defenses."" the ministry added. While Ukraine's potential gains could prove crucial in the overall direction of the war, in recent weeks the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — the largest in Europe, with six reactors — has become a major flashpoint in the conflict. Last week, a nearby fire disconnected the plant from Ukraine’s electricity grid for the first time in its history, forcing the plant to revert to backup power for the safety systems that prevent a nuclear meltdown. Tariq Rauf, a former IAEA inspector now at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said the IAEA mission includes experts on radiation safety, physical security of power plants and nonproliferation of nuclear material located at the site. He said inspectors were likely bringing cameras and radiation measuring devices to replace those damaged during the war. “This is very unprecedented,” he said. “I would expect that it would take at least a few days, if not maybe up to a week because the site is quite large. If they have to go around the site, to look at damage from the shelling and so on, I think that would take some time.” Amid the fighting and conflicting reports about the agreed-upon conditions for the IAEA visit, Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed governor of the part of Zaporizhzhia occupied by Moscow's troops, claimed the inspectors would only spend one day at the plant and downplayed prospects for the mission’s success. “I think it will be more political engagement,” Balitsky said in comments carried by the Russian state-run news agency Interfax. Zelenskyy, meeting Tuesday with the IAEA delegation in Kyiv, said it was crucial that Russia acquiesce to demands from the nuclear watchdog and the international community that the power plant be demilitarized and returned to Ukrainian control. “Only this way, we can eliminate any risks regarding the atomic energy,” he said. Underscoring the rising fears of a radiation catastrophe, workers from Ukraine’s State Emergency Service and State Police held nuclear disaster drills Tuesday that focused on how the civilian population would be evacuated in the event of a radiation leak. Local authorities in Zaporizhzhia have also been doling out potassium iodine tablets to residents within a 31-mile radius of the plant."
2022-08-30,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/russia-gets-first-drones-iran-two-nations-strengthen-ties-rcna45352,,"Russia has picked up the first batch of Iranian drones for its war in Ukraine but it has run into technical problems in the initial tests of the unmanned aircraft, U.S. officials said Tuesday. Facing a protracted war in Ukraine and a wall of Western sanctions, Russia is turning to Iran to bolster its military and keep its economy afloat, as both countries’ interests converge. Barred from importing Western technology and with China wary of openly breaching U.S. sanctions, Russia has sought out drones from Iran to fill a major gap in its arsenal, as the Russian military has failed to develop combat drones able to strike targets behind enemy lines. Russian cargo planes loaded up Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles over several days this month at an Iranian airfield and then ferried the drones to Russia, three U.S. officials told NBC News. The delivery is part of Russia's plans to import “hundreds” of drones from Iran, they said. U.S. officials, however, said the drones transferred to Russia have already experienced “numerous failures,” though they did not offer more details about the nature of the technical problems. The Washington Post first reported on the drone shipment and subsequent technical difficulties. The Iranian U.N. mission and the Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. The partnership between Russia and Iran has been building for more than a decade but it has accelerated since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, with Tehran providing armed drones to Russia and Moscow launching an Iranian satellite, according to U.S. officials. The trend has raised concerns in Washington and elsewhere, though it remains unclear whether the partnership will evolve into a full-fledged alliance or alter Moscow’s relatively friendly relations with Iran’s foes in the region, including Israel, former U.S. officials and experts said. Although Russian and Iranian military and intelligence officers have worked closely together in Syria in support of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, Iran’s decision to provide weapons to Russia for a war in another region is unprecedented, said John Brennan, a former director of the CIA. “That’s new. I haven’t seen Iran provide that to Russia before. We’re talking about significant support,” said Brennan, who is also a senior NBC News and MSNBC national security analyst. Russia earlier this month launched an Iranian satellite into orbit, which Western officials believe could be used for possible intelligence gathering in Ukraine or elsewhere. Iran denied that was the case and said the satellite would be used for scientific research related to agriculture. The Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of economic sanctions from Washington and its European allies, placing Moscow in a position similar to Iran, which for years has been shut out of Western economies and the international financial system. Since the war began, Iran has become the top purchaser of Russia’s grain, and the two countries have announced agreements to bolster trade, including a $40 billion deal to enlist Russian help to develop Iran’s gas fields. Both countries share a common foe and a shared goal of circumventing financial and other sanctions, with Iran accumulating years of experience trying to undercut U.S. measures. With Moscow and Tehran essentially barred from the SWIFT international bank messaging system, the two countries have agreed to use domestic messaging services as an alternative, according to Iranian media. One foreign government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security matters, said the Russian-Iranian cooperation was now more than just a marriage of convenience. “Relations between Russia and Iran are assuming a more serious character, a more strategic character than before because the calculation has changed,” the official said. The official said that “the very fact that Iran is going to provide drones to attack Ukrainians is a very important development, which cannot be ignored,” and added that Washington was still weighing how to respond. The White House has sought to expose the Russian-Iranian military cooperation, publicly revealing Iran’s plans to deliver “hundreds” of drones — including weapons-capable unmanned aircraft — before President Joe Biden’s July visit to the Middle East. The administration also released satellite imagery of a Russian delegation visiting Kashan Airfield in central Iran on June 8 and July 5, where some of Iran’s more advanced drones were on display. Last month, when asked about drone deliveries to Russia, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said technological cooperation between the two countries preceded the conflict in Ukraine. Military experts said that Iran has built up a significant drone fleet, including “kamikaze” drones, that would fill a gap in Russia’s armed forces. The U.S. government believes Russia plans to use the drones on the battlefield in Ukraine and that the drones are capable of conducting air-to-surface attacks and electronic warfare, U.S. officials said. U.S. officials say they are watching Russian-Iranian cooperation closely. One senior administration official said the drone deal suggested Russia was struggling to maintain its military campaign in Ukraine. “We think that really demonstrates some desperation on the Russian side, in terms of the state of its military,” the senior administration official said. Russia’s troubled performance on the battlefield in Ukraine has damaged Moscow’s efforts to promote the Russian defense industry to governments in the Middle East, according to Brennan. The Russian experience in Ukraine “has undermined and undercut their arguments about just how effective these weapons systems are, given that the Ukrainians have been able to withstand the onslaught. It has hurt their image as a military supplier and developer of sophisticated weaponry,” he said. Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior foreign policy adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in July that Russia had established itself as a reliable partner for Iran, and that the Islamic Republic should give up trying to accommodate the West and instead look to Moscow for support and shared strategic interests. CIA Director William Burns said last month that both Iran and Russia are looking for ways to help each other evade sanctions and “to demonstrate that they have options.” “The reality is that the Russians and Iranians need each other right now,” he told Andrea Mitchell of NBC News at the Aspen Security Forum in July. But Burns said the two oil-rich countries are economic competitors and historical rivals, and that there were limits to the partnership. Despite Moscow’s alignment with Iran, Russia so far has maintained friendly relations with Tehran’s adversaries in the Middle East, including Israel, which has enjoyed a pragmatic relationship with Russia. Although Russia waged an air war against Syrian rebels in support of the Damascus regime, it has never tried to prevent Israel from carrying out repeated military strikes against Iranian or Iranian-backed forces in Syria over the past decade. But Russia’s growing cooperation with Iran has raised the possibility that Moscow could end its understanding with Israel, though there is no evidence such a move is imminent or that Israel’s freedom of action has been curtailed, former U.S. officials said. “I really don’t think it’s in either of their interests to upset the apple cart there,” said Douglas London, a retired CIA officer from the agency’s clandestine service and the author of ""The Recruiter: Spying and the Lost Art of American Intelligence."" In May, after Israeli warplanes attacked targets in northwestern Syria, Russia fired anti-aircraft missiles toward the Israeli jets, according to Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz, who confirmed an Israeli media account of the incident in July. Gantz called it a “one-off incident” and said the Israeli jets were never in danger as the Russian missiles had not locked onto the planes. Since the May episode, Israel has continued to conduct strikes inside Syria without any reports of warning shots from Russia. Last week, Israel struck a warehouse containing hundreds of Iranian-made missiles in the Syrian city of Masyaf, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based opposition war monitoring group. The Israeli Embassy in Washington declined to comment when asked about Israeli strikes in Syria. Russia’s increasing cooperation with Iran could also complicate diplomacy outside the Ukraine conflict, including efforts to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. U.S. officials say the talks have made some progress over the past few weeks. But some skeptics of the deal argue that deepening ties between Moscow and Tehran could mean that if sanctions were lifted on Iran, the regime would be better placed to help Russia counter the effects of its economic isolation. The senior Biden administration official said that argument “doesn’t hold up.” Any Iranian bank or company that tried to help Russia violate sanctions would be sanctioned and the nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA, would not prevent the strict enforcement of sanctions targeting Russia. “Iran can try to help Russia evade sanctions without the JCPOA or with the JCPOA. And we’ll obviously look for ways to frustrate that regardless,” the official said."
2022-08-30,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/europe/ukraine-russia-kherson-counteroffensive-putin-zelenskyy-crimea-rcna45477,,"KYIV, Ukraine — A surge in fighting on the southern front line and a Ukrainian claim of new attacks on Russian positions fed speculation Tuesday that a long-expected counteroffensive has started to try to turn the tide of the war. But Ukrainian officials warned against excessive optimism in a war that has seen similar expectations of changing fortunes before, and the Russian defense ministry claimed an attempt by Ukraine’s troops to launch an offensive had failed and caused heavy casualties. Even though independent verification of battlefield moves has been extremely tough, the British defense ministry said in an intelligence report that, as of early Monday, “several brigades of the Ukrainian Armed Forces increased the weight of artillery fires in front line sectors across southern Ukraine.” Attention centered on potential damage Ukraine might have inflicted on Russian positions around the port city of Kherson, a major economic hub close to the Black Sea and one of Moscow’s prized possessions since it started the invasion just over half a year ago. Ukraine’s presidential office reported Tuesday that “powerful explosions continued during the day and night in the Kherson region. Tough battles are ongoing practically across all” of the strategic area. Ukrainian forces, the report said, have destroyed a number of ammunition depots in the region and all large bridges across the Dnieper River that are vital to bring supplies to the Russian troops. The Russian state news agency Tass reported five explosions rocking Kherson on Tuesday morning — blasts likely caused by air defense systems at work. The Ukrainian military’s Operation Command South also reported destroying a pontoon crossing the Dnieper that the Russian forces were setting up and hitting a dozen command posts in several areas of the Kherson region with artillery fire. “The most important thing is Ukrainian artillery’s work on the bridges, which the Russian military can no longer use,” Ukrainian independent military analyst Oleh Zhdanov told The Associated Press. “Even the barges have been destroyed. The Russians can’t sustain forces near Kherson — this is the most important.” On Monday, the southern command center’s Nataliya Gumenyuik told the Ukrainian news outlet Liga.Net that Kyiv’s forces have launched offensive operations “in many directions in our area of responsibility and have breached the enemy’s first line of defense.” The statement quickly made headlines after weeks of reports that Ukraine forces were preparing an offensive there and as Ukrainian attacks on the Kherson region intensified. Zhdanov said that Russia has three lines of defense in the Kherson region and that breaching the first one signals only “isolated offensive actions by the Ukrainian army.” The war has ground to a stalemate over the past months with casualties rising and the local population bearing the brunt of suffering during relentless shelling in the east and also in the wider area around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has also been at the heart of fighting in Ukraine. Amid fears the plant could be damaged, leading to a radioactive leak, a U.N. nuclear watchdog team has arrived in Kyiv and is further preparing a mission to safeguard the Russian-occupied plant from nuclear catastrophe. The stakes couldn’t be higher for the International Atomic Energy Agency experts, who will visit the plant in a country where the 1986 Chernobyl disaster spewed radiation throughout the region, shocking the world and intensifying a global push away from nuclear energy. Compounding an already complicated task is the inability of both sides in the war to agree on much beyond allowing the team to go there. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the wider region around the nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, time and again. Nikopol, which is just across the Dnieper from the Zaporizhzhia plant, once again came under a barrage of heavy shelling, local authorities said, with a bus station, stores and a children’s library sustaining damage. And the city of Zaporizhzhia itself, about 30 miles away, was targeted by a Russian missile strike, the Ukraine presidential office said. The dangers of a leak are now so high that officials have begun handing out anti-radiation iodine tablets to nearby residents. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacted to speculation in his nightly video address Monday, about whether his forces had launched a major counteroffensive. “Anyone want to know what our plans are? You won’t hear specifics from any truly responsible person. Because this is war.” From the other side, the Moscow-appointed regional leader of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, dismissed the Ukrainian assertion of an offensive in the Kherson region as false. He said Ukrainian forces have suffered big losses in the area. And for its part, the Russian defense ministry said its forces had inflicted heavy personnel and military equipment losses on Ukrainian troops. The Kherson region is just north of the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 to set off a conflict that was largely frozen until the Feb. 24 invasion."
2022-08-29,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/inspectors-ukraine-nuclear-plant-zaporizhzhia-iaea-rcna45214,,"International inspectors were heading Monday to the Ukrainian nuclear plant at the center of growing alarm about a potential radiation disaster. The United Nations nuclear watchdog mission is set to arrive at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power plant later this week, offering hope for progress even as the two warring sides exchanged new accusations of shelling around the complex in southern Ukraine. “The day has come,” Rafael Grossi, the head of the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a tweet early Monday, announcing that a team was ""on its way"" after weeks of negotiations about getting nuclear inspectors access to the site near the conflict's front lines. “We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility,” he said. The mission, which will be led by Grossi, will assess physical damage to the plant, determine how well its safety systems are functioning, evaluate working conditions for its staff and perform any urgent safeguard activities, the IAEA said in a separate tweet. The inspectors are expected to arrive in Zaporizhzhia as early as Wednesday, two people with knowledge of the matter told NBC News. After making their way from Kyiv, the individuals said, the group will meet with local officials in Zaporizhzhia, in addition to their site visit to the nuclear plant, which is located in nearby Enerhodar. They said the inspectors are expected to spend several days inspecting the power plant. The U.N.’s atomic energy agency has warned for months about the risk of a nuclear catastrophe, and has sought to send in a team to inspect and help secure the safety of the plant. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Moscow considers the mission necessary, the Russian state news agency Tass reported. He was quoted as saying that Russia will ensure the safety of the IAEA inspectors on the territory that it controls, but reiterated Moscow's opposition to creating a demilitarized zone around the plant. It's up to the international community to pressure Kyiv to reduce tensions around the site, he added. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Monday that the mission ""will be the hardest in the history of IAEA"" given the active fighting on the ground. Kuleba said earlier that the inspectors were expected to arrive in Kyiv Monday. Last week, fighting in the area temporarily disconnected the plant from Ukraine’s power grid for the first time in its 40-year history, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying the incident left the world narrowly avoiding a radiation catastrophe. On Friday, Ukrainian authorities began distributing iodine tablets to residents near the plant in case of any future radiation leak, bringing back painful memories in a country still haunted by the 1986 nuclear disaster at Chernobyl. Ukraine’s allies have urged Russia to hand over control, and the U.N. has warned that any attack on the plant would be ""suicidal."" Kyiv and Moscow have been trading blame for shelling at the plant for weeks. NBC News could not verify either side’s claims. The Zaporizhzhia plant has been under Russian control since the Kremlin's forces seized land in the south in March, but Ukrainian engineers continue to operate it. Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, Energoatom, said earlier Monday that Russia “increased pressure” on the station’s personnel ahead of the IAEA mission’s arrival in order “to prevent them from disclosing evidence of the occupiers’ crimes at the plant and its use as a military base.” It did not provide any evidence for the claim. In its latest update Sunday, the IAEA said that despite reports of renewed shelling in recent days, all safety systems remained operational and there had been no increase in radiation levels. The United States accused Russia of failing to acknowledge the “grave radiological risk” at the plant, and blocking the final draft of a review of a key U.N. nuclear nonproliferation treaty over the issue. The news of the mission to Zaporizhzhia was welcomed by the Group of Seven countries, which includes the U.S. In a statement released Monday, it said the IAEA staff must be able to access all nuclear facilities in Ukraine “timely, safely and without impediment.” It came as Ukraine appeared to launch its long-awaited counteroffensive against Russian-occupied areas in the south, including the Kherson region. “Today we started offensive actions in different directions,” southern military command spokesperson Natalia Humeniuk told Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne. Military observers have been anticipating a counterattack on the ground in the south for months as Kyiv seemingly targeted Russian weapons depots and other military installations behind its defensive lines there and in nearby Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014."
2022-08-29,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-counteroffensive-russian-held-south-kherson-rcna45265,,"Ukraine announced a military offensive Monday in areas across its south, signaling the launch of a long-awaited push to retake Russian-held territory. “Today, we started offensive actions in different directions,” Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for the southern military command, told Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne. The apparent start of the major counteroffensive comes after weeks of buildup and nearly six months since Russian forces seized swaths of territory in southern Ukraine in the early days of the war. Kyiv has long vowed to retake that land and has displayed growing confidence in recent weeks, increasingly taking the initiative in a conflict that the Kremlin itself has admitted was stalled. Military observers have been anticipating a counterattack on the ground in the south as Ukraine seemingly targeted Russian military sites, as well as key bridges, with strikes deep behind defensive lines there and in nearby Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014. The front lines in the south are centered on Kherson, a region Russia seized in its entirety in March. A strategic gateway to the Black Sea and Crimea, it has been critical in cementing Moscow’s grasp on the area. The extent of the Ukrainian offensive and any gains made were unclear as social media buzzed with unconfirmed reports. Humeniuk expressed caution and called for patience, noting that the Russian military was still strong and had been reinforcing its positions in the area. “We do not declare the beginning of the offensive or the end of the offensive,” she said in a clarifying comment by phone. “But under the pressure of our actions, the enemy began to retreat. It is currently recorded that the enemy has withdrawn from some of its positions.” NBC News has not verified the claim. “Early reports are that Ukrainian forces have broken through the first set of Russian defenses in places around Kherson,” said Neil Melvin, the director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. “These were likely defended by some of the weaker Russian forces, notably from the occupied eastern areas of Ukraine, and the real test of Ukraine’s ability to turn back the Russian forces is still likely to lie ahead,” he said. Regarding the current operations, White House spokesman John Kirby said, “There have been efforts throughout the six months of this war where Ukraine has gone on the offense. This is a major offensive effort but the idea of being on the offense is not new to Ukrainians."" He declined to comment on future Ukrainian operations. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appeared to make a veiled reference to the news. “The only possible option for negotiations with Russia is being conducted by a special Ukrainian delegation in the southern and other directions of the front-line,” he said in a tweet. But Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration for the Kherson region, denied the reports of a Ukrainian offensive, calling them a “fantasy” and adding that the region’s capital was leading “a peaceful life,” the Russian state news agency Tass reported Monday. Russian media also reported Ukrainian strikes on the occupied towns of Nova Kakhovka and Beryslav near the city of Kherson overnight. Meanwhile, the governor of the nearby Mykolaiv region, Vitaliy Kim, said at least two people were killed and 11 injured in what he described were heavy Russian strikes on the city of Mykolaiv, which is under Ukraine’s control. It came amid ongoing fears of a nuclear catastrophe at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, also in Ukraine’s south, as an international team of nuclear experts finally set out Monday to inspect the site. Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of continuing to strike the plant despite the risk of a radiation disaster. NBC News has not verified the claims of either side. Without a clear picture of what exactly transpired on the battlefield in the south, some military experts were reserved in their analysis. “It’s a bit too early to tell, but the Ukrainians have been paving the way for an offensive for several weeks now,” said Michael A. Horowitz, a geopolitical and security analyst and the head of intelligence at Le Beck consultancy. “I think the Ukrainian military is also keeping a tight lid on tactical information for operational purposes, which to me also means that this is a major offensive,” he added. The apparent offensive could mean the war has now entered its most important stage since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February, Melvin said. “The Ukrainian armed forces are aiming to destroy Russian forces west of the Dnipro River and to reclaim the city of Kherson, and possibly further north to Zaporizhzhia, as well as inflicting heavy losses on Russian forces in occupied areas further east,” he added. “If this can be achieved, it will raise the prospect that Russians can be defeated in the conflict and drive a spike through the heart of Putin’s war strategy.”"
2022-08-27,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-shelling-zelenskyy-rcna45089,,"Russian forces fired missiles and artillery on Ukrainian-held areas across the river from Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, officials said Saturday, amid fears that fighting around the complex could trigger a radiation leak or an even bigger catastrophe. As concern persisted about safety at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Valentyn Reznichenko, the governor of Ukraine‘s Dnipropetrovsk region, said in a Telegram post that Grad missiles and artillery shells had hit the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, both of which are across the Dnieper River, about 6 miles away from the facility. After power lines were damaged in Nikopol “almost 5,000 families were left without electricity,” Reznichenko said, adding that homes and an educational center had also been hit. Russia’s Defense Ministry, meanwhile, in a post on its Telegram channel Saturday, accused Ukrainian artillery units of shelling areas around the facility three times in the past 24 hours. Ukrainian forces hit a roof of a building that contains nuclear fuel, the post said. Each side has repeatedly accused the other of shelling the complex in southeastern Ukraine, raising fears that the fighting could trigger a catastrophe. NBC News could not independently verify either claim, which came after Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy warned, in a late-night video address, that the situation around the plant remained “very risky and dangerous.” The facility was temporarily disconnected from the national power grid on Thursday for the first time in its 40-year history, heightening fears of a nuclear disaster in a country still haunted by the 1986 explosion at Chernobyl. Exactly what went wrong Thursday was unclear, but Zelenskyy said that “any actions by Russia that could trigger the shutdown of the reactors will again put the plant one step away from disaster.” Seized by Russian forces in March, the plant is still operated by Ukrainian technicians from Ukraine's state nuclear company, Energoatom. The U.N.’s atomic energy agency has warned about the risk posed by conflict for months and has tried to send in a team to inspect and help secure the plant. Officials told The Associated Press that preparations for the visit were underway, but it remained unclear when it might take place. Ukraine and its international allies, including the United States, have been urging Russia to hand over control of the plant. With safety concerns persisting, Ukrainian authorities began distributing iodine tablets to residents near the facility on Friday. The pills were being distributed to those who live within a 50 kilometer (30 mile) radius of the plant in Enerhodar, Volodymyr Marchuk, a spokesperson for the Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration, told NBC News. Recipients were instructed not to take them preventively, he said, adding that they were “being distributed in case of any future radiation leak, at which time the government would instruct people to take the tablets.” Potassium iodide tablets can block one type of radioactive material and are used in nuclear emergencies to help protect the thyroid, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Earlier this week, authorities in the region also started to draw up emergency plans to evacuate civilians in the event of a disaster. Elsewhere in Ukraine, one person was killed and another wounded in the Russian firing in the Mykolaiv region, local government officials said. Mykolaiv city is an important Black Sea port and shipbuilding center. The governor of the eastern Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said Saturday that two people were had been killed in the Russian firing on the city of Bakhmut, a significant target for Russian and separatist forces seeking to take control of the parts of the region they do not already hold."
2022-08-27,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-europe-sanctions-tourist-ban-vacations-moscow-putin-rcna44761,,"KYIV, Ukraine — Outraged and anguished after six months of war in Ukraine, Europe is wrestling over a question with deep diplomatic and moral implications: whether to ban Russian travelers. Kyiv’s allies have been aghast at the split-screen juxtaposition of Russian tourists sunning themselves on Mediterranean beaches while many Ukrainians spend some of their summer in bomb shelters, dodging missiles and artillery. Fueled by a plea from Ukraine’s government earlier this month, the debate over visa bans is raging from Brussels to Washington, underscoring longstanding fractures within the West over how aggressively to confront Russia in the war’s next phase. At the heart of the moral question hanging over European capitals is the Russian public’s culpability: Whether ordinary citizens, by putting up little visible opposition, are enabling President Vladimir Putin’s war. Europe’s struggle to answer that question is pitting competing values against each other: pluralism and fairness versus national sovereignty; accountability for a country’s actions versus the moral hazards of “collective punishment.” “We are not speaking about punishment, we’re speaking about restrictive measures which are aiming to end the war,” Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu told NBC News via Zoom this week. “The right to enter any particular country is not a human right.” The decision could have significant economic ramifications for the continent. Russian travelers spent $22.5 billion last year in foreign countries, according to the analytics firm GlobalData, and there were some 13.7 million international departures from Russia. Among the most popular destinations for Russians, the group says: Italy and Cyprus. Kyiv wants that to change and has called for countries in the European Union and the Group of Seven — a club that includes the United States — to ban Russian travelers. The issue may come to a head next week at an E.U. foreign ministers meeting in Prague, but not all Western nations are on the same page. Germany is against a visa ban affecting “ordinary Russians,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said recently, adding: “This is Putin’s war.” The E.U.’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, told a conference in Spain on Monday that it was “not a good idea” and that “we have to be more selective.” This week, the U.S. also came out against a visa ban. “The U.S. wouldn’t want to close off pathways to refuge and safety for Russia’s dissidents or others who are vulnerable to human rights abuses,” a State Department spokesman said. “It is important to draw a line between the actions of the Russian government and its policies in Ukraine, and the people of Russia.” Yet, many countries on Moscow’s doorstep have led the charge to stop letting in Russians, in some cases citing security concerns given the ongoing war. Finland plans to slash the number of visas issued to Russians by 90 percent. And Poland has said it supports the E.U. denying Russians the Schengen visas, which allow passport-free travel within 26 European countries."
2022-08-26,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-radiation-fears-iodine-rcna45041,,"KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian authorities began distributing iodine tablets to residents near Europe’s largest nuclear power plant on Friday, amid fears that fighting around the complex could trigger a radiation leak or an even bigger catastrophe.

He did not say whether they were going to be distributed, but he stressed that radiation levels at the plant and its surrounding areas were normal. Potassium iodine tablets can block one type of radioactive material and are used in nuclear emergencies to help protect the thyroid, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Earlier Friday, the country’s state nuclear company, Energoatom, said the plant was being safely powered through a repaired line from the power grid, a day after it was disconnected from the national power grid. There were no issues with the plant’s machinery or safety systems, it said. It was later announced that the plant had been reconnected to Ukraine’s power grid and was producing enough electricity to meet the country’s needs. The plant has been occupied by Russian forces and run by Ukrainian workers since the early days of the 6-month-old war, and both sides have repeatedly accused each other of shelling the site. Exactly what went wrong Thursday was unclear, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy blamed Russian shelling for the damage in a late-night video address Thursday. He said catastrophe was averted only because the plant’s safety systems kicked in with backup power. “The world must understand what a threat this is: If the diesel generators hadn’t turned on, if the automation and our staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would now be forced to overcome the consequences of the radiation accident,” he said. “Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster,” Zelenskyy added. However, Russian-installed officials in the surrounding Zaporizhzhia region sought to play down the gravity of the situation. “There was just an emergency situation” that was handled by the plant’s safety systems, Alexander Volga, a Russian-installed official in the nearby town of Enerhodar, told the state news agency Tass on Friday. NBC News has not verified either side’s claims. As the accusations flew about the plant, Belarus’ authoritarian leader, President Alexander Lukashenko, said Friday that the country’s warplanes have been modified to carry nuclear weapons in line with an agreement with ally Russia. Lukashenko said the upgrade followed his June meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who offered to make Belarusian combat aircraft nuclear-capable at Russian factories and to help train pilots. “Do you think it was all blather?” Lukashenko said to reporters Friday. “All of it has been done.”"

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, was back on the grid and supplying electricity to Ukraine on Friday, officials said, a day after it was disconnected from the national power grid for the first time in its 40-year history. Zelenskyy said in a late-night video address Thursday that after the last working line connecting it to Ukraine’s power grid was damaged by Russian shelling, it was only the plant’s safety systems kicking in with backup power that had averted catastrophe. “The world must understand what a threat this is: If the diesel generators hadn’t turned on, if the automation and our staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would now be forced to overcome the consequences of the radiation accident,” he said. “Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster,” Zelenskyy added.

The agency hailed the plant’s staff as heroes who “tirelessly and firmly hold the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders.” But authorities nonetheless began distributing iodine tablets to residents near the plant Friday in case of a radiation leak, amid mounting fears that the fighting around the complex could trigger a catastrophe, the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration confirmed to NBC News. Russian-installed officials in the surrounding Zaporizhzhia region sought to play down the gravity of the situation. “There was just an emergency situation” that was handled by the plant’s safety systems, Alexander Volga, a Russian-installed official in the nearby town of Enerhodar, told the state news agency Tass on Friday. Intense fighting around the site has spurred growing fears of a catastrophe. The two sides have traded blame for the attacks, with world leaders calling for a demilitarized zone around the nuclear complex while pushing for access for United Nations inspectors. Any damage to the plant would be “suicide,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned earlier this month. “It was potentially a very, very dangerous situation,” said Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, who led the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense forces known as CBRN in both the British army and NATO. Cooling systems and other mechanisms that are essential to the safe operation of the reactors need power to run them, while emergency diesel generators are sometimes unreliable. “The generators at Zaporizhzhia are in an unknown condition, thought to be not in great condition mainly because the Russians have occupied the site for six months, had not allowed inspectors in and maintenance has not been taking place as it should be,” de Bretton-Gordon said. “So we now have the safety mechanisms being run on generators, which we are not 100% certain are reliable.” “Absolutely had those generators failed, we would then be in a serious position,” he added. Nuclear experts have raised concerns before about the risk the fighting could pose to the plant’s reactors and the silos of nuclear waste around it. Ukraine and its international allies, including the United States, have been urging Russia to hand over control of the plant. Moscow captured the site in March and has controlled it since, although Ukrainian engineers still operate it. As the accusations flew about the plant, Belarus' authoritarian leader President Alexander Lukashenko said Friday that the country’s warplanes have been modified to carry nuclear weapons in line with an agreement with ally Russia.

2022-08-25,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-orders-increase-russian-armed-forces-ukraine-war-rcna44774,,"Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree Thursday increasing his country’s armed forces by 137,000 as the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine passed the six-month mark. Putin’s decree will increase the number of combat personnel in the armed forces by about 10%, to 1.15 million. That will take the military’s total head count to 2.04 million. A copy of the order on a Russian government website says it goes into effect Jan. 1. It was published online and reported on by Russian state media. No reason for the boost was immediately given. It also orders that the Russian government ensure funds are provided for the increase from the federal budget. A previous such order signed by Putin in 2017 boosted the headcount to 1.9 million, of which 1.01 million were combat personnel. The decree comes just a day after Putin’s defense chief acknowledged that the Russian military campaign in Ukraine has stalled, with experts saying the Kremlin's troops appeared demoralized and understaffed. Russian forces failed to capture the capital, Kyiv, but now control large parts of Ukraine’s south and east, where Moscow has refocused most of its forces in the industrial Donbas region. In recent weeks the world's attention has been focused on a nuclear plant in the south, where fighting has fueled growing alarm about a potential disaster — Ukraine said shelling caused the Russian-occupied plant to be disconnected from the country's power grid Thursday. Wednesday marked six months since Putin’s army launched the full-scale invasion of its neighbor, an anniversary that coincided with Ukraine’s Independence Day in dual symbolism that prompted warnings that Russia might use the occasion to step up attacks. Those fears materialized when Kyiv said at least 25 people were killed in a Russian rocket strike on a train station in the central town of Chaplyne. Moscow confirmed the strike but not the civilian casualties, saying Thursday that more than 200 Ukrainian soldiers and military equipment headed for the Donbas were destroyed in the attack. Russia has not recently released any estimates of how many of its troops have been killed or injured in Ukraine. Kyiv says the number is more than 45,000. Ukraine said this week that 9,000 of its military personnel have been killed, publicly disclosing the number for the first time since the invasion. NBC News has not verified the claims or the number of dead or injured on either side."
2022-08-25,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/22-reported-killed-rocket-attack-ukraine-independence-day-rcna44731,,"Russian forces Wednesday launched a rocket attack on a Ukrainian train station on the embattled country’s Independence Day, killing 25 people, Ukrainian officials said after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Moscow might attempt “something particularly cruel” this week. The lethal attack took place in Chaplyne, a town of about 3,500 people in the central Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukrainian news agencies quoted Zelenskyy as telling the U.N. Security Council via video. The president’s office also reported that an 11-year-old child was killed by rocket fire earlier in the day in the settlement. “Chaplyne is our pain today,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. At one point, Zelenskyy put the number of wounded at about 50. On Thursday, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a deputy head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said in a post on the Telegram messaging app that 31 people have been injured. He also said there were two children among the 25 killed in the attack. ""An 11-year-old boy died under the rubble of a house, another 6-year-old died in a car fire near the railway station,"" Tymoshenko said. Ukraine had been bracing for especially heavy attacks around the national holiday that commemorates Ukraine’s declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Wednesday also marked the six-month point in the war. Days ahead of Independence Day, Kyiv authorities banned large gatherings in the capital through Thursday for fear of missile strikes. Nevertheless, a festive atmosphere prevailed during the day at Kyiv’s Maidan square as thousands of residents posed for pictures next to burned-out Russian tanks put on display. Folk singers set up, and many revelers — ignoring the sirens — were out and about in traditionally embroidered dresses and shirts. Others were fearful. “I can’t sleep at night because of what I see and hear about what is being done in Ukraine,” said a retiree who gave only her first name, Tetyana, her voice shaking with emotion. “This is not a war. It is the destruction of the Ukrainian people.” In a holiday message to the country, Zelenskyy exulted over Ukraine’s success in fending off Moscow’s forces since the invasion, saying: “On Feb. 24, we were told: You have no chance. On Aug. 24, we say: Happy Independence Day, Ukraine!” Britain’s Johnson urged Western allies to stand by Ukraine through the winter. “This is not the time to put forward flimsy negotiating proposals,” he said. “You can’t negotiate with a bear when it’s eating your leg or with a street robber when he has you pinned to the floor.” A car bombing outside Moscow that killed the 29-year-old daughter of right-wing Russian political theorist Alexander Dugin on Saturday also heightened fears that Russia might intensify attacks on Ukraine this week. Russian officials have blamed Ukraine for the death of Darya Dugina, a pro-Kremlin TV commentator. Ukraine has denied any involvement. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces have encountered unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance in their invasion and abandoned their effort to storm the capital in the spring. The fighting has turned into a slog that has reduced neighborhoods to rubble and sent shock waves through the world economy. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, speaking Wednesday at a meeting of his counterparts from a security organization dominated by Russia and China, claimed the slow pace of Moscow’s military action was due to what he said was an effort to spare civilians. Russian forces have repeatedly targeted civilian areas in cities, including hospitals and a Mariupol theater where hundreds of people were taking shelter. But Shoigu said Russia is carrying out strikes with precision weapons against Ukrainian military targets, and “everything is done to avoid civilian casualties.” “Undoubtedly, it slows down the pace of the offensive, but we do it deliberately,” he said. On the battlefield, Russian forces struck several towns and villages in Donetsk province in the east over 24 hours, killing one person, authorities said. A building materials superstore in the city of Donetsk was hit by a shell and erupted in flames, the mayor said. There were no immediate reports of any injuries. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Russians again shelled the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, damaging several buildings and wounding people, authorities said. Russian troops also shelled the city of Zaporizhzhia, but no casualties were reported. In addition, Russian rockets struck unspecified targets in the Khmelnytskyi region, about 180 miles west of Kyiv, the regional governor said. Attacks there have been infrequent."
2022-08-24,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-independence-day-zelenskyy-reborn-russia-war-six-months-rcna44548,,"Ukraine was “reborn” when Russia invaded six months ago, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday as his country observed its Independence Day marked by fears that Moscow may step up its attacks. Kyiv’s international allies offered praise and new promises of military aid to mark the occasion, with President Joe Biden announcing a package of nearly $3 billion that he said would allow the country to acquire weapons to defend itself over the long term. The festivities were subdued, however, with mass gatherings canceled and Ukrainians across the country told to be vigilant in case Russia unleashed fresh strikes. But the symbolism of a nation celebrating its identity six months after its neighbor's tanks rolled across the border in an effort to erase it was evident in Zelenskyy’s address. “On Feb. 24, we were told: You have no chance. On Aug. 24, we say: Happy Independence Day, Ukraine!” Zelenskyy said in a recorded video, which aired early on the 31st anniversary of Ukraine’s independence from Soviet rule. The country’s perseverance throughout the six months of conflict has shaped it like nothing before, the 44-year-old leader told Ukrainians as he stood in Kyiv’s historic Maidan Square, wearing his signature military slacks. “We finally became truly one,” he said. “A new nation that emerged on Feb. 24 at 4 a.m. Not born, but reborn.” Biden hailed Ukrainians' ""extraordinary courage"" in a statement that also acknowledged the “bittersweet” nature of the occasion. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were among the other world leaders who used the occasion to praise Ukraine’s resistance and vow to stand by its side for as long as it takes. In Moscow — as a war the Kremlin hoped would be long over stretches on — Russia's defense chief acknowledged that its offensive had slowed, while the arrest of an opposition politician highlighted the domestic crackdown on dissent. Zelenskyy warned earlier that Russia may unleash “repugnant provocations and brutal strikes” Wednesday. The United States also said that it had information that “Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days.” Local authorities — from Kharkiv in the east to Lviv in the west — have warned people to pay more attention to air raid sirens, respect curfews and work from home, if possible. Some air raid sirens sounded in an otherwise quiet Kyiv early on Wednesday, but perhaps the most potent sign of the war in Ukraine’s capital was the procession of burned-out Russian military vehicles displayed defiantly in the heart of the city. Having held on to Kyiv, Zelenskyy renewed his vow to recapture the eastern region of the Donbas, large swaths of which Russia now controls, and Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014. “What is the end of the war for us?? We used to say: peace. Now we say: victory,” he said in the address."

The administration announced the package on Wednesday, which is not only Ukraine’s independence day but is also six months to the day since Russia invaded. The package will fall under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which draws weapons and equipment from private industry rather than the Presidential Drawdown Authority, which draws from the U.S. stockpile. The package includes radars, surface-to-air missiles, ammunition drones and laser-guided rockets. weapons with newly developed capabilities, a response to the Defense Department’s request this year for private industry to develop and speed new capabilities to Ukraine. In part, the contents of the package reflect the Pentagon's request to private industry this year to develop and speed new capabilities to Ukraine. The Pentagon had specifically asked for air defense, anti-tank and unmanned aerial systems and communications equipment. Many of the systems will not be in the hands of Ukrainian fighters for months or years because they’re still being developed, the officials said."
2022-08-23,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/russia-losing-war-ukraine-rcna44437,,"Only a few months after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus asked a journalist, “Tell me how this ends.” As the war between Russia and Ukraine passes its sixth month, this question feels timely once again. On Monday, Russia’s FSB security agency claimed that Ukraine’s secret services had orchestrated a shocking car bomb that killed the daughter of a close Putin ally, war booster and Russian ultranationalist over the weekend. This claim, made without evidence, could well be a ploy for Russian escalation. While our crystal ball may be cloudy, the number of possible outcomes seem to be narrowing. Clearly, the situation is changing, which makes any definitive answer to this query impossible. But while our crystal ball may be cloudy, the number of possible outcomes seem to be narrowing. Importantly, war is a “means,” not an “end.” And this war was misunderstood before it even started. Many experts argued that Moscow would never go through with an invasion. Others believed the Kremlin would quickly occupy much of the country, based on Russia’s overwhelming military superiority. The strength and resilience of the Ukrainian resistance was grossly underestimated. The abilities of the Russian military were terribly overestimated. That poor read of military capability has defined the war thus far. The determination of Ukraine and its Western allies will define it in the future. The West is confronted with another “long twilight struggle,” as President John F. Kennedy called it, that will continue even after this conflict ends. Time remains a significant resource on both sides, as Moscow works to hold its population’s support together and undermine democratic values. Russian President Vladimir Putin certainly believes he is winning. He is convinced that the willpower and determination of an autocrat is superior to the patience and focus of democracies. But what has so far helped Ukraine and the West are Putin’s two enormous strategic miscalculations. He clearly believed Russia could achieve a quick victory, and also thought the West would remain divided and unable to mount a cohesive response. Ukraine pushed the Russians back from the gates of the capital, Kyiv, and they successfully defended their second-largest city, Kharkiv. Their defiant 82-day defense of Mariupol served not only as a rallying point for Ukrainian resistance but as a focal point for Russian military incompetence. It slowed the Russian westward advance, forced the Kremlin to expend substantial amounts of men and materiel, and demonstrated that Putin’s description of the invasion as a “special military technical operation” was patently false. In terms of Western resolve, Putin may have ironically done more for NATO unity than anyone since the end of the Cold War. NATO increased its forces and many member states announced significant increases in their defense budgets. At its recent summit, NATO leaders condemned Moscow, reaffirmed their support for Ukraine, and welcomed Sweden and Finland as new members. The alliance appears strong. But the human and material costs to Ukraine and Russia have been enormous. Russian forces still have a significant advantage in manpower, weapons and ammunition, but there is evidence they are running out of precision-guided weapons and modern equipment. Furthermore, the Defense Department estimates Moscow has suffered over 70,000 casualties so far. That means nearly one half of the Russian force that attacked Ukraine on Feb. 24 are either dead, wounded, captured or missing. Britain’s top intelligence officer, Richard Moore, the head of MI6, said in July it appeared Russia’s military was “about to run out of steam.” Its shortage of willing and competent soldiers is now a major challenge for the Kremlin. Putin has called for more volunteers, yet he has made no announcements about mass mobilization and expanded conscription, nor has he officially declared war or warned his citizens to prepare for more sacrifice. Ukraine’s major military challenge is a shortage of weapons. Western military equipment has been essential to Kyiv’s slowing the Russian advance, and the delivery of American High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) has had a significant impact. Still, Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly complained that more Western military aid is essential if they are to evict Russian forces from their territory. It’s possible Putin hopes to formally annex those portions of Ukraine under Russian control, at least according to U.S. intelligence reports. This includes a sizable portion of the Donbas region and the southern coast. But as the pace slows, both sides have become mired in an artillery slugfest fighting for incremental territorial gains in the Donbas region, as Ukraine appears poised for a counteroffensive in the south. Kyiv has also conducted a series of high profile special operations attacks on Russian air bases and supply line The war could certainly continue to drag along for many months, with neither side able to achieve decisive victory. It is important to acknowledge that fighting in the eastern portion of Ukraine began in 2014 following the first Russian invasion. Over the intervening eight years, over 14,000 Ukrainians were killed and fighting continued intermittently until the invasion on Feb. 24. Putin might consider escalation should a similar a stalemate occur. This could mean “horizontal escalation,” including cyberattacks or efforts to foment a crisis somewhere else. (Recent Russian threats against Lithuania and Estonia might be an example.) It could also mean “vertical escalation,” including threats to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine or the West. The number of explicit nuclear threats against the U.S. and its European allies has reached nearly three dozen. Such threats have prevented the West from direct military intervention, but they have failed to fully intimidate or deter either Kyiv or the West. Ultimately, victory for Putin must combine success on the battlefield with political aspiration. Some commentators believe if Russia can secure the Donbas, Putin could declare a cease-fire and seek negotiations. President Emmanuel Macron of France and Henry Kissinger have urged negotiations. Ukraine should prepare to cede land for peace, according to this view. But it is a short-sighted perspective. Putin’s territorial desires in the Donbas region, while important, are the least of his ambitions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy correctly argued that a cease-fire while Russia occupies Ukrainian territory would actually prolong the war and provide Putin with more time to plan a new attack. His goal to subjugate Ukraine remains. Moscow continues to “Russify” the areas it controls by introducing the ruble as local currency, appointing new political leaders, improving its ability to defend occupied territories, and declaring occupied Ukrainian territory as part of Russia. Other Russian officials, meanwhile, seem to confirm Putin’s desire to destroy Ukrainian sovereignty. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Security Council, described the goals of the invasion as the end of the Kiev government and of Ukrainian neutrality. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev wondered if Ukraine would even “exist” in two years. While Putin might accept an interim solution, he seeks — at a minimum — a new security architecture in Europe and in a broader sense a new world order. President Joe Biden and his administration must prepare both the American people and our NATO allies for dueling possibilities. The war may become a true slog; it may also end abruptly and messily. Across Europe, there is now widespread concern that Russia may reduce the export of natural gas needed to heat homes for the upcoming winter. Putin may also feel emboldened by a series of shake-ups among Western governments, and because Americans seem increasingly distracted and less interested in the war. Consequently, Biden must both at home and abroad “transform short-term unity borne of reactive shock into enduring cohesion, borne of affirmative purpose,” Ali Wyne, a senior analyst at the Eurasia Group, told The New York Times. Biden must also provide the critical leadership that will ensure that NATO keeps its promise of “unwavering support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,” as Secretary of State Antony Blinken put it more than a month before the invasion. In his inaugural address in January 1961, Kennedy observed, “Now the trumpet summons us again — not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need — not as a call to battle, though embattled we are — but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation.” For Putin and his view of the future to fail, these words must resonate once again. The drama surrounding the car bombing over the weekend, coupled with fears that Russia could be planning an imminent attack at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, highlight the global stakes of this unpredictable conflict. We may not know exactly how the war ends, but we know enough to understand why the fate of the West and Ukraine remain inextricably, dangerously intertwined."

But this year, the country’s Independence Day also marks six months since Russia launched its full-scale invasion — dual symbolism that led the United States to warn of intensified attacks against civilian and government targets. Wednesday is the 31st anniversary of Ukraine’s independence from Soviet rule, an idea that runs counter to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rejection of the nation’s right to exist and lies at the heart of the dogged defense Ukraine has mounted through half a year of war. The U.S. Embassy issued a security alert urging Americans to leave the country. The double anniversary comes just days after the killing of a Russian ultranationalist’s daughter became a new flashpoint that experts fear Moscow may use as a pretext for escalation. Russia has struck on symbolic dates before. So Ukrainians are bracing themselves."

It offered no direct evidence for the claim, which Kyiv dismissed as Kremlin “propaganda."" Ukraine has denied any role and experts expressed doubts that it would be involved. Speculation has swirled about who might be behind what Russian President Vladimir Putin called a “vile, cruel crime,” but most theories share a belief that her father, Alexander Dugin, a vehement supporter of the war and an ideologue sometimes referred to as “Putin's brain,” was a more likely target.

2022-08-21,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/dennis-rodman-says-going-russia-seek-release-brittney-griner-rcna44106,,"WASHINGTON — Former NBA player Dennis Rodman said Saturday that he plans to visit Russia to seek the release of Brittney Griner, the WNBA star who was sentenced to nine years in prison on drug charges earlier this month. ""I got permission to go to Russia to help that girl,"" Rodman told NBC News at a restaurant in D.C. ""I'm trying to go this week."" He is more likely to hurt than help, said a senior Biden administration official. “It’s public information that the administration has made a significant offer to the Russians and anything other than negotiating further through the established channel is likely to complicate and hinder release efforts,” said the official. If Rodman goes to Russia, it won't be the first time he has conducted informal diplomacy with an international leader who has strained relations with the U.S. Rodman has cultivated a relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over the past decade, making multiple visits to the hermit kingdom. He called Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cool"" after a 2014 trip to Moscow. In 2018, he showed up on the sidelines of former President Donald Trump's meeting with Kim in Singapore. And he has credited himself with helping to secure the release of American Kenneth Bae from North Korea. The U.S. has imposed stiff sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine and is aiding Ukraine’s forces. Griner's imprisonment has created an additional source of tension between the two countries — and a potential avenue for diplomacy. Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who has been involved in past hostage negotiations, told The Associated Press this month that he was optimistic about the chances for a prisoner swap that would bring Griner and another American, Paul Whelan, back to the U.S. The U.S. offer to Russia involved a swap of Griner and Whelan for imprisoned Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. Rodman, who was in Washington for a sneaker convention, does not need special permission from the U.S. to enter Russia — just a visa from Moscow. But the State Department has issued a travel advisory that strongly discourages American citizens from visiting the country. ""Do not travel to Russia,"" the State Department advises, citing a litany of reasons, including the ""unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine,"" potential ""harassment against U.S. citizens by Russian government security officials"" and the possibility of ""wrongful detention."" Though he has a much more established relationship with Kim, Rodman expressed confidence in his understanding of Russia's president. ""I know Putin too well,"" he said."

Mykhailo Razvozhaev, the Russian governor of occupied Crimea, said on his Telegram channel that he was at the building in the port city of Sevastapol when “drone flew to the roof. “Unfortunately, it was not shot down,” he said. But in a later “clarification” of the incident also posted to Telegram, he said the unmanned aerial vehicle was “shot down right above the fleet headquarters. It fell on the roof and caught fire. The defeat failed. Well done boys.” Photos and video posted online by Ukrainian politicians and media outlets appeared to show the aftermath of the attack, and a large plume of smoke could be seen rising from the fleet's headquarters. NBC News was not able to independently verify them. The attack came after a series of blasts hit military depots and airbases in the annexed peninsula over the past week, hinting at a growing ability by Ukraine’s military or its backers to strike deep behind enemy lines. Kyiv has stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility for the explosions, but a government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to disclose information about the strikes to journalists, confirmed to NBC News this week that pro-Ukrainian saboteurs were behind them. The official declined to say whether the Ukrainian military or special forces were also involved in the attacks. Elsewhere, Russia's Tass news agency reported that anti-aircraft systems shot down six Ukrainian drones over Nova Kakhova, a small town to the east of the city of Kherson. Home to about 300,000 people, Kherson is by far the largest town and first regional capital to be in Russian hands. Controlling the city also means Moscow can supply fresh water to its forces in Crimea. Elsewhere a Russian missile hit a residential area of a southern Ukrainian town not far from a nuclear power station on Saturday, wounding 12 civilians and heightening fears of a nuclear accident, Ukrainian officials said. Vitaliy Kim, governor of the Mykolaiv region, said on the Telegram messaging app that four children between the ages of 3 and 17 were among those wounded in an attack that damaged several private houses and a five-story apartment building in Voznesensk. The town is about 19 miles from the Pivdennoukrainsk Nuclear Power Plant, the second largest in Ukraine. Energoatom, Ukraine's energy company that manages all four of the country's nuclear energy generators, described the attack on Voznesensk as “another act of Russian nuclear terrorism.” “It is possible that this missile was aimed specifically at the Pivdennoukrainsk Nuclear Power Plant, which the Russian military tried to seize back at the beginning of March,” Energoatom said in a statement. Russia did not immediately respond to the accusation and NBC News was not able to independently verify the situation on the ground. The Mykolaiv strikes came after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, on Friday that shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which sits to the east of Mykolaiv, could result in a large-scale disaster. A readout of the call from Macron’s office said Putin agreed to an International Atomic Energy Agency mission to the plant."
2022-08-20,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraines-soldiers-rockets-drones-are-running-low-boots-t-shirts-rcna43902,,"ODESA, Ukraine — At a sprawling open-air market near the Black Sea, shoppers duck in and out of rusting shipping containers that have been converted to makeshift army surplus shops, scanning row upon row of uniforms, boots and tactical gear. Some are Ukrainian soldiers stocking up on supplies for the battlefield. Others, like former taxi driver Dmytro Kazmirchuk, are volunteers taking it upon themselves to outfit front-line troops who still lack the basics. “Ukraine wasn’t ready for this war. We never thought that our neighbor, who turned out to be our enemy, would resort to a full-scale invasion,” Kazmirchuk says as he picks out goggles, gloves and camouflage T-shirts for six service members he’s sponsoring in Donetsk. “Therefore, not everyone has everything.” Ukraine’s loudest pleas to its allies have been for fighter jets, air defense systems and long-range weapons to defend itself. The United States and its allies have answered many of those calls by providing billions of dollars worth of rockets, tanks, drones and artillery. Yet, as Russia’s war approaches the six-month mark, Ukraine is also burning through its stores of necessities that most modern militaries take for granted. Now, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukrainian troops and their supporters are seeking out creative solutions to crowdsource their way through the war. Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Zelenskyy, told NBC News that Ukraine’s military needs continual resupplies from allies of food, first-aid kits, vehicles, protective equipment, small arms and ammunition. At the height of Russia’s offensive, he said, it was firing up to 60,000 rounds of ammunition per day, forcing Ukraine to respond in turn. “The societies in certain partner countries do not fully understand the level of intensity of the war in Ukraine,” he said in an interview at the presidential offices in Kyiv. “This is a massive war; it is not just a minor regional conflict.” Part of the challenge in keeping Ukraine’s forces supplied is the growing number of people participating in the fight. In the run-up to the war, Ukraine’s armed forces comprised just under 200,000 active-duty troops, according to a report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based security think tank. Russia had more than four times that number, it said. Just hours after Russia invaded Feb. 24, Zelenskyy signed a decree ordering a “general mobilization” of the public, recently extended by Ukraine’s Parliament until November. Since then, hundreds of thousands of reservists, members of Ukraine’s Territorial Defense Forces and others have joined the battle. “There’s also police, and National Guard are also (serving) in the front,” said Yevheniya Kravchuk, a member of Parliament whose husband is in the national police force. “They basically have needs the same as our military.” In May, Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s armed forces had grown to 700,000-strong. That same month, he launched a national crowdfunding drive, United24, to bring in donations of cash, medical equipment and defense supplies, audited by Deloitte Ukraine. Through an online portal, donors are asked to sponsor specific items that, once purchased, are rushed to the front lines: $4,000 for a metal detector to aid in clearing land mines; $80,000 for an armored ambulance. The project is also trying to acquire an “army of drones” to help Ukraine’s military monitor the 1,200-mile-long front line. The campaign includes a drop-off site just outside New York City where donors can drop off their own hobby drones to be sent to Ukraine. With emergency medical supplies also in growing need, the project recently said it purchased 35 artificial ventilation devices, to be used by paramedics and doctors who work 24-hour shifts evacuating troops and civilians injured near the front lines. As he practiced intubating a medical dummy in his ambulance at an Odesa hospital, Dr. Eduardo Kika said the devices have helped save lives of patients injured in mine explosions, and those with lung failure or with traumatic brain injuries who can’t breathe for themselves. “Unfortunately, we do not have enough devices. We have a shortage of ventilators,” the emergency physician and anesthesiologist said through a translator. He said tourniquets, bandages and hemostatic sponges to control bleeding are also in short supply. “As for the front line, our soldiers need painkillers.” Some Ukrainians who have joined the fight are turning to family, friends and co-workers to help make up for shortages. On the main drag in the bustling capital, Kyiv, the tables at the Georgia restaurant overflow with khachapuri (Georgian cheese bread), khinkali dumplings and traditional Georgian wine. But the proprietor, Chef Alexander, is nowhere in sight. He is serving on the front lines and the restaurant declined to provide his last name to protect his safety on the battlefield. Alexander was deployed without much of the basic equipment he needed, the restaurant’s manager, Olga Rogozina, said. The restaurant now devotes 10 percent of every bill to buying him gear: First, night-vision goggles, and next, a Volkswagen to transport him and six of his troop mates. “All the Ukrainian people are helping our army,” Rogozina said. “And if they are looking for a way to help, they have this way.”"
2022-08-19,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/major-gas-pipeline-nord-stream-1-shut-three-days-placing-pressure-eu-f-rcna43980,,"FRANKFURT/BERLIN — Russia will halt natural gas supplies to Europe for three days at the end of the month via its main pipeline into the region, state energy giant Gazprom said on Friday, piling pressure on the region as it seeks to refuel ahead of winter. The unscheduled maintenance order on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which runs under the Baltic Sea to Germany, deepens an energy standoff between Moscow and Brussels which has already helped send inflation surging in the region and raised the risk of rationing and recession. Gazprom said the three-day shutdown was because the pipeline’s only remaining gas compressor requires maintenance, yet the move will bring further disruption particularly for Germany, which depends largely on deliveries from Moscow to power its industry. The latest shut-down follows a 10-day scheduled annual maintenance that took place in July, and raised fears over whether Russia would resume supplies, which have been reduced since mid-June. Germany has already had to give Uniper — its largest importer of Russian gas and the highest-profile corporate victim of Europe’s energy crisis so far — a 15 billion euro ($15.1 billion) bailout after Russia drastically cut flows, forcing it to buy gas elsewhere at much higher prices. The broader Germany economic impact was highlighted in producer price data on Friday which in July saw their highest ever increases, both year-on-year and month-on-month, as energy costs skyrocket. The Nord Stream pipeline had already been running at just a fifth of its capacity, stoking fears that Russia could halt flows completely heading into the winter heating season and make it more difficult to fill up storage facilities. Germany has made targeted efforts to fill up its storage facilities to prepare, with levels standing at 78.19% as of August 17, slightly more than the 75.89% for the European Union as a whole. After maintenance is complete, and “in the absence of technical malfunctions,” flows of 33 million cubic meters (mcm) a day — in line with current volumes — will resume, Gazprom said. This would still be just 20% of Nord Stream’s full capacity of 167 mcm per day. Gazprom said maintenance work at the remaining Trent 60 gas compressor station would be carried out together with Siemens. The Russian group has previously blamed faulty or delayed equipment for lower flows. Germany says this is a pretext to hurt its economy. Siemens Energy, which is in charge of maintaining the Nord Stream 1 turbines, declined to comment. Earlier, senior German politicians from governing parties rejected suggestions that gas shortages could be alleviated by allowing the suspended Nord Stream 2 pipeline to go into service, something the Kremlin has suggested as a solution. “I strongly suggest we spare ourselves the humiliation of always asking (Russian President Vladimir) Putin for something that we’re not going to get,” said Kevin Kuehnert, number two official in Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats. “The dependence on him has to end for once and all,” he added in an interview with website t-online."

Kyiv has stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility for the explosions. The government official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to disclose information about the Crimea strikes to journalists. Experts have speculated that guerrilla fighters, known colloquially as “partisans,” may have played a role, given the nature of the blasts. The official declined to say whether the Ukrainian military or special forces were also involved in the attacks. But he added, “Only thanks to the people who oppose Putin in the occupied territories and in Russia today, resistance is possible.” Explosions were reported near an airbase Thursday night in Crimea, on the southwest coast near the port city of Sevastopol, the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. On the opposite end of the peninsula, the sky was also lit up at Kerch near a huge bridge to Russia, in what Russia said was fire from its air defenses. On Tuesday, large blasts and fires were reported at a military depot in Russian-annexed Crimea, forcing more than 3,000 people to flee the region. Russia called the blasts at an ammunition storage facility in Mayskoye an “act of sabotage,” without naming suspects. Moscow has warned in the past that such attacks would be crossing a red line. But, as with last week’s explosions, speculation fell on Ukrainian forces as having staged the attacks on the region, which Russia has controlled since 2014. A U.S. official with knowledge of the matter has told NBC News that the Biden administration has placed no restrictions on Ukraine launching strikes in Crimea using U.S.-supplied long-range weapons like HIMARS. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had previously said that Ukraine had committed to not using such weapons to target sites inside Russia. The official insisted the U.S. is neither encouraging nor discouraging Ukraine to launch attacks in Crimea, but said, “simply put, the targeting decisions of where the Ukrainians strike is up to Ukraine.” Despite Moscow’s annexation of the peninsula in 2014, the U.S. and the international community still consider Crimea to be Ukrainian territory. The peninsula holds huge strategic and symbolic significance for Russia and Ukraine, and the Kremlin’s demand that Kyiv recognize it as part of Russia has been one of its key conditions for ending the fighting. Ukraine, meanwhile, has vowed to drive the Russians from the peninsula and all other occupied territories. Crimea has been a major strategic hub for Russia’s invasion of mainland Ukraine, providing important supply routes for its forces occupying the south and military bases to support its war operations. It’s also home to Russia’s Black Sea fleet. Josh Lederman reported from Dnipro, and Hyder Abbasi from London."

The Russian-occupied plant is the largest in Europe, with the two countries trading blame over who is responsible for attacks on the site in recent weeks. Concerns for the safety of the nuclear reactor have sparked growing international alarm and calls for a demilitarized zone around the site, which Russia has rejected. Energoatom, the Ukrainian energy company, said early Friday that Russia is planning to switch off the power blocks at the Zaporizhzhia plant and disconnect them from Ukraine's power grid, which would deny the country a major energy source. It also said that the majority of staff members at the plant had been ordered to stay home, with only those who operate the power units allowed in. ""There is information that the Russian occupying forces are planning to stop working power units in the near future and disconnect them from the communication lines supplying power to the Ukrainian power system,” it said in a post on Telegram. The Russian military ""is looking for suppliers of fuel for diesel generators, which must be turned on after the shutdown of power units and in the absence of external power supply for nuclear fuel cooling systems."" Energoatom did not cite any evidence to support its allegations. On Thursday, Ukrainian military intelligence told NBC News that Russian staff members at the nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine had been told not to go to work Friday. This might be evidence that Russia is preparing “large-scale provocations” at the plant Friday, according to Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s Main Intelligence Directorate. Kyiv warned anew Friday that ""the probability of a major act of terror at the nuclear facility is very high."" For its part, Russia said that defense systems of the plant have been strengthened due to what it said are fears of an attack on the facility by Ukraine’s military. The comments were made by Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russian administration that is in control of the occupied region and were reported by the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Rogov, who represents the Russian-controlled area of Zaporizhzhia, also dismissed as ""irresponsible"" and ""out of the question"" calls for the Kremlin's troops to leave the plant and allow a demilitarized zone to be set up.

On Thursday, Russia threatened to shut down the plant, warning that there was a risk of a human-made disaster due to alleged continued shelling by Ukraine. But Ukraine has a completely different story, according to Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s Main Intelligence Directorate. “There is new information, it arrived about half an hour ago, that for tomorrow, August 19, there is an order for the majority of the staff not to go to work,” Yusov said, speaking exclusively to NBC News. “This is what the Russians told their people, primarily the employees of Rosatom,” he said, referring to the Russian nuclear agency. He said that this might be evidence that Russia is preparing “large-scale provocations” at the power plant Friday. “We do not rule out the possibility of massive Russian provocations on the territory of the ZNPP tomorrow. This is confirmed by their propaganda, information from our sources, and the behavior of the Russians at the station,” he added, referring to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russia refused to confirm or deny whether any Rosatom personnel are stationed at Zaporizhzhia. Earlier Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry accused Ukraine and what it called its “U.S. handlers” of trying to stage a “minor accident” at the plant in southern Ukraine on Friday in order to blame Russia. It said the “provocation” was timed to coincide with a visit to Ukraine by United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres and that it may involve a radiation leak. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear reactor complex, the largest in Europe, was captured by Russia soon after it invaded Ukraine almost six months ago and has come under repeated shelling, with both Moscow and Kyiv trading blame. Russia has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of recklessly firing at the plant, while Ukraine says Russia is deliberately using the complex as a base to launch attacks against its population. NBC News has not verified the claims of either side. A senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that the simplest solution to the situation would be for Russian forces to withdraw from the plant, remove any munitions stored there and de-mine it. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told reporters Thursday that Moscow was taking measures to ensure safety at the complex and denied it had deployed heavy weapons in and around the plant. However the ministry said a shutdown of the plant may be attempted if Ukrainian forces continued shelling it. In a briefing, Igor Kirillov, head of Russia’s radioactive, chemical and biological defense forces, said the plant’s backup support systems had been damaged as a result of shelling. Kirillov presented a slide, showing that in the event of an accident at the plant, radioactive material would cover Germany, Poland and Slovakia."

It’s a significant development that could shift the dynamics of the war as it nears the six-month mark, and which defies warnings from Moscow against attacking a region that holds deep strategic and symbolic value for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia said “sabotage” was behind the latest explosions, a shift from its rhetoric last week that an accidental detonation of munitions caused explosions that left severe destruction at an air base in western Crimea. Videos circulating online Tuesday showed plumes of gray smoke rising over flames near the village of Mayskoye in the northern Crimean district of Dzhankoi after a series of explosions at an ammunition warehouse, and satellite imagery reviewed by NBC News showed a column of smoke near Dzhankoi."

Last month, Moscow announced plans to hold “Vostok” (East) exercises from Aug. 30 to Sept. 5, even as it wages a costly war in Ukraine. It said at the time that some foreign forces would participate, without naming them. Its last such exercises took place in 2018, when China took part for the first time. China’s defense ministry said its participation in the exercises was part of an ongoing bilateral annual cooperation agreement with Russia. “The aim is to deepen practical and friendly cooperation with the armies of participating countries, enhance the level of strategic collaboration among the participating parties, and strengthen the ability to respond to various security threats,” the statement said. Under Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, Beijing and Moscow have grown increasingly close. Shortly before Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Beijing and Moscow announced a “no limits” partnership, although U.S. officials say they have not seen China evade U.S.-led sanctions on Russia or provide it with military equipment.

Ukraine has stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility for any of the fires or explosions, including last week’s at another air base that destroyed a number of Russian planes. If Ukrainian forces were, in fact, responsible for any of the explosions, they would represent a significant escalation in the war.

The Russian Defense Ministry said the fires at the depot caused damage to a power plant, power lines, rail tracks and some apartment buildings. It said in a statement that “there were no serious injuries.” Earlier, Russia’s state news agency RIA Novosti reported a fire a transformer substation after “a loud thump sound” in what appeared to be a result of the blasts at the depot. Crimea holds huge strategic and symbolic significance for Russia and Ukraine. The Kremlin’s demand that Kyiv recognize the peninsula as part of Russia has been one of its key conditions for ending the fighting, while Ukraine has vowed to drive the Russians from the peninsula and all other occupied territories. The district where the blasts happened, Dzhankoi, is in the north of the peninsula, about 30 miles from the Russian-controlled region of Kherson in southern Ukraine. Kyiv has recently mounted a series of attacks on various sites in the region, targeting supply routes for the Russian military there and ammunition depots. Last week’s explosions at Saki air base sent sunbathers on nearby beaches fleeing as huge flames and pillars of smoke rose over the horizon. Ukrainian officials emphasized Tuesday that Crimea — which is a popular destination for Russian tourists — would not be spared the ravages of war experienced throughout Ukraine. Rather than a travel destination, “Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouses explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves,” Ukraine presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter, though he did not claim any Ukraine responsibility for the blasts. Crimea’s regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov, said that two people were injured and more than 3,000 evacuated from the villages of Mayskoye and Azovskoye near Dzhankoi following the munitions depot explosions. Because the explosions damaged rail tracks, some trains in northern Crimea were diverted to other lines. The Russian military blamed last week’s blasts at the Saki air base on an accidental detonation of munitions there, but it appeared to be the result of a Ukrainian attack. Ukrainian officials at the time stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility for the explosions, while mocking Russia’s explanation that a careless smoker might have caused the ammunition to catch fire. Analysts also said that explanation doesn’t make sense and that the Ukrainians could have used anti-ship missiles to strike the base. A British Defense Ministry intelligence update said vessels in Russia’s Black Sea Fleet “continue to pursue an extremely defensive posture” in the waters off Crimea, with the ships barely venturing out of sight of the coastline. Russia already lost its flagship Moskva in the Black Sea and last month the Ukrainian military retook the strategic Snake Island outpost off Ukraine’s southwestern coast. It is vital for guaranteeing sea lanes out of Odesa, Ukraine’s biggest port. The Russian fleet’s “limited effectiveness undermines Russia’s overall invasion strategy,” the British statement said. “This means Ukraine can divert resources to press Russian ground forces elsewhere.”"
2022-08-13,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraines-russia-held-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-explained-rcna42785,,"The horrors of Russia’s invasion have so far been visited on the Ukrainian people. But intensifying fighting around a nuclear power plant — Europe’s largest — could put swaths of the continent at risk of a radiation catastrophe. The Zaporizhzhia complex in Ukraine's southeastern town of Enerhodar was captured by Russia in the early days of the war. Still operated by Ukrainian technicians, it has fueled growing international alarm after shelling hit the plant, whose six reactors generate more power than any such facility in the United States. The West is accusing Russia of nuclear terrorism, deliberately stationing hundreds of troops and stores of weapons there to use it as a “shield” for the bombardment of nearby targets. Ukraine also says Russian forces are directly attacking the site. Many of Russia's claims during the war have stretched credulity, but Moscow is charging Kyiv with repeatedly attacking the plant. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov alleged the Ukrainian shelling is “fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for all of Europe.” As a result, officials in the city of Zaporizhzhia, which remains under Ukrainian control, have started to prepare plans to evacuate civilians in case of a radiation leak. Here’s why observers are so concerned: Built by the then-Soviet Union in the 1980s, Zaporizhzhia's six light-water reactors make it among the 10 most powerful nuclear power stations in the world. After the invasion began Feb. 24, the Kremlin war machine took a little over a week to capture the plant at Enerhodar, a city that is around a 2-hour drive southwest of the larger Zaporizhzhia."
2022-08-11,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-russia-missile-guided-tactics-war-himars-nasams-rcna42619,,"The Biden administration this week promised Ukraine $1 billion in additional military aid, including ammunition for precision-guided missile systems mounted on trucks, anti-tank weapons, anti-aircraft artillery and short-range rockets, as well as medical supplies and medical vehicles. The package brings to $9.8 billion the total for U.S. military aid so far since Russia invaded its much smaller neighbor. Here’s a look at weapons systems the U.S. has pledged to send and whether experts believe they meet Kyiv’s needs as it battles a military with many times its own firepower. One of the most powerful technologies being supplied to Ukraine is the Lockheed Martin-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, used by the U.S. Army since 2007, said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a national security think tank. It has a range of 47 miles and hits targets at a precision of 20 feet. The other is the Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, or NASAMS, a surface-to-air defense system developed by Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace and Raytheon Missiles & Defense, which can detect targets 75 miles away and engage them at 19 miles. Ukraine’s government has been asking other countries for even longer-range weapons since the war began in February, and it continues to keep the pressure up. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said last week that if Russia were to continue using old Soviet technology and overwhelming Ukraine’s defenses with an avalanche of continuous shelling, Ukraine would require long-range missiles to have any chance of damaging Russian assets like ammunition warehouses. Cancian said Ukraine has to fight smartly, because it has two-thirds less ammunition than Russia, so every weapons launch has to be precisely targeted and must hit a high-value Russian target. He said Ukraine, which began the war with old Soviet weaponry, has done well, given its army has had to come to grips with complex new weapons systems while constantly under fire. “We are pushing Ukraine through training programs in a few weeks. In comparison, we take a few months to train U.S. Marine Corps infantry,” Cancian said. While the Defense Department continues to hold weekly briefings with the media, some military experts now suspect that some more sophisticated weapon technology donations given to Ukrainians are being kept a secret from the world. On Monday, the Pentagon acknowledged in a news briefing that the U.S. had sent anti-radar missiles to Ukraine for the first time. The weapons have not been mentioned in any of the military aid packages announced so far by the Biden administration. “It is what is not being talked about that could prove most important” to Ukraine’s war efforts, said Justin Crump, a 27-year veteran British army tank commander who was on the ground in Kyiv in July. “Ukraine has more aircraft than it used to and better systems — this shouldn’t be happening six months into a war with Russia,” Crump said. He said he suspected that Western governments have supplied Ukraine with the M982 Excalibur — a 155 mm precision-guided artillery shell that can be loaded into long-range M777 howitzer guns. Developed by the Arizona-based firm Raytheon Missiles & Defense, the M982 Excalibur is touted as being able to hit any target, at any range, within an extremely precise distance of just 7 feet, Cancian said. The Pentagon declined to comment on whether the U.S. was sending Ukraine weapons it has not officially announced. Ukrainian officials declined to comment on the record. On Tuesday afternoon, several explosions rocked the Saki air base in Novofedorivka, 99 miles behind the Russian front line in Crimea. The incident killed one person, the region’s Russia-appointed governor, Sergei Aksyonov, said in a statement. Videos went viral on social media as users speculated that the explosions might be caused by long-range weapons, because it would be difficult for Ukraine to attack such a faraway target with short-range artillery. Several military experts agreed in interviews. They said Ukraine was most likely using either drones or MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile Systems, also known as ATACMS, produced by the U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin, which have a range of 190 miles. “The explosions in Crimea were huge. They destroyed nine Sukhoi Su-24 and Sukhoi Su-33 Soviet aircraft and threw a steel beam through a car some way away,” said Crump, who is also the CEO of the geopolitical risk and intelligence consultancy firm Sibylline. “Ukraine is still being coy on the cause, but clearly something is up,” he added, referring to the possibility that the West has sent more weapons systems to the country than it has officially announced. Crump is leaning more toward drones. He said Western governments have so far hesitated to provide Ukraine with the longer-range ATACMS, because they fear Russia would see it as an escalation. Ukraine has also been vocal in its wishes for new state-of-the-art weaponry, such as the Iron Dome, a mobile air defense system developed by the Israeli firms Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries, which the makers say can intercept incoming missiles with a 97% success rate. But Cancian pointed out that the weapons being donated to Ukraine are not exactly old equipment being tossed out by wealthier countries: The U.S. bought several NASAMS to protect the White House in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Stacie Pettyjohn, the director of the defense program at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington, D.C.-based military think tank, does not believe the world’s latest defense innovations are critical to turning the tide in the conflict. She and Cancian said they feel much more lies in Ukraine’s ability to train up enough personnel to operate its new, often complicated missile systems, because they need to have enough mechanics to maintain the machines, on top of enough people able to staff them. “F-16 fighter jets would take years to integrate,” Cancian said. “Iron Dome could be helpful, but [even] the U.S. doesn’t really have any. We have been testing some, but we don’t have any” in the field. Ukraine must also fully shift to NATO’s standardized ammunition as soon as possible, which would enable more countries to donate compatible artillery and components for when the machines go wrong, Cancian and Pettyjohn said. “In the end it might come down to some of the more mundane, less sophisticated systems like the 155 mm artillery shell rounds,” Pettyjohn said, referring to large-caliber projectiles typically fired from armored vehicles. “Right now, Ukraine has so many pieces of equipment from so many countries that keeping them all working and having spare parts for them will be a real challenge.”"
2022-08-11,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/satellite-images-show-damage-russian-air-base-crimea-rcna42582,,"New satellite images have revealed the heavy damage to a Russian air base in Crimea that was rocked by explosions earlier this week, calling into question Moscow’s ability to protect the territory it controls in Ukraine’s south. The pictures, released Thursday, added to a growing belief that the blasts may be the result of Ukrainian attacks, suggesting an ability to strike deep behind enemy lines that could help shift the course of the war. It comes as Ukraine and Russia traded accusations of new strikes on Europe’s largest nuclear plant, in a crisis that has stoked fears of a catastrophe. The United Nations is set to discuss the situation Thursday. As international leaders raised the alarm about what would be a dramatic development in the conflict, experts and analysts were assessing another. Kyiv said nine Russian warplanes were destroyed in a series of blasts at the Saki air base in annexed Crimea on Tuesday, while Russia denied any damage and said the incident stemmed from ammunition detonating. Ukraine has not publicly claimed responsibility for the blasts. But the satellite images released by Planet Labs, an American public Earth imaging company, appear to contradict Russian assertions. NBC News analysis of the imagery suggests two buildings in the northeast corner of the base burned to the ground, with what appears to be the burned-out wreckage of at least six planes visible, and several other planes damaged. NBC News could not independently verify if all the aircraft were airworthy."
2022-08-10,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-attacks-nuclear-power-plant-zaporizhzhia-employees-rcna42349,,"ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — As Ukraine and Russia trade blame for shelling around Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, one former employee said the consequences could be catastrophic and that she is terrified for her former colleagues at the facility in the town of Enerhodar. “The mood there is very sad. It is very scary for them to work,” Alyona, 37, told NBC News on Tuesday from the city of Zaporizhzhia, which is still under Ukrainian control. NBC News isn’t revealing her last name because she still has family in parts of the Zaporizhzhia region under Russian rule and she fears repercussions. Also, her husband is in the Ukrainian army. Alyona said she stopped going to work as an engineer at the nuclear plant after Russian forces seized it in March and escaped to Zaporizhzhia soon after. She added that she is still able to call and exchange messages with some of her former co-workers at the plant, which was operated by around 11,000 people before the Russian invasion. The number of staff currently working there is unknown. “I feel really scared that they are in there,” Alyona said about the Russian forces who had taken control of the plant, adding she did not think they “generally understand what a nuclear station is and how to control it.” “They are doing such senseless things that it makes me scared,” she said. Her comments came after Kyiv and Moscow traded accusations over who is responsible for attacks on the Soviet-era site. Ukraine said Russian shelling hit the plant Friday and Saturday, damaging several buildings, putting one reactor offline and raising the threat of radiation leaks and fires. Energoatom, Ukraine’s national energy company, said in an update Wednesday that the Russian attacks have caused “a serious risk” to the safe operation of the plant, with monitoring sensors damaged and a possibility of radioactive leaks. It added that the plant remains operational and continues to produce energy for Ukraine. It added the attacks had damaged a high-voltage power line that served the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Russia has denied shelling the plant, instead accusing Ukraine’s 44th Artillery Brigade of launching attacks on it from the nearby town of Marganets. NBC News has not verified the claims of either side. Amid increasing global alarm, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement Tuesday that available radiation measurements continued to show normal levels at the site, and its experts assessed that there was no immediate threat to nuclear safety. This matched a U.S. assessment, a White House National Security Council official said. However, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in Tuesday’s statement that the shelling at the plant “breached virtually all the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars,” including those related to a plant’s physical integrity, functioning safety and security systems, staff and external power supplies. This prompted foreign ministers of the Group of Seven nations on Wednesday to urge Russia to immediately hand back control of the plant to Ukraine. They said in a statement that the staff must be able to carry out their duties “without threats or pressure,” and called for access to all of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities for international monitors. Moscow has yet to respond. Alyona said the consequences of a meltdown at the plant would be far-reaching and “much more terrible” than those from the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant near the northern Ukrainian city of Pripyat. Considered to be the worst on record, it required the evacuation of more than 100,000 people living within nearly 19 miles, and the resulting radiation was detected across Europe. “I don’t even let myself think about that,” Alyona said. While others said they were hoping for the best, Dmytro Orlov, the exiled mayor of Enerhodar, warned that his community would “cease to exist” should something go wrong. “This territory would not be livable anymore,” he said. Morgan Chesky and Erika Angulo reported from Zaporizhzhia. Yuliya Talmazan reported from London."
2022-08-10,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-crimea-blast-explosion-planes-destroyed-kyiv-says-rcna42376,,"Nine Russian jets were destroyed in explosions at an air base in Crimea, Ukraine’s air force said Wednesday. It comes amid speculation the blasts were the result of a Ukrainian attack that would represent a significant escalation in the war. Russia denied any aircraft were damaged in Tuesday’s explosions — or that any attack took place. Ukrainian officials have stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility for the explosions, while poking fun at Russia’s explanation that munitions at the Saki air base caught fire and blew up and underscoring the importance of the peninsula that Moscow annexed eight years ago. In his nightly video address several hours after the blasts, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to retake the peninsula, saying “this Russian war against Ukraine and against all of free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea — its liberation”. On Wednesday, Russian authorities sought to downplay the explosions, saying all hotels and beaches were unaffected on the peninsula, which is a popular tourist destination for many Russians. The fireballs, which killed one person and wounded 13, sent tourists fleeing in panic as plumes of smoke towered over the nearby coastline. They smashed windows and caused other damage in some apartment buildings. Russian jets have used Saki to strike areas in Ukraine’s south on short notice, and Ukrainian social networks were abuzz with speculation that Ukrainian-fired long-range missiles hit the base. Officials in Moscow have long warned Ukraine that any attack on Crimea would trigger massive retaliation, including strikes on “decision-making centres” in Kyiv. A Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, who is more outspoken than other officials, cryptically said on Tuesday the blasts were caused either by a Ukrainian-made long-range weapon or were the work of guerrillas operating in Crimea. The base on the Black Sea peninsula that dangles off southern Ukraine is at least 125 miles away from the closest Ukrainian position — out of the range of the missiles supplied by the U.S. for use in the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems or HIMARS systems. The Ukrainian military has successfully used those missiles, with a range of 50 miles, to target ammunition and fuel depots, strategic bridges and other key targets in Russia-occupied territories. HIMARS could also fire longer-range rockets, with a range of up to about 185 miles, that Ukraine has asked for. But U.S. authorities have refrained from providing them thus far, fearing it could provoke Russia and widen the conflict. But the explosions in Saki raised speculation on social media that Ukraine might have finally got the weapons. Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said the Ukrainian forces could have struck the Russian air base with a Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missile that has a range of about 125 miles and could have been adapted for use against ground targets and fired from Ukrainian positions near Mykolaiv northwest of Crimea. The Ukrainian military might also have used Western-supplied Harpoon anti-ship missiles that can also be used against ground targets and have a range of about 185 miles, he said. “(Officially) Kyiv has kept mum about it, but unofficially the military acknowledges that it was a Ukrainian strike,” Zhdanov said. If Ukrainian forces were, in fact, responsible for the blasts, it would be the first known major attack on a Russian military site in Crimea, which the Kremlin annexed in 2014. A smaller explosion last month at the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port of Sevastopol was blamed on Ukrainian saboteurs using a makeshift drone. During the war, Russia has reported numerous fires and explosions at munitions storage sites on its territory near the Ukrainian border, blaming some of them on Ukrainian strikes. Ukrainian authorities have mostly remained silent about the incidents. Meanwhile, Russian shelling hit areas across Ukraine on Tuesday night into Wednesday, including the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, where 13 people were killed and 11 others were wounded, according to the region’s governor Valentyn Reznichenko. Reznichenko said the Russian forces fired at the city of Marganets and a nearby village. Dozens of residential buildings, two schools and several administrative buildings were damaged by the shelling. “It was a terrible night,” Reznichenko said. “It’s very hard to take bodies from under debris. We are facing a cruel enemy who engage in daily terror against our cities and villages.” The Russian forces also continued shelling the nearby city of Nikopol across the Dnieper River from the Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the power station, stoking international fears of a catastrophe."

A criminal case against Marina Ovsyannikova was also launched on the charge of spreading false information about the Russian armed forces, her lawyer said on social media. The case was launched under a law, enacted after the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, that penalizes statements against the military, lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov said. A conviction is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Zakhvatov told the independent news site Meduza that the case is likely linked to a protest Ovsyannikova staged last month, holding a banner that said Russian President Vladimir Putin “is a killer, his soldiers are fascists.” Zakhvatov said on Telegram that after the raid Ovsyannikova is expected to be brought into the Investigative Committee for questioning. Ovsyannikova used to work as a producer with Russian state-funded Channel One. She made international headlines on March 14, when she appeared behind the anchor of an evening news broadcast holding a poster that said “stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.” She was charged with disparaging the Russian military and fined 30,000 rubles ($270 at the time). After quitting her job, Ovsyannikova became somewhat of an activist, staging antiwar pickets and speaking out publicly against the conflict. She was fined two more times in recent weeks for disparaging the military in a critical Facebook post and comments she made at a court where opposition figure Ilya Yashin was remanded into custody pending trial on spreading false information about the military. According to Net Freedoms, a legal aid group focusing on free speech cases, as of Wednesday there were 79 criminal cases on charges of spreading false information about the military and up to 4,000 administrative cases on charges of disparaging the armed forces."

Russia and Ukraine have traded accusations over who is responsible for attacks on the plant, which is the largest in Europe."
