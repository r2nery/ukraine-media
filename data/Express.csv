2022-11-06,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1692667/vladimir-putin-news-russia-ukraine-war-update-turkey-black-sea-warships-makarov,Putin hammer blow after Turkey locks Russian warships out of key strategic waterway,"Turkey's decision to close the Black Sea’s only access point from the Mediterranean is putting massive strain on the Russian navy, with some ships having to travel to the Pacific for vital maintenance. Iain Ballantyne, an expert on naval warfare, also said recent drone attacks by Ukrainian forces had robbed Russia of the ability to operate in the west of the waterway, seriously hampering Putin more than eight months after declaring war on his neighbour. Turkey, led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, controls access to the Black Sea via the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits - and confirmed it was closing off the narrow passage to warships on February 28, four days after Putin announced his full-scale invasion. Mr Ballantyne is the editor of International Warships Fleet Review as well as an historical author who has recently published his latest book, HMS London. He told Express.co.uk: ""This has forced Russia to send warships needing maintenance after long months in a face off with NATO in the Mediterranean home to either the Pacific, the Baltic or the Arctic rather than to Black Sea naval shipyards.” As well as providing Russia’s President other a major headache, the move has also underlined Turkey's increasing influence, especially in the Mediterranean region, Mr Ballantyne pointed out. He explained: “The predominant NATO naval power in the Black Sea is Turkey with a very capable, balanced fleet, including frigates, minehunters and submarines…and also on the cutting edge with using drones across various missions. “The other NATO navies do their bit too, including the ex-HMS London, in which I sailed to Murmansk and Archangel in 1991 and which serves on to this day as the ROS Regina Maria in the Romanian fleet.” Speaking after a week during which three Russian warships including the flagship Admiral Makarov were reportedly damaged by Ukrainian drone attacks, he added: “The Russian Navy has lost the ability to operate in the western Black Sea following the loss of the cruiser RFS Moskva, plus other vessels, and was also forced to quit Snake Island. “Today it is not even safe in its main base of Sevastopol, in the Crimea, as demonstrated in recent months via Ukrainian air and sea drone attacks. “It has been forced to fall back on its major naval base at Novorossiysk on the eastern shores of the Black Sea. “It has been a major naval hub for Russia for some years, as I saw when I visited there in the early 1990s, and is even more important to Moscow now.” Turkey's increasingly important strategic role was emphasised by Alp Sevimlisoy, a Millennium Fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington specialising in NATO’s role within the Mediterranean region,When he spoke to Express.co.uk last month. He explained: What we will be seeing and what we should be seeing is the creation of intelligence alliances equivalent to Five Eyes, which will encompass Turkey, the UK, the US and further, a direct military alliance between these three countries. “Because more than even NATO, it's those countries within NATO that are able to take part in operations overseas.“ He added: “The new strategic power, the supreme power in that region is Turkey now. “Russia is at the behest of Turkey and rather than a personal relationship between national leaders, what we are seeing is that the Republic of Turkey, the Turkish Armed Forces, and President Erdogan by de facto have become the supreme power in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.“ Separately, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged Turkey on Thursday to set aside its reservations over Finland and Sweden’s efforts to join the military alliance, insisting the Nordic neighbours have done enough to satisfy Ankara’s concerns about their membership. Finland and Sweden applied for membership of the world’s biggest security alliance in the months after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February. In doing so, they abandoned longstanding policies of military nonalignment out of concern that Russian President Vladimir Putin might target them next. However, Turkey, which joined NATO in 1952, is still not ready to endorse them despite months of trilateral talks. The Turkish government wants them to crack down on individuals it considers terrorists, such as supporters of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party and people suspected of orchestrating a failed 2016 coup in Turkey. Speaking after talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in Istanbul, Mr Stoltenberg told reporters: “Finland and Sweden have delivered on their commitment to Turkey. They have become strong partners in our joint fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. “It’s time to welcome Finland and Sweden as full members of NATO. Their accession will make our alliance stronger and our people safer. ”In these dangerous times, it’s even more important to finalise their accession, to prevent any misunderstanding or miscalculation in Moscow.” Mr Cavusoglu said the schedule for accepting them as new members would depend on when Turkey’s demands, agreed upon in a joint memorandum, were fulfilled. He explained: “These two countries must take important steps on combatting terror because one of the biggest threats NATO is facing today is terrorism,” the Turkish minister said. “It’s not possible to say right now that the two countries have completely implemented all aspects of the memorandum,” he added, while stressing that Turkey supports NATO’s enlargement. Mr Cavusoglu said Turkey sees the new government in Sweden as “more determined” to fulfil the memorandum signed in Madrid. The new Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, is scheduled to visit Ankara on Nov 8, he said. All 30 NATO member countries must officially ratify the accession protocol for Finland and Sweden to join the alliance. Only the parliaments of Turkey and Hungary have yet to do so."

Kherson is currently at the centre of Russia's invasion as Ukraine plans its counterattack to take back Russian-occupied city. A western official told the Times it will be ""impossible"" for the Russian president to maintain military presence in the city if Ukraine succeeds. The official claimed commanders are leaving “demoralised and leaderless” conscripts to face the Ukrainian advance when it arrives. They added: “They’ve decided that Kherson isn’t worth fighting for but that natural defensive barrier of the river is extremely valuable to them.”"
2022-11-05,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1692410/iran-news-drones-mohajer6-shahed136-ukraine-russia-vladimir-putin,"Iran has built the deadly drones Russia deploys in Ukraine with Western help, warns report","Iranian drones which Russia is using in Ukraine to kill innocent civilians contain Western components, disturbing new research has indicated. And one UK-based expert has warned Express.co.uk it is currently extremely difficult to prevent private companies selling equipment to Tehran via complex and impenetrable supply networks. A probe by Schemes, the investigative division of US-backed Radio Free Europe, suggested Iran’s mass-produced Mohajer-6 combat drone contains parts from both the United States and the European Union. In addition, the deadly weapons contain components from China, including a real-time mini-camera made in Hong Kong. There is no proof that any of the manufacturers are flaunting US or EU sanctions against Iran. Nevertheless, Ukrainian intelligence believes the Mohajer-6 contains components from more than 30 different technology companies based in North America, the EU, Japan, and Taiwan, the Schemes investigation concluded. To reach their conclusions, Schemes reporters also looked at parts of a Mohajer-6 drone which the Ukrainian military shot down over the Black Sea close to the Mykolayiv region coastal town of Ochakiv. Dr Sidarth Kaushal, a Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told Express.co.uk there was likewise evidence that another type of drone commonly used by Russia in Ukraine, the Shahed-136, was likely fitted with Western parts. He explained: “If you look at for example, the engine that powers it, it's a combination of Chinese engines and for more important missions, you can swap it out for a Taiwanese or a German engine. “That's not to say that all of those countries are necessarily involved in smuggling stuff to Iran, obviously you get private actors or companies who don't know what to whom they are selling but that's certainly a factor. “And that's true of other things as well - the electronics on them for example. Dr Kaushal said Iran had become increasingly proficient in designing military drones in recent years, underlining one of the key reasons why Russia was buying the equipment. He said: “When it comes to you know, design and actual expertise in building this out, they have that in-house. “What they don't have necessarily is the sort of the supporting industries from which you draw components and so often they do have to rely on outside actors, whether that's the Chinese or someone else. “If it's a given piece of kit you can trace its origin to a given manufacturer, but terms of the specific pipeline, that led it to Iran, that's often fairly complex and can span multiple regions.” Daniel Salisbury, a senior research fellow with the Department of War Studies at King's College London, told RFE: “Exporters will look at the request coming from the United Arab Emirates or another third country, and they'll think that they're selling to an end user based there, when really the end user is in Iran. In September, the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions targeting Iranian companies involved in the production unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to Russia for use in Ukraine, which Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded on February 24. A statement issued by Brian Nelson, US Undersecretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said: “Non-Iranian, non-Russian entities should also exercise great caution to avoid supporting either the development of Iranian UAVs or their transfer, or sale of any military equipment to Russia for use against Ukraine.” Iran has always insisted its drones are produced without any external assistance, with one Iranian military official telling the state-run Tehran Times in 2019: “The homegrown drone was made through cooperation among the army, Defense Ministry, and Quds Aviation Industries.” Nevertheless Dr Majid Sagdepour, political director of The Organization of Iranian American Communities (OIAC), said it was no secret that Iran had been using Western equipment for decades. Speaking via video link last week, he to Express.co.uk the international community had been “lured” into a false sense of security by Iran towards the end for the 1990s. He explained: “And what did they do? They bought the excavators with billions of dollars from Germany and other countries. “They bought the cranes from Italy and God knows whatever else to hang the people of Iran with, and dig the ground to build the ground, ostensibly to build metros, but really to build the tunnels that are now housing their nuclear weapons work. And that continues to this day.”"
2022-11-05,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1692543/ukraine-paratrooper-russia-tank-missile-attack-video-latest-vn,Ukrainian paratrooper singlehandedly obliterates Russian tank - video,"The fearless soldier blasted a guided missile towards the T-80 main battle tank as it drove down a dirt track. The strike sends thick plumes of smoke into the air as the tank caught fire. As the tank continued to roll forward, the fire detonated ammunition inside causing the vehicle to end up in pieces. The 95th Air Assault Brigade of the Ukrainian Air Assault Force, which released the clip, said: ""Every day, the soldiers of the Armed Forces risk their lives, demonstrate courage and heroism, and step by step liberate our land from the Russian invaders. ""Glory to Ukraine! Glory to Air Assault Forces! Together to victory!"" It comes as Russian soldiers are forcing Ukrainian civilians from their apartments in the occupied capital of the Kherson region and moving in themselves, a resident said Friday as the southern city became a growing focus of war in Ukraine. His account of soldiers spreading throughout the city of Kherson suggested that Russia could be preparing for intense urban warfare in anticipation of Ukrainian advances. Russia-installed authorities in Kherson continued to urge civilians to leave the city, which lies on the western bank of the Dnieper River and has been cut off from supplies and food by Ukrainian bombardment. Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the region's Kremlin-appointed administration, reiterated calls for civilians to depart for the other bank of the river. Stremousov said Thursday that Russian forces might soon withdraw from Kherson city. On Friday, he said the statement was merely an attempt to encourage evacuations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has suggested the Russians were feigning a pullout from Kherson in order to lure the Ukrainian army into an entrenched battle. Zelenskyy called attempts to convince civilians to move deeper into Russian-controlled territory “theater.” A Kherson resident told The Associated Press that Russian soldiers were installing themselves in vacated apartments. Russian military personnel were going door to door, checking property deeds and forcing tenants to leave immediately if they can't prove ownership of apartments, he said. “They’re forcing city residents to evacuate, and then Russian soldiers move into freed-up apartments across all of Kherson,"" the resident, who spoke on condition that only his first name — Konstantin — was used for security reasons. ""It is obvious that they are preparing for fighting the Ukrainian army in the city.” Hospitals and clinics were not serving patients in Kherson, where residents also reported problems with food supplies. “There are almost no deliveries of food into the city, the residents are using their own stocks and are queuing to the few shops that are still open,” Konstantin said. Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov told the AP that as part of its counteroffensive to reclaim the Kherson region, the Ukrainian army cut off the western bank of the Dnieper from supplies of weapons and food by shelling main transportation routes and ruining bridges across the river. “The Russians understand the danger of transport routes being blocked and have practically put up with the fact that they will have to retreat from the right bank of the Dnieper,” Zhdanov said. “But the Russian troops are not prepared to leave Kherson peacefully and are preparing for battles within the city. They’re deploying the mobilized reservists there and new tactical battalion groups.” According to Zhdanov, the Ukrainian army has a significant advantage over the Russians in aviation and artillery on the right bank, which means that they could shell the city of Kherson and avoid a head-on clash. “Kyiv is taking its time because the Russian resources in Kherson are evaporating, and they’re getting weaker by the day, which allows the Ukrainians to accumulate forces for the main strike,” Zhdanov said."
2022-11-05,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1692542/Ukraine-war-news-Irish-ambassador-warns-Ukrainian-refugees-no-room,Ukrainian refugees warned not to come to Ireland as there's no more room,"The Irish Ambassador to Ukraine has warned refugees from the country not to come. She said those who make the journey may find themselves unable to acquire accommodation. The United Nations last month listed 7.6million Ukrainian refugees across Europe. This included 2.85million in Russia. After this, close to 1.5million of the refugees are now in Poland, and just under one million have landed in Germany. Ireland, too, has worked to aid Ukraine in its efforts against Russia’s “special military operation”, including by housing refugees. Commenting on the situation, Thérèse Healy, the Irish Ambassador to Ukraine, said the country “has never seen so many people arrive in such a short time frame”. She added that because of the high numbers, available spaces are now “restricted” and refugees how arrive in Ireland risk having nowhere to stay. Ms Healy wrote in European Pravda: “I wish to highlight that available State-provided accommodation is now very restricted. READ MORE: Albanians living in UK accuse MPs of making them 'scapegoats' “There have been instances in recent days during which we could not temporarily place newly-arrived Ukrainians and others such as those seeking International Protection in suitable accommodation. “This challenge is one we continue to grapple with and about which we care very deeply. “We ask the Ukrainian people for their understanding and caution anyone contemplating travelling to Ireland at this time to be aware that we may not be able to guarantee the availability of State-provided accommodation on arrival, despite our very best efforts and wishes.” DON'T MISS: Zelensky’s call for no fly zone rejected [OPINION] Putin's army from 'mysteriously weak' to 'brutal' [REVEAL] People sensationally blame Brexit for Russia's chilling invasion [REPORT] She stressed that this did not mean Dublin would cut down on support in other areas, insisting that “Ireland is resolute in our solidarity and support for Ukraine”. Ireland is also working to help Ukraine along its path of joining the European Union. Ms Healy wrote that membership of the Brussels bloc “has been an overwhelmingly positive experience” for Ireland and that “Ukrainians will embrace their journey along the EU path”. Brussels officials have, however, downplayed expectations of Ukraine joining the bloc any time soon. Emmanuel Macron said in May that such a bid could take “several decades”. He added: “That is the truth, unless we decide to lower the standards for accession. And rethink the unity of our Europe.”"
2022-11-05,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691242/putin-news-health-russia-ukraine-war-troops-dead-economic-sanctions,'Won't make next birthday': Putin 'unlikely to survive' crushing Ukraine war humiliation,"Vladimir Putin is ""unlikely to be around for his next birthday"" as he struggles to survive the humiliation suffered by Russia during the war in Ukraine, according to a retired US Army Lieutenant General. Tens of thousands of Russian troops have either been killed or injured during the conflict, scores of its military vehicles and equipment destroyed by Ukrainian forces. Fearsome counter offensive operations from Ukrainian forces have forced Russian soldiers backwards out of key regions they had to be occupied. Putin's desperation is starting to show with his partial mobilisation plan to recruit 300,000 additional troops being shamed as thousands of people were pictures trying to flee the country. Russia also continues to be hit by crippling economic sanctions from Government's around the world that is blowing an increasingly huge hole into the country's economy. The Russian President's reported deteriorating health has been the subject of widespread speculation, and one expert believes the pressure and humiliation in the battlefield could get the better of him before his next birthday in just under a year. Ben Hodges, a retired US Army Lieutenant General who served as Commanding General in the US Army Europe, told Express.co.uk: ""I don't expect Putin to be around for his 71st birthday. I'm not talking about a coup or being drugged in Red Square or anything like that. ""But it's hard to believe that he would be able to survive a combination of battlefield defeat, the economic issues that are only getting worse, the impact of sanctions domestically, the thousands and thousands of Russian soldiers being killed and wounded. It seems unlikely he would be able to survive that. Lieutenant General Hodges added: ""Dr Timothy Synder wrote an article and in it he talked about Putin's number 1 objective is to remain in power and preserve his regime. ""At some point he is going to have to decide just continuing this in Ukraine, does that help him stay in power? I don't think so and I think he realises that."" Putin's presidency has also been the centre of claims ""political elites"" within the Kremlin are becoming increasingly frustrated with his failing war plan and could be plotting to force him from power. Colonel Richard Kemp, a retired British Army officer who served for nearly 30 years, told Express.co.uk: ""There are definitely rumblings among the political elites in Moscow and dissent among some of his close military allies. ""They and politicians in Russia are making very unusual public dissent. It is very possible some of the political elites in Moscow might be planning to get rid of Putin and that is a very distinct possibility. You can't say it will happen and I know it's not easy, but I think it is certainty a likelihood."" Lieutenant General Hodges added: ""There is a significant power struggle going on inside the Kremlin. You have people that are even more ultra-nationalist and hawkish than Putin that are unhappy with how it's going. ""When you go below that, there does seem to be a widening gap between the general staff and Putin himself. I don't think Putin trusts his generals much anymore and that's why they have finally found Sergei Surovikin, whose two redeeming qualities seem to be brutality and loyalty. ""You can't conceal this from the general population forever - the number of casualties, the fact this is going to continue, the impact of sanctions. ""There is a large percentage of the population that think this is great and were cheering the recent missile strikes on Ukraine, but I'm under no illusion there is going to be a massive uprising in Russia, and I don't think Putin can count on unbridled support any longer."" Last week, Ukraine's Head of Intelligence claimed it is unlikely Putin will stay in power until the end of the war, with ""active discussions"" happening in Russia over who will replace him. Russian troops have been fleeing large parts of eastern Ukraine as the opposition continue their fierce counter offensive strategy, with a focus on recapturing the city of Kherson. Major General Kyrylo Budanov believes Kherson could be retaken by the end of next month and added that a counter-offensive to recapture Crimea could happen next year. The Ukraine spy chief told The War Zone: ""It's unlikely that he survives it. And currently, there are active discussions happening in Russia about who'd be there to replace him."""
2022-11-05,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1692656/putin-kremlin-stabbing-each-other-in-back-russia-ukraine-spt,Putin in trouble as people in Kremlin 'stabbing each other in the back',"The Kremlin is one of the most secretive places on earth. No one knows for sure what is motivating Vladimir Putin and the invasion of Ukraine. It is also unclear whether anyone working closely with Putin is willing to defy the orthodoxy in Moscow and challenge him on the war. If US intelligence is accurate, it appears there could be division inside the Kremlin. A source familiar with Washington's briefings recently said: “It’s a real-life ‘House of Cards,’ but in the Kremlin. All stabbing each other in the back.” The claims were reported by CNN. The source said that a mysterious figure called Yevgeny Prigozhin stood up to Putin and criticised the Russian military's failings. He founded the Wagner Group, a private mercenary group that the Russian government uses to help with military operations. Ukraine is no different. The Wagner Group has been accused of being involved in the war crimes committed in the country. Prigozhin has always denied having links to the Kremlin, but he has previously been described as ""Putin's chef"" after his catering company provided food for rulers in Moscow. Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov even denied these claims, telling CNN: “This information is fundamentally incorrect. President Putin holds meetings about the special military operation on a regular basis and all participants express different point of view in working mode.” But Russia expert, Michael Kofman, believes Prigozhin “sees an opportunity to move up in station and wants to ""embarrass"" Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu "" in the hopes of advancing himself"". Meanwhile, the US security source points to other issues which could end up hurting Putin's regime. Mobilisation has angered many in Russia as their loved ones are sent to risk their lives. On the other side, there are ultra-nationalist figures who want Putin to escalate the violence further, even towards a nuclear strike. They added: “The Kremlin is walking on a tightrope. Mobilisation is widely unpopular in Russia and all talk about ongoing and additional mobilization is prohibited in the controlled information space. Several senior officials would like the war to end because Putin’s ambitions are considered unrealistic. Same with many oligarchs. “At the same time, you have people like Prigozhin, [Chechen leader Ramzan] Kadyrov and certain influential military bloggers who want Moscow to go ‘all in.’” Frustration at the lack of progress made by Russia in Ukraine is also apparent in the Russian media. State TV is usually supportive of the Russian government, and while the broadcasters are still reluctant to question Putin, the Russian military is coming under increasing scrutiny. Last month, leading Russian journalist Alexander Sladkov reported on the losses Russia has suffered in the Donbas region. He said that ""the situation is difficult. Ukraine's armed forces are at the peak of their capabilities due to their mobilisation they started in spring."" Alexander Kots, a reporter for the for pro-Kremlin newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, added: “The Russian troops do not have enough manpower to stop the enemy attacks. The recent Russian losses are directly connected to that. It’s a very difficult period of time on the front line at the moment.” He added that Ukrainian forces are “on the high and enjoying a numeric advantage"". Mr Kots continued: ""They don’t have problems with the intelligence data or high-precision weapons which they are constantly using. We are just waiting for our reserves to become fighting fit and join the battle.”"
2022-11-05,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1691225/ukraine-blackouts-kyiv-russia-missile-strikes-vladimir-putin,Ukrainian citizens help each other with vital supplies as Putin's blackouts spark chaos,"Ukrainian citizens are reportedly showing remarkable resilience and are pulling together to help each other out during the multiple hours of the day in which they have been left without power as a result of Russian strikes. Over the last few weeks, Russia has unleashed a brutal barrage of strikes that have rained down on multiple cities across Ukraine, with critical power stations and other types of energy infrastructure deliberately getting targeted. The result has been that up to 40 percent of critical energy infrastructure has been taken out across 16 regions, Ukrainian officials have said, forcing the Government to initiate rolling blackouts in an effort to balance the grid. This has meant that for certain hours at a time, certain areas will have no electricity or power whatsoever. Strikes on Monday for instance left citizens in Kyiv without water and power for hours. But while the power is down, not all hope is lost, and locals area reportedly pulling together to provide assistance to one another when the lights are out and it electricity is shut off. Pavlo Kukhta, a Kyiv local who also just so happens to be President Volodymyr Zelensky’s fomer energy advisor, told Express.co.uk: On Monday, we did not have any power or water, as did most citizens of Kyiv. ""People are pretty p****d off, but they have hope. Self-organisation is pretty good. In our elevator for example, immediately a local barber shop left out emergency supply boxes loaded with water, crackers, medicine and a simple sedative. They provide a bunch of supplies in case a person gets stuck in an elevator, but of course they leave a QR code as an advertisement for their barbershop. ""I know this appeared in homes around Kyiv and maybe throughout the country as a wole for those who get stuck in elevators, because of the balckouts every day, people are getting stuck."" The blackouts are now reportedly getting so severe that there have been reports of them lasting up to 12 hours of outages a day in some locations. But while the Government scrambles to stabilise the energy grid and repair the system after strikes, these organised blackouts are a necessity. Mr Kukhta explained: ""What essentially happens is that some parts of the grid will get isolated and becomes unbalanced. ""You need to have enough capacity to redirect the energy flows. So let's say that temporarily a substation gets taken down and suddenly one region does not have enough capacity to get energy transmitted from the system. ""The system produces enough energy, but it won't be able to get to that region. This means that the system operator has to take down the region and have blackouts there to balance the system in that region, even though the whole system overall in the country is operating fine. ""Then they repair the transmission and the region gets integrated back fully into the system and gets back to normal. This leaves people without power in those regions for several hours of the day."" Ukrainians have also been urged to limit their energy use during peak hours where demand is expected to be highest, as operators scramble to balance the grid. Last month, following the initial barrage of strikes that came after Russia accused Ukraine of blowing up a bridge linking the country to the Crimean Penninsula, President Volodymyr Zelensky urged consumers to energy consumption between 7am and 11pm daily after missiles came crashing into vital energy systems. Mark Savchuk, a Kyiv local and an expert in the energy sector with a postgraduate degree from the London School of Business and Finance, told Express.co.uk following the initial strikes: ""Russia specifically targeted places responsible for transferring big amounts of energy from one place to another. ""It seems as though they were consulting energy specialists to make the target list because if you want to bring electricity systems down, you would have gone for these targets. ""We had large areas without electricity for one day, but we have managed to repair critical stuff pretty quickly. By the end of the day, we went from millions of people without power to hundreds of thousands of people without electricity. ""The next day, we had something called scheduled blackouts to balance energy the system. Including myself, various parts of the country...were taken off-grid for balance."""

In the footage the nine men are marched across a street by Russian soldiers with their heads bowed clutching the waist of the man in front. All except one of the men was tortured and then executed by Russian troops, it has been reported. According to the Ukrainian government, the men were rounded up after it was discovered they had manned a checkpoint. The survivor, Ivan Skyba, a local taxi driver, told the Associated Press that Russian troops had accused him and the other volunteers of being Nazi sympathisers. They were also accused of guiding Ukrainian artillery fire as Russian forces made an unsuccessful attempt to take the Ukrainian capital. One of the men was shot in front of Mr Skyba who was later beaten until he lost consciousness. When he woke up, Mr Skyba saw the Russian troops leading the other men to the yard to execute them. “I felt the bullet pierce my side. I fell and froze, pretending I was dead,” Mr said, describing how he survived the ordeal. He eventually managed to escape and then fled to Poland. On Friday, the Ukrainian government also shared phone calls made by Russian soldiers confessing that they had killed civilians in cold blood. One soldier, Ivan, called his mother in mid-March admitting that he had orders to ""shoot everyone, who gives a f--- who it might be: a child, a woman, an old lady, an old man. “Anyone who has weapons gets killed. Absolutely everyone.” He went on to say that his unit was taking part in a “cleansing” operation involving the seizure of weapons and strip searching. Another solider called Maxim said that he and his fellow troops were binge drinking to cope with implementing their orders. He said: “Everyone here is like that. It’s easier like this to shoot civilians.” The massacre came to light in April after Russian troops retreated leaving the streets strewn with dead bodies."
2022-11-05,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1692732/Ukraine-Russia-Vladimir-Putin-Kherson-city-battle-invasion-war-video-latest-vn,Huge Ukraine convoy spotted approaching Kherson as Putin prepares for defeat,"Ukraine has been slowly advancing in the southern Kherson region as they continue to push back Russian forces. A video has now emerged showing a lengthy Ukrainian military convoy close to the city of Kherson, which remains the only city that Russia continues to occupy. This comes amid conflicting reports about whether Russia will withdraw from Kherson city or hold the city - the largest urban area under Russian control - at any cost. Losing Kherson would mark one of the most significant blows to Vladimir Putin's war campaign. Beyond a symbolic victory for Ukraine, Kherson is also an important industrial city with includes a major port on the Black Sea. Kherson also serves as a key link in shipping grain and oil products to the rest of the world. Appearing to accept the advancing battle for Kherson, President Putin publicly endorsed the evacuation of civilians still living in the Russian-annexed province. At least 70,000 people are reported to have been moved already from Kherson. Blue Sauron, an account that monitors the conflict in Ukraine, shared a video of the convoy and tweeted: ""Ukrainian DShV staging point, Kherson Oblast."" The mass of troops and military vehicles stunned viewers on social media. Many commented on the fact that they did not seem to fear Russian airpower taking out their position. @PaulMBigland tweeted: ""That says something about the lack of Russian airpower..."" @matmatj82 added: ""It’s interesting that they’re so confident of their control of the battlespace that they’re happy to remain formed up in the open."" @Tendar, who also monitors videos from the conflict, tweeted: ""I think I know where exactly that is. But Russians will soon get visit from them so the surprise will be soon revealed."" @MBielieskov added: ""UA concentration of forces/personnel to turn tactical success into smth more large-scale. Light armour vehicles presence is notable."" Ahead of the expected battle in Kherson, a 24-hour curfew was imposed in the city while Russian flags have been taken down from official buildings. Oleh, the commander of a Ukrainian infantry unit west of Kherson, told Sky News that Russians staying to fight in Kherson will be forced to abandon the strategic city by worsening weather, logistical logjams and the threat of encirclement. However, he anticipated a bloody battle, saying: ""They will keep fighting. They will defend their positions as long as they have the ability to do so. It will be a hard fight."" Meanwhile, Russia has struggled to make any advances in the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Bakhmut has been the focus of Russia's military in recent weeks, but Ukrainian commanders claim its troops are “firmly holding the frontline”. The latest British Ministry of Defence intelligence briefing claims that the 300,000 troops Vladimir Putin conscripted as part of the mobilisation drive are providing “little additional offensive combat capability”. The MoD notes that the Russian military is struggling to train the conscripts."

The riots were ignited in military training camps as rushed commanders desperately try to prepare new conscripts for the frontline in Ukraine. Videos and messages shared on the social media platform Telegram suggest around 2,5000 soldiers were upset over poor living conditions and a lack of modern guns. The latest intelligence briefing from the UK Ministry of Defence suggests that the 300,000 troops Vladimir Putin conscripted as part of the mobilisation drive are providing “little additional offensive combat capability”. The MoD claims that the Russian military is struggling to train the conscripts, with many commanding officers held up on the frontline. Reporting on the riots in Kazan, Nexta TV, which monitors the conflict, tweeted: ""In #Kazan, mobilized men rioted over poor living conditions and rusty 1970s-era assault rifles. ""The so-called homeland defenders lacked food, water and firewood, and had nowhere to wash their clothes."" Dmitri, who monitors the conflict in Ukraine from his account @wartranslated, tweeted: ""Nearly 2000 mobiks came out to express their outrage and shout curse words at the drunk general of the regiment. ""According to messages, mobiks had no essentials provided to them, and no one seems to be bothered to resolve their issues."" In one of several night-time videos of the incident shared online, the soldiers can be heard demanding a general be stripped of his rank. One soldier yells: ""Go f*** yourself. Get lost!"" At one point during the clip, a ranking officer comes out to calm the protesting troops. However, he is soon forced to flee following a barrage of whistling and insults. Posts on Telegram claim that Russian riot police were called in to squash the disturbance One Telegram message from those involved read: ""Riot. The whole unit is telling the regiment general to go f*** himself."" ""Everyone is walking around like pigs. They don't let us go home. Tell the media. The general is drunk."" Another read: “The general was kicked out of here - the brute arrived drunk and making complaints about our behaviour. ""We have rusty machine guns from the 1970s that are not tested, it is dangerous to shoot with them.” The situation in Kazan is just the latest expression of defiance against President Putin, amid concerns that the conscripts are serving only as cannon fodder. Elsewhere, conscripted troops from the Chuvashia republic reportedly refused to leave their training base for the frontline this week. Riot police were called to a barracks in Ulyanovsk to quell the uprising."
2022-11-05,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1692162/vladimir-putin-news-wagner-group-russia-africa,Putin’s secretive Wagner Group is using ‘brutal tactics’ to extend influence in Africa,"Vladimir Putin’s Wagner Group is using “brutal tactics” to boost Russian influence in Africa, a military analyst has warned. Rumours abound about the force of well-paid mercenaries, with some members widely believed to have neo-nazi connections. It was revealed this week the secretive private army, which is bankrolled by businessman and Putin adviser Yevgeny Prigozhin, is trying to recruit former Afghan special forces soldiers who once fought alongside US troops to fight in Afghanistan. But as well as being deployed in Ukraine, specifically in the eastern city of Bakhmut, units are also operating in other areas of the world, notably the Central African Republic (CAR). The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) subsequently accused them of mass executions, arbitrary detentions, torture, forced displacement of civilians, and attacks on humanitarian workers in the country. The CAR has been in a state of crisis since 2012, when mostly Muslim Seleka rebels launched a military campaign against former President President François Bozize. According to the UN, the regime of Mr Bozize’s successor, President Faustin-Archange Touadera, who was elected in 2015, signed a bilateral agreement on military cooperation with Russia in August 2018. An investigation by Human Rights Watch published in April cited witnesses whom accused forces they identified as Russian of torturing, beating, raping and executing civilians between February 2019 and November 2021. HRW investigators interviewed a total of 12 people about an ambush which involved armed Russian-speaking men in uniform who beat and summarily executed at least 12 unarmed men on the morning of July 21, 2021, on the road between the towns of Bossangoa and Nana-Bakassa. Speaking about the Wagner Group’s operations internationally, Ed Arnold, a Research Fellow for European Security at the Royal United Services Institute, told Express.co.uk: “While the origins of Wagner stem from Donbas in Ukraine in 2014, the group has reportedly operated in Syria and Africa, most notably the CAR, Libya, Mozambique and Mali, often using brutal tactics on the ground. “In Mali, the Wagner deal with the government last year effectively undercut French security provision and hastened the withdrawal of European militaries operating some of the overlapping missions in the Sahel. “Wagner not only gets paid for these activities, but increases Russian influence in the region and also disrupts Western activities and influence.” Asked to offer an assessment of a typical Wagner Group operative, Mr Arnold said: “It’s very difficult to identify the ‘average’ Wagner soldier as they have a broad quality threshold. “At the higher end, they have Russian ex-special forces who are competent and experienced operators. “However, as the group's operations have expanded, recruitment has widened to those who failed selection or were kicked out of Russian regular units, and prisoners, diluting their quality and capabilities.” Assessing their reasons for joining up, he added: “Their motivation is again mixed. “Many at the core are ideological and there are many right wingers and neo-nazis, including their reported operational commander Dimitry Utkin and Rusich Task Force, in the ranks, or it can be financial incentives and the spoils of war. “For prisoners it is freedom. Their overall quality is below NATO standards and there is no equivalent force in NATO or its members.” The Wagner Group is believed to be bankrolled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a 61-year-old businessman and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Arnold said: “Overall the group seems loyal to Prigozhin, who in turn is loyal to Putin for now, although there have been increasing disagreements on the way the Ukraine war has been prosecuted. “Their equipment varies and as Wagner has expanded, the overall quality of their equipment has been diminished. “In Ukraine, for instance, they have been used in a ground assault role, which is different to those of their other operations, such as reconnaissance, sabotage, and assassination.” The actual number of Wagner troops was “hard to ascertain”, Mr Arnold stressed, partly because large numbers had been killed in Ukraine so far. He added: “It is unlikely that they number more than 8000 and it has been reported that they have had to redeploy fighters from Africa to backfill losses in Ukraine.” Tobias Ellwood, the Tory MP for Bournemouth East and the chairman of Parliament’s Defence Committee, said the Wagner Group was “just a clever way of Russia being able to distance itself from some of the more clandestine activity that Russians get up to”. He explained: “They're basically Russian mercenaries that can be sent out, and they're paid well, they are ex-military usually and fight in a very barbaric way - they take no prisoners. “They normally operate in difficult places such as Mali and elsewhere and allow Russia to be able to bend the rules on the rights and wrongs so they're not operating under a UN umbrella. “And if something goes wrong, Russia itself can distance itself from what the Wagner group is doing, because it can just say, ‘well, they went rogue, and that's that’, and so forth.” Former US National Security Adviser John Bolton, speaking to Express.co.uk from Washington via video link, said: “They're an adjunct to the Russian state they purport to be mercenaries from a private company. But I think they act at the direction of the Kremlin and they have been involved in Libya and other places in Africa and they are still there. “But I think a substantial member of the total Wagner Group force is now in Ukraine although I don't know exactly what the numbers are. “They have they have a reputation for being very tough but I can tell you, it's in the public record, in 2018 they approached an American position in Syria and they were told, ‘you’re facing off with Americans here, you better stay away’ and they kept coming and we called in air cover and killed between 300 and 400 of them. That's the last time they've come against us.”"

The Independent MP for Islington North, formerly Labour MP, will join a panel at the event expected to urge Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to tell western leaders to halt weapons deliveries and talk peace with Putin. The move reportedly sparked fury in President Zelensky's circles. Dasha Zarivna, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, told the Daily Mail that the group's aim is to ""spread narratives that have been carefully crafted by the Russian intelligence services"". She added: ""Once again Jeremy Corbyn finds himself cosying up to known associates of Vladimir Putin and other useful idiots manipulated by the Kremlin. ""Demanding that Ukraine start negotiating with an aggressor state and calling on the West to end the supply of weapons that allow us to defend ourselves from an illegal, unprovoked invasion that has caused a genocide of the Ukrainian people is nothing short of a disgrace."" Mr Corbyn claimed he was unaware of who the other participants to the forum will be. But according to the event's page, ex-Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein will also be at the New York debate. Ms Stein attacked NATO on the night of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in a tweet that read: ""In 2014 the US backed a coup in Ukraine led by far-right insurrectionists. ""The US kept pouring weapons into Ukraine and peddling the pipe dream of NATO membership, sabotaging the actual solution for peace and security."" Among other participants to the forum is Eugene Puryear, a former presenter for Sputnik Radio, funded by the Kremlin. In September, Mr Corbyn demanded the UK government ditches nuclear weapons ""for peace"", disregarding Putin's nuclear threats to the West. The former Labour leader said it was time to ""talk peace"" and to reverse the Government's commitment to increasing spending on defence. Instead, the Islington North MP advocated using the extra money of battling climate change and poverty. Speaking at a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament event on the fringes of the Labour Party's annual conference, he said: ""The time to talk about peace is when it is most at risk. ""The time to talk about peace is now, because we are the most at risk for a very long time. ""There are 40 wars going on around the world. The only one you hear about at the moment is Ukraine, but there are many others."" He advocated Britain ditching the Trident nuclear programme when it comes to an end in order to reduce the number of weapons of mass destruction in the world. Express.co.uk has contacted representatives for Mr Corbyn."
2022-11-04,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691963/Putin-nuclear-threat-Russian-ambassador-Ukraine-war-invasion-West-vn,Putin's envoy topples Russian nuclear threat with clear admission 'Can't be won',"Amid swathes of thinly-veiled nuclear threats from Vladimir Putin, the Russian Ambassador has defied the Kremlin to assert Moscow has no plans to launch a nuclear war. The news comes after global powers were put on high alert for a possible nuclear strike within Ukraine after Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu reported of unfounded claims surrounding a supposed “dirty bomb” plot. Russian diplomat Andrei Kelin declared the West should have “every assurance” that the Kremlin would not trigger an international nuclear dispute. During an exclusive interview with Sky News, Mr Kelin accused the West of “encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction"". However, he went on to contrast the Kremlin’s previous hints of a nuclear retaliation over NATO’s intervention in Ukraine. The Russian Ambassador to the UK said: “The nuclear war cannot be won and it should never be fought and we stick strongly to this statement."" President Putin has previously declared he was willing to use “all weapon systems available” to defend Kremin interests. Asked if Moscow would deploy a tactical nuclear weapon to further the invasion effort within Ukraine, the Russian diplomat asserted this was not a strategy that would be considered by the Kremlin. Mr Kelin replied: ""No. The world has every assurance that Russia is not going to use [a] tactical nuclear weapon in [the] Ukrainian conflict."" Speaking at a defence conference in Russia just last week, Vladimir Putin declared: “We have never said anything proactively about Russia potentially using nuclear weapons. All we did was hint in response to statements made by Western leaders.” The Russian President has repeatedly suggested that any Kremlin discussion of a potential nuclear conflict has been fueled by the threat of Western attacks on Moscow. Discussion of Russia’s nuclear rhetoric intensified after Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu made a series of calls to his Western counterparts. The Kremlin Minister warned fellow diplomats that Ukraine had plotted to launch what he called a “dirty bomb” on its own territory. The allegations made by Mr Shoigu were quickly identified to be completely unfounded and likely a Russian fabrication in order to falsely justify an escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. The UK Ministry of Defence reported: “The Defence Secretary refuted the claims and cautioned that such allegations should not be used as a pretext for greater escalation.” The reports from the Russian Defence Ministry generated a rare response as representatives from the UK, US and France united to release a joint statement on the matter. Authorities of all three nations described the Kremlin allegations as “transparently false” and outlined the continued Western support for the Ukrainian defensive effort. On Wednesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said it feared the five declared nuclear powers were teetering ""on the brink of a direct armed conflict"". It added: ""We are strongly convinced that in the current complicated and turbulent situation, caused by irresponsible and impudent actions aimed at undermining our national security, the most immediate task is to avoid any military clash of nuclear powers."" The statement comes after Vladimir Putin used a conference appearance to remind the audience: “As long as nuclear weapons exist, there will always be a danger that they could be used.”"
2022-11-04,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1692361/Russian-soldier-phone-call-refuse-orders-mobilisation-equipment-Putin-Ukraine-war-vn,Russian soldier reveals troops have 'refused' orders amid provision of 'dead' equipment,"A phone call made by a Russian soldier has revealed his battalion “refused” to follow orders from their commanders amid growing tensions between serving soldiers and Kremlin military officers. The news comes after intelligence reports suggested Moscow was struggling to provide adequate military leadership for groups of newly mobilised Russian troops. During the conversation, the active serviceman also claimed much of the equipment provided to Kremlin forces was “dead” as he described the sorry state of a number of their vehicles. In a translated phone conversation with his wife, the Russian soldier reported: “We went out yesterday and only came back today to the old positions. “They say they wanted to transfer us to Kramatorsk - everyone refused.” He later added: “The Colonels don’t come to us for six, seven days in a row, or the command in general.” When his wife asked if he had any news of when the war could come to an end, the Russian soldier responded: “I don’t know, we don’t know any news at all. “We have one Senior Lieutenant, he doesn’t know [anything] either. He only went to fight so that his son wouldn’t be mobilised.” The phone call, reported by online organisation War Translated, comes after UK intelligence reports suggested the Kremlin was struggling to provide adequate military leadership to head to 300,000 men ordered to mobilise by Vladimir Putin. The Ministry of Defence said: “Major elements of Russia’s military leadership are increasingly dysfunctional. “At the tactical level, there is almost certainly a worsening shortage of capable Russian junior officers to organise and lead newly mobilised reservists.” Defence officials have argued the weak structure of leadership within the Kremlin armed forces has likely contributed to an atmosphere of low morale among fighting troops. Further into the conversation with his wife, the Russian soldier highlighted the dysfunctional state of the armoured military vehicles issued by the Kremlin. He told his partner: “I’ll tell you more when I return, but our vehicles are just - everything they’re advertising, there’s none of that here. The vehicles are completely dead. “Out of five BRTs, on three the turret doesn’t rotate. Another’s barrel lifts up and falls down instantly. “Another one, which has eight wheels, the device for going over mud doesn’t work on it.” The UK Ministry of Defence has reported incidents of Russian soldiers referring to their own vehicles as “aluminium cans,” highlighting the weakness of the Kremlin arsenal. Data suggests the daily Russian loss of armoured vehicles within the conflict increased to over 40 a day throughout October. Contextually, this is roughly the equivalent to a battalion's worth of equipment. In the face of military supply difficulties, the Kremlin has acquired stocks of additional tanks and other infantry vehicles from Belarus, although the ongoing destruction and capture of Russian vehicles by the Ukrainian forces has continued at an alarming rate. Under threat from depleting morale across their armed forces, the UK Ministry of Defence has reported that the Kremlin has constructed “blocking units” which threaten to shoot Russian soldiers if they retreat from the battlefield."
2022-11-04,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1692347/isreal-iran-syria-hezbollah-lebanon,'Must deal with threats': Israel's four red lines that warrant an attack if crossed,"Israel's former acting National Security Advisor has unveiled the four red lines which if crossed, would warrant retaliation from Israel. As Tehran and Tel Aviv continue to lock horns in what is known as the ""war between wars"", a proxy conflict between the two powers which has spilled over into Syria, incoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's former defence advisor Jacob Nagel told Express.co.uk that there are certain lines which if crossed, will warrant an attack from Israel. He said: ""The war between wars is something that we started almost 10 or 11 years ago. We started mostly under the radar mostly to try and work against Iran's nuclear programme. ""We started with cyber attacks in the centrifuges and other things. Now it is large and escaping and it has spilt over. Now it is mostly against Iranians or Syrians or Hezbollah forces in Syria. ""According to the foreign press, there are three red lines for Israel, and if one of these three lines is breached, Isreal is doing what it should do. The first one is, we cannot allow terror activities by terror organisations on our borders. ""The second is that we cannot allow the transfer of game-changing systems from Iran via Syria to Israel. The third - we cannot allow the Iranian forces to stabilise in Syria. If one of these three happens, according to foreign sources, we will attack."" But while there are three widely agreed upon ""red lines"" which Israel is ready to respond to if crossed, Mr Nagel suggested that there should be a fourth added into the mix. He told Express.co.uk: ""I think it is time to change the equation because Hezbollah is starting to produce or divert statistical missiles and precision guided missiles ( to Lebanon, and I think we should attack in Lebanon even though it is a change of the equation. ""Even this would change the situation regarding a confrontation against Hezbollah.” Israel and Lebanon have been locked in a heated conflict essentially ever since Israel first formed in 1948. But in recent weeks tension ramped up over a heated maritime dispute, in which Hezbollah, a powerful militant Shiite faction backed by Iran in Lebanon, threatened to attack Israel if it extracted gas from a disputed region in the Mediterranean sea. While the US helped the two nations to broker a maritime border deal, staving off an attack from Hezbollah for now, Israel will still be keeping a close eye on the militant group which refuses to recognise Israel as a country. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said his group would end its ""exceptional"" mobilisation against Israel, but said warned that the deal ""is not an international treaty and it is not a recognition of Israel"". Mr Nagel warned: ""We cannot allow Hezbollah in Lebanon or allow them to have PGMs. If there is a UAV production manufacturing facility in Lebanon or Syria, we have to deal with it."" This also comes after an Israeli airstrike reportedly hit an Iranian drone-making facility in Syria. Iranian-made drones have also been used in by Russia in Ukraine in a recent spate of brutal strikes which have taken out 40 percent of critical energy infrastructure in the invaded nation. Mr Nagel said that attack Israel’s airstrike on the Iranian bomb-making site, which successfully hit and destroyed equipment used for manufacturing drones in the area of the Dimas military airport., could warrant a response from Iran. He said: ""They [Iran] can try to retaliate. But remember that the last time they tried to retaliate the Iranian forces sent us 40 or 50 missiles from Syria to Israel, about 75 percent of the weapons fell in the Syrian area. ""But we have to be alert all the time for retaliation for counters from Iran, from Syria, from others. We have to be prepared. They know if Israel retaliates it won't be good for them."""

Vladimir Putin was filmed awkwardly getting out of a limousine as he laid flowers in Red Square to mark a national holiday earlier today. Spectators noticed that President Putin was driven less than 100 metres in the limo from the Spassky Tower gate of the Kremlin, following previous claims of a limp. Clips from the Russian defence ministry TV channel Zvezda showed President Putin's limo traveling across the square before the Kremlin leader awkwardly exits the vehicle. Anti-Putin media outlet CрTD media commented that the Kremlin leader appeared unable to walk long distances, adding: ""Old age is not a joy."" He then stiffly moves across to the monument and lays flowers at the foot of statues of two 17th-century war heroes. At one point, the broadcast feed on Zvezda TV appears to abruptly cut out and skip forward during President Putin's approach to the monument without explanation. The MailOnline suggested that the Russian leader ""appeared to show signs of a limp as he approached the monument"". A Ukrainian commentator Ian Matveev tweeted: ""To lay flowers at the monument to Minin and Pozharsky, Putin drove in a limousine for 100 meters from the Spasskaya Tower! ""The car with the FSO was also driving nearby!"" The FSO is Vladimir Putin's own Presidential Security Service. The monument, which was recently renovated, honours Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky, who are celebrated in Russia for defending the country against the Polish invasion in the early 17th century. The footage of President Putin's public appearance comes amid a flurry of claims about the Russian leader's health. President Putin, later speaking to reporters, admitted that citizens in the Russian-occupied Kherson were being evacuated ""for their safety"". He said: ""Now, of course, those who live in Kherson should be removed from the zone of the most dangerous actions, because the civilian population should not suffer."" This comes as Russia prepares for a brutal humiliation with Ukraine quickly advancing within the region which President Putin only recently annexed. There are suggestions that Russian forces may be preparing to abandon the west bank of the Dnipro river. The Russian-installed deputy governor of Ukraine’s Kherson region has announced that a 24-hour curfew has been imposed in Kherson city. Kirill Stremousov said that the curfew was necessary ""in order to defend our city of Kherson"" from what he referred to as ""terrorist attacks"". Mr Stremousov warned that columns of Ukrainian vehicles had been spotted in areas of the frontline.

In an interview with Sky News, Andrei Kelin warned the UK was ""too deep"" in the Ukraine war. Asked to provide evidence of his claim, the ambassador said he had handed evidence over to his British counterpart. He said: ""We perfectly know about [the] participation of British specialists in [the] training, preparation and execution of violence against the Russian infrastructure and the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. We know that it has been done."" Mr Kelin said the evidence will become public ""pretty soon"", indicating this could be within days. He added: ""It is dangerous because it escalates the situation. It can bring us up to the line of I would say no return, return is always possible. But anyway, we should avoid escalation. ""And this is a warning actually that Britain is too deep in this conflict. It means the situation is becoming more and more dangerous."" However, the UK Government has immediately spoken out against the claims, adding that they served only to distract from Russia's repeated military failures during the invasion. A spokesperson said: ""In recent days, Russia has made a range of allegations against the UK, clearly designed to distract attention from Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine; Russia's losses on the battlefield and its bombing of civilian populations and energy infrastructure without any regard for international law and the loss of innocent life. ""We do not plan to give a running commentary on these allegations; it is no secret that the United Kingdom has taken a public lead in our support to Ukraine - this has been enduring since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014."" Vladimir Putin has claimed that the UK plans to destroy Russia and use its natural resources, despite the lack of any substantive evidence suggesting this. The ambassador went on to deny any plans for Russia to use nuclear weapons, saying such a war ""cannot be won and should never be fought"", and insisted that Putin would not use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine. This comes despite Russia accusing the UK of ""encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction"", and claiming to have found evidence of a Ukrainian ""dirty bomb"". The Kremlin frequently accuses its opponents of planning to commit the atrocities it itself intends to perform. Kyiv has denied the existence of the claimed weapon. Russia's foreign ministry has also expressed fears of an approaching nuclear war, warning that the major nuclear powers were ""on the brink of a direct armed conflict"". It added: ""We are strongly convinced that in the current complicated and turbulent situation, caused by irresponsible and impudent actions aimed at undermining our national security, the most immediate task is to avoid any military clash of nuclear powers."" A frigate and a landing ship were among the four vessels Mr Kelin claimed the UK were involved in destroying in a Ukrainian drone attack. Russia has since suspended its implementation of a U.N.-brokered grain deal that has seen more than 9 million tons of grain exported since the war began. Ukraine has denied the attack, saying that the Russians mishandled their own weapons."

Prof Skopin claimed that the education system in Russia was collapsing and that it the ""brain drain"" sparked by the war in Ukraine was a catastrophe. He explained that there were several vacant teaching positions across the historic St Petersburg and Moscow Universities. Prof Skopin told the BBC: ""I think that the Russian research and education system is collapsing, actually. ""And, to my knowledge, in some good St Petersburg and Moscow universities, there are lots of vacant teaching positions now. ""Just because people have left, it's quite unusual and unprecedented. ""Because it used to be very hard to get a teaching position in Russia. Ms Skopin added: ""Now it's very different and, as far as I know at some universities they ask MA students to teach. ""Instead of professors, you can imagine how it will impact the Russian system of education. ""Russian university system... It's a catastrophe."" Some Russin citizens have fled Russia due to Putin's strict regime. At the beginning of last month, a Moscow media source claimed that as many as 700,000 Russian civilians had fled. Just after Putin announced that he would be mobilising 300,000 more Russian men to join the battle in Ukraine. Some Russians left and bought tickets to fly out of the country, which sent the price skyrocketing just after Putin's announcement. At the time of the exodus flights to Turkey shot up to 70,000 roubles ($1,150) from 22,000 roubles. Whilst others decided to drive, causing traffic and delays on the Georgian border. The MoD has explained that the exact number of Russian civilians that have fled is still unclear: ""it likely exceeds the size of the total invasion force"" deployed into Ukraine when Moscow first invaded the country in February. During a daily briefing, they added: ""The better off and well-educated are over-represented amongst those attempting to leave Russia. ""When combined with those reservists who are being mobilised, the domestic economic impact of reduced availability of labour and the acceleration of ‘brain drain’ is likely to become increasingly significant."""

Since Vladimir Putin launched a partial mobilisation order in September, similar videos have emerged from the battlefield with conscripts complaining about the faulty military gear being given. in the latest video coming from the battleground, a Russian soldier showed how defective his helmet is and how he was treated like cannon fodder. Filming his broken helmet, the unnamed soldier said: ""These f***ing amazing helmets arrived from Stavropol Krai. ""We press it, it rips apart."" As he filmed the shell of his helmet, he said: ""Look, this was done with a regular pocket knife. It comes off. ""So easy, not even talking about a bullet."" With a sarcastic tone to his voice, he thanked the administration of Stavropol Krai which claimed to have provided new helmets to the Russian recruits. He said: ""Huge ""And the deputy head of the administration who was yelling that we'll all be going to fight: 'Put on this helmet and go to fight. You first, and we'll go after you.'"" Russia's Ministry of Defence has reportedly started recruiting prisoners from penitentiary establishments to fight in Ukraine, with some soldiers being taken out of the penal colony in Stavropol Krai. The new reported recruitments come as Russian troops are suffering major military setbacks in the southern province of Kherson amid low morale. A Russian-installed Kherson official said Moscow will likely pull out troops from the west bank of the Dnipro river in a potentially major retreat. If confirmed, the move would be a major turning point in the war. ""Most likely our units, our soldiers, will leave for the left [eastern] bank,"" said Kirill Stremousov in an interview with Solovyov Live, a pro-Kremlin online media outlet. However, Ukraine said it was suspicious Moscow could be setting a trap by feigning a retreat from the Kherson region. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command said: ""This could be a manifestation of a particular provocation, in order to create the impression that the settlements are abandoned, that it is safe to enter them, while they are preparing for street battles. ""We continue fighting, also in the Kherson direction, despite the fact that the enemy is trying to convince us that they are leaving the settlements and creating the effect of a total evacuation."" According to the latest intelligence report by the British Ministry of Defence, Moscow has deployed ""block units"" who threaten to shoot their own retreating forces. Due to low morale and reluctance to fight, Russian forces have started deploying 'barrier troops' or 'blocking units'. These units threaten to shoot their own retreating soldiers in order to compel offensives and have been used in previous conflicts by Russian forces,"" the intelligence update said."

Speaking yesterday, Andrei Kelin, Russia’s ambassador to the UK, yesterday accused British ""specialists"" of helping plan an audacious drone attack on Russia's Black Sea fleet at the weekend in which three warships including the flagship Makarov were reportedly damage. Mr Ballantyne, the editor of editor of Warships International Fleet Review magazine, told Express.co.uk: ""It is of course highly embarrassing for the Russians to think the Ukrainian special forces or navy on their own could carry out repeated drone attacks on their warships at sea or against Crimean bases. ""So, it is better for them to save face by suggesting, with no evidence, that the UK’s special forces were involved. ""The Ukrainians are receiving military training in the UK and courtesy of other NATO nations, plus lots of equipment of course, but the idea of ‘UK direct involvement’ in the Sevastopol attack is a face-saving fib for Moscow in my opinion."" Mr Kelin also claimed Russia was continuing to investigate the explosions which damaged the Nord Stream 1 and 2 undersea gas pipelines in September, adding that UK special forces had been involved in training the Ukrainians in the use of explosives and undersea drones. In the West it is widely suspected that the blasts were the work of the Russians themselves in an attempt to increase the pressure on European countries from rising energy prices. And Mr Ballantyne, who has just published his latest book, HMS London, said: ""The idea that the Royal Navy sent special operators – and by that the Russians must mean the Special Boat Service personnel – to sabotage the Nord Stream pipeline is ludicrous. ""It would mean that a NATO nation had sent its military to blow up infrastructure off the shores of NATO nations."" He joked: ""Might Article 5 – an attack on one NATO nation is considered an attack on all - be triggered if that was found to be the case? ""Might NATO then be obliged to attack the UK, or the RAF and British Army at least declare war on the Royal Navy? It shows the sheer stupidity of a risible Russian claim."" He continued: ""There have been suggestions the Americans may have done but that is equally crazy, for the same reason the UK would not do it. ""Both the UK and USA have dismissed such claims robustly. There is one nation with means and the desire to destroy Nord Stream - Russia - as part of its misinformation war to fracture Western resolve and also to put the frighteners on the EU nations as the winter energy war gathers pace."" Speaking after Britain's ambassador to Moscow Deborah Bronnert was summoned to the Russian foreign ministry in connection with the claims, Mr Kelin said the Kremlin would publish its proof ""pretty soon"". He declared: ""We perfectly know about participation of British specialists in training, preparation and execution of plans against the Russian infrastructure and the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. We know that it has been done. ""It is dangerous. It can bring us to the line of I would say no return - return is always possible - but we should avoid escalation. ""This is a warning actually that Britain is too deep in this conflict. It means that the situation is becoming more and more dangerous."" A UK Government spokesman said the Russian allegations were an attempt to ""distract attention"" for its illegal invasion of Ukraine and its continuing losses on the battlefield. He added: ""We do not plan to give a running commentary on these allegations. ""It is no secret that the United Kingdom has taken a public lead in our support to Ukraine - this has been enduring since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014."""
2022-11-04,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1692078/zelensky-putin-energy-terrorism-blackouts-ukraine-russia-war,Zelensky unleashes fury at Putin for 'energy terrorism' as millions left without power,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has lashed out at the Russian President for committing ""energy terrorism"" in Ukraine as over 4.5 million citizens have been plunged into darkness as a result of brutal missile and drone strikes amid the war. In recent weeks, Russia has been deliberately targeting critical energy infrastructure, something its Ministry of Defence has confirmed, in a brutal barrage of strikes using a combination of Iranian-made ""suicide drones"", lethal missiles and other weapons. Ukrainian officials have said these strikes took down at least 40 percent of the country's critical energy infrastructure, which on Monday left citizens of the capital Kyiv without power or water for hours. But in the latest onslaught, in which Russia unleashed fresh attacks using Iran's ""kamikaze drones"" to hit energy targets in southeastern Ukraine, extensive damage to the power grid has left millions without power once again. Mr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Thursday: ""About 4.5 million consumers have been temporarily disconnected from energy consumption. The very fact that Russia is resorting to energy terrorism shows the weakness of our enemy. ""They cannot beat Ukraine on the battlefield, so they try to break our people this way."" Ukrainians had already got used to rolling blackouts, conducted by electricity operators in a bid to balance the grid. But while the strikes may be causing damage, Mr Zelensky's former energy advisor Pavlo Kukhta told Express.co.uk that he doesn't think Russia will be able to up the ante. He said in an exclusive interview: ""The major target is electricity and will remain electricity. But as long as material keeps coming, I doubt the Russians can intensify their strikes by an order of magnitude. Their major volleys are debilitating and take down parts of the network using dozens of missiles and drones, up to 100 maybe. That is a lot. ""They have several thousand maybe overall, which is a lot. They are expending a large percentage of all their ammunition of that kind in one volley in one day. That takes down the grid for several hours, maybe in some places for a day or two, but not more as it gets repaired quickly. ""I doubt they (the Russians) can make the order of magnitude larger and fire a thousand missiles in a single day."" But while Mr Kuktha stressed that Ukrainians have been valiantly repairing the damage at impressive speeds to get power back online, there is potential for things to get worse. potential He explained: ""Some of the major energy companies have said they are starting to run out of spare parts for repairs, so they would need more and these had to be included in supplies sent by the West. This is an important venue of assistance now because it keeps the country up and running. ""If repairs could not be made to the network, it would be a different story and the whole country would start collapsing. Millions of refugees and it would become unliveable, but as long as the network keeps getting repaired, it is a dynamic balance and it's liveable. ""It is a constant game of cat and mouse. Russians keep hitting our grid, but the energy sector in Ukraine is rather robust in terms of human capital. There are a lot of people working there, they know their business, they know how to repair stuff, they know how to repair stuff, they were preparing for this and there was an understanding that this would be the strategy that Russians will be using during winter, so dozens of repair brigades are ready. ""As long as there are resources to make the repairs...I think we will be fine."" However, while it appears that the country has been able to respond and adapt to the situation involving blackouts, Mr Kukhta raised concerns over the heating network, which if targeted could leave millions freezing in the coldest winter months. He explained: ""Heating is also vulnerable. Central European winter is really cold and this can be really dangerous in major cities if they target heating productions. But these are big enterprises and it is not as easy to take them down so hopefully those can be repaired as well."" The latest strikes come after as reports emerged revealing that Russian troops are leaving the occupied city of Kherson, in what could be a major retreat for Russia. Sources on the ground in Ukraine have claimed that Putin's soldiers are= dismantling military posts and crossing into the eastern bank of the Dnipro River towards Crimea."
2022-11-04,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691991/Ukraine-Russian-trap-conflict-street-battles-retreat-ont,Ukraine fears Russia is setting trap and ‘preparing street battles’ amid report of retreat,"In another potential setback for Russian forces, it has been reported by a Russian official in the south of Ukraine that Russia may be retreating. The official reported that it is expected that the Kremlin will pull back its forces from the west bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson. Civilians in the area have been advised to flee the area in order to keep them safe. On this report, senior figures in Moscow have made no comment but officials in Kyiv and the West are remaining sceptical about the information. According to the Ukrainian Government and military analysts in the West, Kyiv is concerned that rather than retreating, Russia is setting a trap. The Russian-installed deputy civilian administrator of Kherson spoke in an interview on Thursday with Solovyov Live, a pro-Kremlin news outlet. Kirill Stremousov said: ""Most likely our units, our soldiers, will leave for the left (eastern) bank."" This region includes the capital of Kherson which marks the only major area Russian forces have captured and held onto since the beginning of the conflict in February. The area includes one side of a dam across the Dnipro river which regulates the water supply to irrigate Crimea, the area Russia has occupied for eight years. Despite the comments by Mr Stremousov, Russia previously denied a withdrawal of troops from the region. However, the tone seemed to have shifted by Thursday night when Stremousov said ""we have to take some very difficult decisions now. ""Whatever our strategy might be, and some people might be afraid to recognise things. ""But for me it is very important to try to say at the moment – People, please go over to the east bank. You will be in a far safer position."" The Russian noted the significance of a Russian withdrawal from the area as he expressed his hope that ""we will not leave Kherson"" but added: ""It will be a big blow not only in terms of the image of us all, but a big blow for people who could stay here."" Suspicions of a Russian retreat were fuelled by photographs which were shared online of the key administrative building in the area without the Russian flag flying on top of it. However, Ukraine cautiously noted that the images may be disinformation from the Russians. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command showed Ukraine’s caution surrounding Russian disinformation and traps. In televised comments she said: ""This could be a manifestation of a particular provocation, in order to create the impression that the settlements are abandoned, that it is safe to enter them, while they are preparing for street battles."""
2022-11-04,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1692469/russia-soldiers-eat-zoo-animals-dnipro-river,Russian soldiers eating zoo animals including kangaroos to survive warzone,"Russia's soldiers in Ukraine are so poorly supplied they have resorted to eating kangaroo and other zoo animals, it has been claimed. After Ukraine reclaimed the Yampil village, volunteer rescue workers who arrived ten days later were met with evidence that the soldiers had been consuming the animals in the nearby zoo. According to the volunteers, they found bones and pieces of flesh at Yampil Zoo, suggesting some of the animals had been eaten. The disturbing discovery serves as an indictment of Russia's supply lines issues which have left many of its soldiers underequipped and underfed. In a local report from Espreso TV, the volunteer workers said: ""Many animals were eaten by orcs [Russians]. Locals said they ate kangaroos, we haven't found the bones yet because there are so many of them, they are scattered all over the zoo. ""There was a bison, it was running around the village, and then it was killed and eaten. Several donkeys, the ostriches were eaten. Someone escaped, the ponies are now running around the territory, we are evacuating them."" According to the authorities, two camels, a kangaroo, a bison, some piglets, birds and wolves were killed. Some animals were saved, and are now being cared for in the city of Dnipro. Zookeepers said that prior to the invasion on February 24, the zoo was the home of many animals, including bears, camels antelopes and wild boars. Volunteers are currently in the process of collecting materials to contact Ukrainian law enforcement agencies, in order to press charges. Yampil, home to around 11,000 people – according to the 2021 census – was liberated from Russian occupying forces on September 30. When news broke, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the special units which returned the area back to Ukraine. He said: ""I especially want to commend the soldiers of the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade and the 54th Mechanized Brigade for their constant bravery and heroism in the Siversk and Bakhmut directions. As well as servicemen of 214 Separate Rifle Battalion of the SOF and 103rd Separate Territorial Defense Brigade for the liberation of Yampil. ""I am also thankful to our intelligence units – Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, as well as the Security Service of Ukraine."" Workers also found that wolves had been left to starve to death in the zoo. They explained: ""The situation with the wolves is terrible. People say that they were tame. They died holding their empty bowl in their paws, in closed enclosures. We found only skeletons. ""They were closed and tightened with nets, we had to break the lock."" In humanitarian law, there is little protection for animals caught up in war zones. However, more recently there has been a push by to get ""ecocide"" included in the Statute of the International Criminal Court. The animals at XII Misyatsiv Zoo in Demydiv, on the outskirts of Kyiv have spent nine months locked away during the conflict. It's feared many have now been left traumatised by shelling while zoos have been forced to rely on donations."
2022-11-04,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1692205/putin-news-russia-drones-iran-ukraine-war-national-resistance-center-report,Putin's drone plot foiled as Ukraine military exposes Iran-Russia deal routes,"Over the past couple of months, Russia has been deploying drones against cities like Ukraine's capital Kyiv and the southern port city of Odesa. Iran has denied exporting any weapons for use in Ukraine, but Volodymyr Zelensky's government has still ejected Iran's ambassador from the country. A Ukrainian military official said Russia is using Belarusian territory to launch drone strikes. Oleksii Hromov said Iranian drones are flying into Ukraine from a military base in the Belarusian city of Luninets, 100km (62 miles) north of the border. An investigation by the National Resistance Center portal, which was created by the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ Special Operations Forces, found that the Mohajer, Arash-1, Arash-2, Shahed-131, and Shahed-136 UAVs drones that Russia is using in the war are delivered from Iran via air and sea routes. According to the investigation, the following companies fly the drones and instructors to Russia: Iran Air (a state airline controlled by the Iranian Ministry of Infrastructure); Pouya Air (part of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or IRGC); Saha Airlines (part of the Iranian Air Force); the privately owned Mahan Air. The sea route that Iran uses to transport the drones passes through the Caspian Sea, the report claims. The National Resistance Center wrote: ""According to the documents, the Iranians transport spare parts for civil aviation through the Bandar Anzali port. ""The destination is Astrakhan or Makhachkala. They are transported on ships belonging to the Iranian Industrial Company (controlled by the IRGC). ""In early November, 200 drones are expected to arrive in Astrakhan by sea in a disassembled state."" The NRC also claims that as Russia is actively shipping stolen Ukrainian grain to Syria on the Sevastopol-Tartus route, Iranian drones and components for them could be transported in containers from a Syrian factory in the opposite direction. READ MORE: Ukraine fears Russian trap amid reports of retreat However, they emphasise they do not have a clear confirmation of this hypothesis. Besides Syria, a UAV assembly plant has been operating in Tajikistan since May. According to Matthew Schmidt, associate professor of National Security, International Affairs, and Political Science at the University of New Haven, Iranian drones will not withstand the precision technology being developed for and by Ukraine to shoot them down before they can even strike.

The world’s largest nuclear weapons state never fully developed this key part of modern war. “It expected to fight a glorious redux of World War Two instead. “And while these drones are likely to continue to cause civilian casualties, they are unlikely to be game changers for Russia. Kyiv has proven adept at shooting them down and has also announced a purchase of drones designed to counter Russian drones by knocking them out of the sky and jamming their sensors.”"
2022-11-04,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1692186/putin-latest-ukraine-territory-crimea-kherson-spt,Putin facing nightmare as Russia set to lose all Ukrainian territory gained since 2014,"The Russian military's downfall in Ukraine has been reported extensively since the start of the war. Vladimir Putin's soldiers failed to take the capital Kyiv and then lost swathes of territory near Kharkiv in September. In April, Russia's main naval vessel was sunk by Ukrainian forces in the Black Sea. Desperate to avoid further embarrassment, Russian troops are now defending the territory they hold in Kherson, southern Ukraine, as well as regions in the east. But Ben Hodges, former commanding general of the United States Army Europe, believes that Russia is set to lose all territory gained since 2014. This would mean Ukraine taking back Crimea, the territory annexed by Russia in 2014. Key to this objective is the HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System). Mr Hodges explained: ""If you think about HIMARS, what is happening now is the offensives are moving to Kherson, and I think Kherson's probably going to fall in the next three or four weeks, and then there is the other wing of the counteroffensive coming down south towards Donetsk. ""Both of these are headed towards Crimea. Once they get HIMARS in range inside Crimea it is math after that."" The HIMARS is a light multiple rocket launcher developed in the Nineties for the US Army, usually mounted on a truck, and enable forces to strike targets at longer range. Mr Hodges added that Russia's logistics systems are ""exhausted"" at this stage in the war, and this will only make their attacks against Ukraine less effective. He continued: ""I believe that Ukraine will have liberated Crimea by the summer and I believe that because we've talked about who has the superior will. ""The logistics situation for the Russians is terrible. The Kerch bridge is damaged, the Russians are now trying to improve the route that runs along past Mariupol to resupply their troops in southern Ukraine. ""Their logistics system was already weak and exhausted before this, now they are adding around 200,000 troops that are just going to be another burden. The Ukrainians have wisely targeted the logistics system for months now, whereas the Ukrainian system gets better with each passing week."" Logistics is not the only issue harming Russia's military efforts. Low morale has also been a reported source of problems during the war. On Friday, reports claimed that Russia's forces are now threatening to shoot down their own men if they try and retreat. The Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update: “Due to low morale and reluctance to fight, Russian forces have probably started deploying ‘barrier troops’ or ‘blocking units’."" The report added that this “likely attests to the low quality, low morale and indiscipline of Russian forces.” As Russia prepares to defend Kherson, the Kremlin has signalled that its soldiers may well retreat, with a source close to the halls of power this week saying: “Most likely our units, our soldiers, will leave for the left (eastern) bank."" However, Ukraine is weary that such comments could be a trap to try and lure Ukrainian troops into a disadvantaged position. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command, said this week: “This could be a manifestation of a particular provocation in order to create the impression that the settlements are abandoned, that it is safe to enter them, while they are preparing for street battles."" For now, Ukrainians are content with making slow but consistent advances near Kherson, and US military figures are confident that they can eventually reclaim the city. US Defence Secretary, Lloyd Austin, was speaking at the Pentagon in Washington this week when he said Ukraine is capable of just that. He said: “On the issue of whether the Ukrainians can take the remaining territory on the west side of the Dnipro [Dnieper] river and in Kherson, I certainly believe that they have the capability to do that. “Most importantly, the Ukrainians believe they have the capability to do that. We have seen them engage in a very methodical but effective effort to take back their sovereign territory.”"
2022-11-04,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1692161/Vladimir-Putin-russia-ukraine-winter-war-kherson-energy-terrorism-vn,Putin on brink as Russia's winter strategy for winter exposes 'he doesn't have a plan',"Vladimir Putin “does not have a strategy” for taking over Ukraine, an analyst has claimed, and is resorting to a “terror campaign” weaponising refugees ahead of the winter. David Sanger, a US national security analyst, told CNN that Putin is trying to “start another flood of refugees” from Ukraine into Europe by destroying energy infrastructure facilities across the nation, forcing civilians to either freeze or flee. Average temperatures in Ukraine in the winter months tend to be around zero degrees celsius and Russia is hoping to offset battlefield defeats by depopulating Ukraine, draining its forces of reservists and crippling the economy, as well as putting more pressure on Western countries supporting Ukraine. Mr Sanger said: “Putin is trying to start another flood of refugees into Europe during the winter. He is going to try to freeze out those who remain. “This is a strategy for somebody who does not have a plan or a strategy for taking the country over. “So, [he is thinking] let’s freeze them out. A lot of people will die, particularly young people, those that get hypothermia. I have been in Ukraine in the winter. It is, as you say, pretty cold. “And this is the strategy of someone who has, as Zelensky said, decided to conduct a terror campaign atop the military campaign.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia on Thursday night of engaging in “energy terrorism” after Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy network left residents without power. About 4.5 million people were without electricity across the country, Mr Zelensky said in his nightly address. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said 450,000 apartments in the capital alone did not have power on Friday. “I appeal to all residents of the capital: save electricity as much as possible because the situation remains difficult!” the mayor wrote on Telegram. State-owned grid operator Ukrenergo reported on Friday that emergency blackouts would be taking place across Kyiv. Russia has carried out attacks on Ukrainian power facilities, particularly in recent weeks. In his address, Mr Zelensky described the targeting of energy infrastructure as a sign of weakness. “The very fact that Russia is resorting to energy terrorism shows the weakness of our enemy,"" he said. “They cannot beat Ukraine on the battlefield, so they try to break our people this way.” Mr Zelensky spoke soon after Moscow-appointed authorities in southern Ukraine's occupied Kherson region said Russian troops were likely to leave the city of Kherson — a claim that Ukrainian officials greeted with some scepticism. The Kremlin-installed regional administration already has moved tens of thousands of civilians out of the city, citing the threat of increased shelling as Ukraine's army pursues a counteroffensive to reclaim the region. Authorities removed the Russian flag from the Kherson administration building on Thursday, a week after the regional government moved out. Ukraine’s southern military spokeswoman, Natalia Humeniuk, said the flag’s removal could be a ruse “and we should not hurry to rejoice.” She told Ukrainian television that some Russian military personnel are disguising themselves as civilians."

Furious Russians blasted their country's leaders for going into war ""without a plan,"" with one citizen saying that Vladimir Putin's generals ""have s*** for brains"". The damning verdict from Moscovites comes as new polling by the independent Levada Centre in Russia shows that 88 percent of Russians are ""concerned"" about events in Ukraine. Speaking to Radio Free Europe, Russians were asked whether the war in Ukraine was going according to plan. One middle-aged man said: ""I don't think it's going to plan. ""It hasn't been from the very beginning because Kyiv wasn't taken in three days and there was no Russian military parade there."" Another added: ""After we retreated from Kyiv? Our generals have s*** for brains if you'll forgive me."" An elderly woman remarked: ""It is not going to plan. I'm sure of that. Our troops are retreating and Ukraine is attacking."" One Muscovite responded that the Russian military ""should have been better prepared for the war"". A few remained cautiously supportive of Vladimir Putin's war, with one person saying the retreats and slow progress on the battlefields are because Russia ""is sparing the civilians"". Others bravely questioned whether President Putin even had a plan before invading Ukraine in February. One middle-aged man said: ""What plan, whose plan? The Russian gene pool is being destroyed. Young people have no future."" Another asked: ""What plan? Was there a plan? Did the authorities ever have a plan?"" One furious woman simply said: ""Yes - if the plan was to destroy Russia. ""I've just been to a Metro store. Half of the products are missing. It'll probably be shut down soon. ""We will all be shut down too. There will be only Putin left in his bunker."" This comes as the latest briefing from the British Ministry of Defence claims Russian forces have started deploying units threatening to shoot their own retreating soldiers due to sinking morale among troops. The intelligence report described these Russian units as ""barrier troops"" or ""blocking units"" used to compel offensives. This follows an anticipated retreat among Russian forces in Kherson ahead of a Ukrainian counteroffensive on the city. On Thursday, the Russian-installed deputy governor of Ukraine’s Kherson region said Moscow was likely to pull its troops from the west bank of the Dnipro River, signalling a huge retreat. However, Kyiv said it was wary that Moscow could be setting a trap by feigning a pull-out."

Drone footage taken of the clash appears to show a Ukrainian infantryman firing a rocket hitting the rear of the tank. The tank is rocked by a massive explosion which sends parts flying. Continuing on a short distance, the Russian tank then suffers a secondary explosion. Thick smoke bellows from the damaged tank after the Ukrainian missile strike. Nearby a second Russian tank stand motionless, it is unclear from the footage if the second vehicle has also been taken out by the Ukrainian unit. This week former US General James Clapper warned the prospect of a nuclear attack by Vladimir Putin is ""not as improbable"" as many believe. Western intelligence has reportedly shown there have been high-level talks within the Kremlin among senior Russian army chiefs about using a tactical nuke as pressure on Putin mount amid Ukrainian military gains. Mr Clapper told CNN: ""I am sure there have been lots of discussions amongst senior Russian officers about nuclear weapons and whether they should be used or not, or when. ""What would they try to do beyond what they are trying to do already? Which is using conventional weapons, gradually destroying the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine. ""I still feel the prospect for the use of nuclear weapons is unlikely but not as improbable as it was before February 24."" This week another former US General predicted Vladimir Putin will lose everything as Russia will eventually be forced to give up all Ukrainian territory gained since 2014. Ben Hodges, who served as commanding general of the United States Army in Europe, has predicted that Ukraine will eventually roll back all of Russia's military gains since 2014, including liberating Crimea. Putin is desperate to cling onto the territory in southern and eastern Ukraine which Russian forces have managed to grab but are now struggling to hold as Kyiv mounts renewed offensives powered by western weaponry. The retired general told Times Radio: ""I believe that Ukraine will have liberated Crimea by the summer and I believe that because we've talked about who has the superior will? The Ukrainian soldiers and Ukrainian people compared to the Russians. ""The logistics situation for Russia is terrible you know, the Kersh bridge being damaged, the Russians now are trying to improve the route that runs along past Mariupol in order to resupply their forces in the southern part of Ukraine. ""Their logistics system was already weak I would say exhausted even before this, and now they're adding a couple 100,000 of troops that are just going to be another burden."""
2022-11-04,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691447/Ukraine-live-vladimir-putin-health-sick-kherson-kharkiv-counter-offensive-kyiv-latest,Ukraine: Putin threatens UK with extraordinary 'unpredictable and dangerous' response,"Vladimir Putin has launched an extraordinary threat against the UK after bizarrely accusing it of being involved in a humiliating Russian defeat in the Black Sea. The UK’s ambassador to Russia was summoned by Moscow to answer for unfounded allegations that Britain was involved in the attack last weekend, which sank four Russian warships. The British ambassador Deborah Bronnert denied any British involvement in the attack - but Russia responded with a serious warning that the UK could face “unpredictable and dangerous” consequences for their so-called “confrontational actions”. In a statement the Russian Foreign Ministry said: “The demarche stressed that such confrontational actions by the British threatened to escalate the situation and could lead to unpredictable and dangerous consequences.”"
2022-11-04,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1692066/Ukraine-special-military-operation-Russia-satanic-west-putin-vn,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine an 'apocalyptic battle against antichrist', says Putin ally","The invasion of Ukraine is the “final apocalyptic battle against the antichrist”, an ally of Putin has said, as he called for the destruction of the “Satanic West”. Referring to comments made by the leader of the Chechen Republic in October that “Satanism is openly acting against Russia”, political analyst Alexander Dugin told Putin’s state media that the operation in Ukraine is a “holy battle”. Dugin’s comments reflect a tactical change in rhetoric among the Russian elite as they look to justify the difficult and costly invasion of Ukraine to a population that appears increasingly opposed to their intervention. His comments come as reports have emerged that Russian commanders are fleeing the city of Kherson in the south ahead of an imminent Ukrainian attack, despite the region being of vital importance to the trajectory of the war. Dugin said: “It is a holy war. It is no coincidence it has been declared a jihad. It is a holy battle against the Satanic West. “And in principle, if Kadyrov can find the courage to say this openly, I do not think we should hesitate to do either. “It is an Orthodox battle, a final apocalyptic, eschatological battle of Orthodox Christian Russia, holy Russia, against the antichrist. “That is the point of this special military operation!” The Russian political analyst was referring to comments made by Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of the Chechen Republic and a longstanding ally of Putin on October 25. Speaking on Telegram, Kadyrov launched into a diatribe against western atheism and same-sex relationships, branding it an “abomination”. He said: “Indeed, there, in the West, Satanism is openly acting against Russia. Satanic democracy is when the rights of atheists are protected, but believers are offended. Or when traditional couples are deprived of children and transferred to same-sex families. Intentionally same-sex, not by chance. “And in Europe they swallowed it. They consider it modern, civilised. The more liberated the topic ‘below the belt’, the better for them. “And I see degradation and Satanism in this. And I'd rather fight it in the bud there than let this abomination envelop our Motherland here.” Since his comments, Moscow has repeatedly attempted to frame their invasion as a holy war. The head of the Russian Orthodox Church said that by fighting in the “special military operation”, Russian soldiers were washing away all sins. Aleksey Pavlov, assistant secretary of the Russian Security Council, said its troops need to carry out the urgent ""de-Satanisation"" of Ukraine. Speaking to the Russian state-owned newspaper Arguments and Facts, he said: “If we talk about the origins of occultism and sectarianism, then I note that the 'Church of Satan', which has spread across Ukraine, is one of the officially registered religions in the United States. “I believe that with the continuation of the special military operation, it becomes more and more urgent to carry out the de-Satanisation of Ukraine.” Pavlov’s remarks were refuted by the High Priest of the Church of Satan Magus Peter H Gilmore, who said there was no elevated following of his movement in Ukraine. Putin himself has also decried the “Satanism” engulfing the West on multiple occasions since Ukraine began sweeping counterassaults on Russian forces, pushing them deeper into their occupied territory. The transparent attempt to justify the war comes during a turbulent period for Russian forces in Ukraine as the last battles are set to take place before the arrival of winter, when it will become difficult to operate on sodden ground. Reports have suggested “demoralised and leaderless” Russian conscripts in the strategic port of Kherson have been abandoned by their commanders to face the incoming Ukrainian forces. Despite the importance of the region - it was one of the first areas occupied by Russian soldiers and has served as a paramount route into Ukraine from Crimea, through which soldiers and equipment supplies have been pushed - a western official reported that commanders have “decided that Kherson isn’t worth fighting [for]”. Videos on social media show that checkpoints have been left unmanned and the Russian flag has been lowered from the main administrative building. A clip on Telegram also showed a Russian-installed official telling civilians “everything is fully under control” as he appears to be fleeing in a car. Deputy head of the Kherson military-civilian administration Kirill Stremousov was also filmed in the front seat of a car filled with suitcases and bags declaring that life was “continuing as normal”."

The ten defendants, aged between 27 and 72, successfully claimed they were ""preventing a crime"" by occupying a jetty at Navigator Terminals in Grays, Essex, preventing the vessel, the Andromeda, from unloading 33,000 tonnes of diesel. District judge Christopher Williams, who returned his judgment at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Friday, said: ""I take the view it's more than likely the Russian war could be described as terrorism."" All 10 denied, and were each cleared of, a single charge of obstructing or disrupting a person engaged in a lawful activity under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. They were accused of trespassed on land at Navigator Terminals and blocked the jetty, obstructing or disrupting ""a lawful activity, namely fuel distribution"". Henry Blaxland KC, defending, questioned whether the unloading of the Russian diesel was lawful activity, and the judge said ""in my view the unloading of the oil was the potential offence"". The protesters broke out into applause and there were cheers as the judge found each of them not guilty. Prosecutor Monali Ralerasker had argued the case did not ""require an analysis of what's morally right and what's morally wrong"". But the judge said it was ""arguable that offences may have been committed under the Terrorism Act 2000"", and that the ""activity which the defendants disrupted was the very thing they were protesting about"". The protesters took two dinghy boats to access the jetty from the riverside late on May 15 this year. Activists attached themselves to the structure and displayed a banner that said ""oil fuels war"". The Andromeda tanker, which was Greek-flagged and carrying Russian oil, was turned around in the Thames in the early hours of May 16. One of the activists who scaled the jetty, former lieutenant colonel Michael Grant, 62, told the court: ""The purpose of the action was to draw attention to the fact that fossil fuels were being imported and thereby funding Putin's war."" Speaking afterwards, Mr Grant, 62, said: ""This is a fantastic result. This verdict is not just a relief for us but a complete vindication of the ethical beliefs that led us to act."" ""I’ve been in the military for a quarter of a century and I’m not easily shocked. But the sheer horror unleashed by Putin’s army in Ukraine still haunts me now as it did when the war started."" He added: ""Entire towns reduced to rubble, thousands of people lying dead or wounded - not to mention the mass graves and war crimes. ""I just couldn't believe that all this devastation was partly funded by Russian oil being imported into the UK. How on earth was that allowed to happen? ""We couldn't just stand by and watch - we had to do something about it. I hope this will inspire other people to make a stand."" Another defendant, Zoe Pontida, 32, a teacher from Oxford, added: ""This is a seismic verdict. It doesn’t just fully vindicate our action, it also puts the UK government squarely in the dock. ""The judge has recognised that we are just ordinary people whose conscience compelled us to stop the oil funding Putin’s campaign of state terrorism in Ukraine. ""With every new town flattened by bombs and every new war crime being uncovered, the reason for stopping the flow of money to the Kremlin’s death machine has grown stronger. ""We did what the UK government should have done months ago but failed to do. The very least ministers should do now is to bring forward the ban on Russian oil imports, extend it to all Russian fossil fuels, and make sure the UK is no way involved in funding Putin’s terror in Ukraine."" The defendants were: Benji Bailes, 38, of Gloucester; Michael Grant, 62, of Rosewell, Midlothian; Kim Harrison, 38, of Oldham, Greater Manchester; Benjamin Hearne-Salter, 41, of Kashmir Road, south London; David James, 62, of Bromfelde Road, south London; Ian Mills, 56, of Chippenham, Wiltshire; Zoe Pontida, 32, of Oxford; Henry Rayner, 28, of Ivanhoe Road, south London; Lyndall Stein, 72, of Surrey Row, south London; Rhiannon Wood, 27, of Hedge End, near Southampton, Hampshire."

There have been recent calls for countries in the West to send Ukraine more weapons. And a Ukrainian MP has set up a crowdfunding page in order to raise funds for a self-propelled Howitzer. The video shows the Ukrainian military locating and targeting a group of Russian troops. Once locked on the target, the Ukrainian forces begin to pummel the Russian army using heavy artillery. Once struck the Russian servicemen appear to jump from the armoured vehicle and begin to run. And a large cloud of thick grey smoke erupts from the vehicle, and Russian soldiers escape to safety.

Those employed to work alongside ministers will be vetted for connections to “hostile state actors” such as China and Russia as the Government seeks to beef up its defence against espionage. The changes will apply to civil servants and contractors and will mean that for the first time the threat from hostile state actors will be taken into account alongside the risk of terrorism. Those working alongside the Prime Minister and ministers will need to pass these vetting checks before they can access top officials or view secret documents. It comes after it was revealed that former Prime Miniate Liz Truss's phone had been hacked by Russian spies. Although the changes are not the result of the hacking of Ms Truss's phone they underline the seriousness of the threat that the Government believes hostile state actors pose. They do reflect fears that Chinese and Russian spies could directly target ministers. There are currently five levels of vetting for people working in Government or at sensitive sites. These include a baseline check, accreditation check, counter-terrorist check, security check and developed vetting. Developed vetting is the most in-depth procedure and allows people to gain access to top secret documents or deal with matters of national security. The counter-terrorist check gives individuals clearance to work with ministers who are at “particular risk from terrorist attack”. They are also able to gain access to “information or material assessed to be of value to terrorists”. This level of clearance gives people access to certain military or civil sites which might be assessed to be at risk from a terror attack. On Monday, the counter terrorist check was extended to include people working with public figures who are also at risk from “hostile state actors”. Known as Level 1B it also includes those who deal with material that might be valuable to these hostile states and allow them to visit sites unescorted that are at risk from such threats. Conservative MP, Bob Seely, a member of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee praised the move. He said: ""It’s a move in the right direction. ""It should have happened years ago but I am delighted that this Government is now taking action."" A Cabinet Office spokesperson said the new scheme was part of a ""modernisation"" programme. ""The new vetting Level 1B clearance is part of the wider Cabinet Office vetting modernisation programme of work, which makes greater use of automation and data checks to deliver national security vetting. ""The new level builds upon the existing CTC clearance to enable appropriate checks on employees; ensuring the Government, and its staff, remain protected.”"
2022-11-03,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691872/Poland-retakes-Russian-embassy-building-Ukraine-war,Poland retakes Russian embassy building ‘destroyed’ by occupants over Ukraine war,"Poland has retaken possession of a rural holiday resort it had leased to the Russian Embassy over the invasion of Ukraine and its failure to pay rent, officials have said. When the State Forest department re-entered the building yesterday, they found the occupants had “destroyed” the place – with “even cables torn from the walls”. However, despite the state of disrepair the buildings had been left in, the Russian Government claimed without irony that the property was now under “illegal occupation”. The Russian Embassy vowed today to raise a protest with the Polish foreign ministry. The centre, which sits on the Zegrze Reservoir, near Skubianka, to the north of the capital Warsaw, had been leased to Russia since the 1980s. According to local reports, the area covers roughly six hectares, and includes two hotels, two villas and eight summer houses. On Wednesday, members of the State Forestry Guard secured the buildings in the complex. In a press conference in front of the property, Edward Siarka, Polish deputy environment minister, told regional outlets that after an assessment had taken place, the land would be redeveloped. Michal Gzowski, a spokesperson for the State Forest department, said when guards had entered the premises, they found it “completely devastated”. He added: “The Russians have destroyed everything, even cables are torn from the walls.” Images released of the buildings show the buildings in a state of disrepair, filled with broken and soiled furniture. The property also had broken windows and collapsed roofs, according to local outlets. Mr Siarka explained that the Polish Government had terminated the contract with the Russian embassy in mid-April with immediate effect, over it’s failure to pay rent. He noted that despite repeated calls for a response from Russia, it did not release the property – which led to the seizure. Jozef Kubica, acting Director General of the State Forests, who also participated in the news conference, said Russia had not stumped up the 12,000PLN (£2,228) a month rent. He added: “There was also [the] aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine.” Only after the resort was requisitioned by Poland did the Russian Government voice its outrage, claiming the buildings had been erected at the expense of the Soviet Union and were therefore property of the Russian state. In a statement provided to state media agency Ria Novosti, it argued it had been “forced” to stop paying rent after the Polish authorities “unlawfully froze” the Embassy’s bank accounts over Vladimir Putin’s horrific invasion of Ukraine. In a stunning lack of self-awareness, Russia stated: “The Polish side, however, for reasons unknown to us, refuses to register these objects as Russian property.” It said: “The Embassy will raise a protest to the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the illegal occupation of a holiday centre near Warsaw.” However, the State Forests shot back: “Russia leased the site in the 1980s. In 2009, the contract was extended. On April 13, 2022, it was legally terminated. The Russians had until May to leave the centre. “They disregarded it. Summons to hand over the site were sent on May 4 and September 16. They also disregarded. Now they are protesting.” In the press conference, Mr Kubica said that “all legal aspects have already been exhausted”, adding that Russia had no grounds for claiming a right to the property."

2022-11-03,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691188/putin-news-russia-ukraine-drone-war-iran-latest,Putin's Achilles heel exposed as Ukraine prepares for all-out 'drone war' with Russia,"According to the US, Russia took delivery of 1,000 drones from Iran at the end of August. The drones being dispatched in Ukraine, including in Kyiv last week, are known as single-use or kamikaze drones because they are not intended to survive their mission. Iran has denied exporting any weapons for use in Ukraine, but Volodymyr Zelensky's government has still ejected Iran's ambassador from the country. The drones are particularly devastating due to the psychological impact on residents, spreading fear and disrupting daily activity. But according to Matthew Schmidt, associate professor of National Security, International Affairs, and Political Science at the University of New Haven, they will not withstand the precision technology being developed for and by Ukraine to shoot them down before they can even strike. He told Express.co.uk: “The next few months will see something new in warfare: a true drone war. “Getting drones from Iran shows how desperate Moscow is. The world’s largest nuclear weapons state never fully developed this key part of modern war. “It expected to fight a glorious redux of World War Two instead. “And while these drones are likely to continue to cause civilian casualties, they are unlikely to be game changers for Russia. Kyiv has proven adept at shooting them down and has also announced a purchase of drones designed to counter Russian drones by knocking them out of the sky and jamming their sensors.” Last week, UK defence minister Baroness Goldie has said she thinks Iran would be ""appalled"" to see the devastation caused by kamikaze drones in Ukraine that it supplied to Russia. Answering questions about the situation in Ukraine in the House of Lords, the Tory peer asserted that Iran is a country of ""honourable traditions"" that takes ""pride in its international position"". She said she thinks Iran might want to think again about providing such weapons to Russia to use in its illegal invasion of its neighbour. Lady Goldie said: ""I have to say that Iran may be a problematic country in many respects, but historically it is actually a country of honourable traditions and I think pride in its international position. ""And I would have thought it was appalled at seeing the footage of what these drones were achieving and delivering for innocent citizens of Ukraine and I would have thought that might want to make Iran consider just where it is in this."" When asked what the UK might do to try and persuade Iran to end its military support for Russia, she told peers that ""severe sanctions"" are already in place. She said: ""I would remind members that sanctions, and severe sanctions, have been applied both by the UK and by the UN against Iran. ""And we continue to review how it is and how we can persuade Iran to reconsider what it is doing."" Meanwhile, Iran has also been in the news over ongoing protests in Iran by women and girls, who are risking their lives to fight the harsh regime. Protests were triggered over attempts to re-impose strict hijab rules, as well as the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman killed in police custody after being arrested for wearing her hijab incorrectly."

Polish defence minister Mariusz Blaszczak revealed work had begun on the fence. It will be 8ft high and 10ft wide and feature an electronic monitoring system and cameras. Mr Blaszczak said: ""The airport in Kaliningrad is accepting flights from the Middle East and North Africa. I decided to take action to enhance the security of the Polish border."" Poland built a steel wall last year along its border with Russian ally Belarus after a migrant influx there. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko says 1,000 emergency ""heating points"" will be set up in case Russia knocks out infrastructure and residents face freezing to death. The heating points will have generators and a stock of necessities such as water. Mr Klitschko warned blackouts will continue despite water and power supplies being restored in most areas of the capital. He said electricity demand had to be managed amid a spiralling energy crisis. Russian missile and drone attacks have damaged 40 percent of Ukraine's energy infrastructure and periodically left large parts of the capital without power and water. The Russian foreign ministry said it feared the big five nuclear powers were ""on the brink of a direct armed conflict"". It said the West must stop ""encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction"". The ministry added it was ""convinced that in the current complicated and turbulent situation, caused by irresponsible and impudent actions aimed at undermining our national security, the most immediate task is to avoid any military clash of nuclear powers"". Western capitals have said Moscow has been escalating nuclear tensions since its war in Ukraine began in February."

They added that Western countries must stop ""encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction, which can lead to catastrophic consequences"". The five countries considered to be nuclear weapon states are the UK, the USA, France, China and Russia. Other countries which have nuclear weaponry are North Korea, Pakistan, India and Israel, and between the nine nations, there are estimated to be 13,000 nuclear weapons across the world. Russia’s Foreign Ministry also stated: ""We are strongly convinced in the current complicated and turbulent situation, caused by irresponsible and impudent actions aimed at undermining our national security, “The most immediate task is to avoid any military clash of nuclear powers."" This year, Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to have threatened the use of nuclear weapons during the war with Ukraine. In September during a television address, President Putin said he was “not bluffing” when he said Russia was prepared to use “all available means” to defend its territory. It came at a time Russia was holding referendums in four military-occupied regions of Ukraine, leading to the annexation of 15 percent of Ukraine’s territory. President Putin also said the United States has set a “precedent” when they dropped two atomic bombs on Japan in order to end World War Two. Last week, Russian military expert Colonel Igor Korotchenko threatened both the UK and the US with nuclear strikes after claiming Ukraine is about to release a “dirty bomb” Colonel Korotchenko, who is the editor-in-chief of Russia’s National Defense magazine, said: “There is only one way, They [the West] must know that if they try to fight with Russia in Ukraine or on our territory, there will be only one answer.” He said that Vladimir Putin should launch “Topol-M - with a [nuclear] warhead” on military targets in both counties. The military expert added: “This is exactly what we have to prepare for, not to threaten. But to be ready with an immediate quick response without any hesitation.” In September, the United States warned Russia they would face ""catastrophic consequences"" if nuclear weapons were launched in Ukraine. Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor of the United States said they had “communicated directly, privately to the Russians at very high levels” about how the country would respond if Vladimir Putin acted on his nuclear threats. He did not go into detail about what had been discussed with Russia but said the US had made clear the ""greater detail exactly what that would mean” to Russian government officials. In a different interview, the security advisor said that Vladimir Putin’s threats were a “matter that we have to take deadly seriously”."

A senior US commander has said the vessel’s arrival should be seen as evidence of the United States’ “ironclad commitment” to its allies - reinforcing a similar message by UK Armed Forces minister James Heappey hours earlier. The 560ft submarine, equipped with Trident II ballistic missiles, is a US Navy Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine which has been in commission since 1994. Ohio-class subs are on constant patrol and make up an important part of the USA’s nuclear capability. Rhode Island was escorted by Royal Marine vessels as it arrived at the British overseas territory. In a statement issued by the US Navy, Captain John Craddock, commander, Task Force 69, which is responsible for US submarine warfare operations, said: “Rhode Island’s port visit to Gibraltar reinforces our ironclad commitment to our allies and partners in the region. “The US and UK share a strong history of cooperation, through exercises, operations, and cooperation activities such as this, that enhance our combined capabilities and partnership. “The complexity, lethality, and tactical expertise of Rhode Island epitomises the effectiveness and strength of the submarine force.” Earlier, in London, Mr Heappey spoke at a reception hosted by the Gibraltar Government at the Shard in London, during which he emphasised that there would be no compromise on the question of the sovereignty of the Rock, located on the southern tip of Spain. He said: “Because the bases in Gibraltar are of huge strategic importance, not just to the United Kingdom but to Europe as a whole.” “In recent, months when Russian submarines have been doing what Russian submarines do, it's amazing how many times Gibraltar as an option for positioning of maritime reconnaissance aircraft has come up. “Which just goes to show how valuable Gibraltar is to the Western Mediterranean and mid-Atlantic, as Cyprus is to the eastern Mediterranean.” Speaking today, the Russian ambassador to the UK, claimed Britain was being drawn “too deep” into the conflict in Ukraine, warning that it risks a “dangerous” escalation of the crisis. Andrey Kelin also claimed British “specialists” had been involved in an audacious drone attack on Russia's Black Sea fleet at the weekend in which three warships were reportedly damaged, including the flagship Makarov. Mr Kelin, who said the Kremlin would publish its proof “pretty soon”, added: “We perfectly know about participation of British specialists in training, preparation and execution of plans against the Russian infrastructure and the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. We know that it has been done. “It is dangerous. It can bring us to the line of I would say no return - return is always possible - but we should avoid escalation. “This is a warning actually that Britain is too deep in this conflict. It means that the situation is becoming more and more dangerous.” Mr Kelin said Russia was also continuing to investigate the explosions which damaged the Nord Stream 1 and 2 undersea gas pipelines in September, adding that UK special forces had been involved in training the Ukrainians in the use of explosives and undersea drones. A UK Government spokesman branded the Russian allegations an attempt to “distract attention” for its illegal invasion of Ukraine and its continuing losses on the battlefield. A spokesman added: “We do not plan to give a running commentary on these allegations; it is no secret that the United Kingdom has taken a public lead in our support to Ukraine - this has been enduring since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.”"

And the Russian military rep can be heard telling them the State Duma had taken off the agenda to pay 300,000. In September Russian dictator Vladimir Putin sent out a call for up to 300,000 men to join the battle in Ukraine. One conscript said: ""No one was chasing us!

US President Joe Biden has been briefed on a conversation between Putin and the leader of the mercenary outfit the Wagner Group during which complaints were lodged against defence minister Sergei Shoigu about the running of the war effort in Ukraine. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian oligarch and head of the Wagner Group, reportedly told Putin that he believes the invasion is being mismanaged as he looked to secure more responsibility and resources for his small squad of 5,000 soldiers in Ukraine.

Retired Lieutenant General James Clapper, former director of US National Intelligence, told CNN that he believed the meeting amounted to a “dramatic comment on the erosion of the prestige and power” of both the Russian military and Putin himself, since open dissent of the Russian leader is rare. Mr Clapper added that he believes the reports are just the “tip of the iceberg” and that it is likely there is much more infighting going on in the Kremlin. Mr Clapper said: “There are a couple of things that struck me about this. First, it is the tip of the iceberg in terms of the intrigue that must be going on inside the Kremlin today. “I am sure there is much more of this jockeying and backstabbing that we are not seeing. This is just what is visible to us. “The other thing about this is I think it is a dramatic comment on the erosion of the prestige and power of the Russian military. “When someone like this, an oligarch with a private army, gets direct access to Putin and then complains about the performance of the Russian military, which, by the way, is accurate, [it demonstrates disharmony]. “It also speaks to the possibility that fear and the intimidation factor of Putin that I think has prevailed with him for years now seems to be dissipating.” President Biden has been briefed by US secret services about a conversation that happened last month between Prigozhin and Putin. The oligarch confronted Putin directly about the war, saying he believes it is being completely mismanaged and that the generals put in charge by Putin were destroying the war effort. Members of Putin’s inner circle rarely voice dissent against his policies and experts have suggested the conversation speaks to Prigozhin’s desire for more responsibility and resources for his mercenary outfit, the Wagner Group. Other senior Kremlin officials have also reportedly approached Putin, calling for a change in tactics in the war. US security services are allegedly concerned that some of those senior officials have suggested to Putin the necessity of using a tactical nuclear warhead in Ukraine. As Russia continues to struggle on the ground - Ukrainian Armed Forces claimed last week they had killed 950 Russian troops in 24 hours - the prospect of missiles as a deterrent to further battlefield advances has proved increasingly attractive to Putin. Suicide drones and long-range missiles have been used over the past few weeks by Russia to target energy infrastructure and civilian areas behind the front lines. But the use of a tactical nuclear warhead in Ukraine risks an escalation of unknown proportions, with nuclear war a devastating prospect on a global scale. Following internal criticism of defence minister Shoigu, Putin announced that General Sergei Surovikin, nicknamed General Armageddon, would take over control of all operational activity in Ukraine. His appointment came hours after the explosion on the Kerch Strait bridge connecting Crimea to Ukraine. General Surovikin’s new role points to the infighting within the Kremlin, as well as the escalation in tactics; his first move was to initiate the long-range bombing of Ukrainian cities."
2022-11-03,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1691835/vladimir-putin-news-russia-underwater-drones-internet-cables-ellwood,Putin's underwater drones could cause ‘massive disruption’ by severing internet cables,"Vladimir Putin could deploy submarine-launched drones to sever “vulnerable” undersea cables which keep the UK hooked up to the internet, defence committee chairman Tobias Ellwood has said. And Dr Sidarth Kaushal, a Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), has further warned such a move had the potential to cause “massive disruption”, especially when it came to financial transactions. Tensions between the UK and Russia have been steadily rising ever since Putin ordered his invasion of Ukraine on February 24. And Mr Ellwood, the Tory MP for Bournemouth East, stressed there was no room for complacency. He told Express.co.uk: “There are very clever drones that can operate completely autonomously, that Russians are now developing and knowing that the economic harm they can cause is phenomenal. “Not only that they can they can deny any culpability and that's the direction of travel of the current conflict. “Why bother attacking us directly militarily or in any battlefield when you can bring you can close down communications where the United States temporarily, or certainly interrupt it in a major way? “There was a number of cables that are vulnerable, it's not just communications, it’s also obviously oil and gas as well. “So this is critical national infrastructure, and it needs protecting.” Dr Kaushal told Express.co.uk Russia has a “whole host of deep diving capabilities” at its disposal, including unmanned drones. He added: “They are not only for cutting cables but also for things like in placing sensors on seabed floors, which is one of their major functions. “But one of the things they can do is actually sever undersea cables, or tap them for intelligence depending on the goal that Russia is seeking.” It was therefore entirely feasible to cut through the crucial cables. “The vast majority of, for example, the global internet depends on undersea cables, fibre-optic cables, as well as all the telegraph cables. “It's worth saying, there is quite a bit of redundancy in North Atlantic cable networks, so any given country is connected by multiple cables, you see this even with natural cable outages. “When you do see natural events, disrupting a cable, about a decade ago near Vietnam, for example, it's usually a day's outage. “So it's not like losing a single cable would necessarily sever the UK’s access to the world, but it can produce massive disruption. “And if you do have a kind of systematic pattern of targeting cables then you could actually see some pretty substantial costs imposed. “Not just on people's lives, but particularly on financial transactions which are by their nature very time sensitive and where small delays can cost huge amounts of money.” Asked whether power supplies could likewise be targeted, Dr Kaushal added: “They could target offshore gas infrastructure, but that's not really what the Russians have built their maritime sabotage capability. “They can certainly do it, we saw that with Nord Stream, for example. “But it's not it's not the primary focus - it's more about the flow of electronic information.”"

Vladimir Putin’s forces have already sacrificed thousands of kilometres of occupied territory after Ukraine’s army liberated key strongholds from Russian troops. Video footage from within Kherson captured a loudspeaker announcement which ordered residents to evacuate via “vehicle transport” organised by Putin’s military. Published by media network Visegrad 24, the video clip captured a public broadcast which declared: “Residents must leave the settlement before November 7th.” The loudspeaker blasted: “The danger is imminent. A high level of military threat is expected. “Evacuation is carried out by organised vehicle transport. Head to evacuation points.” Residents of Kherson were told: “Take documents, money, valuable items and warm clothes.” Russian-installed officials have reported the southern region of Ukraine is under threat from an attack by Ukrainian military forces. Kherson was among four key occupied regions in which proxy referendums were conducted among the population to determine if the territory should be formally annexed by the Russian Federation. Global leaders have condemned the votes and declared the result holds no legitimacy given the referendums were conducted without the approval of the Ukrainian Government and there is no independent verification of the Russian voting system. Despite this, the Kremlin has formally declared that the referendums conducted in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia broadly supported Russian annexation. Some state-controlled media outlets in Moscow reported as much as 98 percent of the resident population approved of their region being absorbed into the Russian state. The Kremlin-appointed governor within Kherson reported in a video message that the region could suffer “mass destruction”. Vladimir Saldo said: “Due to the possibility of the use of prohibited methods of war by the Ukrainian regime, as well as information that Kyiv is preparing a massive missile strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, there is an immediate danger of the Kherson region being flooded.” He continued: “Given the situation, I have decided to expand the evacuation zone by 15 kilometres from the Dnipro. The decision will make it possible to create a layered defence in order to repel Ukrainian attacks and protect civilians.” Saldo claimed the evacuation would prevent a “humanitarian catastrophe” at the hands of the Ukrainian military. Ukrainian authorities have denied their military has any plans to attack the Kakhovka hydroelectric facility. Kyiv has instead suggested Russia has made the allegations ahead of a planned Kremlin attack on the dam. Damage to the Kakhovka dam could unleash a reservoir across southern Ukraine, flooding a number of settlements, including Kherson, which Kremlin forces have occupied since the early days of the invasion. In a national address, President Zelesnky claimed: “Russia is turning the Kherson region into a zone without civilisation.” He suggested there was a Kremlin plot to make the southern city an “exclusion zone,” but asserted “the Ukrainian flag will return” to the region"

The pundit delivered a lengthy monologue telling viewers all about the history of the ""Anglo-Saxon,"" from the Roman invasion to the British Raj. Korotchenko surmised that Britain is a ""tribe of islanders who've gone too far"" in a sign the Kremlin is becoming increasingly frustrated by Britain's strong opposition to Putin's ambitions for Ukraine. Korotchenko told Russia1: ""I was delighted by the news that the British ambassador has been summoned to the Foreign Ministry. ""I hope that there will be a tough conversation there, maybe she will be handed a note of protest. ""But it's entirely obvious that our reaction to the Anglo-Saxons must be very harsh, pragmatically and precisely. ""Well here they are, those very same Anglo-Saxon, as my colleague and I were discussing during the break, in actual fact it was the periphery of the great Roman Empire, ""Where savage Britons were running around climbing up trees and attempting to attack Roman legions."" He continued: ""In fact, it's from there, out of that chaos that they went on to restore their might. ""They were pirating, plundering, raping and siphoning off resources from the states they colonised. ""The entire wealth of the City of London is down to them robbing India and dozen of other territories."" He ended the history lecture with a call to put Britain ""back in its place,"" branding the UK a ""tribe of islanders who've gone too far."" It comes as a former US General predicted Vladimir Putin will lose everything as Russia will eventually be forced to give up all Ukrainian territory gained since 2014. Ben Hodges, who served as commanding general of the United States Army in Europe, has predicted that Ukraine will eventually roll back all of Russia's military gains since 2014, including liberating Crimea. Putin is desperate to cling onto the territory in southern and eastern Ukraine which Russian forces have managed to grab but are now struggling to hold as Kyiv mounts renewed offensives powered by western weaponry. The retired general told TimesRadio: ""I believe that Ukraine will have liberated Crimea by the summer and I believe that because we've talked about who has the superior will? ""The Ukrainian soldiers and Ukrainian people compared to the Russians. ""The logistics situation for Russia is terrible you know, the Kersh bridge being damaged, the Russians now are trying to improve the route that runs along past Mariupol in order to resupply their forces in the southern part of Ukraine. ""Their logistics system was already weak I would say exhausted even before this, and now they're adding a couple 100,000 of troops that are just going to be another burden."""
2022-11-03,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691782/putin-uk-us-trianed-soldiers-afghanistan-ukraine-spt,Putin is paying UK and US-trained specialist Afghan soldiers to fight in Ukraine,"With the Russian military struggling in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin has taken drastic measures to bolster his forces. Last month, he announced a partial mobilisation which will see hundreds of thousands of civilians with previous military experience join the war. But Putin isn't just turning to his own population. It was recently reported that Russia has begun recruiting soldiers who fled Afghanistan last year as the US and UK forces withdrew from the country. Afghanistan's elite commandos were trained by the US and UK, but when Western troops left last year, the Afghan soldiers were targeted by the Taliban as the group regained power. This meant many were forced to flee the country with the majority making their way to Iran. But now, the Russian government is offering these highly trained soldiers cash incentives among other things to lure them into fighting for Moscow's military in Ukraine. Lynne O'Donnell, a journalist at Foreign Policy, has reported extensively on the story. Speaking to Monocle 24's The Globalist podcast, she said: ""We are talking about between 20,000 and 30,000 elite, trained, specialist soldiers of the Afghanistan defence forces. They were trained by the US Navy SEALS as well as Britain's SAS. ""Each soldier cost around $300,000 to train, and they were trained not only in Afghanistan but also in the countries they were working with. They were trained in techniques used by specialist western military units like tactical operations, night raids, navigational skills, covert surveillance and interrogation. ""They are unlike the 300,000-350,000 strong Afghan forces. Their loyalty and ability was never really in question...the Afghan forces were infiltrated by Taliban soldiers who killed their colleagues. That never happened with the commandos."" Ms O'Donnell has even spoken directly with some of the former elite commandos to gauge some of the techniques Russia is using to persuade the Afghan fighters to join the Russian military. She says many will be too desperate to turn down the offer. She continued: ""It seems that, because Russia is having a little bit of trouble recruiting people to send to Ukraine, the Afghan commandos offer a very attractive alternative for fighting. The fact is they are elite fighting men, and they are telling me that they are receiving messages offering them jobs in the Russian military. They sign up in Iran and then go off the grid. ""Part of the deal is that they get Russian citizenship and their families can be moved out of Afghanistan. If you are struggling to make $3 a day and someone offers you $1500 to join an elite force, that's pretty attractive."" The journalist also believes they could make a real impact in the war. Various reports over the last eight months have told of logistical issues within the Russian military. Poorly equipped, poorly trained soldiers have been left with little direction in the war. At the start of the invasion, some Russian troops even claimed they had no idea they were about to invade a sovereign nation. But these new Afghan soldiers could make a real difference with their military expertise. Ms O'Donnell explained: ""One of the former commando generals told me that this is a potential game-changer [in Ukraine]. ""There is the Wagner Group which is a shady mercenary group that works for Putin, going into prisons in Russia and offering to cancel sentences if they sign up to fight in Ukraine. These people are not skilled, they are cannon fodder. ""A lot of the skills that the Afghans would be able to offer don't exist in Russia. It could certainly boost the tactical and strategic ability of the Russian army as it struggles in Ukraine."" However, Ms O'Donnell also said that some of the Afghan elite soldiers are reluctant to help the Russians given the country's chequered past. The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979 under the pretext of preserving the Soviet-Afghan Friendship Treaty – signed because Moscow wanted to keep Afghanistan's unpopular communist rulers in power When they were eventually overthrown, the Soviets invaded the country. After a 10-year war, the Soviet Union retreated in 1989 having spent millions and lost 15,000 soldiers. Two million Afghans also lost their lives. The war has been described as 'Russia's Vietnam'. It appears Russia's invasion of Ukraine is headed for a similar conclusion. While there are no universally accepted figures, Putin has lost tens of thousands of soldiers in the fighting in Ukraine."
2022-11-03,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691966/ukraine-russia-war-kherson-commanders-demoralised-troops,Russian commanders flee Kherson 'leaving soldiers behind' as battle looms,"The news came as troops abandoned the administrative centre of the key southern city. An unverified photo showed the Russian flag missing from the southern regional capital’s town hall. Last month Moscow evacuated 25,000 civilians over the border into Russia. One official said: “In Kherson, it is likely that most echelons of command have now withdrawn across the river leaving demoralised and leaderless men to face Ukrainian assaults. Some reservists are arriving in theatre without weapons.” Western sanctions have crippled the Kremlin’s ability to replenish ammunition and weaponry. The official said: “Without the guns and rocket launchers being fired everything is grinding to a halt.” Ukrainian troops have made major gains in the region and a bloody battle was expected to begin soon in an attempt to drive Russian forces out of a city they took over early in the war. But Kyrylo Budanov, the Ukrainian intelligence chief, dismissed talk of a complete Russian withdrawal as an “information operation”, saying Moscow was “trying to create the illusion that everything is lost”. Defeat in Kherson would be a major setback for Vladimir Putin, who is likely to come under increasing pressure from nationalist hardliners. One Western official said: “When it [the retreat] does go ahead we can expect another uptick in pointed criticism of Russian national leadership. “A key task for us will be to continue to track how this impacts on Putin’s credibility. For now, he appears to successfully deflect with pointed barbs at his lieutenants.” Elsewhere, there was alarm last night after Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant became disconnected from the country’s national grid after Russian shelling. Efforts to cut the plant off from the grid risks a catastrophic failure of its cooling systems. Zaporizhzhia is the largest nuclear facility in Europe."
2022-11-03,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691959/north-korea-smuggling-missiles-russia-ukraine-latest,North Korea ‘smuggling missiles’ to Russia as desperate Putin turns to new ally,"North Korea has been accused of covertly shipping ammunition to Russia to help its invasion in Ukraine. The US has claimed the dictatorship is smuggling a “significant number” of artillery shells to Russia, as the Kremlin appears to be increasingly turning to pariah states to shore up its ailing war effort. The White House’s national security spokesman John Kirby said it was not yet known if the ammunition had reached the warfront, but claimed North Korea was obfuscating their delivery by sending it through other countries. North Korea has denied the claims. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr Kirby said: “Our indications are the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the official name of North Korea] is covertly supplying and we’re going to monitor to see whether shipments are received. Our information indicates that they’re trying to obscure the method of supply by funneling them through other countries in the Middle East and North Africa.” He added that they did not believe the munitions would “change the course of the war.” When pressed, Mr Kirby did not say how the weapons were being transported, or if the US intended to try and intercept them. The State Department spokesman, Ned Price, added at a news conference on Wednesday that the United States would use “every tool” to enforce existing sanctions against North Korea. He said it would “look at additional tools and authorities that we may be able to call upon to counter this activity.” Mr Price went on to urge countries with diplomatic ties to North Korea to apply pressure on its government to not provide weapons to Russia. On September 21 North Korea denied similar allegations, with an official at the North Korean Defense Ministry’s General Bureau of Equipment stating: “We have never exported weapons or ammunition to Russia before, and we will not plan to export them.” The revelations follow concerns that Iran may be shipping drones and surface-to-surface missiles to prop up the invasion as well. If accurate, these accusations would mean Iran was violating a UN resolution forbidding the sale of weapons from the country. They also may be more of a threat than those being supplied by North Korea. Ian Williams, deputy director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: “What North Korea is providing to Russia is older, unguided artillery shells. So, the kind that you essentially fire just based on the ballistic trajectory, and it will kind of land where it may. You need a lot of them to really have an impact. “But if you're just firing them indiscriminately into a civilian area, or you're just trying to blanket a large area, it can suffice in certain circumstances.” However, he added he was “actually more concerned with what the Iranians are doing.” Mr Williams explained that the long-range missiles and drones provided by Iran have been used to devastating effect in attacking civilian infrastructure and spreading panic. Mr Kirby said that Putin’s willingness to turn to allies like North Korea and Iran indicate both the deteriorating state of his assault in Ukraine, and his determination to see it through. Mr Williams added that there may be an emotional element, saying: “My belief is that Russia has lost this war, and they are just like the Germans in World War II, continuing to fire V1s and V2s at London. By the end, it was not for any strategic purpose. It was just vengeance and trying to make the British people suffer.” North Korea remains in a state of war with South Korea, even though formal hostilities ended nearly 70 years ago - although last Wednesday saw Kim Jong-Un launched at least 23 missiles into the sea, some aimed towards its southern neighbour. At a meeting of international policy experts in Moscow last week Putin displayed immense hypocrisy in condemning South Korea for supplying weapons to Ukraine and commenting how awful it would be for Russia to trade weapons with North Korea - all while, as this new intelligence would suggest, he had already set plans in motion to do exactly that. He said: “We have learned now that the Republic of Korea has decided to supply weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. This will be destroying our relations. How would the Republic of Korea behave if we resumed cooperation with North Korea in this area? Would you feel happy about this?”"
2022-11-03,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691431/Vladimir-Putin-Russia-Ukraine-war-Institute-for-the-Study-of-War-ont,Putin humiliated as Russian troop salaries set to 'bankrupt Kremlin',"Russian officials have been promising salaries to troops more than twice the average civilian salary, according to the Institute for the Study of War. The report argues that these high salaries will put Russia under financial strain and may cost between 900 billion rubles and three trillion rubles in the next six months. According to the authors of the report, these very high salaries are the way that Moscow is able to attract troops to fight in the conflict but could also put the Russian economy under decades of strain. They said: ""One expert predicted that payouts to mobilized men including social benefits may cost the Kremlin between 900 billion rubles and three trillion rubles (around $14.6-$32.4billion) in the next six months. ""The number does not account for payouts to other categories of servicemen within the Russian forces such as BARS (Combat Army Reserve), volunteer battalions, and the long-term commitment to veterans' payments to contract servicemen, volunteers, non-military specialists who moved to occupied territories, and proxy fighters. ""ISW previously estimated that one volunteer battalion of 400 servicemen costs Russia at least $1.2million per month excluding enlistment bonuses and special payments for military achievements. ""The Kremlin is continuing to rely heavily on financially incentivizing Russians to fight in Ukraine, which will likely continue to strain the Russian economy for decades. ""Russian officials have been promising salaries to volunteers and mobilized men that are more than twice the average Russian civilian salary before and during Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine."" The report goes on to argue that, although the Kremlin is increasingly relying on taxpayers to pick up the bill for the salaries, it may need to dip into the federal reserve. They said: ""The Kremlin has been attempting to deflect part of the cost of the force generation effort onto Russian federal subjects but will likely need to tap into the federal budget more heavily soon. ""United Russia Party Secretary Andrey Turchak, for example, stated that Russian servicemen from all regions must receive uniform benefits and noted that the federal government must cover the difference if the federal subject is unable to fully compensate all participants of the “special military operation. ""Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) Head Denis Pushilin even acknowledged that there are insufficient measures in place to support mobilized personnel and their families in occupied Donetsk Oblast during a United Russia meeting."" The Institute for the Study of War also go on to argue that the high salaries have also started to increase social tensions in the country. They said: ""Russian Telegram channels released footage of mobilized men in Ulyanovsk protesting payment issues. ""Other footage from the Chuvashia Republic shows a presumably Russian local official yelling at protesting mobilized men that she had not promised them a payment of 300,000 rubles (about $4,860). ""Families of mobilized men publicly complained to Voronezh Oblast Governor Alexander Guseyev that they have not received promised compensation of 120,000 rubles (about $1,945). ""The Kremlin will need to continue to pay what it has promised to maintain societal control and some resemblance of morale among Russia’s ad hoc collection of forces. ""ISW has also reported that the Kremlin is igniting conflict within Russian military formations amalgamated from different sources by offering different payments, benefits, and treatment. ""Social media footage from October 31, for example, showed a physical fight between contract servicemen and mobilized men reportedly over personal belongings and military equipment."""

Ms Bertrand explained that Prigozhin was seeking more involvement and more responsibility over the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. She reported latest intelligence briefings suggested further criticism has been brewing among the top brass of Putin's regime, with the leader facing pressure to deliver ""drastic"" change to win. Ms Bertrand said: ""The reason why the US intelligence community found this meeting so interesting, was because it says a lot about Prigozhin's ambitions and also his standing within Putin's inner circle. ""It's not just anyone who can confront Putin directly on this kind of thing. ""Members of Putin's inner circle don't usually decent openly to his policies. ""But, it also says a lot about Prigozhin's ambitions, because what we were told is that he has become more and more emboldened in terms of challenging the Russian defence minister Sergey Shoigu for influence. Ms Bertrand added: ""And of course, he has been telling people that he wants more resources and more responsibility. ""And more everything really, for Wagner forces who are notoriously brutal who are operating in Ukraine at a very large scale, upwards of 5,000 mercenaries now operating in Ukraine. ""So, the Kremlin now is really walking this interesting tightrope, Putin in particular. ""Because it's not only Prighozin who has confronted him, it's also other senior Kremlin officials we're told saying, look you need to change something about the way this war is going. ""US intelligence officials are really concerned about that, they're watching how Putin responds because some of these officials are saying you need to do something more, you need to do something potentially drastic."" Putin has been ramping up his threats on Ukraine and other Western countries in recent weeks, along with trying to bolster his military forces in order to fight on the frontlines. Prigozhin was exposed in a leaked video speaking to Russian prisoners that he was recruiting them to join the battlefield in Ukraine just a few weeks ago. The pair have been upping the ante in order to try and succeed in the ongoing invasion and reverse Ukraine's military gains. The UK's Ministry of Defence has also been watching to see how involved the Wagner Group is in Ukraine. In a recent intelligence update, which was published on October 30, the MoD said: ""On October 27, Russian mogul Yevgeny Prigozhin posted online, apparently admitting allegations that his private military company, the Wagner Group, had altered its standards and was recruiting Russian convicts suffering from serious diseases including HIV and Hepatitis C. ""The role of Wagner Group has evolved significantly since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. ""Prigozhin has recently discussed plans to create a 200km long defensive ‘Wagner Line’ in eastern Ukraine. This endeavour would require a large labour force. ""There is a realistic possibility that some of the convict recruits will initially be put to work constructing the defences."""

A video reportedly recorded in the Russian enclave of Kalingrad appears to show soldiers boarding Russian army buses boozed up and in the full knowledge that ""they are cannon fodder."" The man behind the camera described the scene: ""Here they brought the boys from Kaliningrad. On buses, buses are full. To go to Ukraine ""They are all drunk looking for vodka, they want to at least get drunk before death, asking where the shops are. ""I'm in the airport of Khrabrovo city, Kaliningrad oblast. Today is 25 October. ""The boys understand they are cannon fodder, I spoke to them. ""Many cops here, they don't let talk too much."" Waving off the buses, he adds: ""Alright, guys. To the meat slaughterhouse."" It comes after drunken Russian soldiers were filmed in a bloody brawl with officers at a military base in Eastern Russia. The man holding the camera said: ""Mobilised men are fighting crowd on crowd. ""Look… they are even dragging some of them to the fields. ""Some are jumping over here across a fence. This is a really tough fight. ""Those who pass out are dragged away. They are beating each other really, really hard. ""They are just crushing the guys. Some needs assistance, help."" ""These guys are from intelligence,"" he added. They are knocking down [the mobilised soldiers]."" Russia launched the mobilisation of 300,000 civilians in September after suffering major losses at the hand of Ukraine's counter-offensive. Mobilised personnel have lamented the conditions they have been sent to fight in, citing a lack of appropriate equipment as well as training before being sent to fight Kyiv's defence forces. While the official number of military casualties on the Russian side has yet to be confirmed, the Kremlin is believed to have lost over 5,000 soldiers since the start of the conflict in February."

New satellite images have shown that the saboteur was successful in his mission, with a conflagration being reported and at least three helicopters damaged. Sharing the clip with her viewers, CNN anchor Ana Cabrera said: ""We're getting some new video, I wanna show you. ""Alledging showing Putin's military helicopters being sabotaged deep inside Russia, more than 600miles from Ukraine. ""You can see an unidentified man appearing to prepare and planting explosives onto an aircraft. ""And at times he holds what could be a timer to his ear."" Ms Cabrera added: ""CNN has traced this video to an airfield in Russia. ""Explosions were reported that night, and a satellite image later shows several damaged helicopters there. ""Ukraine is not directly saying whether or not it's responsible for this attack. ""But says the explosions were the result of mining and that three helicopters were destroyed."" Veretye Airbase was reported to of been penetrated from around 15 miles away from the Russian border with Estonia. The Russian airbase is located 500 miles away from Ukraine. A Russian official has claimed that security was lacking on Veretyre Airbase, making it easier for such an attack to be carried out. He told Radio Free Europe: “It’s fairly easy to get into that military unit, there is zero security. You can get to any of the nearby villages and walk to the runway.” Western officials have also been speculating that Putin might sabotage energy supplies for countries in Europe this winter. The head of analysis, energy and climate intelligence unit, Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin told Express.co.uk exclusively: ""This reflects just how seriously the Government is taking the risks that are being caused by the ongoing gas crisis, and obviously, we'll depend a lot on whether the winter is cold. ""If it is, then we'll have to use more gas. But across the continent, other countries will be using more gas, so we'll be less able to buy extra gas. ""There is also a possibility that Russia causes further disruption in supplies, meddling in different ways like they have for the past year."""

The Russian civilians asked for their views on the invasion of Ukraine and claimed that they did not think the war was going to plan. And one Russian civilian slammed Putin and his generals for having ""s**t for brains"". The Russian president has been trying to control the state media news narrative on the illegal invasion since before the beginning of the onslaught. One Russian civilian said: ""I don't think it's going to plan. ""It hasn't been from the very beginning because Kyiv wasn't taken in three days and there was no (Russian) military parade there."" Another man added: ""It's mostly not going according to plan. I realised that right away, but no one asked for our opinion."" A Russian woman commented: ""It's not going according to the plan, I'm sure of that. Our troops are retreating (Ukraine is) attacking."" Another Russian man declared: ""After we retreated from Kyiv? Our generals have s**t for brains if you'll forgive me."" A Russian citizen vocalised: ""I think it's all going according to plan, they're just sparing the civilians."" Another citizen said: ""I don't think it's our business to discuss that, I think there are smart people higher up who know what they're doing."" A Russian couple said: ""Who can say, ask Vladimir Putin about that, I think it's going according to plan."" Another person added: ""Yes, if the plan was to destroy Russia, I've just been to a metro store half of the products are missing, it'll probably be shut down soon, and we'll all be shut down, too. ""There will be only Putin left in his bunker."" Another Russian laded claimed: ""Of course, it's not going according to plan, the country should have been prepared for the war."" Before the beginning of the Russian onslaught, Putin had been ramping up control of information channels in Russia. His state media channels have been pumping out disinformation about the West and Putin has even banned social media platforms such as Tiktok, Meta, Twitter and various other independent sites making it even harder for Russian citizens to hear anything alternative. Putin even refused to call the illegal invasion a war and instead has been forcing state media channels to refer to it as a special operation. The new face of the anti-Kremlin movement Dmitry Palyugan, a Russian deputy from the St Petersburgh municipal is trying to get Russian civilians to back and support an appeal to the State Duma. The appeal is to try and force Russian dictator Vladimir Putin out of power. Mr Palyuga said: ""We want to unite people from different groups because we have three large groups of people.

In footage released online, the Russian aircraft can be seen flying low to the ground as two Ukrainian soldiers watch on. A missile is spotted striking the aircraft, before the plane eventually careens into the nearby countryside, exploding as one soldier cries “Yes, yes!”. It comes as reports show Ukrainian soldiers have been using Soviet-era weapons dating as far back as the 1960s to destroy Russian bases and military equipment. In a video released by Radio Free Europe, Ukrainian soldiers discussed how they made the most of outdated equipment. Asked about the “effectiveness” of their Soviet-era weaponry, one Ukrainian soldier, known as Olha, said: “Fifty-fifty, because it is old. “You can say that it is effective but the new equipment is more effective.” Another soldier, discussing his tank, said: “It has already lived life a little. Soviet-era. There are certain nuances to the mechanics. “It can go and go as it should and then you have to bang something somewhere, some cable or pipe. In short, everything has a tendency to break. ""The main thing is to repair everything quickly and then everything will be fine.” One soldier, an elder man called Serhiy, reported that the tank he was operating, though equipped with a “completely new” bottom and chassis, was from 1986. Nonetheless, the Ukrainian forces in the east have destroyed scores of Russian equipment and forced the retreat of thousands of enemy soldiers. Another soldier, named Ilya, explained the process of attacking Russian bases using short-range missile launchers and tanks. He said: “If we see the enemy, we are told how many there are, if there are tanks or armoured vehicles, and based on that, we are immediately given the coordinates of the target. “We hit it, that is not up for discussion. We sometimes shoot 60 or 70 shells a day. Now that the enemy has realised we have such firepower, they have paused [their attack].” Bakhmut has been the scene of some of the most lethal and long-lasting fighting of the Russian invasion. Ukraine’s 58th motorised infantry brigade, alongside other outfits, have been locked in battle with Russian forces, including members of the mercenary Wagner Group, dubbed “disposable soldiers” by Putin’s Army, for roughly four months. Ukraine’s Armed Forces have been using drones to coordinate and monitor in “real time” the effectiveness of strikes from distance. But since October, the front lines have remained for the most part stationary, with both forces gaining and losing territory. As the focus of the war shifts to the south, with the battle for the strategic port of Kherson north of Crimea likely to prove seminal to the trajectory of the conflict ahead of winter, Ukraine has been focused on simply holding their lines in the east while trying to limit losses. Meanwhile, Russia used drones, missiles and heavy artillery to bomb a number of cities and energy infrastructure facilities this week, killing at least six civilians and wounding a further 16 Ukrianians. Over the past day, six cities and villages in the Donetsk region were attacked by heavy artillery, while in the northeast, Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv was hit by three missiles, officials said. The city of Nikopol was also shelled, damaging residential buildings, a gas station and several private enterprises, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said Thursday."

The agreement a allows the export of grain from designated Black Sea ports. During the phone conversation Mr Erdogan expressed his delight that the two countries had resolved the issue around grain shipments through cooperation the Turkish Presidency said in a statement. The statement added that while it was vital for the world that Russia and Ukraine could sell their grain shipments Mr Erdogan emphasised the continuation of the grain shipment agreement. Writing on Twitter Mr Zelensky thanked Mr Erdogan for his efforts on the grain deal and support for Ukraine. He said: ""I thanked Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his active participation in preserving the grain deal, for his steadfast support of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine."" Mr Zelensky added that he is hoping for Turkish support in terms of securing the return of Ukrainian prisoners of war and political prisoners. Earlier on Wednesday Russia had announced that it was restart the implementation of the grain export deal. Moscow claimed that Kyiv had promised not to use the humanitarian corridor for military attacks. Russian Defence minister Sergei Shoigu also told his Turkish counterpart Hulusi Akar that the grain deal would ""continue in the same way as before"" from Wednesday Mr Erdogan told members of his ruling AK party at parliament. He said the ""good news"" had followed a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. The two leaders had discussed the implementation of the grain deal . The first shipments will prioritise African countries such as Somalia, Djibouti, and Sudan according to Mr Erdogan. Ukraine and Russia separately signed a document on July 22 with Turkey and the United Nations in Istanbul. It allowed for the resumption of food and fertilizer shipments from Ukrainian seaports to international markets. On October 29 Russia withdrew from the agreement citing Ukrainian ""terrorist attacks against ships of the Black Sea Fleet and civilian vessels involved in guaranteeing the security of the grain corridor."" However according to the Russian Defense Ministry in a statement Turkey and the UN pursuaded Ukraine to issue a written guarantee on Tuesday that it wouldn't use Black Sea ports or shipping lanes covered by the deal for military operations."
2022-11-03,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691420/Russian-nuclear-strike-west-Ukraine-united-states-ont,Russian nuclear strike plans discussed by Kremlin leaders leaves West on state of alert,"US officials revealed that generals in Russia have previously discussed plans of how and when they may use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. The New York Times reported that Joe Biden’s administration was sent into a high state of alert after hearing about the conversations which were held in mid-October by Kremlin officials. Officials clarified to the New York Times that the Russian President was not part of the discussions of nuclear weapons. Despite the discussions of using such tactical weapons, the United States has since clarified that they have not seen any evidence of Russia preparing for such an attack. US intelligence has said that the vehicles used to launch such missiles, suc as the RS-23 Yars, have not been observed manoeuvring into launch positions. The newspaper added that tensions were further eased when Russia’s defence minister General Sergei Shoigu held a number of phone calls with his counterparts in Western nations. It was during one of these calls to Defence Secretary Ben Wallace that Shoigu made the accusation that Russia thought that Ukraine was planning on using a ‘dirty bomb’. Despite this warning which was immediately dismissed and seen as a potential move by Russia to instigate a false flag operation, the open line of communication between Russia and the West was seen as vital and positive. It was also reassuring to Washington that Putin previously said in a speech that he had no intention of deploying nuclear weapons and ultimately, the decision will be his. However, with warning of nuclear attacks regularly emerging from Russia, the West is continuing to focus on the issue, especially as Putin continues to suffer embarrassing setbacks in Ukraine. Nuclear weapons are thought of as either tactical or strategic with the former being used to win an individual battle and the latter to win a war. Talking to CNN, Andrei Kelin, Moscow’s ambassador to the UK said that the use of such weapons was “out of the question”. Despite this, Russia can still use the threat of the weaponry to escalate tensions with Ukraine, NATO and the world. The movements of launch vehicles will most likely be visible to the US and British satellites and just their movement can be enough to instigate initial stages of discussions to de-escalate the situation. Another method which could be employed by Russia may be that they stop alerting the US to their nuclear exercises. Following this, Russia may launch low-yield weapons directly into Ukraine but it is safer and still effective for Putin to allow officials to be overheard by the West discussing the use of nuclear weapons."

A Russian who fought in Moscow’s 423rd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment and a number of conscripts in his regiment were forced to pretend they were dead after they were left with just machine guns as defence. His wife revealed their tactics and said that both he and others are set to face court martial after they left the frontline. Ekaterina, spoke of how her 27-year-old husband was being trained in trench digging before he was moved to the frontline. Speaking to Novaya Gazeta Europe, an independent Russian news outlet, she said: “For many hours they simply lay on the ground and pretended to be dead for one simple reason: they no longer had any weapons other than machine guns. “There were mortars against them, drones flew over them, if they even moved a finger, then a drone would immediately fly in and destroy them.” With a number of conscripts reportedly being underage, and the majority given minimal training and little equipment, it is not surprising that morale among Russian troops is low. According to officials in the West, antidepressant sales in Russia have soared since Putin’s war in Ukraine. Irina, the wife of another Russian soldier said that her husband, 24, was shelled for 12 hours which left one of his commanders “torn to pieces”. She said how the remaining commander ordered the troops to retreat before senior officials forced them back to the frontline. She added: “After the refused to return, they were offered new equipment, bulletproof vests, helmets – or a court martial.” They stated that “Russians feel frightened” as the impact of Putin’s war on the economy and on Russians begins to take hold. A Western official said that Russia’s false belief that the war in Ukraine would be a quick win was short-sighted and that “they still don’t have a plan B”. Russia’s failures along with the increased hardship Russians are facing has led to an increase in dissent against the Kremlin’s regime. With the elite concerned about their finances and businesses, and adults worried for their children’s futures Russia is turning against Putin’s actions. According to the official, Putin “has been weakened by this really catastrophic error”. Figures have revealed that Russians have spent 70 percent more on antidepressants in the first eight months of this year compared to last. In September, Putin declared that more men would be drafted into the army which sparked a mass exodus of men who would be drafted. It is thought that at least 400,000 people have fled Russia since the announcement."
2022-11-03,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691182/russia-media-putin-military-losses-ukraine-spt,Putin's media turns on him: Russian president facing dissent from country's news outlets,"Ukrainian forces are making progress near the city of Kherson which was annexed by Moscow in October. Reports in recent weeks suggest this will be the next key battleground and could indicate who will ultimately win the war. Russian President Vladimir Putin will be hoping that his military can avoid another setback in what has already been an embarassing offensive campaign. While estimates vary, the Kremlin's forces have lost tens of thousands of soldiers since the start of the invasion in February. State media in Russia was, at first, determined to conceal this reality from the country's citizens. But in recent months broadcasters and the print media have started to vent their frustration at the lack of progress made by Russian troops. This was highlighted by the BBC's Moscow Correspondent, Steve Rosenberg, in September. He translated a number of newspaper articles and state TV broadcasts that covered Ukraine's counteroffensive in Kharkiv where Ukrainian forces were able to take back a large area of territory previously occupied by the Russians. In one example, a Putin loyalist said: ""On the frontlines of the special operation [in Ukraine], this has been the toughest week so far"" — the words of Dmitry Kiselyov, who is one of the Kremlin's most prominent propagandists. He added: ""It was particularly tough along the Kharkiv front, where following an onslaught by enemy forces that outnumbered ours, [Russian] troops were forced to leave towns they had previously liberated."" Russian tabloid newspaper, Moskovsky Komsomolets, quoted a military analyst who gave a surprisingly honest view of what was going on in Ukraine: ""It's already clear that we underestimated the enemy. [Russian forces] took too long to react and the collapse came… As a result, we suffered a defeat and tried to minimise the loss by withdrawing our troops so they weren't surrounded."" Not every media outlet gave the same version of events, though. Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a newspaper published by the Russian government, denied that Russian forces had retreated from nearby towns and cities. A passage read: ""The Russian defence ministry dismissed rumours that Russian troops fled in disgrace from Balakliya, Kupiansk and Izyum. They didn't flee. This was a pre-planned regrouping."" Other reports show the lengths the Russian government is going to in order to conceal its losses in Ukraine. Last week, CNN reported how Belarus is helping to treat and hide injured Russian soldiers. In the early stages of the war, Belarus allowed Russian troops to use the country as an entry point into Ukraine and stage an attack on Kyiv. However, they failed to take the Ukrainian capital and later retreated. As the operation fell apart, Russia sent some of its wounded soldiers to be treated in Belarus, and Belarussian doctors treated these soldiers and were even forced to sign non-disclosure agreements so that no one would hear about what was going on, it has been claimed. Russia doesn't release figures on how many soldiers it has lost in the war, but in August, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said that British estimates put the figure at around 80,000 if injuries and desertions were included. He told BBC's Radio 4: “I spoke to my intelligence chiefs this morning before coming on, you know, Russia’s advance can be measured in metres per week, not miles. “It is grinding in small parts of the country in an attempt to advance – completely opposite of the three-days special operation that it touted at the beginning of this, six months ago. “We pretty much accept, well, we do accept, the sort of observations of Russian losses to be – if you combine deaths, injuries, desertions – over 80,000 of their armed forces. That’s 80,000 in six months compared to 15,000 they lost in a decade in Afghanistan. I think we are in a position where Russia is in a very fragile position.” Influential figures in Russia have also raised questions about the losses endured. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said last week that his forces have suffered serious losses fighting alongside the Russian military in Ukraine. He said: “At the beginning of this week, one of the Chechen units was shelled in the Kherson region. Twenty-three fighters have died and 58 have been injured.” In September, Kadyrov criticised the Russian military after the Kharkiv counteroffensive, and said that if the situation didn't improve, he would be forced to confront Moscow's defence ministry. Kadyrov warned: “If today or tomorrow no changes in strategy are made, I will be forced to speak with the leadership of the defence ministry and the leadership of the country to explain the real situation on the ground to them. It’s a very interesting situation. It’s astounding, I would say."""

He claimed he and fellow conscripts had resorted to ""drinking water from puddles"" in Ukraine as they were left without appropriate supplies. Reports have been emerging for weeks of the poor conditions Vladimir Putin's troops have been forced to fight in, with some claiming that soldiers were not being given the necessary military clothing, helmets and weapons. The Russian man asked his friend: ""How's it going, are you alright there?"" The Russian soldier said: ""Alright, taking in an encirclement, f****ng..."" The friend asked: ""Who is closing the encirclement? You or them?"" The soldier said: ""Them, f**k half the people f***ed off to villages and such, can you imagine? 50,60 people left but they say 150 (gunshots) can you hear this?"" As the conscript spoke, gunfire could be heard going off in the background, with the friend asking: ""F**k is that shooting?"" The Russian soldier explained: ""Yeah, haha. Here the helicopters are operating, you know how many corpses are here? We're sick of getting them out."" The Russian man asked: ""Are they giving you food at least?"" The soldier explained: ""F*cking every three days, we're drinking water from the puddles."" ""We're collecting rainwater from, and Putin was saying the mobilised will be paid 190,000. ""But the boys are getting 2-4000 don't their cards, can you imagine?"" ""F**k fighting like that for 4,000 I'd rather o and beat the f*ck out of the commissar, s**t in his mouth."" Putin has been trying to bolster his army in Ukraine and called for up to 300,000 Russian men to join the battle. Verified accounts suggest Russia has lost over 5,000 troops since the beginning of the onslaught in Ukraine but the number could be far greater. There have been ongoing reports of the poor treatment of Russian soldiers at the hands of Russian senior military generals. Britians Ministery of Defence discussed some new reports which found that Russia had failed to equip its new conscripts with necessary weapons and clothing. The MoD tweeted: ""Russia has deployed several thousand newly mobilised reservists to the front line in Ukraine since mid-October. In many cases, they are poorly equipped. ""In September, Russian officers were concerned that some recently mobilised reservists were arriving in Ukraine without weapons. ""Open source images suggest that those rifles which have been issued to mobilised reservists are typically AKMs, a weapon first introduced in 1959.

""The integration of reservists with contract soldiers and combat veterans in Ukraine will mean Russian logisticians will have to push two types of small arms ammunition to front line positions, rather than one.

Mikhail Khodorkovsky has claimed that since holding talks with Chinese allies the Kremlin are less likely to deploy nuclear weapons. He added that in spite of MI6 fears over Putin being replaced with someone even more hostile, there could be no one more ""dangerous"" than the warmongering President. Speaking to Kirsty Wark on Newsnight, Mr Khodorkovsky shared his insight into the inner workings of the Kremlin. When asked about the most recent former Head of MI6's comments that ""if Putin is brought down be careful what you wish for, because there might be an even more dangerous despot put in his place"", the Russian replied: ""I can't imagine what the distinguished gentleman is expecting in terms of more dangerous. ""Before us stands a man who began the war, who threatens to use nuclear weapons, and who threatens to expand that war to NATO countries. ""What does he think could be more dangerous than that?"" Putin has continuously warned that he is prepared to use nuclear force and has insisted he is ""not bluffing"". Ms Wark then asked Mr Khodorkovsky what he thought the chances of that actually happening were as a percentage. He replied: ""There was that growing danger, but after talks with his Chinese colleague Putin has become much more cautious when talking about nuclear weapons. ""So I think that danger has now diminished."" In terms of Putin eventually being deposed Mr Khodorkovsky stated that the Russian leader would ""lose power only if he is defeated militarily"". He added: ""There are a number of groups who might seize power, but I don't think that any of them could hang onto it. ""But if we're looking to somebody who could hold power after Putin, then we would have to look to the Russian regions."" Foreign Secretary James Cleverly has slammed Putin's ongoing war rhetoric, saying his words were ""unclear, untrue and unedifying""."

Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin is said to be growing increasingly skilled at spotting the Kremlin's weaknesses and exploiting them for his own political ends. Mr Soldatov told CNN: ""[Prigozhin's] extremely ambitious and now it seems that he's getting ambitious politically. ""He's really good at identifying the weak spots the Kremlin has and two weeks ago it was mostly about the military and Prigozhin criticised the military openly and he got some changes.

It comes as the UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said momentum on the ground remains with Ukraine, with Crimea expected to come within range of Ukrainian artillery by the end of November. Boris Johnson has said he does not believe Vladimir Putin will use a tactical nuclear weapon in the conflict with Ukraine, as it would be ""crazy"" to wreak ""total disaster"" on his own country. The former prime minister said the act would ""immediately tender Russia's resignation from the club of civilised nations"" and plunge the country into a ""kind of cryogenic economic freeze"". He added that he suspects it would trigger an ""absolutely hysterical reaction"" in Russia itself. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson said he does not think it is ""credible"" for Mr Putin to retain the territory his troops still hold in regions such as Kherson, in southern Ukraine. ""I don't think that's credible for him anymore,"" he said. This sentiment was echoed by Mr Wallace at a meeting of the Lords International Relations and Defence Committee on Tuesday. ""The direction of travel is that I think it is likely that by the end of this month, the northern part of Kherson will be depleted of Russians or the Russians will have left that part, which brings into range parts of Crimea from long-range artillery that Ukraine held or the HIMARS-type systems,"" he said. This week, the UK's Foreign Secretary James Cleverly warned that Russia's assault on Ukraine is ""not limited to its horrific land invasion"", as Moscow has ""persistently attempted to invade Ukraine's cyberspace, threatening critical information, services and infrastructure"". The Government claimed Russian actors have a ""long history of hostile and destabilising activity"" against Ukraine, with alleged past targets including the country's electricity grid, finance and energy sectors, Kyiv's metro and Odessa's airport.

A deal was brokered on July 22 between Turkey and the UN to allow grain ships to pass through the area, however, Moscow has recently extricated itself from the agreement. Ships are continuing to be loaded and move out of ports thanks to Turkish cooperation. Putin withdrew from the deal claiming he could not guarantee the safety of civilian ships after his fleet were attacked in the Black Sea. Speaking in his Tuesday night address the Ukrainian President said: ""A reliable and long-term defence is needed for the grain corridor. ""Russia must clearly be made aware that it will receive a tough response from the world to any steps to disrupt our food exports. ""At issue here clearly are the lives of tens of millions of people."" The aim of the grain deal was to provide extra sunflower oil, wheat and fertiliser for world markets in order to prevent millions suffering from hunger. Before the war Ukraine exported five million metric tonnes of food supplies every month. The UN coordinator for grain and fertiliser exports under the accord posted an update on Twitter on Tuesday saying he expected ""loaded ships to leave Ukrainian ports on Thursday"". Ukrainian Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on Twitter that eight vessels were expected to pass through the corridor on Thursday, reported Reuters. Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar has been in contact with Russia twice over the past two days. He said he expected to hear a response ""today and tomorrow"". Moscow has also been accused of targeting key Ukrainian infrastructure such as power plants, plunging millions into darkness. President Zelensky said: ""We will do everything we can to provide power and heat for the coming winter. ""But we must understand that Russia will do everything it can to destroy normal life."""
2022-11-02,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691129/Russia-war-Ukraine-old-broken-equipment-fuel-tankers-military-reservists-vn,"Russia sending broken-down trucks to Ukraine-based soldiers, new footage shows","Russia is sending broken fuel tankers to the front lines in Ukraine as they struggle to restock their dwindling supplies of military equipment. In footage released on social media, dozens of purportedly “new” vehicles based on the Ural-375, which were built in the 20th century, can be seen being attended to by Russian engineers. A German journalist who shared the footage commented that “some of them are broken even before reaching Ukraine”. The footage further highlights the struggles that Russian forces are facing on the battlefield after sweeping Ukrainian counterassaults over the past two months have left Putin’s soldiers short on equipment, while reservists are being sent to the front lines with second-hand, malfunctioning weapons. Journalist Julian Röpcke shared the footage, alongside some screenshots of the fuel tankers, on his social media. The photos suggest the vehicles are, in fact, second-hand despite claims they were brand new. He captioned the video: “‘New’ Russian fuel tankers, sent to Ukraine, are based on the Ural-375, built between 1960 and 1982. “Seems some of them are broken even before reaching Ukraine”. Another social media user familiar with the equipment compared it to the Unimog 435, which is a fuel tanker built by Mercedes-Benz in the same period. They suggested the fuel consumption of the Russian vehicle was more than twice the amount of the German model. They said: “Average consumption is 50 litres per 100 kilometres and increases when driving off-road and when the vehicle is loaded. “A Unimog 435 from the same decade consumes between 17.5 and 20 litres per hundred kilometres. Expensive fun even for Russia.” As Putin’s soldiers in Ukraine are reportedly already struggling with a lack of supplies, Russia’s problems appear to have been compounded by poorly-equipped reservists as they begin to enter the war zone. Many of the mobilised soldiers have been armed with “barely usable” weapons, according to British defence analysts, dating back to the 1950s. Open source images suggest that the troops have been issued rifles of a type which could be over 60 years old, such as the AKM assault rifle, which uses ammunition incompatible with the current weapons used by fighting Russian soldiers. The intelligence update, posted by the MoD on Twitter, said: “In September, Russian officers were concerned that some recently mobilised reservists were arriving in Ukraine without weapons. “Open source images suggest that those rifles which have been issued to mobilised reservists are typically AKMs, a weapon first introduced in 1959. Many are likely in barely usable condition following poor storage. “The integration of reservists with contract soldiers and combat veterans in Ukraine will mean Russian logisticians will have to push two types of small arms ammunition to frontline positions, rather than one. This will likely further complicate Russia's already strained logistics systems.” Fears that they will have to enter the warzone poorly equipped have led thousands of Russians to flee the country, a problem that has become so significant that neighbouring Poland announced on Wednesday it was erecting fences across its shared border. Polish soldiers began laying razor wire Wednesday along Poland's border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad after the government ordered the construction of a barrier to prevent what it fears could become another migration crisis."

In the footage, the badly damaged drone can be seen lying in a field as Ukrainian soldiers prepare to recover the debris An Eleron-3SV drone is said to cost the Russian military €150.000 per unit. It is believed the downed Eleron will now be examined by Ukrainian specialists to learn more about Russia's drone technology. The Eleron-3SV is used by Russian forces as a surveillance and reconnaissance drone and can be used to correct artillery fire and spot potential ambushes. UAVs have seen widespread use by all sides in the Ukraine conflict. This week, Military analyst Cedric Leighton belittled Russian attempts to destroy Ukraine's national grid with punitive drone strikes. The retired US Air Force colonel argued that Ukraine's will to resist Putin is likely to outlast the Kremlin's ability to replace used-up drones, branding Russia's latest strategy to win the war as futile. Mr Leighton told CNN: ""You're looking at who can run out the clock the fastest in other words who can really run out their supplies. ""I think what you're looking at is the possibility at least, that Russia is going to expend its missiles, especially the type of cruise missiles, these are air launch cruise missiles that they've used in these particular attacks. ""They will lose those they will run out of those more quickly, then the Ukrainians will lose their will to fight and the Ukrainians will certainly be able to restore some of their power, some of their water before too long. ""I think they'll be able to do this in a fairly concerted fashion, they'll need some help to do it but it's going to be something where they will beat the clock in terms of whether or not Putin will run this or not. ""But it is certainly a case where the Russians are going to be spending a lot of money and a lot of weapons in a perhaps futile effort to coerce the Ukrainians."" It comes after suspected Ukrainian maritime drones strike Russian ships based in the Crimean port of Sevastopol. Footage supposedly recorded by the Ukrainian UAVs shows Russian forces desperately racking the sea with gunfire in an attempt to save their ships. Kremlin officials looked to point the finger of blame for what they termed a ""terrorist attack"" on the UK, claiming with evidence that the British military had been aided by the Ukrainian units involved in the audacious strike. Russia's defence ministry said: ""Nine unmanned aerial vehicles and seven autonomous marine drones were involved in the attack.

Over the past few months, Putin has resorted to a number of tactics designed to overcome the significant losses sustained on the battlefield and Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, former Commander of US Army forces in Europe, told Times Radio that the “weaponization of refugees” is the latest of those methods. He claimed by “specifically targeting Ukraine’s power generation capabilities”, Russia was deliberately forcing the nation’s inhabitants to flee to nearby Europe before the harsh reality of winter makes the lack of energy and power too devastating to tolerate. Lieutenant General Hodges said: “It was actually General Breedlove, former secretary here, who I first heard use the phrase weaponization of refugees, which is what Syria, with Russian support, was doing by using chemical weapons against their opponents, putting millions of refugees on the road towards Europe. “Now, of course, what the Russians are doing by attacking the power infrastructure across all of Ukraine, I mean specifically targeting their power generation capabilities, making Ukrainian cities less and less inhabitable as winter approaches, potentially, you are looking at another two million refugees going into Europe. “This would not be a surprise to the Russians that what they are doing would cause this kind of effect. “This is all intended to put pressure on Western Governments so that they will lose the willingness to continue supporting Ukraine.” Russian use, or at least its condoning, of the weaponization of refugees is not a new concept; as highlighted by Lieutenant General Hodges, the Russian-backed Syrian government, led by President Bashar al-Assad, have used this tactic in the last eight years. As Russian soldiers appear to be losing on the battlefield, with roughly 72,000 troops killed since the invasion on February 24, more than a thousand of which were killed last weekend, according to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Putin looks to be employing this strategy to offset those issues. On Monday, the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and the northeastern city of Kharkiv were bombed by Russian strikes yet again. Even Lviv, in the far northwest of Ukraine, which is a city that has avoided ground combat altogether owing to its proximity to Poland, just under 70 kilometres away, has suffered Russian strikes in the last few weeks. Among Putin’s other tactics, such as annexing territory in the east and south of Ukraine in an effort to assert a legal right over the land, a strategy that has summarily failed as Russian troops continue to be pushed out of those territories nevertheless, Russia appears to be trying to weaponize refugees as emphatically as possible. Hundreds of Ukrainians have died in the long-range strikes of late, with the rest of the civilian population living with the continual sound of air raid sirens. The act of forcing non-fighting Ukrainians to leave the country has a number of benefits to Russia. It risks overwhelming Western supporters with an influx of refugees, effectively blackmailing those nations into withdrawing their support of Ukraine to maintain civility within their own borders. It also allows Russia to avoid battlefield combat and rely on their preferred method of “scorched earth” tactics, which involve razing territories to the ground using long-range weapons, after which their soldiers are sent in to overcome the few remaining soldiers. The depopulation of civilian Ukraine permits such tactics to be used without the risk of counterintuitively appalling the West into continued support of Ukraine by brutally bombing civilian territories. It also reduces the number of Ukrainians the Armed Forces can call upon if and when they are needed. Additionally, the mass migration of the Ukrainian population will make it considerably harder for the country to remain a sustainable independent state with a functioning economy. Since the Russian invasion in February, about 8 million Ukrainians have fled the country and Putin had hoped that overwhelming western nations with refugees would destabilise them – especially neighbouring Poland. So far, however, he has been disappointed, but it is uncertain how many more refugees Europe can sustain."

The British journalist also reported many other billionaire businessmen who did not agree with Putin's war in Ukraine could not speak out about it as easily as they could face jail time and their families could be harmed. Mr Tinkov's decision comes amid reports of up to seven high-profile businessmen who have condemned Putin's regime. Mr Chance told CNN: ""Yeah I mean it's got a point in that direction. ""I think you have to remember that Oleg Tinkov is a unique case. ""He sold his businesses already in Russia, he's got leukaemia so he may feel he's got nothing to lose. ""But of course, there are many many other business people in the country that have a lot to lose, speaking out like that would probably mean the end of your business. He added: ""It could mean jail, it could mean danger for your family. ""So, even if they agree with what Oleg Tinkov has to say, they're probably going to keep their mouth shut. ""Having said that the fact that anyone is speaking out at all... And there are several high-profile business people. ""It indicates the economic impact that this war is having on Russia."" Some Russian oligarchs have been sanctioned by Western Governments, as a way to impact Putin economically and stop him from syphoning funds to pay for his ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Despite calls from Western leaders for other global governments to do so. Vladyslav Huntyk, a Ukrainian coder and the founder of a mobile app has called for more economic pressure to be put on oligarchs. Mr Huntyk told Express.co.uk: “We decided that the more pressure we can put on [the oligarchs’] shoulders, the more pressure they will put on Putin’s shoulders. “The most convenient way is to ask people who know [about these assets] because you can't identify that some real estate belongs to an oligarch just by looking at it. “But this information can be known by people who, for example, are their neighbours, they might know that this is the oligarch’s daughter’s property. “Or perhaps a bank employee who knows that a specific bank account belongs to an oligarch. “Or a boat crew, they would know that the boat belongs to them. “So we are trying to target a specific group of people who would have this kind of information.”"

If Ukrainian forces keep their momentum and retake their territory, Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky claims the Russian President will lose power. And regional politicians could be the key to toppling Putin, Mr Khodorkovsky added. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, he said: ""Putin will lose power only if he's defeated militarily. ""There are a number of groups who might seize power. ""But I don't think that any of them could hang on to it. ""But if we're looking for somebody who could hold power after Putin, then we would have to look to the Russian regions."" Vladimir Putin has been facing episodic turmoil in Russia since he unilaterally launched the invasion of Ukraine. In early September, Russian elected officials from St Petersburg launched a petition signed by at least 18 districts around the country to demand the Duma's MPs impeach Putin and get him out of power. According to Russia's Constitution, the State Duma can start impeachment proceedings with one-third of deputies backing the indictment on the basis of high treason or another grave crime. To effectively remove Putin from office, Russia's lower and upper chambers must each pass the motion with two-thirds of the votes. The anti-Kremlin official who led the petition, Dmitry Palyuga, acknowledged to Express.co.uk that it would be difficult to sway pro-Putin MPs who have almost all unanimously backed Putin's move to expand the war in Ukraine to the totality of the country. If his political campaign takes off, the Russian official believes popular pressure can sway both Russian chambers' views and bring about his ouster. ""I would say that probably people on the federal level will see other people's reactions, and they will at some point probably decide that it's safer for them to get rid of Putin,"" Mr Palyuga said. And since he launched a ""partial"" mobilisation order, Putin has faced popular unrest with protests erupting in Moscow and St Petersburg among other parts of the country. In a last-ditch attempt to counter the irresistible Ukrainian offensive, Russian troops have carried out multiple nationwide attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure and civilians, including on the capital Kyiv. Kyiv authorities are now preparing more than 1,000 heating points throughout the city in case the city's heating system falters under continued Russia attacks, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. At the national level, 40 percent of Ukraine's energy infrastructure has been damaged by Russian missile and drone attacks, which have already briefly left large parts of the capital without power and water. The head of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, accused Russia of trying to make the Kyiv region an ""outspot"" and of deliberately targeting electricity power stations ahead of winter. ""They are hitting (us) directly so that there is no light in Kyiv itself,"" Mr Kuleba said, adding: ""There is a real threat that we may be without electricity for up to two weeks and we are already preparing for it."""
2022-11-02,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1690963/Vladimir-Putin-news-Ukraine-war-latest-Russia-military-Kherson-offensive-vn,"Putin to lose all territory gained since 2014 by next summer, ex US Army chief forecasts","Ben Hodges, who served as commanding general of the United States Army in Europe, has predicted that Ukraine will eventually roll back all of Russia's military gains since 2014, including liberating Crimea. Vladimir Putin is desperate to cling onto the territory in southern and eastern Ukraine which Russian forces have managed to grab but are now struggling to hold as Kyiv mounts renewed offensives powered by western weaponry. The retired general told TimesRadio: ""I believe that Ukraine will have liberated Crimea by the summer and I believe that because we've talked about who has the superior will? The Ukrainian soldiers and Ukrainian people compared to the Russians. ""The logistics situation for Russia is terrible you know, the Kersh bridge being damaged, the Russians now are trying to improve the route that runs along past Mariupol in order to resupply their forces in the southern part of Ukraine. ""Their logistics system was already weak I would say exhausted even before this, and now they're adding a couple 100,000 of troops that are just going to be another burden. ""And Ukrainians have wisely targeted the logistics system for months now, whereas the Ukrainian system gets better with each passing week. Still some real shortfalls in terms of weapons and ammunition and, what we would call this is kind of tedious, but it's really important, the maintenance necessary for all of these different weapons systems right now. ""I believe that Ukraine will have liberated Crimea by the summer and I believe that because we've talked about who has the superior will? The Ukrainian soldiers and Ukrainian people."" ""Many of them have to be taken all the way back to Poland or Lithuania or Germany to be repaired. We ought to find a way to help Ukraine have what we would call second and third-level maintenance inside Ukraine to return equipment more quickly to the front. ""But if you think about the HIMARS, what's happening now the offensives that are moving from Kherson and I think Kherson is probably going to fall in next three, four weeks. ""And then the other wing of the counter-offensive that's coming down south towards Donetsk. ""Both of these are headed towards Crimea. So we would say all roads lead towards Crimea, and once they get HIMARS in range of the Russian bases inside Crimea, then I think it's just math after that."" It comes after another military analyst, Cedric Leighton belittled Russian attempts to destroy Ukraine's national grid with punitive drones. The retired US Air Force colonel argued that Ukraine's will to resist Putin is likely to outlast the Kremlin's ability to replace used-up missiles, branding Russia's latest strategy to win the war as futile. Mr Leighton told CNN: ""You're looking at who can run out the clock the fastest in other words who can really run out their supplies. ""I think what you're looking at is the possibility at least, that Russia is going to expend its missiles, especially the type of cruise missiles, these are air launch cruise missiles that they've used in these particular attacks. ""I think they'll be able to do this in a fairly concerted fashion, they'll need some help to do it but it's going to be something where they will beat the clock in terms of whether or not Putin will run this or not. ""But it is certainly a case where the Russians are going to be spending a lot of money and a lot of weapons in a perhaps futile effort to coerce the Ukrainians."""

Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to deploy a total of 13 Iran-made kamikaze drones to carry out the attacks on the country. As she introduced Australian former Labour MP Michael Danby, Sky News Australia's host Peta Credlin said: ""This is a new level of cruelty, isn't it?"" Mr Danby said: ""So barbaric. Suicide drones don't loiter. They don't send feedback back to their base. ""They have a small bomb at the end and it is sufficient to destroy a power station, substation or a water pump. ""So Ukrainian people are sitting in Kyiv and Kharkiv tonight in the dark, sometimes without water."" The string of Russian attacks forced Ukraine's sole power grid operator to conduct power outages in the capital Kyiv, as well as Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltava regions. Ukrenergo said in a statement that the effort was needed to stabilise the energy supply damaged by Russian suicide drones and missile attacks and reduce the load on the grid to sustainable levels. ""This morning, the enemy again launched a massive missile attack on energy infrastructure facilities. New damage has exacerbated the situation in Ukraine's power system. Stabilization schedules of hourly power outages, which were introduced from 06.00 in all regions, have been cancelled,"" the company said on Monday, according to the Russian Interfax news agency. Regional power companies have introduced local restrictions for consumers within the region, Ukrenergo added. Twelve kamikaze drones were shot down by Ukrainian forces, bringing the total number to 300 since the war began, Ukrainian Airforce reported. A total of 13 Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones had been launched by Russia. The Ukrainian Air Force said: ""On the night of November 1 to 2, the enemy attacked Ukraine from the eastern direction by 'Shahed-136' kamikaze drones. 12 out of 13 barrage munitions were destroyed by air defence in the eastern and central regions of the country. ""Six UAVs were shot down by anti-aircraft missile units, aviation and mobile fire groups of the eastern air command."" Iran denies supplying suicide drones to Russia, but President Zelensky claimed Russia may have ordered as many as 2,400 to be deployed on critical infrastructure. The Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported Iran officials to intend to send a shipman of more than 200 combat drones to Russia in what would be the first confirmed instance of Iran sending Russia advanced precision-guided missiles. The Paris-based dissident organisation National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) has accused Iran of selling more than 3,500 kamikaze drones to Russia, alleging ""most of them were made at the factories of [Iran's] Ministry of Defense, with others produced by the factories of the Iranian Aviation and Space Industries Association (IASIA)."" A total of 16,000 homes were left without power following Monday's Russian bombardment, according to Ukrainian officials."
2022-11-02,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691250/north-korea-news-vladimir-putin-update-russia-ukraine-war-joe-biden-dxus,"North Korea supplying Putin with deadly weapons for use in Ukraine, warns White House","North Korea is shipping “significant” quantities of artillery shells to Russia to supports Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, the White House has claimed. Speaking the explosives, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the US believes the Hermit State, led by Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un, is “trying to make it appear as though they’re being sent to countries in the Middle East or North Africa.” He refused to offer a specific estimate on the quantity of ammunition being sent to bolster the Russian effort but said it was being supplied “covertly”. He added: “We’re still monitoring this to determine whether the shipments are actually received.” Mr Kirby said the US has “an idea” of which country or countries the North may funnel the weapons through. However, he declined to offer specifics because the administration is still weighing up its possible response. The White House would not specify the mode of transportation or whether the US or other nations will attempt to intercept shipments to Russia. The new intelligence was almost two months after first alleging US intelligence officials had determined the Russian Ministry of Defence was in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea. Even as the administration revealed information about the covert North Korean artillery shell shipments, the White House also downplayed their significance. Mr Kirby explained: “We don’t believe that they are in such a quantity that they would change the direction of this war or tangibly change the momentum either in the east or in the south"" where some of the heaviest fighting in Ukraine is taking place. The revelation follows an announcement by the Biden administration in August said that the Russian military took delivery of hundreds of Iranian-manufactured drones for use on the battlefield in Ukraine. Iran has also sent personnel to Russian-controlled Crimea to provide technical support on operation of the drones, the White House claims, although Iranian officials have deny all involvement. North Korea has sought to tighten relations with Russia as much of the West has pulled away, blaming the United States for the Ukraine crisis and decrying the West’s “hegemonic policy” as justifying military action by Russia in Ukraine to protect itself. PyongYang has also shown interest in sending construction workers to help rebuild Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine’s east. North Korea’s ambassador to Moscow has already met with envoys from two Russia-backed separatist territories in the Donbas region of Ukraine and expressed optimism about cooperation in the “field of labour migration,” emphasising his country’s easing of pandemic border controls. In July, North Korea became the only nation aside from Russia and Syria to recognise the independence of the territories, Donetsk and Luhansk, further aligning with Russia over the conflict in Ukraine. The North’s arms export to Russia would be a violation of UN resolutions which ban the country from exporting to or importing weapons from other countries. Its possible dispatch of labourers to the Russian-held territories in Ukraine would also breach a US resolution requiring all member states to repatriate all North Korean workers from their soil by 2019. Separately, air raid sirens sounded on a South Korean island and residents evacuated to underground shelters after North Korea fired more than 20 missiles Wednesday, at least one of them in its direction and landing near the rivals’ tense sea border. South Korea quickly responded by launching its own missiles in the same border area. The launches came hours after North Korea threatened to use nuclear weapons to get the US and South Korea to “pay the most horrible price in history” in protest at ongoing South Korean-US military drills which it views as an invasion rehearsal. The White House insists the United States has no hostile intent toward North Korea and has vowed to work with allies to curb North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. The North’s barrage of missile tests also came as world attention was focused on South Korea after a weekend Halloween tragedy which saw more than 150 people killed in a crowd surge in Seoul in what was the country’s largest disaster in years."

The Russian Defence Ministry said Monday that ship traffic from ports in southern Ukraine was halted, calling the movement “unacceptable.” But ships loaded with grain departed Ukraine on Monday and Tuesday, despite Vladimir Putin's announcement he was ready to walk away from the deal. Three ships carrying 84,490 metric tons of corn, wheat and sunflower meal left Ukraine through a humanitarian sea corridor set up in July, while 36 other vessels cleared inspections near Turkey to head to their final destinations, the UN said. The corridor, brokered by Turkey and the UN, was seen as a breakthrough to ensure Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia would receive grain and other food from the Black Sea region during Russia's war in Ukraine. A total of 14 ships sailed on Monday, including one chartered by the UN World Food Program to bring wheat to Ethiopia, which along with neighbouring Somalia and Kenya, is badly affected by the worst drought in decades. The UN has warned that parts of Somalia are facing famine. Thousands of people have died there. Calling Putin's bluff, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu informed Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar that the deal for a humanitarian grain corridor would “continue in the same way as before” as of noon. Erdogan said the renewed deal would prioritize shipments to African nations, including Somalia, Djibouti and Sudan, in line with Russia’s concerns that most of the grain exported since the agreements first was reached in July was ending up in richer nations. The Russian Defence Ministry said Russia agreed to continue carrying out its role in the deal after receiving written guarantees from Kyiv that Ukraine would not use the sea corridor for military actions against Moscow, according to a statement by the Russian defence ministry READ MORE: 'Imminent' Iranian attack on Saudi Arabia puts kingdom on high alert The Defence Ministry said Wednesday that Ukraine had formally committed to using the safe shipping corridors through the Black Sea “exclusively in accordance with the stipulations of the Black Sea initiative,” a reference to the separate UN and Turkey-backed agreements signed by Moscow and Kyiv on July 22. The UN operation had been prioritising a large backlog of ships waiting for checks off Istanbul, said Munro Anderson, head of intelligence of the risk consultancy Dryad Global. While Western sanctions on Russia do not affect its grain exports and a parallel wartime deal was meant to clear the way for the country's food and fertiliser shipments, some shipping and insurance companies have been wary of running afoul of the penalties or want to avoid doing business with Moscow.

Putin also said resuming the grain deal would require an investigation into the attack on Russia's Black Sea fleet, according to a Kremlin readout of the call. The July 22 deal to spur exports of grain and fertiliser was a response to skyrocketing food prices as a result of slashed supplies from two major producers following Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. The UN said that as of Tuesday, more than 9.7 million metric tons of grain and other food have been shipped from three Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea."
2022-11-02,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691346/Russia-military-strategy-failure-Ukraine-invasion-blackout-Putin-mobilisation-vn,Russian forces ‘fighting on many fronts’ as Putin’s military strategy collapses,"After Russian troops were forced to retreat from thousands of kilometres of occupied territory, the Kremlin has launched a new military strategy in a bid to destroy Ukrainian morale. Key civil infrastructure within Ukraine has come under targeted missile attack, leading to widespread blackouts affecting a huge quantity of the civilian population. Despite the shift in Moscow’s tactics, Lord Richard Dannatt asserted Russia would “lose in Ukraine” as the Kremlin’s forces face a battle on “many fronts”. The former Chief of the General Staff reported that Vladimir Putin’s plot to make Ukraine’s NATO allies “lose appetite” for the conflict had proved ineffective. Speaking to Times Radio, Lord Dannatt explained: “Putin is fighting on many fronts. He is losing on the battlefield. “He is trying to extend the campaign to make some European countries lose appetite for the fight. “He is also trying to destroy the morale of the Ukrainian people by his attack on their infrastructure. He will lose in Ukraine.” He added: “The Ukrainians are doing well, they deserve all our support.” After global allies of Ukraine placed fierce sanctions on Moscow, Vladimir Putin responded by cutting gas supplies to Europe in a bid to discourage an intervention in his invasion plans. Despite the pressure placed on European economies by the energy shortage, NATO has remained a staunch supporter of the Ukrainian defence effort. This has earned further backlash from the Russian President who has spoken of the Western world in vilified terms and hinted at escalating the conflict to an international nuclear war. Speaking at a conference in Russia just last week, Vladimir Putin said the Kremlin could use “weapons of mass destruction” to protect the “territorial integrity” of the Russian Federation if it came under threat. Rather than targeting known Ukrainian military facilities, Russian forces have more recently conducted attacks against core civilian infrastructure in a bid to deflate Kyiv’s morale. The UN reported: “Many civilian objects, including dozens of residential buildings and vital civilian infrastructure – including at least 12 energy facilities – were damaged or destroyed in eight regions, indicating that these strikes may have violated the principles on the conduct of hostilities under international humanitarian law. “Damage to key power stations and lines ahead of the upcoming winter raises further concerns for the protection of civilians and in particular the impact on vulnerable populations.” In a speech on Tuesday, President Zelensky confirmed that there had been widespread blackouts in a number of regions across Ukraine following Russian missile attacks. He added: “We will do everything to give people electricity and heat this winter, but we must understand that Russia will do everything to destroy the normality of life.” Intelligence reports from the UK Ministry of Defence have suggested Russia remains on the backfoot in Ukraine amid a crisis of supply concerning weapons and vehicles within Moscow’s armed forces. Defence officials suggested the swathes of newly mobilised Russian troops arriving in Ukraine were “poorly equipped” and weapons that were available among active battalions were likely “barely usable” following improper storage. The Kremlin had refuted this information as Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu reported: “At an early stage, there were problems with various types of supplies and subsistence for the mobilised. These problems have been resolved. “All those deployed to their units are provided with the required supplies, uniforms, equipment, and food at the same standard as professional military personnel serving under contract.”"

The saboteurs placed explosives onto Ka-52 helicopters, which are worth about £12million each. On Monday, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said that two Russian Ka-52 helicopters were destroyed while two more were severely damaged. The military intelligence department, however, did not claim responsibility for the attack, but Russian media has reported explosions at the Veretye airfield. The Telegraph news service Baza, which has ties to Russian security services, quoted an anonymous Russian officer who said the explosion was “so powerful that the aircraft’s debris was scattered around 200 metres away”. Baza reported that the Russian military had discovered a handmade explosive device attached to one helicopter, but has also reported that the helicopters are currently being repaired. However, this may be the Russian media downplaying the attack, and British media cannot confirm if the helicopters were destroyed or just damaged. Russian social media users have also mentioned an incident concerning helicopters in the region, and video footage posted online appears to depict the sabotage. The video shows a man crouching in the daytime beside a helicopter with what appears to be a bomb which appears to have a VZD-6Ch mechanical fuze. These fuzes operate on a delay of up to six hours, which would leave the saboteurs time to escape. The Russian airbase that was infiltrated is 15 miles away from the Russian and Estonia border, however, it is 500 miles away from Ukraine, making it seem the sabotager has travelled a long distance. According to an anonymous Russian official in the Pskov region, security at the Veretyre airbase has been negligent for a number of years. On Tuesday, the source told Radio Free Europe that the airbase was poorly guarded and easy to access. The official said: “It’s fairly easy to get into that military unit, there is zero security. You can get to any of the nearby villages and walk to the runway.” In 2019, a Russian photographer gained access to the base and took photos of the Ka-52 helicopters and other aircraft parked in the snow during the day. Ka-52 helicopters have been used by the Russian military for over a decade as one of Russia’s most advanced weaponry. Nicknamed the Alligator, the attack helicopter is believed to have taken the manufacturer Kamov 14 years to supply roughly 100 of the helicopters to the Russian air force. Russia’s production of military aircraft has been reported as having decreased due to the lack of high-tech components needed, and Russia has no access to them due to current trade sanctions. It was believed that before the Ukraine invasion, Russia had 90 of the Ka-52 helicopters in use. Britain’s Ministry of Defense, however, believe Russia has lost at least 23 of the helicopters in the last eight months of the war."

Mr Prigozhin is the founder of the notorious Wagner mercenary group and has been described as ""Putin's chef"", yet he has reportedly privately confronted the Russian leader over the direction of the war effort in Ukraine. The statement was issued from Mr Prigozhin's press office on Tuesday, marking a notable change from the official Russia line that President Zelensky is a drug addict and neo-Nazi. Although Mr Prigozhin has no official role in the Kremlin, he holds significant power and has been filmed hiring convicted Russian criminals to fight in Ukraine. In a statement on the Vkontatke social media platform issued through his catering firm, Concord he said: ""Although he is the president of a country that’s hostile to Russia right now, Zelensky is a strong, confident, pragmatic and nice guy."" He explained why he spoke so positively about the Ukrainian President, saying: ""Don't underestimate him."" According to US intelligence reported in the Washington Post Mr Prigozhin and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov have openly criticised Putin's military efforts. In the summer Mr Prigozhin, 61, revealed he was the founder of the Wagner Group, a military contractor responsible for Russian actions in the Middle East and Africa as well as Ukraine. He had previously denied he had anything to do with the group, who are said to have committed a number of military atrocities in foreign countries. British lawyers McCue Jury and Partners on Tuesday announced they were bringing legal action against Wagner for ""terrorism"" in Ukraine, reported The Telegraph. They have said they wish to claim compensation for victims of the mercenary group. The Institute for the Study of War said on Tuesday that Mr Prigozhin was ""establishing himself as a political force, using his popular status and his affiliation with Wagner to criticise his opponents within elite circles"". Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky has also given an insight into the Wagner Group's leader status in Moscow, telling the British Parliament he is a ""significant tool for the Kremlin"". He added: ""The number of meetings with the dictator is the only currency that’s in demand in that regime, and Mr Prigozhin has got a lot of those meetings."" Mr Khodorkovsky was previously the richest man in Russia, however he spent a decade incarcerated there as a political prisoner."

Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was once Russia's richest man and spent a decade in prison after accusing Putin's inner circle of corruption, make the allegation during an appearance at the Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday. The mercenary organisation, known as the Wagner Group, is led by Prigozhin. Prigozhin is known as ""Putin's chef"" and is said to be a ""significant and important tool for the Kremlin"". The ex-hot dog salesman gained the nickname after his company won catering contracts from the Kremlin. Prigozhin's contracts even saw him provide school meals across Moscow. Mr Khodorkovsky told MPs: ""He is in direct contact with President Putin and he receives instructions from him."" He added: ""He has a lot of personal meetings with Putin."" Khodorkovsky even claimed Prigozhin has as much influence as Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov or Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. The Wagner Group has been accused of committing atrocities in Ukraine, Syria and Africa. According to the Times, the mercenary organisation is also thought to have tired to assassinate Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The UK's Ministry of Defence has also been keeping an eye on the Wagner Group's involvement in Ukraine. In an intelligence update published on October 30, the MoD said: ""On October 27, Russian mogul Yevgeny Prigozhin posted online, apparently admitting allegations that his private military company, the Wagner Group, had altered its standards and was recruiting Russian convicts suffering from serious diseases including HIV and Hepatitis C. ""The role of Wagner Group has evolved significantly since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The update added: ""Prigozhin’s has recently discussed plans to create a 200km long defensive ‘Wagner Line’ in eastern Ukraine. This endeavour would require a large labour force. ""There is a realistic possibility that some of the convict recruits will initially be put to work constructing the defences."""
2022-11-02,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1691384/Vladimir-putin-military-strategy-failing-three-crucial-elements-military-expert,Putin’s paradox as military strategy ‘failing’ in three crucial elements of war,"A military historian and strategist has laid bare the three key strategic failures of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine that have had a domino effect on its ability to make sweeping gains in the conflict. Professor Edward Luttwak said that Vladimir Putin’s tactical blunders have made a Russian victory “unlikely”. It is widely believed – and repeated by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson just yesterday – that the Russian military had planned for a swiftly executed intervention that would lead to the fall of Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, in a matter of days. However, Russia’s armed forces have been dogged with setbacks and humiliating retreats, retaliating with air strikes on population centres and Ukrainian infrastructure. As the war stretches into its eighth month, the much smaller Ukrainian armed forces have been able to make incisive counter-attacks on Russian occupied regions – particularly in the north-west of the country – while Putin faces economic and domestic turmoil at home. According to Professor Luttwak, best known as the author of Coup d'État: A Practical Handbook, Putin “collided head on with the paradoxical logic of strategy”. Following the end of the Cold War, the NATO military alliance had weakened significantly, as it was not unified by a common enemy. Putin seized on this opportunity to strike Ukraine. But by invading Ukraine, the Russian President created a common threat for the West again, and unified NATO behind the plucky ex-Soviet state. Ukraine’s successes in holding off a far larger and more powerful aggressor have been attributed to the many forms of military aid allies have given it – in large part by the US and UK. Putin’s second failing, Professor Luttwak said, was Russia’s lack of a strong and commanding navy – typified by the sinking of the Russian flagship Moskva in April. Writing in UnHerd yesterday, he said: “Even though Russia has effective attack submarines, both nuclear-powered and diesel-electric in Atlantic waters, the US and Canada have been able to support Ukraine by shipping aid entirely unmolested. “Because Russian naval forces are totally deterred, western Europe has its safe material and strategic depth in the Atlantic.” According to the military expert, the Russian assault on Ukraine has failed on all four layers of strategy that must be considered for an intervention to prove successful. On a tactical level, Putin thought an “elite” assault force landing at the Antonov air base outside Kyiv would be able to take the airfield and “swiftly seize the capital”. Meanwhile, Ukraine had only the forces that were nearby. But Putin underestimated the strong morale among Ukrainians to resist a Russian incursion. Professor Luttwak wrote: “Because they had expected no resistance at all […] they were shocked by the ferocious resistance, and soon had to flee into the nearby woods. “A Russian tactical victory would not have won the war, but the tactical defeat at the Antonov field was catastrophic, because the entire Russian war plan was based on a fast Coup de Main to seize central Kyiv in a matter of hours.” That, in turn, concatenated a failure at an operational level: rather than attacking from multiple directions, which would have meant a single tactical defeat would not have stopped the other advances, the Russian military premised their whole plan on capturing the capital. When they were unable to advance via the Antonov airbase, the columns of tanks and armoured vehicles headed for Kyiv would not be met by the thousands of occupying troops they hoped to fly in. Professor Luttwak said: “Recall that double column of armoured vehicles and supply trucks in those satellite pictures: it could neither advance nor retreat without entangling itself in thousands of cumbersome U-turns.” He continued that Putin had become “a reckless gambler”, sending a “very small” army of 130,000 men to attack Europe’s largest nation – a failure of theatre-of-war strategy. By contrast, when the Soviet Union invaded the much smaller Czechoslovakia in 1968, it sent an army of 800,000. Professor Luttwak has become renowned for his theory on grand strategy – that concerning the scale of a nation’s population and economy. But he argued to draw power from mass in conflict, a nation needs cohesion. Since the invasion of Ukraine, Putin has seen many of Russia’s allies remain neutral – despite recent reports that he may call on nearby Belarus to join the conflict – and push other neutral nations, such as Sweden and Finland, into the hands of NATO. The Russian despot has already mobilised a far larger number of reservists, which “could stop Ukraine’s victories” once trained. Russia “can lose many battles and yet still keep fighting” in virtue of the number of fighting men it has, Professor Luttwak said. However, historically a year or more of Russian defeat in wars have usually been followed with victory only with the help of other great powers. The military expert noted: “This time, however, there will be no allies to rescue Putin.”"

The retired army officer explained that Russia had moved its more skilful troops to the region of Kherson to defend the occupied land. And claimed that if Ukrainian forces were to push Russia back from Kherson that it would be a major embarrassment to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The war in Ukraine has been ramping up as Ukrainian forces have been pushing back on the Russian onslaught on their land. Lord Dannatt told Sky News: ""The fight around Kherson is intensifying. ""It will appear that the Russians have moved some of their better troops to defend Kherson. ""And if it was to be lost, it's a major... Major defeat a major embarrassment for Putin. ""As Kherson is the one major city that he has managed to capture so far, so on the battlefield the fight continues and at home, the fight continues."" JUST IN: 'Beautiful' British expat destination has lots of free activities - 'people don't know' Military intelligence in Ukraine reported that Putin has piled up to 40,000 Russian servicemen on the western part of the Dnipro river in Kherson. It is hard for Russian soldiers to escape from where they are currently situated towards the Western part of the River. A former US General has claimed that the Russian troops could be wiped out soon. Lieutenant General Mark Hertling told CNN: ""Russia is basically stacking their defences with new mobilised recruits. ""But again, those recruits are absolutely untrained, terrible and joining units with low morale. ""So, what we're seeing really is Russia feeding more meat to a meat grinder. ""And Ukraine will have increased challenges with countering those kinds of larger units because after all, quantity has a quality all of its own."" Saldo said: ""Due to the possibility of the use of prohibited methods of war by the Ukrainian regime, as well as information that Kyiv is preparing a massive missile strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, there is an immediate danger of the Kherson region being flooded, (resulting in) the mass destruction of civilian infrastructure and humanitarian catastrophe. ""Given the situation, I have decided to expand the evacuation zone by 15 kilometres from the Dnipro ... the decision will make it possible to create a layered defence in order to repel Ukrainian attacks and protect civilians."""
2022-11-01,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1690435/putin-russia-Ukraine-iran-bombing-energy-infrastructure,Queues for water as Putin targets civilian lifelines,"Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said residents should ""stock up on water from the nearest pump rooms and points of sale"" amid fears of further Russian bombardments. Moscow's military has been targeting Ukrainian civil infrastructure in recent weeks using expensive long-range missiles and cheap Iranian-made drones. Strikes yesterday left 80 percent of Kyiv without vital lifelines. It came as it was claimed that nearly 1,000 Russian soldiers were killed in one day in Ukraine - marking the deadliest day for Putin since his troops invaded eight months ago. Ukrainian forces have made gains across Russian-occupied areas, with fighting intensifying in the east and the southern city of Kherson. Some 950 Kremlin soldiers were killed on Sunday, pushing the Russian death toll up to at least 71,200, Kyiv said. Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat said Russia used strategic bombers to carry out ""massive"" retaliation strikes. It was also revealed air defence systems sent by Germany were used to shoot down missiles. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said 18 targets were hit in 10 regions. They included hydroelectric power plants in Kyiv, Kremenchuk, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and Cherkasy. There were partial blackouts in some areas and emergency shutdowns in others to reduce the load on the system. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that ""instead of fighting on the battlefield, Russia fights civilians"". Meanwhile, Moscow says it has completed its ""partial mobilisation"" to boost its ailing military. The Kremlin appeared to stop short of reimposing a grain blockade however, with a large convoy of ships carrying supplies from Odesa yesterday. It pulled out of a UN-brokered deal in retaliation for a drone attack on warships at the Black Sea port of Sevastopol. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly accused Putin of ""exacting vengeance"" on Ukrainian civilians and low-income nations around the world for his ""military failures""."

Britain has pledged £6million to bolster Ukraine's cyber defences through a scheme which will see private contractors protect Kyiv from attacks on key databases and infrastructure. Russian hacker groups including the FSB-linked Armageddon and GRU-linked ATPU28, also known as Fancy Bear, have been targeting Ukraine throughout the war. Hacking group TURLA - considered Putin’s stealthiest cyber force - has also launched attacks on Ukraine. Leo Docherty, Europe minister at the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), warned that Ukraine has been facing a ""daily onslaught"" of cyber attacks. The groups are focused on ""high-value targets"" to gain crucial and compromising information to further Russia's war effort. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the UK's ""support to Ukraine is not limited to military aid"", adding: ""We are drawing on Britain's world-leading expertise to support Ukraine's cyber defences."" He continued: ""Together, we will ensure that the Kremlin is defeated in every sphere – on land, in the air and in cyberspace."" Lindy Cameron, chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre - an arm of the intelligence agency GCHQ - said the organisation is ""proud to have played a part in supporting Ukraine’s cyber defenders"". She added: ""They have mounted an impressive defence against Russian aggression in cyberspace, just as they have done on the physical battlefield. ""The threat remains real and the UK’s support package is undoubtedly bolstering Ukraine’s defences further."" Russia has repeatedly dismissed claims it has carried out cyber attacks. But those involved in defending Ukraine from cyber attacks have said they represent the most extensive compromise of a single government seen in history. The cyber attacks have increased in intensity and frequency since the second half of last year, in the lead-up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Speaking about the UK's response to the cyber attacks, Mr Docherty said: ""We brought some of our expertise to bear on helping them defend from what has been a daily onslaught of cyber attacks from Russia since the start of the invasion."" He added: ""We've seen on a daily basis now the terrible images of the way that the electrical grid in Ukraine has been battered by ballistic strikes and drone strikes from the Russians - they face the same threat and same challenge in the cyber domain. Sources close to the UK programme, which includes extensive private sector support, told the BBC they saw waves of attacks, sometimes using innovative techniques. Russian cyber attacks have had a number of major impacts on Ukraine's infrastructure over the last decade. In December 2015, they resulted in shutting off part of Ukraine’s electricity grid, leaving 230,000 people without power for up to six hours. Destructive cyber attacks in 2017 targeted Ukraine’s finance and energy sectors and government services, meanwhile, Kyiv metro and Odesa airport have been disrupted by ransomware. There have also been a series of cyber attacks since the invasion, including attacks on commercial operators such as Viasat in March. The attack had a serious impact on access to internet access and other services across both Ukraine and other parts of Europe."
