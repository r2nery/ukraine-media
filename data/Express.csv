Russia's Defence Ministry has today conceded its own forces have moved back in what it described as an effort to “regroup”. Quoted by Russian news agency TASS, the defence ministry said: “To achieve the stated goals of the Special Military Operation for the liberation of Donbas, it was decided to regroup the Russian troops located in the districts of Balakliia and Izium for the purpose of increasing efforts in the Donetsk direction.”"
2022-09-11,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1667710/ukraine-news-kharkiv-counter-russian-border-zelensky-putin-latest,Ukraine breakthrough MAPPED: Zelensky's forces now just miles from border after huge gains,"Volodymyr Zelensky took Putin and the world by surprise when he gave the green light to a major counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region last week. Ukraine's army has made stunning progress and taken more territory in the past five days than Putin's army managed during the entire of April during its Donbas campaign. Western analysts say that Ukrainian troops have penetrated 43 miles into Russia's defensive positions in the northeast. At the same time they have recaptured over 1,100 square miles of territory from the Russian invaders. Putin's army has proved unable to halt the Ukrainian juggernaut and is being pushed further and further back. Latest reports suggest that Ukrainian forces are within just 15 miles of the Russian border. George Barros, an analysts for the Institute for the Study of War, tweeted: ""Ukrainian forces are likely 25 kilometres (15 miles) of the international border with Russia. ""Russian sources reported that Ukrainian forces captured Velyky Burluk in Kharkiv on September 10. ""Russian milblogger Yuriy Kotenyok stated that Ukrainian forces took advantage of the absence of a continuous front line while advancing on Velyky Burluk."" Anarchy and disarray appear to have broken out among Russian front-line troops in the region, as they desperately seek to escape Kyiv's advancing army. Unconfirmed reports suggest some soldiers have turned their guns on their fleeing comrades in a desperate attempt to force them to fight. WarMonitor, a military analyst, tweeted: ""Russian units near Izyum are reportedly having communication issues. ""Some units are complete without communication."" He added: ""There are also unconfirmed reports that Russian soldiers are shooting the ones that want to retreat. ""Some soldiers are found dead before the battles have even started."" A Ukrainian military expert said Ukraine's army was showing ""great ingenuity"" in its tactical manoeuvres. Mykola Sunhurovsky, an analyst with the Razumkov Centre, told the Associated Press: ""The Ukrainian army has taken advantage of the relocation of the bulk of the Russian forces to the south and is trying to direct the course of the war, excelling in manoeuvre and showing great ingenuity.” Ukraine’s quick gains, he added, are “important both for seizing the initiative and raising troops’ spirit”. It comes as the UK's Ministry of Defence said in its latest war update that Ukraine's army continued to make ""significant gains"". The MoD also rejected Putin's claims that only a small amount of grain exported by Ukraine since August had made its way to developing countries. Analysts wrote on Sunday: ""Over the last 24 hours, Ukrainian forces have continued to make significant gains in the Kharkiv region. ""Russia has likely withdrawn units from the area, but fighting continues around the strategically important cities of Kupiansk and Izium."" They continued: ""On 07 September 2022, President Putin said that only 60,000 tonnes of the grain exported from Ukraine since August had been sent to developing countries, and that the majority had been delivered to EU states. ""Putin's claim is not true. According to UN figures, around 30% has been supplied to low and middle-income countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. ""Russia is pursuing a deliberate misinformation strategy as it seeks to deflect blame for food insecurity issues, discredit Ukraine and minimise opposition to its invasion."""

Russia's own defence ministry confirmed a retreat among its forces, in what is seen as the most significant Ukrainian advance since Russia withdrew from areas around Kyiv in April. President Zelensky, in his nightly address on Saturday, said the Russian military are making the right choice to flee. He said: “The Russian army is showing its best — showing its back. And it’s a good choice for them to run away. There’s no place for the occupiers in Ukraine.” BBC News anchor Lucy Hockings called the retreat and collapse of the Russian frontline a ""humiliating setback"" for Vladimir Putin. The BBC's Hugo Bachega, reporting from Kyiv, called the latest Ukrainian offensive a ""massive gain"". He said: ""More than 30 villages or towns have been liberated in the east, and these are significant towns and villages. ""Russia has admitted that their troops have abandoned the town of Izyum, which operates as a major military hub for Moscow."" Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko said that Izyum had been liberated in half a day after ""Russians spent one month to take it in spring"". Izyum had been used by Russian forces as a launch pad for attacks in Donetsk. Mr Bachega continued: ""We have seen footage of people out in the streets in these areas welcoming Ukrainian soldiers with kisses and hugs. ""This could be a decisive turning point in this war. ""We are hearing from pro-Russian Telegram accounts that people in those regions are reporting a desperate situation for Russian troops. ""We have seen reports for weeks of Russians refusing to fight, and complaining they are understaffed and underequipped. ""It seems that many areas occupied by Russians are suffering really, really low morale."" On Saturday, Ukraine's military confirmed it had seized Kupiansk, a vital eastern supply hub for Russian forces. In a tweet, Ukrainian Armed Forces said Kupyansk ""was and will always be Ukrainian"". Russia's defence ministry has scrambled to justify the retreat, claiming that the collapse of the frontline would allow Russia ""to regroup"". The ministry also confirmed the withdrawal of troops from a third key town, Balaklyia. Earlier, the British Ministry of Defence said that ""Russian forces were likely taken by surprise"" by the Ukrainian counter-offensive. The Kyiv Independent's defence reporter Illia Ponomarenko said: ""The Russian front line section between Kupyansk and northern Donbas is collapsing. ""An official tells me he can’t keep up. They have gone further and faster than they imagined."" Earlier today, Ukraine's special forces admitted that its claims about a southern offensive were a ""big disinformation campaign"" to distract Russian from the real offensive in Kharkiv. Taras Berezovets, from the Ukrainian special forces, said: ""The offensive happened where they least expected, and this caused them to panic and flee."""
2022-09-11,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1667697/putin-news-russia-dealt-hammer-blow-eu-replace-gas-pipeline-Trans-Saharan-nigeria,Putin dealt hammer blow as EU poised to replace Russian gas with new £11bn pipeline,"European Union leaders are reportedly looking to end delays on the Trans-Saharan pipeline, which flows across the great desert, from Nigeria into Spain and Italy. In late July, Algeria, Nigeria and Niger signed a memorandum of understanding to build a natural gas pipeline across the Sahara desert. First proposed in 2002, the pipeline never got off the ground but was finally revived as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine forced Europe to look for alternative gas suppliers. While officials and experts have warned of financial hurdles offering further delays, the EU is reportedly looking to push the plans through and get the pipeline flowing as soon as possible. While signing the agreement, Algeria's energy minister, Mohamed Arkab said: ""This agreement marks the commitment of the three parties to revive a project of regional and international scope, which will boost the social and economic development of our country."" Speaking to Middle East Eye, Abdelmadjid Attar, a former Algerian energy minister and ex-CEO of the Algerian oil and gas giant Sonatrach noted that currently, the pipeline is just an agreement underpinned by ""strong political will"". Meanwhile, an anonymous Algerian energy ministry official added that ""discussions will carry on between experts from the three countries"". While signing the agreement, the minister did not fix a clear date of completion, but rather spoke of completing the ambitious 4,000km pipeline ""within the shortest possible timescale"". However, Mr Attar noted that if given the pressure, the pipeline completed within three years or less. He said: ""In the 90s we built the gas pipeline that links Algeria and Morocco in less than two years.” The Trans-Saharan gas pipeline is could send up to 30 billion cubic metres a year of supplies to Europe. However, experts warn that major financial issues need to be solved in order to make headway with the pipeline. While Algeria and Nigeria, which hold most of the shares of the company building the pipeline, may have enough funding to complete their respective parts of the pipeline, Niger may not have the resources, with costs in 2009 estimated to surpass £8.6billion. Sources within Algeria have noted that Europe may be potentially interested in financing this pipeline, as EU countries desperately seek to replace Russian gas. An anonymous former executive at Sonatrach told Middle East Eye: ""European countries would like to see the project up and running within a maximum of two years.” The EU is scrambling to end its reliance on Moscow, with tensions soaring to new heights in just the past few weeks. In a fiery speech, Putin warned the EU that if they decided to impose a price cap on Russian gas, the Kremlin would view that as a breach of contract and end flows completely. Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum, he said: “Will there be any political decisions that contradict the contracts? “Yes, we just won’t fulfil them. We will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests. “We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil — we will not supply anything. We would only have one thing left to do: as in the famous Russian fairy tale, we would let the wolf’s tail freeze.”"

Ukrainian troops tracking the Russian withdrawal released video of the moment several Russian tanks and vehicles fled Izyum. It marks the most significant Ukrainian advance since Russia withdrew from areas around Kyiv in April. Izyum had been used by Russian forces as a launch pad for attacks in Donetsk. BILD journalist Julian Ropcke tweeted: ""Pictures for eternity. The defeated Russian army flees southern Kharkiv oblast over the river Oskol. ""This is the army, fleeing #Izyum. I would guess, this is an agreed-upon withdrawal route. ""The latest #RussianArmy map shows, Russian invasion forces withdrew to the river Oskol and abandoned ALL positions West of it."" On Saturday, Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko said that Izyum had been liberated in half a day after ""Russians spent one month to take it in spring"". Other videos posted online showed the rushed Russian abandonment of the formerly occupied territory. Clips on social media from recently recaptured towns and villages illustrate the scale of the humiliation, showing military hardware and ammunition left behind by fleeing Russians. Ukrainian politicians also shared morale-boosting videos of the country’s soldiers raising the national flag in various towns and villages. This comes as Russia admitted it has withdrawn from several key occupied settlements, marking a decisive triumph for Ukraine. The Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine has retaken more territory in five days than Russia had taken since April. General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukrainian forces, said on Sunday that Ukraine had regained control of about 3,000 sq km of land since the beginning of September. The colossal advance means Ukraine's forces have tripled their gains in just 48 hours. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky, said the next three months would be critical in determining the outcome of the war. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, hailing the victories said: “And so I reiterate: the more weapons we receive, the faster we will win, and the faster this war will end."" On Saturday, Ukraine's military also confirmed it had seized Kupiansk, a vital eastern supply hub for Russian forces. Russia's defence ministry has scrambled to justify the retreat, claiming that the collapse of the frontline would allow Russia ""to regroup""."
2022-09-11,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1667797/russia-news-mykolaiv-province-dawn-attack-video-kherson-counter-putin-ukraine-war-update,Watch: Ukrainian army launches 'daring' dawn raid to liberate village on Kherson front,"The last few days have seen spectacular gains by Kyiv's army on the Kharkiv front. President Zelensky launched his surprise attack in the country's northeast last week and has reaped the rewards ever since. His forces have brushed aside all Russian resistance and taken over 1,100 square miles of territory within five days. The Kharkiv onslaught has shifted focus from Ukraine's southern counteroffensive, which seeks to recapture the port city of Kherson. The city is located on the Black Sea and Dnipro River and is of vital strategic importance to Kyiv. It was captured by the Russians early on in the war after its defenders fled without putting up a fight. A new video circulating on social media purportedly shows Ukrainian troops in the Mykolaiv province launching a daring dawn raid on the village of Ternovi Pody. Images show an armoured vehicle speeding towards the settlement. A soldier can be heard shouting: ""F***! Go, go go!"" This is followed by an outburst of machine gun fire as the vehicle races towards the village. Rounds can be seen slamming into the foreground, sending up puffs of dirt. Through the clearing of smoke and mist, other military vehicles come into view and Ukrainian infantry can be seen advancing on the village. Another clip shows a machine gunner firing off a number of rounds from his armoured vehicle before picking up a bazooka and using it. The three clips were published by the social media user ""Digger"" on his Twitter account. He wrote: ""@GeoConfirmed at 46.861166, 32.380026 Ternovi Pody, Mykolaiv Oblast, Ukraine. ""Three videos of a daring early morning attack by Ukrainian armed forces to liberate Ternovi Pody village."" Ukrainian military officials reported their forces were conducting positional battles in Kherson Oblast on September 10. Operational Command Spokesperson Nataliya Humenyuk said that Ukrainian forces had advanced tens of kilometres in some unnamed areas of the Kherson region. She also noted that the Ukrainian counteroffensive was pushing Russian forces to retreat to their second lines of defence. She added that Russian forces continued to resist Ukrainian attacks and retained ammunition and supplies on the frontlines. However, the Russian units were suffering heavy losses. It comes as President Zelensky mocked Putin over the performance of his army in Ukraine. He told his TV audience on Saturday night: ""These days, the Russian army is showing its best – showing its back. ""And, in the end, it is a good choice for them to run away. There is and will be no place for the occupiers in Ukraine.”"

Dr Mike Martin explained how Ukrainians managed to push back against the Russian onslaught in Kupiansk and Izum, and win back their land. The former army officer claimed that Russian troops were ill-equipped and their supplies were running out. The ongoing war in Ukraine has been raging for over six months, and with the help of NATO-aligned countries, Ukraine's armed forces have been able to push back on the illegal invasion. Dr Martin told Times Radio: ""This war has never really been right for Russia, they never had enough troops. ""The troops that they have had have been poorly trained, poor morale because of the corruption in the forces they've been sort of poorly equipped. ""Rather than buying, you know the military grad stuff they bought the cheap stuff and so on and so forth. ""And the Ukrainians have had the opposite, you know they've got great Western equipment more and more coming along all the time, they're fighting to defend their homeland, their morale is sky high. ""The Ukrainians have been pushing in the South in this place called Kherson which is on the way to Crimea for Ukrainians because Crimea is very important for the Russians that's really their centre of gravity. ""The Russians rushed lots of troops into Kherson to defend it and because they don't have enough troops overall they thinned out in the Northeast in this place called Kharkiv and also in the Donbas where they had that offensive a couple of months ago. JUST IN: Meghan and Harry are reunited with William and Kate as they view tributes at Windsor Dr Martin added: ""What the Ukrainians realised was there was this huge opportunity, the Russians were spread very, very thinly and so they took advantage of it, and they just drove a kind of mechanised thrust Eastwards from Kharkiv, which is the second biggest city in Ukraine in the Northeast. ""Right through as you said in your intro they took Kupiansk, once they took Kupiansk because that's a major rail junction, then the Russians had to surrender a place called Izum because they were cut off from supplies, and then it created a kind of domino effect. ""And what you actually find in war, war is really about psychology and once you've shattered your enemy's supply and leadership, and its ability to coordinate the whole thing starts to collapse. ""And dominoes start to falling, everyone panics, troops start running away and that's really what we're seeing amongst the Russian army, large pockets of it you know, putting on civilian clothes and running away or getting annihilated or just pulling out like it's, it's a total rout is the only way we can describe it."" Ukraine has been supported consistently by Western countries since the beginning of the illegal invasion. Weapons such as HIMARS and anti-tank systems have been gifted to Ukraine's army to help them stop Russian advancements on their territory. Britain has also been training up to 10,000 Ukrainian troops every 120 days, in order to keep soldiers up to date with top-of-the-range weapons and military techniques. This week new Prime Minister Liz Truss spoke with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky in order to reaffirm the UK's commitment to continue to support Ukraine. Reports of Ukrainian soldiers pushing back on the Russian advancement have been steadily emerging for over two weeks. Confirming the news in a statement published on social media, Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said: ""Ukrainian troops are advancing in eastern Ukraine, liberating more cities and villages. ""It's crucial to keep sending arms to Ukraine. Defeating Russia on the battlefield means winning peace in Ukraine.”"

Ukraine's forces are sweeping all before them as they reconquer vast tracts of territory in the northeast of the country. Putin's army is reported to be in disarray and chaos as they flee from Zelensky's advancing forces. Russian troops are reported to have abandoned Izyum, a key logistical centre for Moscow's army in the east. The capture of the city represents a massive blow for Putin, and seriously impacts the ability of his army to continue its offensive in Ukraine's Donbas region. Russian officials, however, have tried to downplay the gravity of the situation to the pubic at home. The Ministry of Defence framed the retreat of the army from Izyum as a ""regrouping"" of forces to support their war efforts in the Donetsk direction. They also falsely claimed that Russian forces undertook a number of demonstrative actions and used artillery and aviation to ensure the safety of withdrawing troops. The refusal to acknowledge the realities of the conflict has enraged patriotic Russian bloggers, who have accused Putin and his regime of betraying their own soldiers. War Informant, one of the most active and prominent of the bloggers, wrote: ""Colleagues, in fact, the current deathly silence of the Ministry of Defence about the real situation and the reasons for certain decisions is far from the first. ""All this looks like a conscious progressive self-isolation from reality, as though if you keep silent about the situation from the high stands, then the population will not know anything. ""But the population knew everything long before the next briefing began. ""To talk about the next destroyed 'nationalists' and their warehouses, but not to say a word about the realities of what is happening in the Kharkiv direction, means to betray those who fought there and are still fighting."" Volodymyr Zelensky could not resist the temptation to mock Putin in his latest nightly TV address on Saturday. The Ukrainian President hailed the successes of his troops, while belittling the Russian army. He said: ""These days, the Russian army is showing its best – showing its back. ""And, in the end, it is a good choice for them to run away. ""There is and will be no place for the occupiers in Ukraine.” Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that Ukrainian forces had demonstrated they were capable of defeating the Russian army with the Western weapons given to them. He urged Western leaders to continue to supply Kyiv with weapons, so Putin could be defeated once and for all. He said: “And so I reiterate: the more weapons we receive, the faster we will win, and the faster this war will end."" Putin is facing increasing domestic unrest from the Russian public, who appear to have lost confidence in their leader's ability to prosecute the war in Ukraine. In the latest move against the regime, municipal officials from a district in Moscow called on the Russian President to resign. This follows calls by councillors in Saint Petersburg for Putin to be tried for treason."
2022-09-11,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1665447/Putin-Russia-Ukraine-invasion-war-Kherson-street-battle-broken-morale-military-vn,Putin’s forces grapple with ‘broken morale’ as Russia faces ‘ruinous street battle’,"Ukrainian forces have launched an ambitious bid to reclaim the southern city of Kherson, which has been occupied by Russian troops since the early days of the Kremlin’s invasion. President Zelensky’s troops began the operation with a series of strategic strikes on transport routes into the region, plotting to “cut off” Russian troops from vital supplies of equipment, food, and medicine. The initial stages of the counter-offensive mission planned to weaken Moscow’s forces by “breaking their morale” and reducing their ability and will to fight back. As Ukraine escalates its strategy to close in on the city, Dr Patrick Bury spoke to Express.co.uk to explain why both sides would be keen to avoid a “ruinous street battle” in Kherson. Dr Bury, a senior lecturer in security at the University of Bath, explained how Ukraine had used advanced, long-range weapons to isolate Russian troops. He said: “In Kherson, it’s been very interesting because the Ukrainians have used HIMARS very smartly. “We’ve seen them take out logistics nodes especially, ammo dumps as well which has reduced the rate of fire from the Russian artillery. “What they have been trying to do is cut off and make it very difficult for the Russian forces in Kherson to sustain themselves and break their morale.” Dr Bury continued on to explain why both sides would be keen to avoid the open conflict of a “street battle,” having already suffered huge losses in the war so far. “They don’t really want to get into a street battle - they can’t. “If they get into a street battle in Kherson it will be bloody, but also completely ruinous and destructive if the Russians decide to stay and fight in the way that the Ukrainians did. “It’s one thing to defend, but when you move onto the attack you need combined arms, which is using artillery, air forces, ground forces. To do that effectively you need at least a 3:1 and sometimes a 5:1 force ratio, for it to be successful generally. “The problem is easier to defend and harder to attack.” The Ministry of Defence reported that Ukrainian armed forces had begun renewed offensive operations in the south towards the end of August. Intelligence information suggests Russian forces have been struggling to track Ukraine's advance due to a lack of advanced military equipment. The Ministry of Defence reported: “It is likely Russia is struggling to maintain stocks of uncrewed aerial vehicles, exacerbated by component shortages resulting from international sanctions. “The limited availability of reconnaissance UAVs is likely degrading commanders’ tactical situations awareness and increasingly hampering Russian operations.” Intelligence updates have suggested Ukraine’s bid to “break the morale” of occupying forces may have been a success. The Ministry of Defence said: “Russian forces continue to suffer from morale and discipline issues in Ukraine.” Ongoing frustrations surrounding issues with pay and the longevity of the conflict have been exacerbated by insufficient supplies of arms, rations, and uniforms given Ukraine’s targeting of Russian resupply routes. Sources from within the Kherson have reported an atmosphere of panic steadily unfolding as Russians who had moved into the city as well as Ukrainian civilians attempt to flee the area amid increased shelling."
2022-09-11,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1667722/Europe-nuclear-power-plant-shut-down-Zaporizhzhia-Ukraine-Energoatom-statement-latest,Europe's biggest nuclear power plant goes into total shutdown after mass evacuation,"Officials at Energoatom said they had disconnected the last power unit at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the energy grid in the early hours of Sunday morning. The nuclear power station reportedly has been repeatedly shelled by Russian forces. The state agency wrote on its Telegram channel:""A decision was made to shut down power unit Number 6 and transfer it to the safest state – cold shutdown."" Energoatom reiterated calls for a demilitarised zone to be established around the plant. The agency said: ""In order to prevent an emergency situation at the station, it is necessary to stop the Russian shelling of the ZANP's communication lines with the power system and create a demilitarised zone around it. ""After that, the communication lines will be able to be repaired, to ensure the inclusion and further safe operation of the ZANP."" The atomic facility is one of the ten biggest nuclear power stations in the world. The plant was captured by Russian troops on March 4, in the early days of the war which began on February 24. Kyiv has accused Moscow of placing military equipment and ammunition at the plant, as well as shelling the surrounding area. Earlier in the month, officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) were able to gain access to the nuclear power station. In a subsequent report, they said the Russians had placed military equipment in the engine rooms of the power units at the plant. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi called for the creation of a nuclear safety and protection zone around the station on Friday. His call came after Kyiv on Wednesday had urged residents of Russian-occupied areas around the plant to evacuate for their own safety. It comes as the IEAEs top decision-making body called on Putin to cease all actions at Ukraine's nuclear facilities. The Board of Governors has drawn up a draft statement in which they roundly condemn Russian actions at nuclear plants in Ukraine. The statement said: ""The board deplores the Russian Federation's persistent violent actions against nuclear facilities in Ukraine, including the ongoing presence of Russian forces and Rosatom personnel at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant."" The text calls on Russia to ""immediately cease all actions against, and at, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and any other nuclear facility in Ukraine, in order for the competent authorities to regain full control over all nuclear facilities within Ukraine's internationally recognised borders."" The board members come from 35 different countries, but does not include Ukraine. The draft statement was put together with the help of diplomats from Poland and Canada, according to Reuters. Ukraine's army continued to make gains in its Kharkiv counteroffensive on Saturday. Analysts say Ukraine has retaken over 1,100 square miles of territory since it launched its attack last week. Latest reports suggest that Ukrainian forces are within just 15 miles of the Russian border. George Barros, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, tweeted: ""Ukrainian forces are likely 25 kilometres (15 miles) of the international border with Russia. ""Russian sources reported that Ukrainian forces captured Velyky Burluk in Kharkiv on September 10.

2022-09-11,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666176/vladimir-putin-west-russia-ukraine-war-usa-kremlin-update,'Fatal mistake': Horror warning for West not to play into hands of Putin's successor,"Wikistrat, which describes itself as a “crowdsourced consultancy” often carries out “Death of a Leader simulations” to learn about “internal power dynamics” and the “regional influence” certain leaders have. A team of experts are given a number of different scenarios for how the leader dies and are asked to discuss how each scenario would affect their country’s foreign policy towards their allies and foes. With countless rumours flying around about the state of Putin’s health, Wikistrat decided to use the Russian leader’s hypothetical death for their latest simulation. The experts came to the conclusion that the war in Ukraine would not end with Putin’s death. Speaking about the findings of the simulation, Wikistrat CEO Oren Kesler told Express.co.uk: “One of the key assumptions floating around is that if Putin dies, his successor will take the opportunity to take a step back when it comes to Ukraine. “Another assumption is that it would be a good time to press on the gas and increase tensions and to try to force Russia to come to the West and that if we pressure them enough, this might work. “And I think that that could be a fatal mistake because, after Putin’s death, the leadership will be in a weak position because it will be trying to stabilise the country. “So I believe that if the West becomes harsher in its response to Russia then the new leadership could use this opportunity to make the West out to be a bigger threat than it is and that will give them the excuse to become more hawkish.” “Essentially, the idea of the West becoming more and more aggressive under sanctions will only provide more of an opportunity to certain elites to increase the narrative of Russophobia that they're pushing, for example, the thing with the visas.” Last week EU foreign ministers voted to suspend a visa agreement with Moscow, making it harder for Russian citizens to enter the bloc. In response, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Glushko said the EU was ""shooting itself in the foot"" and the move would not go unanswered. Keir Giles, Senior Consulting Fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Programme, Chatham House and one of the experts who took part in the simulation said that after Putin’s death, the Russian elite will be faced with a choice: to do what’s best for the country or to preserve the Putinist regime that has guaranteed them wealth and power. He said: “Putin's close colleagues may therefore be faced with a choice – preserving the Putinist system that until now has guaranteed their power, wealth and personal safety, or instead putting Russia as a country first and placing their bets on change.” However, Dr Mark Galleoti, Senior Associate Fellow of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) and another expert involved in the simulation stated that it is more likely that Putin’s successor will be a nationalist figure who will further Putin’s ideology of hatred toward the West. He said: “It is more likely that a nationalist figure would emerge, or a nationalist government or at least a nationalist policy would be adopted by the new government, and essentially force the elite to maintain Putin's very harsh stance.” Following the end of the Cold War, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, relations between the West and Russia became friendlier. During this period, Russia began to embrace Western culture and chains such as McDonalds began operating in the country. However, Mr Kesler said that Russia has gone through a “metamorphosis” in recent years. He said: “Putin in the year 2000 and Putin in the year 2022 is not the same. “Russia in the year 2000 and Russia 2022 is not the same. “The country has gone through a process primarily in the last five to 10 years from, you know, well it was never a democracy but from some sort of a power-sharing of different groups into a dynamic which is very authoritarian, all the way to totalitarian.” Thus, with the simulation predicting that Russia is likely to continue in this direction, Mr Kesler has warned that the West should be careful in its response to Putin’s death, “to avoid playing into the hands of whoever is doing the power grabbing in Moscow”."

Putin's army was taken by complete surprise and has been overwhelmed by the Ukrainian onslaught. Latest intelligence estimates that Ukraine's army has penetrated 43 miles into Russian defensive lines and retaken over 1,100 square miles of territory. Ukraine's military has managed to retake Kupiansk and Izyum, key logistical centres for Russia's army in the east The stunning success of Kyiv's army has sent shock waves through the Kremlin and Russia's military high command, who appear to be in denial about realities on the ground. Russia's Ministry of Defence attempted to paint the withdrawal of its forces from Izyum as an organised tactical move. Officials claimed the Russian soldiers were being ""regrouped"" so that efforts could be stepped up in Donetsk. However, analysts from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) dismissed these claims in their latest bulletin, saying the Russian army was in total disarray. They wrote: ""The Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast is routing Russian forces and collapsing Russia’s northern Donbas axis. ""Russian forces are not conducting a controlled withdrawal and are hurriedly fleeing southeastern Kharkiv Oblast to escape encirclement around Izyum."" They added: ""Ukrainian forces have penetrated Russian lines to a depth of up to 70 kilometres (43 miles) in some places and captured over 3,000 square kilometres (1,100 sq. miles) of territory in the past five days since September 6th. ""This is more territory than Russian forces have captured in all their operations since April."" The chaos and panic gripping Russian troops were graphically illustrated by Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces in their Sunday update. They reported that Russian units from the 3rd Motorized Rifle Division of the 20th Joint Arms Army had been left without support and were in ""a panicked mood"". Ukraine's military officials also said the Russians continued to suffer heavy losses. They said: ""During the previous day, more than 75 wounded Russian soldiers were brought to the village of Valuyka in the Belgorod region, while more than a hundred occupiers were evacuated from Belgorod to Moscow."" They noted: ""Due to significant losses in manpower, the Russian invaders plan to carry out the so-called ""mobilisation"" of the male population in the temporarily captured territories. ""Now men are forbidden to leave settlements."" It comes amid reports that Ukraine's army is now within just 15 miles of reaching its border with Russia. Russian military bloggers claim that Kyiv's army has captured Velykyi Burluk in Kharkiv region, which would put it within shouting distance of Russia. George Barros, a ISW analyst, tweeted: ""Ukrainian forces are likely 25 kilometers of the international border with Russia. ""Russian sources reported that Ukrainian forces captured Velyky Burluk in Kharkiv on September 10. ""Russian milblogger Yuriy Kotenyok stated that Ukrainian forces took advantage of the absence of a continuous front line while advancing on Velyky Burluk."""

Biden urged to wake up to China threat if Putin toppled,"Wikistrat, which describes itself as a “crowdsourced consultancy” often carries out “death of a leader simulations” to learn about “internal power dynamics” and the “regional influence” certain leaders have. A team of experts are given a number of different scenarios for how the leader dies and are asked to discuss how each scenario would affect their country’s foreign policy towards their allies and foes. With countless rumours flying around about the state of Vladimir Putin’s health, Wikistrat decided to use the Russian leader’s hypothetical death for their latest simulation. The experts came to the conclusion that China could use Putin’s death to slip under the radar and take Taiwan, whilst the world is watching Russia. Commenting on the findings of the simulation, Oren Kesler, CEO of Wikistrat said that the West, and in particular the US, needs to be harsher in its response to China to prevent this from happening. He said: “For the Chinese, if Putin dies, this could be a shift not in their strategy towards Russia, but this could be a shift in cross-strait (China-Taiwan) relations. “The US should be aware that in such case, they will need to increase their level of willingness to show strength and force. “China might say now the West is distracted. Or this is something that we can do without a cost. “So I would say that Western leaders’ dialogue with China should be harsher. Not nicer.” Adding to this, James Shaw, a Former US Army Officer and one of the experts involved in the simulation said: “I believe that China will benefit by having Russia as the dartboard for the rest of the world to focus on while China continues pushing forward with its own efforts in its own ""near abroad"", LATAM, Africa, and MENA.” Mr Kesler added that, following the death of Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping could come to the forefront and proclaim that he is the leader of the non-Western world. He said that part of doing this could be increasing tensions in the South China Sea, to show his strength. Taiwan is an island about 100 miles off the coast of China and is home to approximately 24 million people. From 1895 to 1945, Taiwan was under Japanese rule. But after Japan surrendered in WWII, China took over the administration of the island. In 1949, The People's Republic of China was formed under General Mao in Beijing following a civil war and the nationalist party fled to Taiwan where they then ruled. Taiwan has insisted on its independence since 1949. Today, China’s ruling Communist Party sees Taiwan as a province that it hopes will one day become part of its country. Taiwan’s President has accused China of using a variety of techniques of intimidation, such as drones and cognitive warfare. Speaking to soldiers during live-fire exercises on Tuesday, Tsai Ing-wen said: “In addition to frequent intrusions by China’s aircraft and ships, China also conducted cognitive warfare, using false information to create disturbance in minds of people, as well as the use of drones.” On Tuesday, Taiwan launched military exercises on the Hengchun peninsula in the far south of the island, simulating warfare against an invading enemy. Lt. Col. Jing Feng-huang told reporters at the site of the drills: “We will continue to hold the attitude of being prepared for war.” “We will not shy away from war but will not seek it out.”"

Ukraine's army has regained more than 772 square miles (2,000 square kilometres) from the Russian occupiers within a matter of a few days, sending shock waves through the Kremlin. The strategically important cities of Kupiansk and Izyum are now believed to be under the control of Kyiv once again. Photos published by the Ukrainian security forces showed troops raising the national flag in Kupiansk. The Russian Ministry of Defence also confirmed the withdrawal of its troops from Izyum, the major base for Moscow’s forces in Kharkiv. Officials claimed the Russian troops were being ""regrouped"" so that efforts could be stepped up in Donetsk. However, Dr Mike Martin, a military expert, said the Russians were ""routed"" at Izyum and predicted a collapse of Putin's army in the near future. He said: ""The Russians fled Izyum in what can only be described as a rout. ""The Ukrainians have just fought a brilliant piece of combined arms manoeuvre. ""The Russian armed forces have been demonstrated, again, to be utterly terrible."" Dr Martin noted that the fall of Kupiansk and Izyum would seriously impact the Russian army's ability to continue its Donbas offensive. The two cities were critical logistical centres for Putin's army in the east. The King's College London professor wrote: ""This is very significant - the Russians will not be able to conduct offensive operations in the Donbas anymore until (if ever?) they reconfigure their logistics."" The Kharkiv counterattack has detracted attention from events in the south of Ukraine, where Kyiv's army is also on the offensive. Ukrainian forces are currently fighting the Russians in the Kherson region, as they seek to retake the port city of the same name. Capturing Kherson would provide a platform to launch an attack on Crimea to liberate the peninsula that was seized by Moscow in 2014. Dr Martin said: ""But as ever - this is all about Kherson. ""Watch over there too today - because Crimea is the Russian strategic centre of gravity and the Kherson pocket will need to collapse to make that happen. ""But after what we’ve seen over the last 72 hours the collapse of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine doesn’t seem a long way away."" A former top Ukrainian government official claimed the Kherson counterattack was just a feint for the Kharkiv operation. Taras Berezovets, a former national security adviser, told The Guardian that the much-publicised Ukrainian southern offensive was a disinformation campaign to distract Russia from the real one being prepared in the Kharkiv region He said: ""It was a big special disinformation operation. ""Russia thought it would be in the south and over their equipment. ""Then, instead of the south, the offensive happened where they least expected and this caused them to panic and flee."""

2022-09-11,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1667640/zelensky-poland-ukraine-russia-war-ont,Zelensky may provide ‘brother’ Poland with thermal coal to prepare for winter,"The Ukrainian president, while addressing the nation on Saturday evening, said he had ordered that work be speeded up on upgrading a power transmission line from Ukraine's Khmelnytskyi nuclear plant to Poland. According to the news reports, Ukraine and Poland are increasing this year's production of thermal coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, preparing for colder months as Europe grapples with an energy security crisis exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. He said: “I have instructed the cabinet to work out the possibility of urgently supplying 100,000 tonnes of thermal coal to Poland right now. “We have sufficient volumes for ourselves and we can help our brothers to prepare for this winter.” Poland, which relies on coal for around 70 percent of its electricity generation, has introduced measures that will subsidise coal for households using fuel for heating purposes to mitigate surging prices. Ukraine wants to increase electricity exports to the European Union to boost cash flow to its utilities hit by a drop in electricity use since the Russian invasion. President Zelensky said work on upgrading the power transmission line from the Khmelnytskyi plant to the Polish city of Rzeszow needed to be completed by December 8. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Friday that Warsaw was interested in buying power from the facility. Mr Morawiecki held meetings with the Ukrainian president to discuss the geopolitical situation, the energy market, energy and military security, his spokesman said. He told a news briefing he held along with President Zelensky: “We could use some electricity from Ukraine. “I heard from President Zelensky that Ukraine will soon be ready to sell power from Khmelnytskyi and I thanked him for that.” Meanwhile, Ukrainian electricity would help the EU cope with reduced gas supplies from Russia. Ukraine is already selling some electricity to Hungary and Slovakia, along with some 200 megawatts (MW) of power to Poland. An additional 1,000 MW of electricity could flow via a power cable linking Ukraine's Khmelnytskyi plant and Poland, a possibility that Mr Morawiecki was referring to. The link, idled since the 1990s, is scheduled to reopen by the end of the year after necessary upgrades."

The news came after days of apparent advances by Ukraine south of Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, in what could become the biggest battlefield success for Ukrainian forces since they thwarted a Russian attempt to seize the capital of Kyiv at the start of the nearly seven-month war. According to Ukrainian media only around one third of the population — mainly the elderly — stayed in the city during its occupation. Now Ukrainian soldiers patrol the main street, while a few residents make their way around — for the most part on foot or by bike. Although some buildings have escaped unscathed, many have either been destroyed or damaged. Olexander Sidorov, an employee with a local electricity firm who battled to keep supplies going despite the conflict, told A Digital Journal: “We were happy to meet the Ukrainian forces.” At the same time, he lamented the scale of the destruction. Ukrainian officials on Saturday claimed major gains in a counteroffensive against Russian forces in the Kharkiv region, saying Ukrainian troops had cut off vital supplies to Izium. Danylo Grygorenko, a volunteer aged 24, had brought in food and medical supplies for isolated residents. He told the publication: “People are happy that it arrived, that people are back in their home (in Ukraine). “That there is no Russian occupation, no more oppression, no more basements, no FSB (Russia’s Federal Security Service). “But at the same time people are traumatised by the occupation.” Videos on social media appeared to show Ukrainian forces on the outskirts of Izium at a roadside checkpoint. A large statue with the city’s name could be seen in the footage. Ukrainian forces did not acknowledge holding the city, reported CNN. Earlier on Saturday, the British Defence Ministry told reporters it believed the Ukrainians had advanced as much as 50 kilometres (30 miles) south of Kharkiv, and described Russian forces around Izium as “increasingly isolated”."

On Saturday, President Putin instead praised Russian officials for doing a ""great job"" in Ukraine. He also spent the day opening the largest Ferris Wheel in Europe, in an out-of-touch ceremony that one BBC journalist described as ""surreal"". Commemorating Moscow City Day on Saturday, President Putin spoke with officials and delivered a speech praising Moscow's role in the Ukrainian war. He claimed that ""Moscow specialists are already doing a great job in reviving the capitals of the Donetsk and the Lugansk people’s republics"". President Putin claimed Russians were helping to ""rebuild damaged residential buildings, roads, schools, doing everything to prepare Donetsk and Luhansk for the winter period"". However, he did not acknowledge the dramatic collapse of the Russian frontline nor the remarkable game-changing advances of Ukrainian forces. This week's counter-offensive in the Kharkiv region marks the most significant Ukrainian advance since Russia withdrew from areas around Kyiv in April. Politico's Christopher Miller reported: ""It is absolutely stunning how quickly Ukrainian forces have retaken territory in the east and forced Russian troops to retreat — and they're still on the move. ""Big victory for Kyiv and humiliating blow to Russia and Putin — but at least he opened that Ferris wheel in Moscow today."" BBC's Steve Rosenberg echoed this: ""On the day Russian forces retreated from occupied areas of Kharkiv region and Ukrainian forces reported major gains, back in Moscow Vladimir Putin was inaugurating a giant Ferris wheel and there was a fireworks display to celebrate city day. Surreal."" Associated Press White House correspondent Chris Megerian wrote, ""I'm trying to imagine the political blowback for an American president opening a new amusement park ride while the US military retreats."" Several pro-Russian military bloggers sharply criticised President Putin for going ahead with the celebrations of the Ferris Wheel. President Putin also released a video encouraging Russians to cast a vote in Sunday's local and regional elections. The BBC's Francis Scarr tweeted: ""For the time being, Putin isn't reacting publicly to the setbacks now being encountered in his 'special military operation'. ""Instead, this morning the Kremlin released a video in which he encourages Russians to cast e-votes in tomorrow's local and regional 'Single Voting Day'."" A growing number of Russians are voicing their criticism of the recent retreats. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-appointed leader of Chechnya, questioned Russian military leadership in the wake of the retreats. In a post on Telegram, Mr Kadyrov said: ""If today or tomorrow no changes in strategy are made, I will be forced to speak with the leadership of the defence ministry and the leadership of the country to explain the real situation on the ground to them. ""It’s a very interesting situation. It’s astounding, I would say."""

Izium in Kharkiv province was Moscow's worst defeat since its troops were forced back from the capital Kyiv in March. It could prove a decisive turning point in the six-month-old war, with thousands of Russian soldiers abandoning ammunition stockpiles and equipment as they fled. Russian forces used Izium as the logistics base for one of their main campaigns - a months-long assault from the north on the adjacent Donbas region comprising Donetsk and Luhansk. State-run TASS news agency quoted Russia's Defence Ministry as saying it had ordered troops to leave the vicinity and reinforce operations elsewhere in neighbouring Donetsk. TASS reported the head of Russia's administration in Kharkiv told people to evacuate the province and flee to Russia to “save lives”. Witnesses described traffic jams of cars with people leaving Russian-held territory. President Zelensky said in his nightly video address Ukraine's armed forces have liberated about 700 square miles (2,000 square kilometres) of territory since a counter-offensive against Russia started earlier this month. He said: “As of now, as part of active actions since the beginning of September, about 2,000 kilometres of our territory has already been liberated. “These days, the Russian army is showing its best - showing its back. And, in the end, it is a good choice for them to run away. “There is, and will be, no place for the occupiers in Ukraine.” President Zelensky said in his nightly video address Ukraine's armed forces have liberated about 700 square miles (2,000 square kilometres) of territory since a counter-offensive against Russia started earlier this month. Ukrainian officials stopped short of confirming they had recaptured Izium, but Andriy Yermak, Mr Zelensky's Chief of Staff, posted a photo of troops on its outskirts and tweeted an emoji of grapes. The city's name means “raisin”. Mr Yermak wrote on Twitter: “The Russian army is claiming the title of fastest army in the world ... keep running!” The Russian withdrawal came hours after Ukrainian troops captured the city of Kupiansk farther north, the sole railway hub supplying Russia's entire front line across northeastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials posted photos early on Saturday of their troops raising the country's blue-and-yellow flag in front of Kupiansk's city hall. That left thousands of Russian troops abruptly cut off from supplies along a front which has seen some of the most intense battles of the war. Ukrainian officials stopped short of confirming they had recaptured Izium, but Andriy Yermak, Mr Zelensky's Chief of Staff, posted a photo of troops on its outskirts and tweeted an emoji of grapes. The city's name means “raisin”. There were signs of trouble for Russia elsewhere along its remaining positions on the eastern front with pro-Russian officials acknowledging difficulties at other locations. Mr Zelensky said Ukrainian armed forces are continuing to advance in different areas along the front. A few days ago, Kyiv's forces burst through the front line and have since recaptured dozens of towns and villages in a swift mechanised assault, surging forward dozens of miles a day. TASS quoted Russia's defence ministry as saying: “To achieve the stated goals of the Special Military Operation for the liberation of Donbas, it was decided to regroup the Russian troops located in the districts of Balakliia and Izium for the purpose of increasing efforts in the Donetsk direction.” Russian forces had already abandoned the town of Balakliia days ago. Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar sounded a cautionary note, urging people not to report prematurely that towns have been “taken” just because Ukrainian troops have entered, as in Balaklia. She said: “A few days ago it was reported that troops had entered the town. Today we have finally established control in the city, carried out all the necessary activities, and raised the flag.”"

Kyiv's army has captured more than 30 towns and villages and reclaimed 2,500 square kilometres of territory from the Russians within a matter of a few days. The incredible speed of the advance shows no sign of slowing down, as Ukraine's commanders seek to press home their advantage. Reports are now coming in of the strategically vital cities of Kupiansk and Izyum falling to Kyiv. Putin and his generals have resorted to pointing the finger of blame at each another, as tensions between the Russian leader and his military high command explode. The Telegram channel, General SVR, reported in a recent meeting called by a furious Putin, one of his generals could no longer contain his frustrations and told the Russian president where he could go. General SVR said: ""The most significant event of the meeting was a report to the President via video link from one of the Generals, who is located much closer to the front line than the other speakers. ""Already at the start of the General's report, Putin began to have doubts as to whether he was sober. ""The President asked him directly whether he had been drinking spirits, to which the General reacted somewhat boldly. ""Moreover, Putin tried to put the General in his place with a blunt threat. ""The General wouldn't back down and told Putin to go you know where!"" He added: ""Putin stopped the video link and ordered his officials to 'shut the f***er up.' ""After the incident the President's mood worsened even more and he postponed the meting until Thursday."" The General SVR channel has regularly commented on Putin's health. It is believed to be run by Viktor Yermolaev, a lawyer from Kharkiv. Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, said that the Kremlin is almost certainly involved in a blame game over the Ukraine debacle. He tweeted: ""I’m sure the blame game — кто виноват— for Russia's failed invasion of Ukraine has already begun behind closed doors. ""I wonder when it will become public. I would not want to be a senior official in the Russian military, intelligence, or military industrial complex right now."" Meanwhile, Russian troop morale continues to plummet amid the Ukrainian military onslaught. Dimitriev, a Russian blogger, said troops in the Mykolaiv direction were complaining about the endless supply of missiles at Kyiv's disposal. The soldiers noted their incredible accuracy, as missile strikes continued to target Russian troop concentrations, supply trucks and front line positions. Putin's soldiers predicted that if things were to continue as they are, then the war would be over in two weeks. Оleksiy Arestovych, a senior adviser to President Zelensky, said that the Russian army was ""crumbling"". He told journalists: ""We found a weak point and hit there, they were not ready. ""Two or three such defeats, and they will crumble. They already have one."""

Kyiv said its military had recaptured swaths of territory in a thrust centred on the region around Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. Russia later acknowledged a section of its frontline had crumbled southeast of Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv. Vitaly Ganchev, head of the Russian-backed administration in the Kharkiv region, said on state television: “The enemy is being delayed as much as possible, but several settlements have already come under the control of Ukrainian armed formations.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later said Kyiv's forces had liberated more than 30 settlements in the Kharkiv region so far and that fighting continued in the eastern Donbas region and the south. In a video address, the President said: “Our army, intelligence units and the security services are carrying out active engagements in several operational areas. They are doing so successfully.” Russia has taken control of around a fifth of Ukraine since its troops invaded on February 24 in what Moscow calls a “special military operation” to “disarm” Ukraine. The Kyiv government and its Western allies accuse Russia of an imperial-style war of aggression. The Russian defence ministry released video of military vehicles speeding along a highway, saying they showed reinforcements rushing to defend the area. Ukrainian officials released videos showing soldiers raising flags and posing in front of street signs in villages and towns across part of previously Russian-held territory. One image showed troops by a highway welcome sign for Kupiansk, previously more than 50 km inside Russia's front line. The city is an important target as the junction of several of the main railway lines supplying troops at the front. Mr Ganchev had said his administration was trying to evacuate civilians from cities including Izium, Russia's main stronghold and logistics base in the province. President Zelensky’s adviser Oleksiy Arestovych, in a video posted on YouTube, said the Russian defenders in Izium were almost isolated. Citing what he described as reports from the front line, Mr Arestovych said hundreds of Russians had died so far and several hundred more had been taken prisoner."
2022-09-10,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1667310/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-poses-major-threat-ukraine-war-iaea,‘Complex and dangerous’ Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant poses major threat following IAEA visit,"Zaporizhzhia nuclear powerplant (ZNPP) in Ukraine continues to pose a grave nuclear threat even following a visit by the world's nuclear energy agency, according to an expert. The plant has been occupied by Russian forces since March and has seen regular shelling, some of which has damaged critical infrastructure at the plant. There are concerns about the plant's power supply as well as a potential false flag attack by Russian forces made to look as if Kyiv had attacked the plant. Dr Paul Dorfman is an Associate Fellow at University of Sussex Business School specialising in civil nuclear, he has advised various Governments, including the UK Government, on nuclear policy. He told Express.co.uk the situation was ""incredibly dangerous"" particularly with regard to keeping the plant supplied power. The plant has, once again, been disconnected from the main power grid and days later, shelling reportedly damaged the plant's last backup power cable. ZNPP was using its remaining online nuclear reactor to keep its systems running, according to the IAEA. Although the site does have diesel powered backup generators, they are unlikely to have much fuel left due to the war creating logistical problems. Dr Dorfman said: ""IAEA visited the site, [Head of the IAEA Rafael] Grossi spent four hours [at the plant] and came out saying he knew what he needed to know. ""He’s left a small team in order to do what exactly? It’s an incredibly dangerous and difficult situation. The generators only have a limited time they can [provide backup power] without being refuelled themselves. ""Then there is the issue of: Does Russia want to disconnect it from the [Ukrainian] grid and reconnect it to their own? Which is a hugely complex and dangerous thing to do."" The IAEA has said that so far, the shelling from that incident did not ""have an immediate impact on the ZNPP’s current operations"" as the plant was already disconnected from the grid. However, on September 9, the organisation gave its gravest warning about the situation at Zaporizhzhia yet. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said: ""This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious. Enerhodar [the town near ZNPP] has gone dark. ""The power plant has no offsite power. And we have seen that once infrastructure is repaired, it is damaged once again."" ""Then there is the issue of: Does Russia want to disconnect it from the [Ukrainian] grid and reconnect it to their own? Which is a hugely complex and dangerous thing to do."" The IAEA has said that so far, the shelling from that incident did not ""have an immediate impact on the ZNPP’s current operations"" as the plant was already disconnected from the grid. However, on September 9, the organisation gave its gravest warning about the situation at Zaporizhzhia yet. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said: ""This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious. Enerhodar [the town near ZNPP] has gone dark. ""The power plant has no offsite power. And we have seen that once infrastructure is repaired, it is damaged once again."" The technical dangers at Zaporizhzhia do not take into account the human factor at the plant. Ukrainian operators continue to work at the Russian occupied plant. Their families in the surrounding towns are likely subject to Russian shelling, possibly from ZNPP itself. There have also been reports of torture and coercion by Russian forces there. Additionally, there remains the threat of a Russian false flag operation which could see Russia damage the plant, possibly significantly, while blaming the attack on Kyiv. Dr Dorfman added: ""We’ve got the largest nuclear station in Europe under military attack, whether internally or externally - especially in the context of potential Russian false flag operations. ""We know that Russia is unstable, we know Russia is firing from the nuclear plant, and some of the towns Russian forces based in Zaporizhzhia are firing on are where nuclear workers’ families are sheltering."" Both experts and the IAEA seem to agree, that in its present situation ZNPP is a ticking time bomb which could even spell disaster for the region and the world."
2022-09-10,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1667037/Russia-Ukraine-invasion-war-military-equipment-Kremlin-Air-Force-Vladimir-Putin-vn,Russian forces 'going to get weaker' in Ukraine as Putin still reluctant to use Air Force,"President Vladimir Putin’s reluctance to employ the Russian Air Force in combat in Ukraine has “weakened” Moscow’s invading forces. Russian troops in Ukraine are said to be suffering from an increasing crisis in the supply of both munitions and military personnel as the war drags on far longer than the Kremlin had first anticipated. The news comes as President Zelensky’s troops have launched several counter-offensive operations in Ukraine to reclaim Russian-controlled territories. Dr Patrick Bury, a senior lecturer in security at the University of Bath, spoke to Express.co.uk to offer his analysis of the conflict. Comparing the military power of Ukraine and Russia, Dr Bury said: “The general consensus is the forces are quite equal but, in the longer term, Russia is going to get weaker. “They have expended and chewed up a lot of their best units. “They haven't thrown in some of their more capable kit yet, which is interesting. We’ll have to wait and see why they haven’t done that. “Why is their Air Force being pathetically weak so far?” The UK Ministry of Defence have reported that the Kremlin may be reluctant to make use of the Russian Air Force due to an insufficient supply of well-trained troops. An intelligence update claimed Moscow had previously been forced to deploy retired pilots to operate military planes due to the increasingly high number of war casualties. Ukrainian authorities have claimed responsibility for strikes on a Russian air base in Crimea which reportedly destroyed a number of the Kremlin’s military aircraft. The Kremlin has denied the attacks resulted in damage to their warplanes, although satellite imagery from Crimea suggested at least nine were damaged or destroyed. Dr Bury speculated: “Maybe they are just incapable, maybe they don’t want to lose this stuff. “The Ukrainians will get stronger as they go on because they are getting the Western support.” He added: “The training of their civilians will also come up.” President Zelensky has continued to secure valuable packages of military aid from his Western allies, notably America and the United Kingdom. An intelligence report from the Ministry of Defence read: “Operationally, Russia is suffering from shortages of munitions, vehicles, and personnel.” Oryx, a Dutch independent defence intelligence organisation, confirmed Russia had lost at least 53 military aircraft since the invasion of Ukraine began. The failure to properly mobilise the Russian air force is reported to be one of the core contributing factors behind Moscow’s “very limited campaign success”. Ukraine’s Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov reported supplies of advanced anti-aircraft systems had arrived in Ukraine, strengthening defending forces against the possibility of a Russian Air Force Attack. He said: “Our capabilities to protect our sky will be strengthened.”"

It comes after Ukraine launched a surprise offensive in the Kharkiv region earlier this week. An installed official from the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces “encircled” the city of 27,000 people. Balakliya is some 43 miles southeast of the city of Kharkiv, lying on a bend of the Siversky Donets river to the west of Izyum. Russian forces quickly turned it into a stronghold earlier in the invasion."
2022-09-10,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1667487/emmanuel-macron-news-france-handling-putin-hollande-exposes-russia-ukraine-war,‘Indulgent!’ Macron savaged by insider who exposes his 'too close' handling of Putin,"Mr Hollande accused Mr Macron of being too indulgent towards the Russian leader who has invaded Ukraine and triggered a major gas crisis across Europe. Mr Hollande, who led France until 2017, slammed Mr Macron and Ségolène Royal, his long-standing companion and former cabinet minister, for being too soft on the Russian President and being fooled by him. Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Mr Macron has since tried to ease tensions with Russia by calling Putin but has so far failed to bring about a resolution to the conflict. Mr Hollande told Inter radio in France: “Emmanuel Macron is typical of a part of the political class which has always been quite indulgent, not to Russia but to Vladimir Putin.” He added for this “political class”, that their thinking was that “in reality, it’s our fault and that we didn’t talk enough to Putin, that we are supposed to have encircled him and even attacked him”. The former French leader accused his successor of being duped by Putin in the numerous telephone conversations and meetings held with him. He said: “I had numerous talks with him [Putin] and what always struck me was his capacity for spouting lies.” In their last phone call, Mr Macron and Putin agreed on the need to send a delegation by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant where the risk of a nuclear disaster escalated amid shelling. According to a Kremlin readout of the call, Putin blamed the shelling of the plant on Kyiv, adding that they created the risk of ""large-scale catastrophe"". Meanwhile, Ukraine accused Russian in early August of damaging three power lines that connect the plant to the Ukrainian grid. The IAEA previously sounded warnings, calling the fighting around the nuclear plant is ""very alarming"". The main risk facing the plant is the loss of power essential to cooling the reactor core and spent fuel pools. If cooling systems failed, the nuclear reaction would slow, while the reactor itself would heat up very quickly. At such high temperatures, hydrogen could be released from the zirconium cladding, leading to the reactor melting down and radioactive substances released into the environment. Russia recently rejected calls to demilitarise the plant. Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan noted that he was worried about the danger of ""another Chernobyl"" disaster erupting at the plant. Mr Macron was also recently shamed after a French oil company was accused of frequently supplying a refinery which produces fuel for Russian war planes amid the conflict in Ukraine. TotalEnergies, which part owns the Termokarstovoye field in Russia’s far north along with Russian gas firm Novatek, produces around 600,000 tonnes of gas condensate (similar to crude oil) each month. According to the NGO Global Witness, this then gets shipped to Gapzrom’s Neft refinery in Omsk, where the condensate gets refined into products such as petrol, or jet fuel."
2022-09-10,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1667483/ukraine-war-russia-east-counterattack-30-territory,Ukraine stuns Russia with ‘extraordinary’ move to reclaim 30 areas: 'Substantial victory',"Kyiv announced on Saturday its forces were making lightning gains in the east of the country in a shock counter-offensive to recapture territory that fell to Russia shortly after Moscow's February invasion. Foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said in a statement on social media: ""Ukrainian troops are advancing in eastern Ukraine, liberating more cities and villages. “Their courage coupled with Western military support brings astonishing results. ""It's crucial to keep sending arms to Ukraine. Defeating Russia on the battlefield means winning peace in Ukraine.” James Mates, from ITV, said: “An extraordinary Russian military collapse is unfolding in Eastern Ukraine. “Towns and cities that took Ru weeks to capture have fallen in hours to a lightning counter-offensive.” It comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops had “liberated dozens of settlements” and reclaimed more than 1,000 square kilometres (385 square miles) of territory in Kharkiv and in Kherson over the past week. On Friday, he posted a video of Ukrainian soldiers announcing they had captured the eastern town of Balakliia, south of Kharkiv. Speaking from Kyiv during his nightly address, Mr Zelensky said his forces are ""gradually taking control of new settlements"" and ""returning the Ukrainian flag and protection for all our people"". The Ukrainian military said it had advanced nearly 50km (31 miles) through that front after an assault that appeared to take the Russians by surprise. In addition, the Ukrainian general staff said early on Friday retreating Russian forces were trying to evacuate wounded personnel and damaged military equipment near Kharkiv. Ukraine’s breakthrough in the east comes a week after Kyiv announced its counteroffensive in Kherson province in the south. Royal Family LIVE: Prince Andrew and Anne fight back tears at service Panicking Putin deploys 'most terrible weapon in world' to Ukraine King Charles 'love bombed' Harry and Meghan in speech Russian state television broadcast an interview on Friday acknowledging that Kyiv had achieved a “substantial victory” in the region. Russian state TV showed the head of the Russian-installed occupation administration for Kharkiv province, Vitaly Ganchev, saying in an interview: “The very fact of a breach of our defences is already a substantial victory for the Ukrainian armed forces.” Russia’s defence ministry also released a video of its troops being rushed to reinforce the area. The UK Ministry of Defence also said on Saturday: “Ukrainian forces launched offensive operations in the south of Kharkiv Oblast on 06 September 2022. “Lead elements have advanced up to 50km into previously Russian held territory on a narrow front. Russian forces were likely taken by surprise. “The sector was only lightly held and Ukrainian units have captured or surrounded several towns. A Russian force around Izium is likely increasingly isolated. “Ukrainian units are now threatening the town of Kupiansk; its capture would be a significant blow to Russia because it sits on supply routes to the Donbas front line. “With Ukrainian operations also continuing in Kherson, the Russian defensive front is under pressure on both its northern and southern flanks.”"
2022-09-10,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1667449/putin-news-tos1a-heavy-flamethrower-kharkiv-counter-russia-ukraine-war-update,Panicking Putin deploys 'most terrible weapon in world' to Ukraine as defeat looms,"The Kremlin has been rocked to its foundations after Ukraine launched a surprise counterattack in the northeast of the country. Kyiv's forces have smashed through Russian defensive lines in the Kharkiv region and are now threatening to cut off thousands of Putin's troops in the city of Izyum - a gateway to the Donbas. The Russian President and his commanders are facing an unprecedented military humiliation and are desperate to halt Kyiv's momentum. Now it appears that the Russian tyrant is placing all his bets on the TOS-1A heavy flamethrower to help him save the day. The TOS-1A is a thermobaric weapon which can cause devastating destruction and carnage. This type of munitions releases a large cloud of flammable gas and causes massive explosions. It is able to generate temperatures up to 3,000 degrees Celsius and can quite literally ""vaporise human bodies"". Normally such a weapon is used to clear out buildings, bunkers and other fortifications. Russian reports today say the flamethrower will lead to “guaranteed defeat of the enemy”. A source told ultra-loyalist news outlet RIA FAN: “These weapons are considered the most terrible, there are no analogues in any country in the world. “The Americans even tried to ban it, but not because it really is a weapon of mass destruction, but because the Americans can't do anything like that.” The destructive power of a TOS-1A was graphically highlighted in a 2011 edition of the US Army's World Equipment Guide. It stated: ""The primary ... effect [created by the TOS-1’ss rockets] is a long-duration high-pressure blast wave which creates a vacuum – then precipitates a reverse wave. ""These pressure/vacuum surges (up to 427 pounds per sq inch) cause a ripping effect on soft materials (such as airplane skin, radar surface, human lung tissue). ""Walls and surfaces within the affected area do not necessarily shield victims, rather cause multiple pressure waves, which amplify the tearing effects and can topple structures.” It added: ""A secondary effect is high-temperature heat — 2,500-3,000° C. ""An incomplete explosion renders a near-devastating effect, wide-area long-duration high-temperature flame. ""Even those outside of the blast area will be rendered ineffective with debilitating mental and physical trauma.” It comes amid reports that Ukrainian forces have now captured the key cities of Izyum and Kupiansk. The BBC says that a number of pro-Russian Telegram channels have claimed Ukrainian forces now control half of Kupiansk, while Ukrainian sources have told the outlet that Kupiansk has been “completely liberated”. BBC Russia also reports that pro-Russian channels have said Russian troops have left Izyum. Other channels reportedly said Ukrainian troops were already in the city’s centre. The Russian military blogger ""Moscow Calling"" wrote on his Telegram channel: ""Advanced units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine enter Kupyansk. ""The city was not destroyed by the work of artillery 'in squares', as happens during the assaults of the RF Armed Forces, and there was no assault as such - the Russian military fled without any panic, abandoning their equipment. He added: ""In the future, the qualitative superiority of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will lead to a radical change in the front lines, with the inevitable final - the defeat of the Russian Federation. It's just a matter of time."""

The push has made rapid gains and seen Ukraine's forces come within touching distance of Izyum, where thousands of Russian troops are based. Reports suggest that Kyiv's army has reached the banks of the Oskil river at Senkove and has managed to cut off Russia's main line of communication with its army units in Izyum. Putin's troops appear to be in effect encircled and face being wiped out or ignominious surrender. The tactic is a classic military ploy that has been used throughout the ages by generals on the battlefield. Dan Snow, a military historian, claimed it was the ""holy grail"" for commanders and could be ""annihilating"". He said: ""This....is mind-blowing. We are watching an army scythe through enemy lines, and thrust deep behind them, threatening to surround large numbers of troops. ""Envelopment is the holy grail. It can be annihilating."" Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War wrote in their latest bulletin that Kyiv had succeeded in capturing an estimated 2,500 square kilometres in Kharkiv Oblast as of September 9. Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces claimed that in some places their units had advanced up to 50 km (31 miles) within Russian-held territory. They added in their situational report on Saturday: ""More than thirty settlements that were temporarily occupied by the Russian invaders in the Kharkiv region were liberated or taken under control."" The speed of the advance has stunned both western observers and the Russian high command. The Kremlin is scrambling to send reinforcements to the area to try and stop the Ukrainian onslaught and prevent Izyum from falling to Kyiv. ISW researchers said: ""Russian forces and occupation authorities in the rear of occupied Kharkiv Oblast are panicking to reinforce Russian positions and 'evacuate civilians' amid the high pace of the Ukrainian advance. ""Geolocated Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) footage shows Russian military convoys in Raihorodka, Luhansk Oblast driving north reportedly to reinforce Russian forces in unspecified areas of Kharkiv Oblast."" Unconfirmed reports on social media suggest that clashes are already taking inside Izyum and that some Russian units have surrendered. Barracuda, an OSINT investigator, tweeted late on Friday: ""Eyewitnesses from Izyum report that clashes took place in the city. ""Residents of Izyum report that the Ukrainian Army has surrounded the city, and some Russian soldiers have laid down their weapons and surrendered to the Ukrainian Army."" Despite the success of the Kharkiv offensive, Ukraine's forces are vulnerable to a Russian counterattack on their flanks. Mr Snow observed: ""If these flanks don't hold, you're in trouble."" A similar point was made by a Russian military blogger, who noted that Ukrainian forces were thin on the ground. ""Play Civilisation"" explained: ""Of course, Ukraine's forces are in a vulnerable situation - they are drawn out in thin lines of formation, they have poor communications and a thin density of soldiers. ""A powerful counter will simply crush their group and create a gigantic hole in their defence. ""But for that you need reserves. The question is do we have any there or not?"""
2022-09-10,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1667524/putin-news-pays-tribute-King-Charles-III-Russians-scramble-reconfigure-ukraine-war,Putin pays tribute to King Charles as Russians scramble to 'reconfigure' in Ukraine battle,"The former Prince of Wales became King on Thursday following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, at the age of 96. Messages of condolences on Her Majesty’s death and of well-wishing for the new monarch have been sent in recent days from around the world. One such note has today been received from the Kremlin. Putin wrote to King Charles: “Please accept my sincere congratulations on Your Accession to the throne. “I wish Your Majesty success, good health and all the best.” Some commentators have taken the message as a sign of the statue of the British Royal Family – that the passing down of a crown should give pause for pleasantries despite what some have termed the ongoing proxy war in Ukraine, in which, at the least, Britain has pitted itself behind Kyiv. This also comes at a time of great difficulty for Russia’s forces – perhaps the most they have faced since the beginning of the “special military operation”. Ukraine has been pursuing an effective counter effective and has recaptured a good deal of land from Russian forces. Perhaps more than Moscow has yet officially conceded. Agentstvo, an independent Russian media outlet, also known as Proekt, today said that in its latest mapping of activity in the ongoing conflict, the Russian Defence Ministry showed the city of Balakliya outside its controlled zone. READ MORE: Ukraine Live: Putin facing worst military defeat since WW2 BBC journalist Will Vernon noted that Moscow has not yet officially confirmed its loss of the city. Russian propagandists have also taken to crafting excuses for their country’s losses in Ukraine. Francis Scarr of the BBC reported in a post on Twitter that Channel One Russia host Vladimir Solovyov shared a post on social media platform Telegram in which the writer claimed Russian forces were “evening out the frontline” because its “previous configuration was unfavourable”.

This is when a win inflicts so much damage it is tantamount to a loss. Mr Lee commented in a post on Twitter: “I think Russia's gains in the Donbas were likely a Pyrrhic victory because they took heavy losses they couldn't afford, which is evident now.” Following the death of the Queen, Putin wished Britons “courage and perseverance in the face of this heavy, irreparable loss”. The Kremlin did, however, announce that its leader would not be attending Her Majesty’s funeral."
2022-09-09,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666380/putin-news-russian-oligarchs-ukraine-war-spt,Putin to 'disappear' as elites turn on Russian despot over prolonged Ukraine war,"Putin claimed on Wednesday that Russia had “lost nothing” by sparking a war, which has killed thousands of Ukrainians and an estimated 50,000 Russian military personnel. His claims come as Ukraine launched a surprise counteroffensive in the north-east Kharkiv region, reportedly retaking several settlements. Ukrainian President Zelensky spoke of “good news” but did not elaborate on which Russian-occupied areas Ukraine had seized. The apparent breakthrough follows a parallel counteroffensive in the southern Kherson region, where Ukrainian forces have pushed back the Russian frontline. As Putin’s six-month war rages on, Russia’s powerful business elites are said to be growing increasingly weary, as the Russian economy continues to struggle under Western sanctions. Media moguls and military suppliers are set to turn on Putin, leading to his eventual “disappearance”, according to Professor Nikolai Petrov, a senior research fellow on the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House. Speaking to Express.co.uk about how the oligarchs could depose Putin, he said: “They will fight against each other, and it will destabilise the system. “It will not be an uprising against Putin or at least it will not start as such. But it will be their fight, leading to the further weakening of the regime. “And finally, it can lead to Putin’s disappearance as the supreme arbiter who is providing this balance between all major elite groups.” Professor Petrov, who has been following events in Russia and Ukraine, explained how Russian business chiefs will grow increasingly agitated with one another. He said: “The pie is shrinking in a very essential way. And pieces of this pie, which are given to all major elite clans, should become smaller as well. “They will see that their neighbour is getting more or is losing less than themselves. The tension is between these major elite groups, and this is the fight for survival. “This is not just political ideas, but in order to survive, they need to keep their piece of pie as big as possible.” Putin’s eventual exit from the Kremlin has been mapped out in a range of different scenarios. Since Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine began in February, some experts have considered whether there will be a regime change to remove the despot, possibly through an internal uprising of Russian officials. However, some experts doubt whether a coup could take place due to Putin’s grip on Russia’s levers of power, including the protection he enjoys from his inner circle of security chiefs, known as the “siloviki” or “strongmen”. This group includes figures like Alexander Bortnikov, head of the FSB, Russia's Federal Security Service, and Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia’s Security Council, who is Putin’s closest advisor. But Russian opposition politician Vladimir Milov stressed that an internal Kremlin coup from these men was unlikely, telling CNBC that we should not “have some rosy hopes about that”. Professor Petrov echoed this opinion, stressing that although individual members of the siloviki may be powerful, they are unlikely to coordinate as a group. He said: “The so-called ‘siloviki’, who are considered to be extremely powerful, are powerful in a corporate sense. “But not in the sense of individual players and forces of these siloviki corporations. So, it is pretty well-designed by Putin. First of all, they compete and even fight against each other. “And second, if the corporation is pretty strong, like the FSB, it is not totally controlled by its formal boss. “And there are some managed conflicts at the top, which will make it easier to control the whole corporation.” He added: “So, the role of the siloviki is much more instrumental. They are realising certain orders and decisions coming from the top. “Rather than making these decisions. Due to strong discipline, I would not wait for any kind of internal move from this side to oppose Putin and decisions he makes.”"

Soldiers have been warmly received by civilians in liberated towns and villages as Ukrainian troops continue to advance amid fierce fighting. Footage from the town of Balaklia shortly after Ukrainian soldiers entered shows a squad being received by relieved residents. Sobbing, women emerge from a block of flats and hug each of the soldiers in turn. A member of the Ukrainian Parliament, Inna Sovsun, shared the video on Twitter saying: ""Residents of the liberated town hug Ukrainian soldiers who liberated their town from occupation. ""People invite the soldiers to their homes for pancakes!!! Although there is a humanitarian crisis in the town."" After keeping silent for a day, Moscow effectively acknowledged that a section of its frontline had crumbled southeast of Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv. ""The very fact of a breach of our defences is already a substantial victory for the Ukrainian armed forces,"" the head of the Moscow-installed administration for occupied areas in Kharkiv province, Vitaly Ganchev, said on Russian state TV. Ganchev later said his administration was trying to evacuate civilians from cities including Izium, Russia's main stronghold and logistics base in the province near the front in the east. The Russian defence ministry released video of military vehicles speeding along a highway, saying they showed reinforcements rushing to defend the area. The Kremlin declined to comment on the Ukrainian advance. Ukrainian officials released a parade of videos showing soldiers raising flags and posing in front of street signs in villages and towns across part of previously Russian-held territory. One viral image showed troops holding up a Ukrainian flag at a highway welcome sign for Kupiansk, previously more than 50 km inside Russia's front line. The city is an important target as the junction of several of the main railway lines supplying Russian troops at the front. Ukraine kept independent journalists out of the area and Reuters could not confirm the images, but President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said troops had ""liberated dozens of settlements"" and reclaimed more than 1,000 square km (385 square miles) in the eastern Kharkiv and southern Kherson regions. Western military analysts said the advance could shut the supply lines Moscow has relied on to sustain its force in eastern Ukraine, and potentially leave thousands of Russian troops encircled. Such rapid advances have largely been unheard of since Russia abandoned its assault on the capital Kyiv in March, shifting the war mainly into a relentless grind along entrenched front lines. ""We see success in Kherson now, we see some success in Kharkiv and so that is very, very encouraging,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told a news conference with his Czech counterpart in Prague. The Ukrainian general staff said early on Friday that retreating Russian forces were trying to evacuate wounded personnel and damaged military equipment near Kharkiv. ""Thanks to skilful and coordinated actions, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, with the support of the local population, advanced almost 50 km in three days."""
2022-09-09,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1667307/russia-energy-crisis-fuel-price-eu-report,‘Must ban now’ Russia earns millions from EU in sky high fossil fuel prices - damning data,"After the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, western countries scrambled to hurt Russia’s economy with sanctions against energy and fuel imports. However, despite the sanctions, Russia has earned €158billion (£136.952billion) from fossil fuel exports after six months of war with Ukraine. A report from the Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) said Russia has benefited from record high prices, partially increased because of sanctions. They said: “The surge in fossil fuel prices means that Russia's current revenues are well above those of previous years despite reductions in export volumes.” Gas prices have soared to historic levels in Europe while oil prices rose sharply at the start of the war before falling back more recently, the report added. It then calculated that fuel sales added “€43billion (£37.274billion) to the Russian federal budget, helping to finance war crimes in Ukraine”. These figures were estimated for the first six months of the war following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, from February 24 to August 24. Over the six month period, CREA estimated the largest importer of Russian fossil fuels was the EU, with a value of €85.1billion (£73.777billion). The EU has decided on a progressive embargo on its imports of oil and oil products, and also stopped buying Russian coal. However, the EU is heavily dependent on Russian gas, with sanctions not including the fuel as of writing despite multiple attempts to introduce measures. However, the CREA believes the EU coal embargo, which was implemented on August 10, has paid off with Russian exports since falling to their lowest level since the invasion of Ukraine. In a scathing assessment of the EU’s measures, CREA believes ""stronger"" rules need to be put in place to prevent Russian oil from entering markets where it is supposed to be banned. The report held western sanctions are now too easily circumvented, adding: “The EU should ban the use of European ships and ports for the transport of Russian oil to third countries.” The UK was also called upon to ban the involvement of its insurance sector in such international shipments. It comes as EU energy ministers have clashed over introducing a price cap on Russian gas, despite emergency talks. Royal Family LIVE: William and Kate speak out over new titles Queen Elizabeth's funeral plan set in place for decades 'Your last great journey' Charles emotional message to Queen Speaking after talks in Brussels in response to surging gas and electricity prices, EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson said “nothing is decided” on proposals to curb Russia’s income. She has defended the cap plan as reasonable, suggesting “the context of this measure is that Russia is gaining huge profits by manipulating and limiting, artificially, supply to drive up prices”, and adding “the cap would reduce these profits”. Countries which import large volumes of gas from Russia, such as Hungary, Slovakia and Austria, have spoken out against the cap proposal because they fear the Kremlin would halt all gas flows and plunge their countries into recession as a result. Hungarian foreign minister Péter Szijjártó, who attended the meeting, said: “If price restrictions were to be imposed exclusively on Russian gas, that would evidently lead to an immediate cut-off in Russian gas supplies. It does not take a Nobel Prize to recognise that.” Vladimir Putin blasted proposals to cap prices on Russian gas as “stupid”, and threatened to make Europe “freeze” this winter if such a measure is agreed. On Monday, the Kremlin said Russia will not resume in full its gas supplies to Europe until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, blamed sanctions “introduced against our country by western countries including Germany and the UK” for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. He added, according to Interfax news agency: “Other reasons that would cause problems with the pumping don’t exist.” Mr Peskov also said Russia’s full resumption of gas supplies via Nord Stream 1 was “undoubtedly” dependent on whether the west would lift its sanctions on Moscow. The spokesman said: “It is these sanctions imposed by the western states that have brought the situation to what we see now.” Additional reporting by Maria Ortega"

2022-09-09,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666562/biden-russia-attack-russian-weapon-deepfakes-spt,Biden faces lightning attack from ‘gamechanger’ Russian weapon: ‘Major threat!’,"The US President has been put on notice over Russia’s use of deepfakes, an increasingly sophisticated form of media that uses artificial intelligence (AI). The pioneering technology can be used to synthetically alter audio and video to create fake images that appear highly realistic. Deepfakes have been used for light-hearted purposes, such as producing a lifelike version of the actor Tom Cruise. However, they also have more sinister uses, including the creation of a video showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky surrendering during the Ukraine war. Leading deepfakes expert Nina Schick described the technology as a “game-changing” human advancement. In a recent interview with CBS’ ‘60 Minutes’ podcast, she said: “The fact that AI can now be used to make images and video that are fake that look hyper-realistic, I thought, well, from a disinformation perspective, this is a game changer.” The political scientist and technology consultant first came across deepfakes when she was researching Russia’s use of disinformation in elections. She added: “It is without a doubt one of the most important revolutions in the future of human communication and perception. “I would say it is analogous to the birth of the Internet.” The expert, who wrote the 2020 book ‘Deepfakes’, explained that she was looking at deepfakes “from the perspective of disinformation and manipulation in the context of elections”. Although experts are fearful of countries like Russia using deepfakes to sway voters, so far there is no evidence to suggest that the technology has influenced a US election. However, that has not stopped American intelligence chiefs warning of Russia’s use of deepfakes. In March 2021, FBI warned that “Russian [and] Chinese… actors are using synthetic profile images” to construct fake journalists and other public figures. In June of this year, the FBI’s Internet crime complaint arm then issued a fresh deepfakes warning. It reported an “increase in complaints reporting the use of deepfakes and stolen personally identifiable information”. The US intelligence agency claimed that deepfakes were being used to “apply for a variety of remote work and work-at-home positions”. The FBI said: “Deepfakes include a video, an image, or recording convincingly altered and manipulated to misrepresent someone as doing or saying something that was not actually done or said.” Actors were using the technology to try to impersonate job applicants’ specific facial expressions and actions, the FBI warned. It added: “Complaints report the use of voice spoofing, or potentially voice deepfakes, during online interviews of the potential applicants. “In these interviews, the actions and lip movement of the person seen interviewed on-camera do not completely coordinate with the audio of the person speaking. “At times, actions such as coughing, sneezing, or other auditory actions are not aligned with what is presented visually.” As well as deepfakes’ impact on individuals, the technology could also be used in a lightning attack to harm the markets, according to US Republican Senator Ben Sasse. He said: “When you think about the catastrophic potential to public trust and to markets that could come from deepfake attacks, are we organised in a way that we could possibly respond fast enough?” His warning, which came during a US hearing, was echoed by Dan Coats, the former US Director of National Intelligence. He said: “We clearly need to be more agile. It poses a major threat to the US and something that the intelligence community needs to be restructured to address.”"
2022-09-09,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666856/Putin-Russia-Ukraine-invasion-war-Kharkiv-counter-offensive-river-crossing-equipment-vn,Putin humiliated as three tanks submerged in panicked Kharkiv river crossing bid - VIDEO,"Moscow has been humiliated after an atmosphere of panic broke out among Russian troops in the Kharkiv region. The Kremlin’s forces are understood to have fled across a river as Ukraine’s counter-offensive operation advanced on Kharkiv. New video footage from Ukraine has revealed the retreating Russian troops abandoned at least three military vehicles in the water, with additional artillery supplies dumped along the banks of the river. A video, believed to be recorded by Ukrainian soldiers who had moved in on the invader’s bases around Kharkiv, has exposed the aftermath of Russia’s frantic withdrawal. In the recording, three Russian BMPs, a model of infantry fighting vehicle, are shown submerged in the water, one leaning awkwardly against the edge of the opposite bank. At least one clearly bears the Kremlin ‘Z’ symbol in support of President Putin’s “special military operation,” confirming the stranded vehicles as Russian equipment. The banks of the river are littered with other military supplies, including belts of ammunition and what appears to be a collection of rockets. The news of the panicked Russian retreat in Kharkiv comes as President Zelensky’s forces have advanced a series of counter-offensives across Ukraine. Intelligence reports confirmed Ukraine had begun campaigns to advance on Russian settlements in the Kharkiv, Kherson, and the Donbas regions. The string of coordinated missions has strained the Kremlin’s military organisation as Russian forces are under pressure from advancing Ukrainian troops in the north, east, and south. The concurrent threats to Russian-occupied areas spread across 500km and are set to test the Kremlin’s ability to coordinate military forces as leaders must urgently decide where to reallocate soldiers. President Zelensky has claimed operations to reclaim Kremin-controlled regions have already proved successful. Speaking on Thursday, the Ukrainian leader said: “In total, more than a thousand square kilometres of our territory have been liberated since the beginning of September.” He added: “I am grateful to everyone who made it happen, I am grateful to the army, intelligence officers, and special services for every Ukraine's flag that has been hoisted in these days.” President Zelensky has declined to name the regions that have been returned to Ukrainian control, although he has detailed “good news” from the operation in Kharkiv, suggesting there have been particular advancements in this area. The decision of Putin’s forces to abandon equipment as they fled Kharkiv comes as the Russian army is said to be suffering from a munitions crisis. Moscow’s army is confirmed to have lost over 1,000 infantry fighting vehicles since the conflict began, although the actual number is expected to be far higher as reports continue to emerge. The UK Ministry of Defence has confirmed: “Russia is suffering from shortages of munitions, vehicles, and personnel.” By comparison, Ukraine continues to be bolstered by international military aid, most recently the pledge of additional supplies from America after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Kyiv."
2022-09-09,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666906/horror-images-Russian-incendiary-attack-on-Ukraine-Donetsk-vn,Horror images emerge of Russian incendiary munitions raining down over Ukraine,"In footage released on social media, the incendiary rounds, believed to be white phosphorus, can be seen raining down in bright light against the night sky. The munitions burn at 1,500 degrees and are not supposed to be used on humans due to their tortuous effect on human flesh. Designed to be used against petrol dumps and ammo storage, since they can burn through metal, their use is banned by the Geneva convention. It is not the first time Russia have used this method of attack despite its illegality; footage released several months ago showed Putin’s forces using these munitions on the Mariupol steel plant in an attempt to force the remaining Ukrainian Azov battalion out. Hundreds of small rounds of the incendiary munitions were captured on video pouring down onto the area in Donetsk. As the munitions hit the ground, burning flames erupted across the area in terrifying scenes. It is believed the attack was carried out against Ukrainian Army positions in the south of the Donbas, where the Donetsk Oblast is located. One user on Reddit, commenting on the attack, described it as “f***cking sickening”. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address on Thursday that Ukrainian forces had “liberated dozens of settlements” and reclaimed 1,000 square kilometres (385 square miles) of territory in the east and south since September 1. Mr Zelensky also posted a video in which Ukrainian soldiers said they had captured the eastern town of Balakliya near Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine. Video posted to a Ukrainian news aggregator appeared to show the Russians had left behind trucks, artillery, and ammunition. Vitaly Ganchev, a pro-Russian official, told Russian state television that Russian forces had fought off a Ukrainian attempt to encircle and capture Balakliya, which he said remained in Russian hands. Earlier, Ukrainian Brigadier General Oleksiy Gromov said troops had advanced up to 50 km (30 miles) behind Russian lines and recaptured more than 20 villages in the Kharkiv region. The Ukrainian military said early on Friday Russian forces were trying to evacuate wounded personnel and damaged military equipment in the areas of Vilkhuvatka village, southwest of Kharkiv, and Borodyansky, to the southeast. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Ukrainian forces were making progress and he pledged US support for “as long as it takes”. “We did get a comprehensive update on the counteroffensive and, again, it's very early but we're seeing clear and real progress on the ground, particularly around Kherson, but also some interesting developments in the Donbas in the east,” Mr Blinken told reporters before leaving Kyiv. If the gains are confirmed and held, they would be a serious blow for Russia, which Western intelligence services say has suffered huge casualties. The gains would also represent a big boost for Ukraine, which is keen to show its Western backers that it can turn the tide in the conflict and deserves more of their support. This week's surprise counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region saw Ukrainian forces make a sudden and deep thrust behind Russian lines. Ukraine has for weeks been talking about a big counteroffensive in the south around Kherson. Western military analysts believe Russia may have left itself exposed in other areas as it rushed to reinforce the south. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych underscored that possibility."

""It is especially amusing that Russian self-propelled guns are outlined with boastful inscriptions 'To Kyiv' and 'Crimea is ours',"" Ukrainian 25th Airborne Brigade, who posted the video, said in a Telegram post. Ukrainian soldiers also claim to have captured an entire battery. The video was filmed 20km from the previous frontline. The brigade added: ""The offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was so swift that even long-range artillery, which was stationed 20 kilometres from the front line, was captured in its positions."" Ukrainian forces are conducting a successful counteroffensive in the southern Kherson region and the north-eastern Kharkiv region in a military effort to retake Russian-controlled territories. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says Ukrainian troops have recaptured more than 1,000 square kilometres of territory over the last week. ""Our heroes have already liberated dozens of settlements. And today this movement continued, there are new results,"" President Zelensky said in a nightly address."" ""In total, more than a thousand square kilometres of our territory have been liberated since 1 September."" Kharkiv cities like Balakliya were recaptured by Ukrainian soldiers, with footage emerging of residents welcoming soldiers. Residents can be seen hugging soldiers and some crying in a video shared by Ukrainian journalist Nataliya Gumenyuk. Ms Gumenyuk said in the tweet: ""Ladies greet soldiers in liberated Balakliya after 6 months of occupation. ‘Boys, we have some pancakes left, would you like?’ ‘A bit later, please, better still hide, shelling is still possible'. I can watch endlessly"" Reacting to another video of Balakliya residents, Igor Sushko, who has been translating Russian and Ukrainian content into English since the start of the war, said: ""Bittersweet to watch the videos of residents' reactions to the Ukrainian soldiers liberating cities from Putin's fascist regime. This is #Balakliya near #Kharkiv."" President Zelensky acknowledged $675million in military aid announced by the United States on Thursday as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made an unannounced visit in Kyiv. Secretary Blinken tweeted: ""Stay strong, Kyiv. I leave with redoubled respect for your ferocity, your courage, and your confidence that Ukraine will prevail."" President Zelensky also appreciated the $1 billion Ukraine is set to receive from a package put together by several European countries. ""Each of these steps of our partners has a real impact on the strength of our state and the whole of Europe in defence against Russian terror,"" he said."

To avoid further attacks around the Ukrainian plant and the potential spread of lethal radiation, the United Nations have suggested sending peacekeepers. Major General Chip Chapman warns that ""depending on where the wind blows"", radiation could reach NATO territory and escalate into a full-blown military response against Russia. He told Times Radio: ""We know that security pillars have all been compromised to an extent at the nuclear power plant. ""But there isn’t a big radiation element at the moment. ""And of course, if it does leak then from a NATO perspective, depending on where the wind blows, that could be seen as an article 5 act of war if NATO chose to see it."" According to Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute, radioactive particles from the Zaporizhzhia could affect EU countries – who are all part of the NATO alliance. Countries like Belarus, Lithuania, Estonia, Letonia, Poland, Romania, Moldova, Hungary, and Slovakia could see radiation spread, according to the Institute’s simulation conducted under the meteorological conditions of August 15-18, 2022. ""Pending the end of the conflict and re-establishment of stable conditions there is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means,"" a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) warned. The report also said the agency is ""still gravely concerned about the situation"" at the plant after ""witnessing shelling in the vicinity"" of the plant, ""in particular on September 3 when the team was instructed to evacuate the ground level of the Administrative Building."" When asked what else the international community can do to help protect the Ukrainian staff working at the plant, General Chip Chapman said: ""Well, not really. ""Because obviously, the two UN inspectors are still there after the IAEA did their formal and larger inspection"", he said, adding the Russian shelling on the plant is part of ""Putin's ploy - a deterrence by fear."" ""And of course, it should be that the moral authority of the UN is the thing which gets Russia to disengage with that,"" Mr Chapman said ""But as we well know, the UN is largely a forum where the interests of the larger, more dominant powers are in the fall and other states coalesce around their interests as we’ve seen, for example, in bizarre states like Syria and North Korea, acknowledging the new form of the Donetsk and Luhansk at being independent states as so-called form their perspective."" To stave off a Chernobyl-style nuclear disaster, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for a demilitarised zone around the plant that would involve the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops. The IAEA’s director general Rafael Mariano Grossi, who led an inspection of the Zahparizhzhia nuclear plant warned of the potential of an imminent nuclear disaster. He said: ""We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place. ""This is why in our report, we are proposing the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone limited to the perimeter and the plant itself,"" Mr Grossi added."

The news comes as the latest update to Ukraine's renewed counter-offensive which has seen a series of coordinated missions launched across the country to reclaim territories under the control of Moscow’s invaders. Ukrainian servicemen were filmed standing on a Russian flag, with the Ukrainian flag raised in the background, as they declared the liberation of the city. A video of the announcement has been published on social media by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence. In the footage, Ukrainian soldiers addressed their leader as they reported: “Mr President, Mr Commander in Chief, Balakliya is taken under control. “The order has been completed. Glory to Ukraine!” One serviceman reported the advancement while standing upon a Russian flag as two fellow soldiers kept the flag pinned to the ground with their boots. Illia Ponomarenko, the defence and security reporter for the Kyiv Independent, released additional footage from Balakliya. His video showed a steady flow of Ukrainian military vehicles entering the city, each proudly displaying a Ukrainian flag. The military operations in Kharkiv have been accompanied by the simultaneous advancement of Ukrainian troops in the Kherson and Donbas regions. The counter-offensive has placed Russian military commanders under pressure to decide where to reallocate troops as the conflict continues to evolve. In an address on Thursday evening, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported more than 1,000 kilometres of Ukrainian territory had been recaptured from Russian invaders. President Zelensky commented on “good news” within the Kharkiv region, but declined to reveal specifically which areas had been reclaimed as the mission remains in action. A statement from the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces confirmed the victory in Balakliya and celebrated the success of President Zelensky’s troops. “The flag of Ukraine is in a free Ukrainian city under a free Ukrainian sky!” Ukrainian Brigadier General Oleksiy Gromov reported the liberation of “more than 20 villages” in the Kharkiv region, understood to stretch across a distance of 50 kilometres. A publication from the US-based Institute for the Study of War suggested the Russian forces in Kharkiv had suffered territorial losses as Kremlin military commanders had repeated an earlier mistake in the conflict. The report claimed the Russian Ministry of Defence had again overlooked important intelligence information before reallocating troops to new locations, failing to recognise the Ukrainian advancements on Kharkiv and leaving Russian occupying battalions undermanned. The think tank predicted Ukrainian troops would now move to capture Kupyansk in the coming days and, if successful, would severely impede Russian lines of communication around Izyum, another city in Kharkiv."

General Ben Hodges has expressed this belief as optimism grows that Kyiv’s forces are gaining the upper hand in the conflict with Russia. Putin’s army invaded Ukraine over six months ago, however, the Russian army has withdrawn from their previous frontline near Kyiv and their advance in the Donbas region has also stalled. President Zelensky’s men have successfully attacked supply lines to the city of Kherson in the south, while they have also gained ground in the Kharkiv region. General Hodges told Newsweek: “The Ukrainians saved their country. “They've set the conditions where they can restore full sovereignty, to include Crimea, I think, within the next year. “Here we are, half a year after the start of the full scale Russian invasion, and the supposed second-best army in the world is now the second-best army in Ukraine. “After all this time, Russia still controls less than 20 percent of Ukraine's territory, and their ability to conduct further offensive operations has been all but exhausted.” President Zelensky has often urged the West to do more to aid his country by providing weapons and tightening sanctions against Moscow. General Hodges echoed this sentiment, adding: “There needs to be a declaration that we want Ukraine to win, that we want it to get all of its territory back, that we want it to be able to defend itself in the future, and that we're going to do everything necessary to help them do that.” It remains unclear exactly how Ukraine plans to achieve these goals, especially given that control of Crimea was seized by the Russians back in 2014. However General Hodges argued that this is exactly how it should be to keep military secrets safe from the other side. He continued: “We shouldn't publicly know what [Ukraine’s] needs are, because you never want the enemy to know what your capabilities are and what your shortfalls are. “But I am 100 percent sure that the US Department of Defence and National Security Council know exactly what Ukraine needs, that the Ukrainians have told them that.” Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Honcharenko told Newsweek: “Next year will be the decisive year of this war. “With the help of the free world, Ukraine has an opportunity to win.”"

Brigadier General Oleksiy Gromov said at a briefing that Ukrainian armed forces had advanced up to 50km (31 miles) into Russian lines and that “the total amount of territory returned to Ukrainian control in the Kharkiv and Pivdennyi Buh directions stands at more than 700 sq km”. He told a news conference: “Our units in separate areas advanced from two to several dozen kilometres deep into the enemy's defences. A number of settlements were liberated [from the Russian army].” The development came as Antony Blinken, the US Secretary of State, unveiled a further £2.4billion in military aid during a surprise visit to Kyiv. Mr Blinken, who held talks with Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, said the Ukrainians were making progress but did not give further details. He told reporters: “It's very early, but we are seeing clear and real progress on the ground, particularly in the area around Kherson, but also some interesting developments in the Donbas in the east.” The latest American aid package includes £584million ($675million) in arms, ammunition and supplies and another $1billion in longer-term loans and grants for Ukraine to buy more US equipment. On Thursday, Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Kyiv has retaken more than 1,000 sq km (390 sq miles) of territory and over 20 villages, as its troops wage a counteroffensive in the south and the east of the country. Mr Zelensky also released a video late on Thursday in which Ukrainian soldiers said they had taken the key eastern town of Balakliya, which has a population of 27,000 people. The US Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which follows the fighting in detail, said the Ukraine counterattack in the east drove Russian forces back to the north side of the Siverskyi Donets and Serednya Balalaika rivers and that Kyiv had retaken 400 sq km of territory in the east of the Kharkiv region. On Wednesday night, Mr Zelensky said: “This week we have good news from the Kharkiv region” but cautioned that “now is not the time to name the settlements to which the Ukrainian flag has returned.” The Telegraph reported that Alexander Kots, a correspondent for the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda with close ties to the military, wrote on his personal Telegram channel that the Ukrainians had advanced “in places to 30 kilometres” (18 miles) by Thursday morning. He denied that the front had collapsed, and said Russian reinforcements had succeeded in holding up the Ukrainian advance in several places. He wrote: “The situation is serious, but there could have been a disaster by morning and there wasn’t.” Footage shared on pro-Ukrainian blogs on Thursday suggested the Ukrainians have massed fast-moving armoured formations and are complementing tanks with mechanised infantry to achieve breakthroughs deep in the Russian rear. In one video, a mixed Ukrainian and foreign volunteer unit fired heavy machine guns from armoured jeeps as they charged at high speed towards enemy positions."

On Wednesday evening, the Smolninsky council adopted a petition stating that Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine had caused tremendous loss of life, strengthened NATO and had led to economic difficulties in Russia. It said: “Putin’s actions present a threat to Russia’s security. He needs to be removed.” They referred to the war using the Kremlin’s term “special military operation”, as following the invasion a censorship law was passed by Moscow making the use of the word “war” in relation to the conflict illegal. This will come as a bitter personal blow to Putin, as he grew up in Smolninsky and began his political career in St Petersburg. One of the councillors, Nikita Yurefev, explained the petition was designed to give voice to those Russians who are against the military action but are too afraid to speak up. He told The Telegraph: “People are very anxious about what’s going on. “We’ve decided to appeal to a different audience, using the arguments that we have heard so that maybe someone will think about it and see that the president’s stated goals (in Ukraine) have completely failed.” The council has argued that the war has failed in at least one of its supposed objectives, which was to stop NATO expanding eastwards. READ MORE: Since the invasion the previously neutral states of Sweden and Finland have applied for NATO membership and been accepted. Mr Yurefev added there is not much hope their petition will change much, but they want to send a message to fellow anti-war Russians. He said: “My inbox is filled with messages of gratitude and support: it shows that it’s wrong to think that everyone in Russia supports Putin and the special military operation. “This petition is for the people to see that there are many people who are against it, and they’re not alone.” In July Moscow councilman Alexei Gorinov was sentenced to seven years in prison for a speech in which he condemned the war and the slaughter of Ukrainian children. However Mr Yurefev believes he will be safe from such persecution as the word “war” is not used in their petition. He added: “We’re trying to use all legal means at our disposal. “I don’t think it’s dangerous. We aren’t breaking the law in any way.”"

She said that considerable evidence reveals thousands of children have been separated from their families or removed from orphanages. According to US information, “more than 1,800 children were transferred from Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine to Russia” just in July, she said. She told the meeting: “There is mounting and credible evidence that those considered threatening to Russian control because of perceived pro-Ukrainian leanings are ‘disappeared’ or further detained. “Thousands of unaccompanied children, either separated from their families or removed from orphanages, had been taken to Russia, 1,800 in July alone.” Thomas-Greenfield said the estimates indicate thousands of children have been subject to filtration, “some separated from their families and taken from orphanages before being put up for adoption in Russia”. The UN says 6.9 million people have been displaced by the war, with more renewed fighting in the south and in the eastern Kharkiv region. Ukrainian troops have recaptured more than 270 square miles of territory in the south and in the eastern Kharkiv region, Brigadier General Oleksiy Gromov said at a briefing today, advancing 30 miles into the Russian line and retaking at least 20 villages. Ukraine declined earlier to disclose exact details so as not to compromise the operation. According to a news report by The Times, a senior UN official described as “credible” allegations of “forced transfers of unaccompanied children to Russian occupied territory” or to Russia. Ilze Brands Kehris, the assistant secretary-general for human rights, said: “We are concerned that the Russian authorities have adopted a simplified procedure to grant Russian citizenship to children without parental care, and that these children would be eligible for adoption by Russian families. “Moreover, we are particularly concerned that the announced plans of the Russian authorities to allow the movement of children from Ukraine to families in the Russian Federation do not appear to include steps for family reunification or in other ways ensure respect for the principle of the best interests of the child.” Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces also appear to have recaptured the town of Balakliya, in the northeast Kharkiv region, after a counteroffensive caught the occupying Russian army by surprise. Social media videos showed Ukrainian troops and military vehicles in the centre of the town, which was seized by Russia early in the war. Ukrainian flags were also hoisted on several buildings, as well as in a central square. Another video showed locals greeting Ukrainian soldiers after reports of heavy street-to-street fighting. Kyiv has not commented."

It is hoped the latest offensive will be used as a springboard for an offensive on the occupied city of Izyum. Yesterday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the city of Balakliya had been liberated from Russian control. In video footage, Ukrainian troops were captured pulling a Russian flag down from a radio tower in the small town of Yasynuvate (not to be confused with the Donetsk city) and replacing it with the Ukrainian flag. The tower sits some 50km to the east of Balakliya, suggesting Zelensky’s men have penetrated far into Russian occupied territory, and look to cut troops in the north off from their stronghold in the south. Russian forces have complete control over the sympathetic Luhansk and Donetsk regions to the east, but have struggled to assert control over the north of the country. After using Western-supplied missiles to effectively cripple the Russian military operation in the south, forcing Vladimir Putin to move beleaguered soldiers to the front between Kherson and Mykolaiv. But Ukraine’s armed forces instead spent the past few days launching counter-attacks in the north, perhaps in an effort to surprise the enemy. The liberation of Balakliya has strategic as well as symbolic significance. According to Ukraine’s Centre for Strategic Communications (Stratcom), it “creates an opportunity to develop an offensive on Izyum and Kupyansk”, a town on the River Oskil. All are “important logistical centres” for the Russian army, as they are used as vital staging posts for the supply of military equipment to the front line. It is hoped that the Ukrainian armed forces’ latest assault will “complicate Russian logistics and expose their rear”. Stratcom added: “It will be difficult to organise alternative supply routes due to the peculiarities of the area.” Attention now turns to the captured city of Izyum, where Russian troops are in danger of being encircled. Stratcom said access to the Oskil reservoir on the other side of the river with the same name “will actually cut off the enemy group in Izyum from the rear. “The Russian military will be surrounded.” The raising of the Ukrainian flag over the radio tower in Yasynuvate shows how far the defending forces have been able to push behind enemy lines. Maps published by news outlet Visegrad24 show it would provide a corridor from Balakliya nearly to the western banks of the River Oskil. Mr Zelensky said on Thursday that his military had retaken more than 1,000 square kilometres of territory since the beginning of September. He commented: “As part of ongoing defence operations, our heroes have already liberated dozens of settlements. “And today this movement continued; there are new results.”"

Austin announced the arms package at a meeting with dozens of fellow ministers at the US air base in Ramstein, Germany. The package includes howitzers, ammunition, Humvee vehicles, armoured ambulances and anti-tank systems. The Biden administration said it had set aside £1.7bn in long-term assistance for Ukraine and 18 of its neighbours, including both Nato members and non-members “most potentially at risk from future Russian aggression”. The State Department said about £850million of aid would go to Ukraine and the rest would be divided among Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. It would help those countries “deter and defend against emergent threats to their sovereignty and territorial integrity” by enhancing their military integration with Nato and countering “Russian influence and aggression”. The department added: “This assistance demonstrates yet again our unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s future as a democratic, sovereign, and independent state, as well as the security of allies and partners across the region.” US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken arrived in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Thursday, as his colleague urged Ukraine’s allies to commit to supporting the country for as long as necessary and be prepared to adapt the type of support offered. In Kyiv, Mr Blinken said that the aid would be delivered at a “pivotal” moment during the war, with Ukrainian operations against Russian forces “proving effective”. He also vowed that the US and its allies would “continue to exert that pressure until the aggression ceases and Ukraine is fully sovereign and independent”. In Washington, US President Joe Biden held a call with a number of US allies - including UK Prime Minister Liz Truss and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz - in which they reiterated their collective support for Ukraine. On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country’s military had recently carried out successful attacks against Russian forces which control large areas of Ukraine in the south and the east - and retaken settlements near the north-eastern city of Kharkiv. While in Kyiv, Mr Blinken received a briefing from Ukrainian officials on the counter-offensive. He did not give details but both Ukrainian and pro-Russian officials report fighting around Balakleya, 60km (38 miles) south-east of Kharkiv. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says there are signs Ukraine is making real military progress. Western-supplied long-range artillery and rockets are helping to target Russian supply lines and command centres. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied the reverses, saying: “We have not lost anything and will not lose anything.” Russia says it is fighting neo-Nazis in Ukraine, a claim derided by Western powers,and that it is threatened by the Nato alliance’s strong relations with Ukraine."

The soldiers previously ruled out fighting outside the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), including in the neighbouring Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). Because of dwindling resources and poor living conditions, the soldiers are now rebelling against Vladimir Putin’s orders. A soldier shouted to his commander: ""The officership have all been f****** looters since day one. ""They brought things here by truck. Who are you? Capitan from Luhansk? ""You didn’t know that?! The truck used to come here with the appliances! And we haven’t had a vacation not once in seven months!"" The Luhansk soldier erupted: ""[Unclear] should be shot. All of them from the combats… [unclear] ... How many new cars the f****** brought here. Look what we drive. ""Why aren’t you driving that? Let’s go get yourself Lanos. F****** wiseacre!"" The Luhansk soldiers shouted: ""We’re not going anywhere else. You can f****** shoot us. ""Call the prosecutor’s office in Russia. Call them and let them come. Let them come. We won’t move from here."" The troops’ refusal to wage the war deals another blow to Vladimir Putin whose forces have suffered major losses in the Kharkiv region. In a surprise counteroffensive, Ukrainian troops have advanced almost 31 miles into Russian-controlled territory, the military’s General Staff said, with Moscow’s armies retreating. ""Some enemy units suffered significant losses,"" the military’s General Staff said in a war update. Ukraine is retaking cities in the Kherson region that fell under Russian occupation in the early days of the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a video on his social media accounts to praise soldiers for retaking the Kharkiv city of Balakliia. ""The order is fulfilled. Russian occupational troops have withdrawn,"" one of the soldiers says in the video, as they stand above a building, alongside the Ukrainian flag."

While this left the plant without an outside source of electricity, it had been sourcing its power for its own safety systems from the last remaining reactor still intact. But on Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency warned that shelling in the nearby city of Enerhodar where the plant is operated from, has caused a blackout and sent safety concerns soaring. The IAEA chief Rafael Grossi called for the shelling at the plant to stop immediately, as well as shelling in the nearby city of Enerhodar. The Russian envoy to the IAEA also supported the appeal. Mr Grossi, responding to the increasingly precarious situation there, said in a statement: ""This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious. Enerhodar has gone dark. The power plant has no offsite power. And we have seen that once infrastructure is repaired, it is damaged once again. ""I therefore urgently call for the immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area."" He added: ""Only this will ensure the safety and security of operating staff and allow the durable restoration of power to Enerhodar and to the power plant. Mr Grossi also said that the situation is ""completely unacceptable"" and that ""it cannot stand"". Mikhail Ulyanov said on Twitter: ""We fully support the appeal and demand of the IAEA Director General that shelling of the town of Enerhodar and the ZNPP must stop immediately."" The shelling reportedly destroyed power infrastructure in the city of Enerhodar, where the plant is operated from, as the threat to the site continues to grow. The IAEA has now warned that there is a significant risk of an impact on the availability of essential staff to carry on safely operating the plant. Both sides have blamed the shelling, which has hit the plant and surrounding areas repeatedly amid the conflict, on each other. But its occupation by Russian forces continues to be a huge concern to the plant's safety. Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, Ukraine's nuclear operator, said: “Only the withdrawal of the Russians from the plant and the creation of a security zone around it can normalize the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Only then will the world be able to exhale."" While shelling has sparked concerns for the plant, Mr Kotin has previously said that it “can be stopped completely” at any moment, with the only power source left to back it up being a diesel generator. Mr Kotin has also previously said that shelling at the site has ramped up the risk of nuclear and radiation safety. He said: ""The situation (at the plant) is very bad now and it is worsening all the time. Over the last three weeks, there's been an increase of shelling at the site. The actions from Russia increase the danger to nuclear and radiation safety onsite. Also, the conditions of our staff there are really decreasing."" This also comes amid reports that the Ukrainian staff detained at the plant have been tortured by the Russian forces that are occupying it. Mr Kotin said: ""They [the Russians] captured about 1,100 personnel from the site, and they kept them in their facilities, the captured facilities and police facilities in the (nearby) town of Enerhodar. ""One person was killed, another person was heavily wounded. They're trying to push on them to accept the Russian world. All kinds of psychological pushes on them.""

2022-09-09,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666953/putin-war-Ukraine-russia-commander-captured-Lieutenant-General-Andrei-Sychevoi,Putin nightmare: Speculation Russian officer is 'most senior captured since WW2',"Lieutenant General Andrei Sychevoi may have been detained as Ukraine continues its fightback against Russia, according to local media sources in Ukraine. He is thought to be the most senior Russian officer to be captured since World War 2. Images and videos shared to Telegram and social media site Twitter purportedly show Lieutenant General Andrei Sychevoi among a group of Russian troops handcuffed on their knees and being interrogated by Ukrainian soldiers The kneeling man, who bears a striking resemblance to Lieutenant General Andrei Sychevoi, is wearing a standard-issue Russian army camouflage uniform and Lieutenant Colonel rank, without other markers. He is bleeding from a cut on his eyebrow and refuses to answer questions from the troops. One social media claimed they were captured near Balakliya, in the Kharkiv region. His capture has not been confirmed. Chuck Pfarrer, former SEAL Team Six Squadron Leader, posted on Twitter: “Yesterday, videos featured a RU officer captured on the Kharkiv front. “He was assumed to be a local commander - he was, in fact, Lieutenant General Andrei Sychevoi, General in command RU’s ‘West’ Group. “Sychevoi is the most senior Russian officer captured since WWII.” Nexta TV tweeted: ""It seems that the Armed Forces of Ukraine captured not the usual 'lieutenant colonel', but the commander of the 'West' grouping, Colonel General Andrey Sychevoi.” In its daily military update on September 9, the Kyiv Post said infantrymen had ""likely"" captured Sychevoi, citing circulating video and independent Ukrainian media sources. The Lviv Journal tweeted: “Time will tell if it's Gen. Andrei Sychevoi that appears in the video.” Since Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine back in February, Putin has seen a number of high-profile figures abandon him. He has also lost 63 top-ranking Russian officials since the war in Ukraine began - including three of his colonels in a single day. Meanwhile, the Russian strongman has also been delivered a blow on the frontlines. Swiftly advancing Ukrainian troops were down on the main railway supplying Russian forces in the east on Friday, after the collapse of a section of Russia's front line caused the most dramatic shift in the war's momentum since its early weeks. In a video address, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian troops had ""liberated dozens of settlements"" and reclaimed more than 385 square miles of territory in the east and south in the past week. President Zelensky posted a video in which Ukrainian soldiers said they had captured the eastern town of Balakliia, which lies along a stretch of front south of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. The Ukrainian military said it had advanced nearly 50 km through that front after an assault, which appeared to take the Russians by surprise. That would make it by far the fastest advance by either side in the war since Russia was forced to abandon its disastrous assault on the capital Kyiv in March. Moscow has so far offered no official response to the reports of the breakthrough on the Kharkiv front. Since Russia's forces were defeated near Kyiv in March, Moscow has waged a relentless war of attrition, using its firepower advantage to press slow advances by bombarding towns and villages. But that tactic depends on tonnes of ammunition a day reaching the front line by train from western Russia. Until now, Russia had successfully fended off all attempts by Ukraine to cut off the train line. The Ukrainian general staff said early on Friday retreating Russian forces were trying to evacuate wounded personnel and damaged military equipment. In a statement, they said: ""Thanks to skilful and coordinated actions, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, with the support of the local population, advanced almost 50 km in three days."" Ukraine has been using new Western-supplied artillery and rockets there to hit Russian rear positions, with the aim of trapping thousands of Putin’s troops on the west bank of the wide Dnipro River and cutting them off from supplies."
2022-09-09,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1667016/Russia-news-ukraine-soldier-intercepted-phone-call-wife-commander,Russian tank driver tells wife he wants to 'get rid' of commander in intercepted call,"According to a new intercepted conversation, released by the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine’s Defense Ministry, Vladimir Putin’s men are dissatisfied with the indifference and incompetence of their leaders. The intercepted conversation, which the ministry shared on Telegram yesterday, captures the moment a Russian tank soldier told his wife about how his comrades-in-arms were injured due to a Ukrainian drone dropping a grenade. The soldier adds that his comrades were left without their commander because he was hiding in a basement. One of the soldiers involved was a mechanic, while another acted as a tank commander and gunner. The soldier on the phone also complained about the state of the tank. He said it was no longer able to fire because a shell had got stuck in its gun barrel. He added he was worried that the shell may explode and draw the attention of Ukrainian artillery. The Russian serviceman also admitted that he would probably be sent to the front line, but neither he nor his colleagues wanted to go there. He said: “Well, in short, everyone wants to get rid of the commander, the whole battalion. All the crews (want to) get rid of him, all the companies, because he’s stupid, he’s an artilleryman, he’s not a tankman, and he doesn’t care about the men.” According to the soldier the commander does not care about the wounded or the dead. The commander also did not report the losses to headquarters, the soldier said. The Ukrainian counter-offensive continues. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian army has kept hold of the strategically significant Antoniviskyi bridge and other crossings along the Dnipro River in the Kherson region. The city of Kherson and its surrounding areas have become the site of the most intense fighting in recent weeks for its importance to Russia solidifying its grip on southern parts of Ukraine. By maintaining control of the river crossings, Ukrainian troops are able to stem the flow of supplies to Putin’s forces. A counter-offensive has also been launched in the Kharkiv region. Most recently, the occupying administration in the town of Kupiansk in the region has announced an “evacuation”. Its head, Vitaliy Ganchev, said in a video message: ""As of today, the situation in the town of Kupiansk forced us to prepare for an evacuation."" Ukrainian partisans in Russian-occupied areas are also in the process of taking out key targets. Explosives and car bombs have been used to target Russian officials in Kherson, and have been placed at their homes and routes to work, as well as near administrative buildings. A key target the resistance has repeatedly tried to take down has been Vladimir Saldo, the head of the Russian temporary administration in the region. A bounty of 1million hryvanias (just under £24,000) has been placed on the official. His assistant Pavel Slobodchikov, has been shot and killed in his vehicle, while another official Dmytry Savluchenko was killed by a car bomb."
2022-09-08,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1666381/eu-row-russia-gas-vladimir-putin-ursula-von-der-leyen-energy-crisis,EU bust-up erupts: Bloc in chaos as nations fume at VDL’s energy plans to beat Putin,"Earlier this week, Ms von der Leyen announced plans to propose a price cap on Russian gas imports, in a bid to cut the revenues that the European Union sends to Vladimir Putin. The plan, packaged with four other proposals, sent shockwaves across Europe, as many countries were largely taken by surprise by these planned measures. The energy crisis facing Europe has grown more acute after Russia's state-backed energy giant Gazprom “indefinitely” suspended gas supplied through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany work last week. This plan also led to tensions escalating between Russia and the EU, with the Russian President threatening to halt all supplies if they took such a step. The Commission's five proposals for tackling the European energy crisis had “blindsided” member countries, with many of them split over the plans, six diplomats told POLITICO. Aside from setting a price cap on Russian gas, Ms von der Leyen proposed four other “immediate” moves to help curb Europe’s crippling energy crisis. These include mandatory measures to reduce electricity demand, a cap on revenues for companies generating electricity from low-cost sources like wind, a solidarity tax on fossil fuel companies making big profits, and facilitating support for ailing utility companies. Following a meeting of EU ambassadors, only two of the proposals received support from both the EU countries and the Commission. First of these was the plan to provide credit to help utility companies trade on energy exchanges during times of skyrocketing wholesale prices. The second of the popular proposals include plans to tax the profits of inframarginal producers, which are low-cost energy generators like wind and nuclear, that are currently raking in record profits by selling electricity at market prices. Under the Commission’s plans, these ""unexpected profits"" would go towards helping consumers, although EU ambassadors demanded assurances that these profits would stay in the right country. However according to EU diplomats, plans to impose a price cap on Russian gas have been the most contentious measure, which is primarily aimed at punishing Putin financially for the war in Ukraine. The member states reportedly have ""very contradictory views"", one EU diplomat noted, with Germany noting that it is ""sceptical"" about the idea. Meanwhile, Hungary, which is Russia's closest ally in the EU, is against the plan and is supported by Slovakia and at least two other countries. Countries including Italy and Poland want the bloc to cap the price of all natural gas imports, which Brussels has largely opposed so far. Diplomats noted that Hungary has demanded that any energy package needs to be unanimously agreed upon, rather than being approved with majority voting as part of emergency procedures. Meanwhile, Poland has blamed the EU’s Emissions Trading System for causing the price rise, but it faced stiff opposition from Luxembourg, Ireland, Germany, Finland and Sweden. While EU nations broadly agree that cutting electricity demand is important, countries including Bulgaria, Hungary, Greece and Poland have opposed plans to make the cuts mandatory. EU energy ministers are due to hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss how to tackle the energy crisis."
2022-09-08,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666244/russia-gas-putin-revenue-eu-spt,Russia's gas blackmail to backfire as Putin to lose 90 percent of revenue: 'Vindictive',"The EU has announced plans to cap the price of Russian gas just hours after Vladimir Putin rubbished the idea. Brussels and Moscow remain at odds as Russia continues to withhold gas in response to sanctions placed on the country following the invasion of Ukraine. Putin even warned that Russia would stop supplies of gas completely if the EU followed through with the plan. He said: ""We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil - we will not supply anything."" The withholding of gas has threatened a crisis in Europe, with many economic experts warning that there could be recession across the continent. But Bill Browder, an American financier and prominent critic of the Kremlin, tells Times Radio that Putin's ""game of chicken"" will hurt his country's economy the most. He said: ""There is a solution which doesn't come from us, but comes from Putin himself. Putin is now withholding the export of gas to Europe through the Nord Stream pipeline. ""Europe was the buyer of 90 percent of Russia's gas. If he doesn't sell the gas, he doesn't get the money. ""What he is doing is playing chicken but, this is really important, we can eventually find other sources of gas. If the prices of gas remain at these levels people will consume less and replace their consumption of gas with other types of energy. If Putin does this for any length of time his customers in Europe will stop buying from him, and if they do that he is bust. Gazprom is the main source of revenue for the Russian government. ""If he doesn't have that money, he doesn't achieve his objectives because of his vindictive behaviour."" Before the invasion of Ukraine, the EU got roughly 40 percent of its gas supply from Russia. But European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said Wednesday She added: ""We must cut Russia's revenues which Putin uses to finance this atrocious war against Ukraine."" The EU has sought to find gas from elsewhere, and found success in July when the bloc signed a deal with Azerbaijan. Gas imports from the country are set to double by 2027 through the Southern Gas Corridor, which transported gas from Azerbaijan to Europe since 2020. However, the International Energy Agency Director Fatih Birol warned at the time that the EU still needs more gas deals to make up for its loss of Russian resources. He said: “It is categorically not enough to just rely on gas from non-Russian sources – these supplies are simply not available in the volumes required to substitute for missing deliveries from Russia. “This will be the case even if gas supplies from Norway and Azerbaijan flow at maximum capacity, if deliveries from North Africa stay close to last year’s levels, if domestic gas production in Europe continues to follow recent trends, and if inflows of LNG [liquefied natural gas] increase at a similar record rate as they did in the first half of this year.” Human Rights groups also criticised the deal between Brussels and Baku given Azerbaijan's track record of oppression and corruption. Philippe Dam, acting EU director at Human Rights Watch, said: “The reality is that Azerbaijan authorities have been famous for cracking down on civil society activists investigating corruption, especially when it comes to oil and gas.” While the gas row rumbles on between Europe and Moscow, Ukraine's soldiers continue to fight Russian forces. Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive to try and claim back important areas such as the southern city of Kherson. It has also been reported that, on Wednesday, Ukrainian troops launched a surprise attack near the city of Kharkiv – Ukraine's second largest city."
2022-09-08,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666483/putin-military-plan-russia-ukraine-invasion-spt,Putin's military plan in tatters as 62% of Russian men 'not ready to fight' in Ukraine,"Ukraine's Armed Forces have claimed they killed 640 Russian military personnel, shot down two aircraft and destroyed two helicopters on Wednesday, as the war in the country continues. Kyiv now estimates that, since the beginning of the invasion, a total of 51,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Moscow does not release information on its military losses, but the US has previously estimated that the Russian death toll could be as high as 70,000. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree ordering his military to bolster its forces with 137,000 extra men. Many experts believe this plan will depend on a large number of volunteers. But, Kseniya Kirillova of the Jamestown Foundation recently wrote a report outlining why Russia may struggle to entice its population into signing up for its war in Ukraine. In an article for The Centre for European Policy Analysis, Ms Kirillova laid out Russia's ""multiplying war problems"". She said Putin's goal of recruiting 137,000 people has fallen short by a third, and the trend of young people trying avoid conscription will only increase. Ms Kirillova also cited polling by Russian Field sociological service, which found that ""almost two-thirds of the surveyed men (62 percent) are not ready to personally take part in hostilities in Ukraine"". Intriguingly the same study found 60 percent of respondents would back a ""new offensive against Kyiv"", but that 65 percent would also support an end to the ""special military operation"" via a peace deal. Gauging Russian opinion on the war is difficult due to the brutal suppression of opposition and independent media in the country. In March, a group of independent survey research organisations conducted a poll via phone calls with Russians. The results, shared with the Washington Post, found that 58 percent of Russians supported the invasion while 23 percent were against. The poll also found that younger Russians were more likely to oppose the invasion. Among 18-24 year olds, 29 percent indicated they back the war, while 39 percent were opposed. A staggering 75 percent of respondents aged 66 or older expressed support. Since the attack began in February, a number of reports have indicated that some Russian soldiers are refusing to fight in Ukraine. Pavel Filatyev, a former paratrooper in the Russian army, published a diary last month outlining his experiences during the war. He described the poor conditions he and other soldiers were living in, writing: ""What a wild state you can drive people to by not giving any thought to the fact that they need to sleep, eat and wash. ""Everything around gave us a vile feeling; like wretches, we were just trying to survive."" Condemning his country's leaders for sending men to invade Ukraine, Mr Filatyev added: ""This is a vicious circle of some kind, we are all to blame, but we need to make the right conclusions and correct our mistakes. ""Where is the breadth of the Russian soul? Where did our nobility and spirituality disappear… Our ancestors shed so much of their own blood for the sake of freedom. ""It may not change anything, but I refuse to take part in this madness. Ethically, it would be easier if Ukraine attacked us, but the truth is that we invaded Ukraine and the Ukrainians did not invite us."" While Russia appears to struggle in achieving its military objectives, Russian President Putin has insisted his forces ""have not lost anything, and will not lose anything"". He also warned Western leaders this week that Russia cannot be isolated by sanctions. Putin added: “No matter how much someone wants to isolate Russia, it is impossible to do. You just need to look at the map.”"

It is understood that Kyiv is focussing on limiting the extent to which Russia can respond to such attempts. The latest Western intelligence updates on the ongoing conflict suggest Russia is facing increasing “pressure” as key travel routes come under fire. Artillery and ammunition stores are also significant targets as resources become more scarce. The UK Ministry of Defence yesterday drew attention to the latest in a string of challenges being faced by Russian troops in Ukraine. It said that “multiple concurrent threats spread across 500km will test Russia’s ability to coordinate operational design and reallocate resources across multiple groupings of forces”. This challenge has today been made all the more difficult following the destruction of key passing zones. The Ministry said in a statement today: “In Kherson Oblast, Ukrainian brigades continue to conduct offensive operations. “Ukraine has probably destroyed a military pontoon bridge at Darivka, which Russian forces had deployed after the nearby road bridge was severely damaged.” It added: “The Darivka crossing is one of the main routes between the northern and southern sectors of Russia’s military presence along the Dnipro river. READ MORE: Everything that will close or be cancelled in UK due to death of Queen “Ukraine’s systematic precision targeting of vulnerable crossing points likely continues to impose pressure on Russian forces as they attempt to contain Ukrainian attacks: it slows their ability to deploy operational reserves and resupply materiel from the east.” This, alongside the targeting of military stores, is creating large troubles for Russia’s war efforts. Military economist Marcus Keupp told German broadcaster NTV that because of production troubles: “In a year at the latest, the Russian army will have no more tanks if the rate of attrition continues at this rate.” DON'T MISS: Zelensky’s call for no fly zone rejected [OPINION] Putin's army from 'mysteriously weak' to 'brutal' [REVEAL] People sensationally blame Brexit for Russia's chilling invasion [REPORT] He added that while “Russia still has artillery superiority”, this could change within a month. Ukraine is not without its own problems relating to ammunition and artillery. Numerous intelligence reports have highlighted the extent to which Volodymyr Zelensky’s forces are outgunned by those of Vladimir Putin. The West has been working to ensure Kyiv’s stocks remain at sufficient levels to respond to Russia’s invasion. Though stocks in these countries are also running low, and some commentators are asking for how long can current levels of support be maintained."

Video footage shows the strike, with the building erupting into balls of flames. The attack, thought to be by Ukrainian forces, left the major city in “pitch black”. The strike will come as a major blow to Vladimir Putin as the Russian Army uses Belgorod, which is close to the Ukraine’s border, to launch missiles at Kharkiv. Visegrád 24 tweeted: “Another video of the aftermath following the Ukrainian strike on the electricity distribution centre in the Russian city of Belgorod. “As the Russian city of a Belgorod is left pitch black tonight after a Ukrainian strike on an electricity distribution centre, the only thing that can be seen is an illuminated ‘Z-Symbol’ powered by another source... ironic….” It comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported ""good news"" from the front near Kharkiv in the east, saying some settlements had been recaptured as both sides reported heavy fighting in the region. Ukrainian and pro-Russian officials said there was fighting around the town of Balakleiia about 38 miles southeast of Kharkiv, with unconfirmed reports of heavy losses to Russian forces. An explosion at a power plant near Odesa in the south, meanwhile, cut electricity supplies to 360,000 people, a spokesperson for the regional administration said. Ukraine remained guarded about its counter-offensive in the east but presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych, in a video posted on YouTube, said Ukrainian troops had surprised Russian defenders at Balakleiia. Referring to the main transport hub supplying Russian forces in Izyum to the east, he said: “The Russians are saying that Balakleiia is encircled when in fact (our troops) have gone much further ... they've cut off the road to Kupiansk.” Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to halt all energy shipments to Europe, if Brussels goes ahead with a proposal to cap the price of Russian gas, in a combative speech declaring his nation would not lose the war in Ukraine. Putin said in a speech on Wednesday to an economic forum in Russia's Far East that Russia would not lose what he calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. He threatened to halt all supplies of energy to Europe if Brussels went ahead with its proposed price cap on Russian gas, the latest Western step to deprive the Kremlin of funds to finance the war. The Russian despot said: “We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil - we will not supply anything"" if that occurs."" Europe usually imports about 40 percent of its gas and 30 percent of its oil from Russia. Asked about the war's progress at the forum in Vladivostok, Putin said: ""We have not lost anything and will not lose anything."" Russian forces overnight fired rockets and heavy artillery into towns in several districts, killing seven civilians, wounding others and damaging more than a dozen houses and buildings. Zaporizhzhia's regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko wrote on Telegram: “The night was full of alarms and shelling.”He said at least 11 houses and other buildings were damaged, but there were no reports of injuries. In Kharkiv region, regional officials said five people were hospitalised and in Donetsk seven were killed."
2022-09-08,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666313/ukraine-I-symbol-resistance-russian-occupied-areas-guerilla-bombs,Meaning behind mysterious 'Ï' symbol appearing all over Ukraine in act of defiance,"The “Ï” symbol in the Ukrainian alphabet is unusual in that it does not appear in Russian, and has been drawn on walls and roads in various locations in Ukrainian territory that have been snatched by Putin’s forces to symbolise resistance against the dictatorship, according to multiple sources. Russian forces continue to occupy Crimea and parts of Donbas since the earlier annexation in 2014, while areas captured since the full-scale invasion in February 2022 include all or parts of Kharkiv, Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Mykolaiv Oblasts. Describing the symbol as a “mark of defiance”, former US Navy Seal and author Chuck Pfarrer wrote on Twitter: “The letter Ï appears in the Ukrainian alphabet, but not the Russian. This uniquely Ukrainian character has begun to appear on walls, roads and buildings in Russian-occupied territory. “The letter Ï has become a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance.” Olena Halushka, co-founder of the International Centre for Ukrainian Victory and board member of Ukraine’s Anti-Corruption Action Centre, confirmed she had also seen the symbol, saying it existed “Not only [in] Mariupol, this is the symbol of the resistance in all occupied territories. I've seen Ї pics from Crimea too”. The Business Ukraine magazine also reported the use of the symbol. Ukrainian resistance in occupied areas continue to frustrate Russian attempts to solidify its power, and threatened its attempts to hold referendums in a move towards annexation. According to the Associated Press (AP), guerrilla forces loyal to Kyiv are killing pro-Moscow officials, blowing up bridges and trains, and helping the Ukrainian military by identifying key targets. Andriy, a 32-year-old coordinator of the guerrilla movement in the southern Kherson region, told the outlet: “Our goal is to make life unbearable for the Russian occupiers and use any means to derail their plans.” Andriy is a member of the “Yellow Ribbon” resistance group, which takes its name from one of the two national colours of Ukraine. Its members use ribbons in that colour to mark potential targets. The resistance member added: “We are giving the Ukrainian military precise coordinates for various targets, and the guerrillas’ assistance makes the new long-range weapons, particularly HIMARS, even more powerful. We are invisible behind the Russian lines, and this is our strength.” Ukrainian troops recently used the US-supplied multiple rocket launcher known as HIMARS to hit a strategic bridge on the Dnieper River in Kherson, severing the Russians’ main supply link. Prior to the successful strike a former UK intelligence officer told Express.co.uk that destroying this bridge would represent a significant victory for Ukraine, as it further damages Russia’s ability to resupply its troops and complicates its logistics - something that has proven a major thorn in the Kremlin’s side since the war began. As a result of its strategic importance, Kherson has seen fierce fighting in recent weeks. Explosives and car bombs have also been used to target Russian officials in the area, and have been placed at their homes and routes to work, as well as near administrative buildings. A key target the resistance has repeatedly tried to take down has been Vladimir Saldo, the head of the Russian temporary administration in the Kherson region. A bounty of 1million hryvanias (just under £24,000) has been placed on the official. His assistant Pavel Slobodchikov, has been shot and killed in his vehicle, while another official Dmytry Savluchenko was killed by a car bomb. While Ukrainians initially held peaceful protests against Russian occupation, these were disbanded by the Russian military, who arrested activists. A guerilla movement has also emerged in the heart of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas, an area which has a largely pro-Moscow sentiment. Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said six Russian troops were wounded last month when their vehicle was blown up by guerrillas in the city of Sievierodonetsk soon after its seizure. He told the AP: “The guerrillas have acted quite successfully. They haven’t only spread leaflets. They also have destroyed infrastructure facilities. “It helps a lot to slow down the Russian attacks and advances.”"

It is believed the attack targeted a central electricity distribution station. The city is located just 40 kilometres from the Ukrainian eastern border and around 80km from Kharkiv, near where Ukraine is believed to be staging counter-offensives. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported “good news” from the front near Kharkiv, saying some settlements had been recaptured as both sides reported heavy fighting in the region. Ukraine remained guarded about its counter-offensive in the east but presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych, in a video posted on YouTube, said Ukrainian troops had surprised Russian defenders at Balakleya. “The Russians are saying that Balakleya is encircled when in fact (our troops) have gone much further ... they've cut off the road to Kupyansk,” he said, referring to the main transport hub supplying Russian forces in Izyum to the east. A pro-Russian official from the region, Rodion Miroshnik, said on Telegram that Balakleya remained in Russian hands although there was fighting north of the town. The battlefield accounts could not be verified but Yuri Podolyak, a Ukrainian often quoted by pro-Russian officials, also said Russian troops were surprised by the Ukrainian advance. “The enemy had considerable success near Balakleya with a relatively small force ... It would appear that Russian forces slept through this advance and were expecting it elsewhere,” he wrote on Telegram. “Everything would seem to depend now on the speed with which reserves are brought into the fight ... there have been significant losses.” Asked about the war's progress at the forum in Vladivostok, Russian President Vladimir Putin said: “We have not lost anything and will not lose anything.” Russian forces overnight fired rockets and heavy artillery into towns in several districts, killing seven civilians, wounding others and damaging more than a dozen houses and buildings, local Ukrainian authorities said on Thursday. “The night was full of alarms and shelling,” Zaporizhzhia's regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko wrote on Telegram.

Mr Kuleba said: “Russians have returned the body of a British humanitarian worker Paul Urie whom they captured in April and reported dead due to “illnesses” and “stress” in July. With signs of possible unspeakable torture. Detaining and torturing civilians is barbarism and a heinous war crime. “I express my deepest condolences to relatives and close ones of Paul Urie. He was a brave man who dedicated himself to saving people. Ukraine will never forget him and his deeds. “We will identify perpetrators of this crime and hold them to account. They won’t escape justice.” The two men were later charged with “mercenary activities” by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR). Mr Urey’s death was reported by the DNR in July, claiming only that it was due to “illness and stress”. Daria Morozova, the ombudsperson of the Russian separatists in the eastern Ukraine region, said officials from their side gave Urey the “necessary medical assistance despite the grave crimes he committed”. UK officials have confirmed they have been informed of the cruel and illegal tortuer of Mr Urey. According to Sky News, a spokesperson for the foreign office said: “We are disturbed by reports that aid worker Paul Urey may have been tortured in detention. It is essential that we see the results of a full post-mortem as soon as possible. Our thoughts are with Paul Urey’s family at this distressing time”. The humanitarian worker’s mother Linda Urey called the separatists “murderers” and asked “Why did you let him die?” after learning of his death. When Mr Urey died, Britain summoned the Russian ambassador to the UK to the foreign office to question them over the circumstances that led to his death. A video of Mr Urey, representing one of the last times he was seen alive, showed him in captivity and was broadcast on Russia television. In the video said he travelled to Ukraine because he did not believe how the British media portrayed the Russian invasion of Kyiv. However his mother drew doubts over whether this had truly been Mr Urey’s motivation, saying he did not seem like himself in the video, leading to suggestions he may have said the words under duress. She added that he had gone to Ukraine despite her begging him not to go to a war zone. She said that he had told her he would not have been able to live with himself knowing people needed help and that he had to get them to a safe place."
2022-09-08,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666389/russia-gas-delivery-blocked-sweden-stockholm-port-greenpeace-coral-energy,No thank you! Russian cargo gas delivery blocked as activists cause carnage at port,"Activists from Greenpeace Nordic prevented the ship Coral Energy from delivering a cargo of Russian fossil gas at a liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal in Nynäshamn, south of Stockholm. Protestors reportedly climbed cranes to unload gas from the ship. Meanwhile, Greenpeace sailing vessel SY Witness and activists in kayaks are in the water to prevent the ship from docking. The activist organisation is demanding that Sweden immediately stops the the import of Russian fossil gas. Karolina Carlsson, campaign leader at Greenpeace Nordic, said: ""The fact that Russian fossil gas is still allowed to flow into Sweden, more than six months after Putin began his invasion of Ukraine, is unacceptable. ""The Parliament has given the Swedish government a clear mandate to stop all imports of Russian energy to Sweden and it is Prime minister Magdalena Andersson’s obligation to act on this."" Sweden has received around 100.000 cubic meters of liquefied fossil gas (LNG) from Vysotsk in Russia. Greenpeace claim that Sweden continues its imports of gas despite an announcement from its Parliament that it needs to stop. The Riksdag said in an online statement: ""The Riksdag emphasises that it is important that the government continues to clearly and forcefully push the line in the EU that European dependence on Russian energy should end as soon as practically possible. ""This applies not least to fossil energy. The government should also pursue the issue of the EU developing a regulatory framework for origin labelling of fossil energy, which primarily concerns geographical origin. ""Measures also need to be taken so that Sweden stops importing Russian energy whenever possible, not least fossil fuels such as natural gas and oil."" Nadia Shevchenko, Ukrainian journalist and environmental expert who is on board the Greenpeace sailing vessel Witness in Nynäshamn, said: “I am extremely grateful for all the support that Sweden has given to Ukraine in these dark times for my country. ""At the same time, it is incomprehensible to me how Sweden’s government can support Ukraine with one hand and with the other finance Putin’s invasion and the abuse of the Ukrainian people by allowing these imports of Russian fossil gas to continue."" Ms Shevchenko moved to Sweden with her daughter after a Russian bomb exploded near her home in Kyiv. However, the environmental activist said the first thing she saw when she arrived was a tanker ship unloading 27 million euros worth of Russian gas. Speaking to Express.co.uk, a currency expert said that despite the efforts of Western sanctions, the Russian economy was ultimately being kept afloat by its sales to ""gas-guzzling Europe"". Greenpeace added: ""This peace protest is, like all Greenpeace actions, a safe and peaceful protest carried out with the highest priority on the safety of activists, personnel and equipment in the area. ""All activists are experienced climbers and use ATEX-rated equipment for work in dangerous environments. ""The activists also have measuring equipment to ensure that they are not exposed to any dangerous substances when they are in the area."""
2022-09-08,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1666510/putin-news-freeze-europe-horrifying-warning-eu-vdl-russian-gas-price-cap,‘We’ll freeze Europe’ Putin issues new threat as VDL plots end of Russia's cash cow,"Reports of the EU looking to impose a price cap on Russian gas led to Putin giving a fiery speech where he threatened to cut off all energy supplies. Cutting off all energy supplies to the fuel-starved continent would be devastating, and could result in rationing of supplies and even higher prices. Giving a speech in Vladivostok, the Russian leader highlighted this control over Europe, warning of a bleak winter if the Kremlin stopped flows. Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum, he said: “Will there be any political decisions that contradict the contracts? “Yes, we just won’t fulfil them. We will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests. “We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil — we will not supply anything. We would only have one thing left to do: as in the famous Russian fairy tale, we would let the wolf’s tail freeze.” “Those who are trying to impose something on us are in no position today to dictate their will. They should come to their senses.” In an effort to curb the soaring prices, the European Commission is now proposing plans to approve a broad price cap on Russian gas, along with mandatory cuts in electricity use, and a tax on oil and gas companies. Speaking after Putin's threat to block supplies, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: “We must cut Russia’s revenues which Putin uses to finance this atrocious war against Ukraine.” Last year, Europe imported about 40 percent of its gas and 30 percent of its oil from Russia. Last week, the Group of Seven (G7) wealthy democracies announced plans to impose a price cap on Russian oil exports, which could restrict Russia's ability to secure tankers and insurance from countries beyond the G7. However plans to impose a price cap on Russian gas have been a major sticking point in the EU, with member states reportedly having ""very contradictory views"". According to POLITICO, Germany notes that it is ""sceptical"" about the idea, while, Hungary, which is Russia's closest ally in the EU, is against the plan and is supported by Slovakia and at least two other countries. These plans come as Norway, the UK’s biggest supplier of gas, signalled that is willing to discuss long-term gas agreements and price caps to help ease the energy bills in the UK. Norway’s exports have surged since the EU began weaning itself off Russia, and the country is now facing pressure to do more to help European countries that face the risks of blackout and recession. Jonas Gahr Store, Norway’s prime minister, said: “I fully understand that Europe now has a profound debate about how energy markets work, how they can secure more affordable prices for citizens, families, industries, and how this shortfall of gas after Putin’s aggression can be handled.”"

On Thursday, Mr Biden approved an additional $675million (£587million) in weapons to Ukraine as Russia’s raging war continues. During a meeting to discuss how to continue supporting Ukraine in the long-term in countering Russia's illegal invasion, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said countries could work together to train Ukrainian forces and improve their own defence industrial bases for the long-haul. Mr Austin said:""This contact group needs to position itself to sustain Ukraine's brave defenders for the long haul. ""That means a continued and determined flow of capability now."" The conflict has settled into a war of attrition fought primarily in eastern and southern Ukraine. The latest US package will include more ammunitions, humvees and anti-tank systems. Washington has already provided more than $10 billion in military assistance to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's government since Russian troops illegally invaded on February 24. Meanwhile, the US is working towards signing a major trade deal with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing regards as its sovereign territory. President Tsai Ing-wen said she was confident Taiwan could sign a ""high standard"" trade deal with the US. Washington and Taipei unveiled the US-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century Trade in June, days after the Biden administration excluded the Chinese-claimed island from its Asia-focused economic plan designed to counter China's growing influence. President Tsai said Taiwan would work with the US to forge even closer trade and economic ties in warning shot to Beijing. Speaking during a meeting with US officials, she said: “We have already announced that negotiations under the US-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century Trade will begin soon. “We are confident that through this initiative, we can sign a high-standard trade agreement and advance bilateral trade development.” Taiwan has long pushed for a broad free trade deal with the US, its most important international backer and foreign arms supplier even in the absence of formal diplomatic ties. Stephanie Murphy, a Democrat from Florida who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, told President Tsai she supported such an agreement. She said: ""One of the most important things Congress can do right now is to deepen the economic relationship with Taiwan, and in particular, by pushing for a high-quality free trade agreement between the US and Taiwan."" President Tsai thanked the delegation for conveying strong congressional support for Taiwan just as China has been carrying out its drills, which have been scaled back but are continuing. She added: ""Taiwan will not back down. ""We will actively deepen our cooperation with democratic partners to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the region."" China's foreign ministry reiterated its opposition to such trips by US officials, saying their ""scuttling"" visits violate the ""one-China principle"" and breaks the American promise to only maintain non-official relations with Taiwan. Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters in Beijing:""China resolutely opposes and is very unhappy with this."""
2022-09-08,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666439/Turkey-news-Erdogan-Ukraine-grain-Black-Sea-row-Putin-UN-export-world-west-wealthy-nation,Turkey's Erdogan issues fresh ultimatum to Europe in Black Sea grain row as he BACKS Putin,"The president added that Putin was right in his claim yesterday that grains exported from Ukraine under a UN-backed deal have gone to wealthy EU countries, not poor ones. This claim has since been proven inaccurate. Speaking at a news conference with Croatian president Zoran Milanović, Mr Erdoğan said today that Putin was uncomfortable with the grains being sent to countries that sanction Russia. This follows Putin’s suggestion that Ukrainian grain exports could be limited. Speaking at an assembly of the Eastern Economic Forum in Russia, Putin said: ""We should probably think about limiting the destinations for grain exports, and I'm going to discuss that with Mr Erdoğan, president of Turkey, because it was he and I who came up with this plan."" He falsely accused the EU of failing to send grain to developing countries. The dictator said: ""Excluding Turkey as the mediator country, almost all the grain exported from Ukraine is flowing not to the poorest countries, but into the European Union."" Putin went on to explain this accusation by saying that of the 87 ships sailing under the Black Sea deal, only two were sent to developing countries. The Russian leader accused the West of ""deceiving developing countries."" He said: ""We need to help the poorest countries first and foremost. This is not what is happening right now. And I can tell you that this situation is the outcome of reckless action pursued by the elites of the U.S., U.K. and EU who are labouring under political delusion."" But UN data disproves the allegation by Putin, which Mr Erdoğan has now backed. According to its data, more than 20 vessels are heading to developing and least-developed countries (excluding those heading to Turkey). Six ships have Egypt as their final destinations, while others are heading to Djibouti, Yemen and Sudan. The false claims come as part of Putin's scheme to appeal to improve Russian diplomacy with developing countries after his relationship with the West was obliterated by the invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin has attempted to push the narrative that the rise in food prices is the result of Western sanctions following the war, and not due to the invasion itself. Mr Erdoğan's move to support Russian propaganda comes a day after he accused the West of provoking Russia. In a press conference alongside his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vučić in Belgrade, Erdoğan said: “I can clearly say that I do not find the attitude of the West [toward Russia] right,” adding that there was a “policy based on provocation.” The Turkish president also said he doesn’t think the war in Ukraine will end “anytime soon,” and urged countries not to “underestimate Russia.” Turkey has attempted to present itself as a neutral party in the invasion of Ukraine, hosting talks with both Kyiv and the Kremlin. It also helped to negotiate the grain deal to assure the safe export of grain out of blockaded Ukrainian ports. However, its strong ties to Russia remain. Ankara has increased its trade with Russia, Turkish banks have adopted a Russian payments system and Turkey has reportedly doubled its imports of Russian oil this year."

Since Ukraine was invaded in February, President Zelensky has received ample military aid from allies in Europe and America; by comparison, President Putin has remained largely isolated from international support. As a deal with China appears to have fallen flat, US intelligence reports that the Kremlin has turned to North Korea to buy millions of rockets and other artillery supplies. Speaking on CNBC, security strategist and former CIA officer Matthew Kroenig analysed China’s decisions to pull back on support for Russia. He said: “What China is really worried about is not the court of world opinion on this, I think they are worried about the United States secondary sanctions. “They are worried that if they are seen as directly supporting Russia, that they could become victim to US sanctions and they want to avoid that.” The US, like Europe, has already imposed strict sanctions on Russia as a consequence of President Putin’s “special military operation” in Ukraine. Newly declassified American intelligence suggests President Putin has moved to fill Russia’s void of artillery with military equipment from North Korea. Mr Kroenig said: “I think this shows that US sanctions are working and Russia really have joined the ranks of the world’s worst rogue states. “Russia is out of munitions, it can’t get the munitions from other countries, even China is refusing to help Russia’s military effort.” He suggested President Putin’s negotiations for military equipment had grown increasingly desperate as he added: “It shows that Russia is at the end of its rope.” The US did not confirm the exact weaponry supposedly purchased by Russia and a Pentagon Press Secretary reported it was unclear whether Russia had yet received any weapons shipments from North Korea. The news comes after US authorities reported Russia had received initial shipments of drones from Iran, some of which were suggested to be faulty. President Putin’s reliance on Iran and North Korea for military equipment has been declared a signal that international sanctions against Russia are proving effective. The UK Ministry of Defence has confirmed the Russian armed forces are suffering from significant shortages of munitions, vehicles, and personnel. An intelligence report added that Moscow’s failure to provide adequate equipment, pay, and rations had largely contributed to the “fragile morale” among Putin’s troops. The Kremlin has hit back against nations that imposed restrictions on Moscow by steadily restricting the gas supply through Nord Stream 1 to Europe. Last week, Gazprom, the Russian state-controlled energy supplier, declared the pipeline would remain closed indefinitely. Kremlin officials have said the politicians who decided to place sanctions on Russia are to blame for the supply cuts, which have sparked a crisis of soaring energy prices across the European market."
2022-09-08,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666462/Russia-Ukraine-invasion-war-counter-offensive-Kharkiv-President-Zelensky-video-vn,Horrifying footage shows Russian soldiers take on heavy fire as Ukraine pushes on,"Russian forces in areas of occupied Ukraine have come under renewed attack as President Zelensky’s troops have pushed on with their operation to reclaim regions under Kremlin control. Startling video footage from Kharkiv has unveiled the true horror of the counter-offensive as President Putin’s soldiers are filmed under relentless artillery fire. Moscow’s army is set to come under immense pressure to retreat as Ukraine has launched simultaneous attacks on Russian-occupied areas in the east and south of the country. The video footage, which was released on social media, is reported to relay the experience of Russian troops operating in the Kharkiv region. As the recording begins, a loud blast can be heard, presumably the detonation of a Ukrainian missile strike, close to the Russian soldiers who cry out after the explosion. The haunting sound of constant artillery fire rings out as the clip captures the group of Russian servicemen sheltering in what appears to be a shallow trench. Panicked clusters of Russian soldiers can be seen running between trees, clutching guns as they attempt to find cover and return fire. The news comes as Ukraine has launched a series of counter-offensive strikes to reclaim Russian-occupied land and force Moscow’s troops to fall back. President Zelensky has already issued a dire warning to President Putin’s forces, urging soldiers to flee Ukraine ahead of the operation. Speaking ahead of the renewed fighting in Kharkiv, the Ukrainian President said: “The occupiers should know: we will oust them to the border, to our border - the line of which has not changed.” He added: “Our defenders will not stop until they liberate everything that belongs to Ukraine.” The UK Ministry of Defence confirmed that Ukraine had launched counter-offensive operations in the Kharkiv, Kherson, and the Donbas regions. Intelligence reports suggest Ukraine’s tactic of simultaneous attacks has strategically strained invading troops across several distant areas. The threats to Russian control spread 500km across Ukraine and will pose a challenge to the Kremlin’s ability to coordinate military forces. The Ministry of Defence has reported that Russia’s failure to appropriately reallocate forces in the early stages of the war caused President Putin’s troops to underperform from the offset. The level of heavy fire observed in the video footage is unlikely to be matched by Russian forces amid a crisis of military supplies. Frustrations surrounding a lack of modern and well-maintained weapons have prompted an atmosphere of low morale among Moscow’s troops, especially in the face of renewed assault from Ukrainian soldiers. An intelligence report read: “The Russian military has consistently failed to provide basic entitlements to troops deployed in Ukraine, including appropriate uniform, arms, and rations, as well as pay.” The equipment crisis weighs heavy on Putin’s soldiers, adding to the strain of combat fatigue and a rising toll of war casualties."

Russia’s most recent loss will come as a particular blow given reports of depleting stocks. It took less than a month after Vladimir Putin’s announcement of engagement in Ukraine for military analysts to draw attention to the rapid rate of ammunition and artillery consumption. An expert writing in the Royal United Services Institute commented in June that this “has proven that the age of industrial warfare is still here”. He, Alex Vershinin, noted: “The massive consumption of equipment, vehicles and ammunition requires a large-scale industrial base for resupply.” There is, however, a large question mark over the extent to which this can be achieved in Russia. Kyiv has this week celebrated a recent strike which is understood to have seen more Russian equipment laid to waste. Its naval forces destroyed Russian equipment in Donetsk, Kherson oblasts, according to The Kyiv Independent. The paper reported: “The Ukrainian Naval Forces reported that it destroyed five Russian howitzers, two tanks, an artillery system, two multiple launch rocket systems and a radar station on September 7.” This comes after military economist Marcus Keupp told German broadcaster NTV that it has long been assumed Moscow could draw on huge stocks of military equipment in the ongoing conflict. READ MORE: Pound horror as British currency bombs to lowest level since 1985 But, “if we look at what is actually operational, the numbers look much smaller”. Mr Keupp added: “In a year at the latest, the Russian army will have no more tanks if the rate of attrition continues at this rate.” Shortages are also being suffered by Ukraine, with a report early in the war highlighting that its army was outgunned by its Russian counterpart 20 to one in artillery and 40 to one in ammunition.

But shortages are not also being felt in these, given decades of military downsizing. A US defence official late last month told the Wall Street Journal that the level of certain rounds in military storage have become “uncomfortably low”. In a further blow to Moscow’s advances, Ukraine is also reported to have recaptured over 270 square miles of its territory in the east and south during a counter offensive. Volodymyr Zelensky last night said: “This week we have good news from Kharkiv Oblast. “All of you have most likely seen reports about the recent activities of Ukrainian defenders. And I think every (Ukrainian) citizen feels proud of our warriors.”"

As supplies diminish, Russian troops have begun relying on stocks of Soviet-era munitions, while Ukrainian forces, armed to the teeth with Western weapons, push back in a counteroffensive to reclaim areas captured by Russia. As Putin seeks to replenish his weapons, Ukrainian Intelligence has reportedly warned that Russia is desperately seeking chip technology built by European and American companies. According to a report from POLITICO, Russia has been looking to acquire Western semiconductors that are built by Nexperia. Nexperia is a subsidiary of Chinese technology company Wingtech, which purchased the UK's largest microchip factory, the Newport Wafer Fab in Wales. A procurement document seen by POLITICO revealed that the Russian military is looking for high-tech components for its war machine, which includes microchips, diodes and transistors built by Nexperia. The “shopping list” also includes chips made by US companies such as Texas Instruments, along with parts sourced from German and Taiwanese companies. Last month, the Telegraph reported that components made by Nexperia had been discovered in a Russian missile that was recovered from the battlefield by researchers at the Royal United Services Institute. Tom Tugendhat, chairman of Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, said the disclosure “reminds us of the importance of protecting our industry from exploitation by our enemies”. He added that “with Nexperia’s plan to buy Newport Wafer Fab, it also shows why we need to defend our key strategic assets from those who could use them against us"". Nexperia has not been accused of foul play, however, Russia would likely try to acquire their technology through intermediaries or by stripping down non-military technology and recycling their chips. While Nexperia technology bought the Welsh factory last year, the deal is currently undergoing a national security investigation Under the National Security and Investment Act, he may be able to block the sale on security grounds. A Nexperia spokesman noted that none of the components that were identified in the procurement document is manufactured ar the UK site. They added that their components were not made for military use. The spokesman said: “Nexperia utterly condemns Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, we support and have abided by all international sanctions.“We have no Russian customers and do not sell into Russia. “Unfortunately, like other chip companies, we have seen incidents of our products being used in military applications for which our chips were neither developed nor sold, including in Russia where we do not even do business.” Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine’s prime minister, noted that Russia was beginning to run low on critical weapons, and currently has just “four dozen” hypersonic missiles left in its arsenal. He said: “These are the ones that have precision accuracy due to the microchips that they have. “But because of sanctions imposed on Russia, the deliveries of this high-tech microchip equipment have stopped and they have no way of replenishing these stocks.”"

Major General Chapman claimed Ukrainians were receiving better weapons from NATO-aligned countries and it was giving Ukrainians the ability to fight smarter on the battlefield. Countries in the West have sent Ukraine top-of-the-range systems in order to fight off the Russian onslaught, and have continued to keep doing so. The military expert told Times Radio: ""Well I think that's true, I mean if you analyse the Russian economy at the moment, of course, the energy sector still looks fairly healthy but the industrial sector looks absolutely awful. ""I mean the number of closures of plants which could actually impact on cities which are sustained just by one industry. ""So the high tech stuff, which is being... Not getting to Russia by the sanctions is a real concern for them. ""And that is caveating the way they will be able to fight the war, precision-guided munitions need all that sort of high-tech wizardry within them. Major General Chapman added: ""We know that they fire over some 3500, probably more than that now, Precision guided munitions. ""They're probably running low on that, if you're running low on that sort of stuff it means you have to fight back to a kind of analogue war rather than a digital war. ""And as the Ukrainians get better with the equipment given to them and the surveillance and electronic warfare and other gizmos from the West. ""The ability of the Ukrainians to fight smarter is what really comes to form, and that's what we're seeing."" Countries that are NATO aligned have been sending Ukraine top-of-the-range weapons since the beginning of the war. Ukraine has been equipped with HIMARS and NLAWs and anti-tank missiles in order to push back on the Russian advancement of their land. Some experts have been claiming in recent weeks that the EU is now running low on weapons due to them giving them to Ukraine. Germany has rejected the request to send Ukraine two tanks but has vowed to continue giving and showing support. Deputy Director of the Atlantic Council’s Center for Strategy and Security Matthew Kroenig has been warning that Russia is running out of weapons to use on the battlefield. Mr Kroenig said: “Russia is out of ammunitions, it can’t get munitions from other countries and even China is refusing to help Russia’s military effort. “So Russia is turning to Iran and North Korea, these countries are providing Russia with more ammunitions now, but I think it shows that Russia is at the end of its rope."" US White House officials have been warning that Putin may be gearing up for a new weapons deal with North Korea as he is getting more desperate."

The Ukrainian Armed Forces have launched a surprise offensive around the northeastern city in a bid to divert Russian forces away from Kyiv's ongoing counter-attack in the southern region of Kherson. Footage appears to show the moment Ukrainian soldiers took down the Russian Su-25 with a surface-to-air missile. As the Russian plane flew in low and fast across an open field a loud bang can be heard followed by plumes of smoke. An onlooking squad of Ukrainian fighters can be heard celebrating the successful downing from their position hidden in a tree line. Russian military Telegram channels are reported to have confirmed the loss of an aircraft but suggested the pilot had survived. Kharkiv region, in northeast Ukraine, is on the far end of the front line from the southern Kherson region, which Ukraine last week announced as the focus of a push to retake territory. Several posts on social media from military bloggers and witnesses reported fighting around Balakliia, a town of 27,000 people that lies between the cities of Kharkiv and Izyum. Gaining control of Balakliia could facilitate a Ukrainian attempt to encircle or partially encircle Izyum, said Kyiv-based military analyst Oleh Zhdanov. Little information has emerged about progress of the main Ukrainian offensive in the southern Kherson region, with Kyiv barring journalists from the front line and releasing only limited reports to preserve the element of surprise. The announcement of a simultaneous Ukrainian advance near Kharkiv was an indication that Russian forces were now having difficulties reinforcing along the huge length of the front, said Mark Hertling, a retired former US commander of ground forces in Europe. ""This confirms RU inability to maneuver forces between theater locations & within their force's defensive 'stance' to counter Ukrainian offensive actions,"" Hertling tweeted. ""RU is nursing wounds, bearing loss of combat capabilities (people & equipment), have bad leaders."" There have also been increasing attacks by Ukrainians in Russian-occupied areas against Moscow-installed authorities. On Tuesday, the Russian-installed commandant of Berdiansk, a port in the south, was badly injured when his car was blown up outside the city administration building, pro-Russian local officials said, blaming Kyiv for the attack on Artyom Bardin."

The soldier, holding a bouquet – probably a gift for his wife – is struggling to walk towards the gate of his home. His wife and daughter run towards him and hug him tight in an emotional moment for the family. The unnamed Ukrainian soldier was waiting outside the gate and walking with difficulty towards the house, with a huge smile on his face. What appears to be his daughter hesitates for a milli-second before throwing herself onto her dad, with her wife hugging him as well. The soldier, still holding his clutches and a bouquet, tries his best to hug his beloved wife and daughter. The adorable footage was shared on Twitter by Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. ""That is what we’re fighting for,"" the Ukrainian official wrote in his tweet featuring the cute video. His wife and daughter cannot get themselves away from the Ukrainian soldier in what seems to be a loving moment for the couple. An elderly woman, who seems to be his mother and witnessing the scene, appears to be crying. An elderly man, allegedly his father, joins the daughter and wife in hugging the soldier. After a long hug with his three relatives, the Ukrainian soldier struggles to get up but is assisted by a fellow comrade, and went on to hugging two women. Oleksiy Sorokin, a journalist for The Kyiv Independent reacted to the video, tweeting: ""In a few days we’ll have a lot of good news made public. The offensive in the north, from what I know, is going very very good."" Ukraine is carrying out a counteroffensive on multiple fronts including in the southern Kherson region and the northeast Kharkiv region in a bid to retake Russian-occupied territories. Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo reports that ""all early indicators"" show that Ukrainian forces are being ""quite successful"" in a surprise counteroffensive in Kharkiv. ""It appears that the Ukrainians have already recaptured several villages and are on the cusp of encircling a very key city of Balakliya"" in Kharkiv region, Mr Elizondo told Al-Jazeera, adding: ""This is a city of 25,000 people that was in the hands of the Russians for many months now."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there was ""good news"" about Ukrainian troops' counteroffensive, claiming the recapture of several settlements from Russia. To protect Ukrainian soldiers and guarantee the success of the operation, President Zelensky declined to name which places had been retaken, saying: ""now is not the time to name"" them. ""I think every citizen feels proud of our soldiers,"" he said, naming specific military units and applauding their bravery in combat."

He suggested And that in the lack of a breakthrough a peace deal would begin to be outlined by Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The warning comes as Kyiv claims success across the two-pronged fronts of Kherson and Kharkiv over Russia's army. Mr Marshall told Times Radio: ""So where we are in phase three in attrition is approaching the winter. ""The ground gets much hard, much harder to fight there will be skirmishes. ""We get to next Spring they'll go at it again, hammer and tongs. ""If there is no breakthrough, if one side is not hurting enough, at that point you may see the outline of the peace deal emerging. I'm not saying it will be signed, but the outline of it will emerge. Mr Marshall added: ""Phase one, the invasion which was halted giving time for the weapons flow to arrive. ""Phase two the Russians concentrating on the East in the Donbas and the South. ""And now phase three, it's simply attrition there's a 620-mile-long front line and in the past week or so the Ukrainians have actually gone out on the counterattack. ""But it is incremental, its village by village and sometimes just a few hundred of yards. And I don't think they're going to break through across that front."" The war in Ukraine has been raging for over six months, and peace deals have been halted so far as both countries bombard each other on the front lines. What President Putin claimed would be a three-day invasion and conquer has gone on much longer than intended. Ukraine has vowed to take back every inch of Ukrainian land that Russia was occupying. Some experts have been predicting that Russia has been experiencing a lack of ammunition supplies due to sanctions, which are affecting them negatively, and that this could lead to a possible withdrawal. Lord Richard Dannatt told Times Radio: ""You've got to face reality because they would then perfectly reasonably say the West, having encouraged them is now selling them down the line. ""He has got to at some point realise and his advisers have got to realise, and the military commanders have got to advise. ""Look, Mr President, we have done as much as we can but we really can't throw the Russians out. ""We can prevent them from taking any more territory, but I think we are going into a stalemate situation. ""President Zelensky, Sir, you've got to start negotiating."""
2022-09-08,https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1666443/Michael-Fallon-putin-russia-ukraine-war-nato-spending-economic-forum-gdp,'Putin must be crushed!' Ex-Defence Secretary calls on Nato members to step up spending,"Speaking at the Economic Forum in Poland - a major annual conference in Eastern Europe where political leaders, influencers and business leaders meet - Sir Michael said that there can be “no compromise” with Putin and warned that western European countries are doing to little to guarantee defence. He pointed out that at the Nato conference in Wales in 2014 all member states agreed to reach the target of 2 percent of GDP spent on defence but after eight years “only eight countries meet that target.” The Tory heavyweight, who was also a former energy minister, drew applause from the audience sitting just seven hours drive from the Ukrainian border. In a plenary session at the conference, he described the Russia-Ukraine war as “a war of principle not of territory.” He said: “International borders cannot be changed by force, we can't accept that or compromise.” Sir Michael also lashed out at Tony Blair’s Labour Government and others in the EU such as Angela Merkel who sought to compromise with Russia while Putin was rearming his country after the turn of the century. He noted: “While we were enjoying the peace dividend our enemies were rebuilding.” He pointed out that Putin had a long record of attacks with very little retaliation from Nato. This included a major cyber attack on Estonia in 2007, the invasion of Georgia in 2008, the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and now the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The former defence secretary also noted that Russia spends 5 percent of its GDP on defence while only the US, UK, Baltic countries and a few others in Nato spend above 2 percent. He said: “I welcome [new Prime Minister Liz Truss’s] commitment to spend 3 percent of GDP by 2030. It is very important.” But he noted that some of the richer EU countries have yet to pay their fair share on defence. He also agreed with an audience member who said “Putin must be crushed.” In a session yesterday, the retired minister also insisted Putin should be “humiliated.” He said: “I do not understand people that say that Putin must not be humiliated by failure. He needs to fail and to be humiliated if we are not to concede he has any kind of legitimate right to be any part of Ukraine. If we weaken now by allowing Russia to continue along this path it seems the Baltic States, Moldova, Georgia, the West Balkans - all of them - will be vulnerable in the future.” Also at the plenary session was assistant general secretary of Nato Giedrimas Jeglinskas who echoed Sir Michael’s no backing down argument. He said: “We must do what it takes to help Ukraine win. That is the fundamental goal we have.” The warnings come as the war has entered its sixth month with no sign of ending soon. Already it has impacted energy prices across the world while the EU is discussing imposing rationing on energy use after Russia turned off gas supplies to many countries including Germany. Poland, which is hosting the conference, has alongside Britain been one of the strongest in taking the line that Putin must be defeated."

A second Russian official was quoted as saying he had suffered the “explosive amputation of his legs and great blood loss”, by state-controlled news agency Tass. Footage from the scene showed Mr Bardin’s vehicle burnt and mangled from what appears to be the result of a powerful explosion Mr Bardin was the latest pro-Kremlin official to be targeted in Russian occupied Ukraine. The Ukrainian government has hailed the attacks as the work of partisans behind enemy lines."

The advances which haven't been officially confirmed by Moscow or Kyiv would place Ukrainian soldiers at least a dozen miles behind the Russian front line. It would also mean that they could potentially threaten key supply lines to Russian forces in northern Donbas. The Ukrainian army and government did not formally announce that the assault near Balakliya had begun on Tuesday. However, an anonymous official told The Daily Telegraph that the offensive had been planned for a long time. It was designed to catch the Russians off guard while their generals were focusing on counteracting the Ukrainian offensive in the southern Kherson region, the source added. They said: “The Russians sort of expected it down there, and part of it is to attack them seemingly independently but in different locations so they never know where. ""The first objective is to throw the Russians out of Kharkiv region and the second objective is to create a platform to start approaching Izyum. ""So far it has been pretty successful."" Pro-Ukrainian bloggers posted videos online on Wednesday morning which claimed that Ukrainian troops were in the village of Verbivka outside Balakliya and in the centre of Volokiv Yar. In another video Ukrainian forces are seen taking a prisoner who said he was from Alchevsk, a town in the Luhansk region. There was also confirmation of Ukrainian gains on Telegram channels run by Russian mercenaries, soldiers and war bloggers. “Volokhiv Yar, Semyonovka are under the Nazis. They are moving to Shevchenko,” said one post linked to a channel controlled by the mercenary Wagner Group. Another channel linked to the Wagner Group warned followers to “not expect good news today”. Alexander Kots war correspondent for Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda wrote on Telegram that it was likely that Ukraine was looking to cut off the Russian command centre in this part of the front. He said: ""They do not have the objective of taking Balakiye at all costs. ""If the enemy moves through Shevchenko to Kupiansk, the Izyum grouping will in fact be cut off from the [Russian] mainland."" He added that Russian forces should consider withdrawing eastwards in order to avoid being encircled. Izyum is a key junction on the border of the Kharkiv and Donbas regions and its loss would represent a major blow to Moscow."
2022-09-08,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666265/Orban-Russia-eu-sanctions-putin-viktor-orban-Ukraine-ont,Orban postpones bid to disrupt EU sanctions against Russia by protecting three oligarchs,"Budapest had demanded that three oligarchs were removed from the sanctions list which threatened to disrupt the EU’s plans to renew their sanctions against Russia. The Bloc is obligated to review and renew its sanctions against individuals since the invasion of Ukraine. Without the official renewal of sanctions, they lapse, and the EU needs all member states to agree to the sanctions at the point of renewal. Ahead of a meeting on Wednesday of EU envoys, the Czech presidency of the Council of the EU reached a deal with Hungary to avoid their obstruction of the renewal process. The agreement noted that the inclusion of the three oligarchs in question will need to be reviewed at the new renewal point in a couple of months. Such an agreement ahead of the vital meeting on Wednesday ensured that all went smoothly, according to EU diplomats. The EU is hoping to renew the sanctions list for another six months ahead of the renewal deadline of September 15. Hungarian leader Viktor Orban, previously obstructed the EU’s oil ban against Russia earlier this year and Hungary’s push to remove the oligarchs from the list had once again infuriated EU leaders. The Russian businessmen who Hungary wishes are taken off the sanctions list are Alisher Usmanov, Petr Aven, and Viktor Rashnikov, according to two diplomats. According to diplomatic sources with knowledge of the matter, Hungary wants the three men in question to be delisted from the visa ban and asset freeze list. According to the EU’s official journal, Mr Usmanov is a “pro-Kremlin oligarch with particularly close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin”. He has also been referred to as one of “Putin’s favourite oligarchs” who fixes Putin’s business affairs. Meanwhile, Mr Aven is reportedly “one of approximately 50 wealthy Russian businessmen who regularly meets with Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin”. According to the EU: “He does not operate independently of the President’s demands.” Both men were added to the sanctions list in February at the time of the invasion and Mr Rashnikov was added in March with Brussels calling him “a leading Russian oligarch who is owner and chairman of the board of directors of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works company. MMK is one of Russia’s largest taxpayers”. It is now up to the Council to ensure that the sanctions list, which impacts over 1,200 people, is extended by the mid-September deadline. The list has already been expanded since the invasion of Ukraine in February with Brussels having taken increasingly restrictive measures against Moscow."

A mixture of cars, lorries and vans were all visible in the clip and all vehicles were ground to a halt. Twitter user @vbobber1 said: ""People are returning to Kharkiv, there is a traffic jam at the entrance. No Europe can replace our native city."" @biz_ukraine_mag replied: ""Traffic jams in Kharkiv as residents return home."" However, @awererger added: ""Many Kharkivers are returning to their city. ""Here is a traffic jam when driving into the city. ""Places of residence such as Saltivka (large prefabricated housing estate) are still hardly habitable."" However, a recent intelligence update by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) revealed heavy fighting was still taking place on several fronts. The MoD said yesterday: ""Over the last 24 hours, heavy fighting has taken place on three fronts: in the north, near Kharkiv; in the east in the Donbas; and in the south in Kherson Oblast. ""Russia’s planned main effort is probably an advance on Bakhmut in the Donbas, but commanders face a dilemma of whether to deploy operational reserves to support this offensive, or to defend against continued Ukrainian advances in the south. ""Multiple concurrent threats spread across 500km will test Russia’s ability to coordinate operational design and reallocate resources across multiple groupings of forces. ""Earlier in the war, Russia’s failure to do this was one of the underlying reasons for the military’s poor performance."" It had been claimed Ukraine's fightback in Kharkiv had caught Russia off-guard. Anatoly Dremov, a Russian soldier, posted on social media a clip in which he said: ""Leaving the national guard face to face with the Ukrainian armed forces is a complete failure."" According to the Times, Artyom Bardin, the head of the city of Berdyansk on the Black Sea, was said to be in a grave condition after his car exploded on Tuesday. Serhiy Leshchenko, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, even promised ""great news"" from the Kharkiv region."
2022-09-08,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666279/putin-russia-health-concerns-general-svr-world-news-ont,Putin's health questioned after the Russian President falls asleep during meeting,"The session took place on Russky island near the city of Vladivostok, as Russian officials discussed tourism. In the video footage, the Russian leader seems tired and other officials appear to fall asleep while listening to speeches. Recent footage of a Russian council meeting shows Vladimir Putin appearing to fall asleep. The Russian President has been attending the 2022 Vostok war games, but speculations about his health have resurfaced after his feet appeared to be twitching while on a trip to Kamchatka. The Telegram channel General SVR has recent claims about Vladimir Putin’s health, and in the past has claimed President Putin may have cancer or Parkinson’s disease. President Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has addressed the health concerns and said the Russian leader is in “excellent health” and the rumours were “complete nonsense”. Telegram channel General SVR, which opposes the Russian Government, has made fresh claims about President Putin’s health. The channel said: “Even before the flight to Kamchatka, President of Russia Vladimir Putin had worsening problems with his kidneys, swelling of his face appeared, [and] 'bags' under his eyes clearly appeared. “Despite the use of drugs, there was no clear improvement. Upon arrival in Kamchatka, Putin complained to doctors about fatigue and shortness of breath. “But the president nevertheless decided to participate in pre-planned activities.” On Monday, President Putin appeared to walk with a limp while attending the war games in Vostok. Video footage of the event shows the Russian leader walking stiffly across the room and he appears to hesitate before sitting down. In recent months, President Putin was also seen limping while getting off a plane in Iran and twisting his foot while in a meeting with the President of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko. A few days ago, the Russian leader visited Kamchatka and he appeared to bemuse the audience while giving a rambling speech while he slouched in a chair and seemed unable to keep his feet from twitching. He also appeared puffy-paced and seemed to have difficulty speaking at times as he had a croaked voice. The Telegram channel General SVR has also claimed that President Putin was planning to use a body double while in Kamchatka. They stated: “A doppelgänger of the President is ready to assist.” President Putin has admitted that Russian officials had considered using a double in the past, but he was against the idea. He said: “I discarded the idea of any doubles.” The Russian leader was advised in the early 2000s when Russia experience a terrorist attack that a lookalike should go in his place to public events. President Putin said: “This was during the toughest time of our war against terrorism.” Body doubles have been used by historic Russian leaders, such as Joseph Stalin during the Soviet Union, who used a former dancer named Felix Dadaev to attend rallies and meetings."
2022-09-08,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666629/europe-food-shortage-farm-closures-vladimir-putin-energy-crisis-latest,Europe facing food shortage crisis as Putin's energy war sparks farm shutdowns,"Europe faces potential shortages this winter as Russian President Vladimir Putin uses energy supply to retaliate over sanctions imposed by the West in response to his war in Ukraine. Russian flows of gas via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline running under the Baltic Sea to Germany remained at zero today (September 8) after Russia scrapped a Saturday deadline to restart flows. Putin has threatened to cut off energy supplies if price caps are imposed on Russia's oil and gas exports. He warned the West it would be ""frozen"" like a wolf's tail in a famous Russian fairy tale. But the move has led some farmers and food producers to halt or slow output for the winter. Swedish newspaper Afton Bladet reported on Sunday that top Swedish tomato producer Nordic Greens Trelleborg said it will not be planting a winter crop because it would be running at a loss given current electricity prices. The company's site manager Mindaugas Krasauskas said it was because Nordic Greens had locked in tomato prices earlier this year when electricity prices were lower. EU farmer union Copa-Cogeca told the Financial Times the dairy and bakery sectors are most affected by the surge in fuel prices because processes for pasteurisation and milk powder production consume a lot of energy. This has pushed up butter and milk powder prices, which rose by 80 percent and 55 percent respectively at the end of August from a year ago, according to the European Commission. Some greenhouses in the Netherlands also plan to switch off or reduce production because of high fuel prices. The Netherlands is the world's second largest agricultural exporter so reduced farm output would hit fruit, vegetable and flower shipments. Meanwhile, new environment minister Mark Spencer said today British farmers may need to look to ""our ancestors"" to solve some of the challenges the UK faces over fertiliser supply. He was responding to the chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, Conservative MP Sir Robert Goodwill, who said: ""I don't think the situation could be any more serious for farmers in this country, both grain and grass farmers. ""The UK requires around about 2.2 million tonnes of nitrogen fertiliser and about a million tonnes of that came from the Ince plant and the Billingham plant. The Ince plant is shut, the Billingham plant is paused waiting for deliveries of ammonia."" He asked when the first load of ammonia will arrive at Billingham, when production will commence and if there was a real fear the plant may not start. Speaking in the Commons for the first time since taking up a new role at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Mr Spencer said: ""It's something which we do take very seriously. We recognise the huge challenge, not only to UK agriculture but of course other sectors around the country."" He added: ""We're going to have to work together as an industry, as a sector, to look to other alternatives as well. And it could be, if you look back to the '30s and '40s, how agriculture used to operate with nitrogen-fixating crops and other agricultural methods, we're going to have to look at our ancestors to solve some of the challenges we face."" Russia's war on Ukraine has sent wheat prices up with sunflower oil, meat, poultry and a number of other staples also jumping in price, driven by higher fuel and fertiliser costs. Kyiv and Moscow reached a deal to release millions of tonnes of grain from Ukraine's ports, but Putin warned yesterday problems on the global food market were likely to get worse and a humanitarian catastrophe is looming. The Russian leader said he would discuss amending the landmark grain deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey, to limit the countries which can receive cargo shipments. Putin claimed Russia signed the deal in July on the understanding it would help alleviate surging food prices in the developing world, but instead rich Western countries were taking advantage of the deal. A Ukrainian presidential adviser said Russia had no grounds to review the deal and the terms of the wartime agreement were being strictly observed. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said: ""Of course there are no objective reasons for revising the grain deal, not even close. ""I believe such unexpected and groundless statements rather indicate an attempt to find new aggressive talking points to influence global public opinion and, above all, put pressure on the United Nations."" A UN spokesperson for the Black Sea Grain Initiative said on Wednesday a drop in global wheat prices last month was partly due to grain exports resuming from Ukraine. They added that ensuring food and fertiliser supplies was critical to sustaining a downward trend."

The two leaders discuss the movement of Russian troops inside Ukraine after Vladimir Putin launched his ""special military operation"". As he realises the conflict has expanded from the Donbas region to the whole of Ukraine, a concerned Emmanuel Macron understands Ukraine is in the midst of a ""total war"". In a phone call with President Zelensky, the French President asked: ""So, does that mean that they sent special forces everywhere in Kyiv?"" President Zelensky answered: ""Everywhere. ""In Kyiv, in Odesa, and from Belarus. So, we fight everywhere on our territory. There are troops everywhere,"" President Zelensky continued. ""We couldn’t imagine it – that’s not been seen like it was in 2014”, Zelensky said, as Russian troops have moved beyond the eastern Donbas region. ""So, it’s much, much more,"" Mr Zelensky warned. A visibly concerned Mr Macron said: ""It’s clear. It’s total war."" ""Yes, total war,"" Mr Zelensky said. ""Ok,"" said a shocked Mr Macron at loss for words, ""Okay."" Mr Zelensky said with a sigh: ""Yes."" Mr Zelensky then said: ""So, I think, Emmanuel, it’s very important that you speak with Putin and very important to make an anti-war coalition. ""We are sure that European leaders and Biden can connect and they call him [Putin] and say, 'Stop'. ""He will stop. He will listen to you,"" Mr Zelensky said, calling on his French counterpart to call the Russian president. In the weeks leading up to the war, Russian troops had been amassing on the eastern and northern flanks of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin eventually launched what he termed a “special military operation” supposedly meant to bring back peace in Ukraine. Despite repeated warnings by President Zelensky and a war already raging on in the eastern part of the country, Western leaders failed to understand the potential of a full-blown invasion. Vladimir Putin announced on February 24 the immediate invasion of Ukraine in a televised address to Russians. President Macron has since tried to ease tensions with Russia by calling Putin but has so far failed to bring about a resolution to the conflict. In their last phone call, the two leaders agreed on the need to send a delegation by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant where the risk of a nuclear disaster escalated amid shelling."

Zelensky in stark warning to EU over 'complete' Russian visa ban,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised alarm bells in a brutal warning to the European Union, as he claims Russia is ""sending killers"" to the bloc. The EU first considered a full EU visa ban on Russian tourists but eventually adopted suspending a visa travel deal with Moscow. However, President Zelensky warned the EU is falling short of what should be done to prevent the influx of Russian ""killers."" After raising the moral issue of issuing that visa ban, President Zelensky said: ""It is also a matter of elementary security. ""Russia has repeatedly sent killers to Europe under the guise of ordinary tourists. ""They have already admired enough the spire in Salisbury, German streets and warehouses with weapons in the Czech Republic. ""Enough! Europe is not a place for promenade for murderers and those who support them."" He went on to thank the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for suspending the simplified visa regime currently in force between Brussels and Moscow. But he regretted the bloc failed to move forward with a ""complete"" visa ban. President Zelensky said: ""Of course, this is not yet a complete visa ban. ""But this already demonstrates to the citizens of the terrorist state that they bear certain moral responsibility for their state’s aggression against Ukraine and the whole of Europe. ""There is such a situation now when it's inadmissible to remain silent. And it is inadmissible not to oppose terror."" ""It is absolutely unacceptable that European territory can be used for tourism or shopping by those who at home, in Russia, not only support the split and mockery of Europe but also work for it,"" President Zelensky said. ""And it cannot be taken lightly that Russian propagandists can still stay in European countries, lie daily in reports and broadcasts from European capitals. ""Lie about Europe! Humiliate Europe!” President Zelensky erupted. ""And at the same time be in Europe – an absurdity that must be stopped immediately."" The EU’s 27 foreign ministers agreed to suspend the 2007 visa facilitation agreement with Moscow, which makes it relatively easy for Russians to obtain travel documents. There was a ""substantial increase of border crossings"" from Russia into the EU since mid-July, the EU’s Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell said, describing it as ""a security risk for the neighbouring states."" ""We have seen many Russians travelling for leisure and shopping as if no war was raging in Ukraine,"" Mr Borrell said. ""Member states considered that we are not business as usual. It cannot be business as usual."" Baltic States – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuanian – are planning to limit land crossings by mid-September to complicate access for Russians with Schengen visas. Up to 12 million Russians currently have Schengen visas and can freely travel inside the Schengen travel area in the European Union."

The Zaporizhzhya plant is the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe and there are fears a nuclear accident may occur if it is hit by weaponry during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Serhii spoke on the telephone with the Times and told the newspaper about the current situation in Zaporizhzhya. The former power plant worker said: “I think about 70 percent of the staff have left, mostly the low-level workers. “I don’t know if that means there are enough to keep the plant running, maybe.” He added: “It wasn’t safe there. As we came off shift we would have to try to avoid the incoming missiles. We would have to run for shelter.” The former plant worker has said that senior workers have been taken away by Russians and have not been seen since. Serhii also said the power plant has been repeatedly shelled during the occupation. On Tuesday, the United Nations’s nuclear agency released its report on the safety conditions of the Zaporizhzhya power plant after visiting the site last week. The report noted the “extremely stressful conditions” facing the Ukrainian workers who still currently operate the power plant. The UN’s report also went into detail about the current damage to the plant and said while shelling had not yet caused a nuclear emergency, there was a threat to safety that “may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance"". The report said: “The Ukrainian plant staff and managers reported to the team that 40 percent of positions in the area of physical protection were not currently staffed, which significantly increased the workload for existing staff to ensure continued physical protection at the site.” Russia has accused Ukraine of hitting the area three times in one day, but Ukraine has said Russia is using the power plant as a shield in order to fire weaponry. Both sides blame each other, however, the United Nations was careful to remain neutral on the issue during its report. Ukraine officials have said that Ukrainian citizens are currently trying to evacuate the area surrounding the nuclear power plant after an explosion cut off electricity and water in Enerhodar, the town right next to the plant. Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Iryna Vereshchuk has asked Russian authorities to allow civilians to leave the area, which is currently controlled by Russia. She said: “People are turning to us en masse for help. They are trying to leave this dangerous territory. “We once again appeal to the Russian Federation with the demand to provide us with a humanitarian corridor for the evacuation of women, children and the elderly.” Those able to risk driving through areas which may be fighting zones will then queue at a checkpoint at the village of Vasylivka in order to be allowed into Ukraine territory. Russian soldiers then check and search cars, and those fleeing have been waiting for up to five days to leave. Serhii said that those with children are able to jump the queue, which is what he and his family did. The former plant worker has also said he has had to lie about his occupation as Russia has banned any more nuclear power plant workers from leaving. President Zelensky has warned this week that the power plant was in danger after shelling disconnected Enerhodar from the power grid. The President said: “The last power transmission line connecting the plant to the energy system of Ukraine was damaged due to another Russian provocative shelling.” He added: “Russia is interested only in keeping the situation the worst for the longest time possible.”"

US officials confirmed that Ukraine was making ""slow but meaningful progress"" against Russian forces. Speaking in his nightly video address to Ukrainians, Mr Zelensky said there was ""good news"" in relation to the rumoured success of Ukrainian troops. He said, applauding the bravery of the troops: ""I think every citizen feels proud of our soldiers."" However, the President added: ""Now is not the time to name the settlements to which the Ukrainian flag returns."" In recent weeks Ukraine has stepped up its operational security sharing few details about potential counter offensives in the south and east of the country. Ukrainian troops launched an offensive south east of Kharkiv towards the eastern region of Donetsk. It is a region that Russia has maintained military control over since the start of the war six months ago. According to some reports, Ukrainian troops may also be a few kilometres away from the city of Izyum, a key link in Russia's military supply chain. Speaking at an event in the United States, Colin Kahl - the Under-Secretary of Defence for Policy argued that Ukrainian troops were performing better than Russian ones in some areas. He said: ""It is early days. I think the Ukrainians are making slow but meaningful progress. ""And we'll see how things pan out. ""But I certainly think things are going better on the Ukrainian side right now in the south than is true on the Russian side."" In its regular nightly update, the Ukrainian General Staff said on Wednesday that it had ""repelled all Russian attacks"" in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. However, they confirmed that both sides had exchanged artillery and air strikes causing considerable damage. Mr Zelensky also said on Wednesday that Ukraine would spend more than a trillion hryvnia ($27bn; £23.5bn) on defence. However, he promised that key social provisions such as pensions would be maintained."

As Ukraine engage in its Kharkiv counter-offensive, he explained Ukraine’s current intention is to “cut a very important road” which connects Kharkiv to other fighting sites in eastern Ukraine as, he stressed, such move would be able to “hamper the Russians enormously”. Mr Krushelnycky told Times Radio: “They were pushed out, they were ejected but they are to the north and northeast and the southeast of Kharkiv. “The Ukrainian intention there is to push them out of there and also to try to cut a very important road that leads from Kharkiv down to where the fighting is in eastern Ukraine. “That would hamper the Russians enormously, so there’s a number of aims. “So far the surprise has worked in Ukraine’s favour to a large extent.” He continued: “The Ukrainian armed forces began a couple of weeks ago an advance in the south of the country trying to reclaim territory that has been occupied by the Russians early in the war. “They also were keeping an open mind as to what to do, I think there were contingency plans to make this surprise attack in the northeast of the country, around Ukraine’s second largest city Kharkiv. “I think they depended on what the Russians would do and maybe the Ukrainians calculated that the Russians would try to move troops, their own troops, from that area to reinforce their troops which are under the cosh in the south of Ukraine. “If that were to happen, I think they had contingency plans to try to take advantage of that and to push the Russian forces further out from Kharkiv, which they try to encircle and take rights in the first days of the war.” Referring to the Zaporizhzhia plant under Russian occupation, he added: “If the electricity is cut off to the plant itself, the danger is that the cooling system which relies on electricity to pump water around its cooling system will fail in its job. “In the worst case scenario, there could be a meltdown”. The comments came as Ukraine confirmed it has launched a surprise counterattack in the north-east Kharkiv region. According to latest reports, Ukrainian forces have successfully “encircled” Balakliia, a town located a few miles away from Kharkiv. Despite not providing exact details on the ongoing Ukrainian campaign, Ukraine’s President Zelensky in his Wednesday evening address thanked his troops and said: “the extremely successful hits in areas where the occupiers are concentrated”. Further reports seem to confirm that Ukraine has so far seized around 400sq km in Kharkiv through their surprise counter-offensive in the attempt to retake control over the Russian-occupied city. Kharkiv has been under Russian control since the begging of the conflict in February and represented the first major Ukrainian city to fall into Russian hands. As Ukrainian forces engage in their counter-offensive, Ukraine has also warned that it might have to close Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s biggest nuclear power station in Europe, amid increasing fears over radioactivity releases. In light of mounting concerns, earlier this week the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) urged for a “security zone” to be put in place around the facility. IAEA said in a statement: “The shelling on site and in its vicinity should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities, for the safety of the operating staff and to maintain the physical integrity to support safe and secure operation”."

During his time in the city, Mr Ryzhenko operated a telegram channel reporting on the occupation and provided intelligence information to the Ukrainian military. Now having escaped the region, the journalist has unveiled the true horror of Russian torture strategy in occupied cities, branding the attacks in Kherson “more tragic than Bucha.” Speaking to the BBC’s Ukrainecast, Mr Ryzhenko said: “People died in both Bucha and Kherson, in both places they were killed by Russians, but there is a big difference in how this happened. “Let’s say they tried to use rapid interrogation methods in Bucha - they would take a man, beat him, and then shoot him. “Suffering is determined by pain and the time period in which a person experiences this pain. “Here in Kherson people could be tortured for months and die from torture, they were not just taken and shot, but tortured to death.” Kherson has been occupied by the Russian military since the early days of President Putin’s invasion. The reporter continued: “I say that this is more tragic than Bucha because people would take longer to die here. “It was like a conveyor - they were constantly burning corpses outside the city. “We believe these are the bodies of the people they tortured to death, they are trying so hard to cover up their crimes. Concluding his horrific insight into the war, Mr Ryzhenko added: “This is much scarier than Bucha.” Evidence of an apparent civilian massacre emerged from Bucha, a town just outside of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, around the beginning of April. At the time, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said: “I am horrified by the images of civilians lying dead on the streets and in improvised graves in the town of Bucha.” She went on to promise an independent investigation would be conducted to expose the events leading up to the catastrophic scene captured in photographs from Ukraine. In the month following, a Human Rights Monitoring Mission operated by the United Nations found evidence of at least 300 unlawful killings of civilians in Bucha and the surrounding towns. Matilda Bogner, head of the UN mission, explained such activity would violate international humanitarian law and may constitute a “war crime” by Russian forces. Mr Ryzhenko is not the only source to report on Russian forces using torture against Ukrainain civilians in Kherson. Fellow Ukrainian journalist Oleh Baturin told the BBC he was kidnapped within the Kherson region and beaten “with the butt of a machine gun.” Human Rights Watch have reported: “Russian forces have tortured, unlawfully detained and forcibly disappeared civillians in the occupied areas of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.” Yulia Gorbunova, a senior researcher on Ukraine with Human Rights Watch said: “Russian forces have turned occupied areas of southern Ukraine into an abyss of fear and wild lawlessness.”"
2022-09-07,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1665703/putin-ukraine-russia-Balakliya-kharkiv-latest-news-ont,Putin ‘panicking’ as Russian forces fear Ukrainian ‘offensive’ attack near Kharkiv,"According to the experts, the Russian forces are worried about the situation in Balakliya and are fearing an “Ukrainian assault at 4am” tomorrow. Journalist Julian Röpcke shared the information to his Twitter followers. She tweeted: “There is absolute panic among Russian sources about the situation in Balakliya. “They fear an ‘Ukrainian assault at 4am’ tomorrow, claim ‘English speaking mercenaries are leading the offensive’ & talk about Russian ‘units, getting encircled in the direction of Kharkiv’. “Latest Russian reports indicate a large-scale Ukraine offensive along 17 km of the Balakliya-Kupyansk highway with attacks on two cities along the highway and Balakliya itself. “Verbivka is not in the report, possibly meaning it was already taken by Ukrainian forces.” Ukrainian forces launched a surprise offensive against Russian positions in the east of the country in an apparent expansion of their efforts to roll back the invasion. Reports of a Ukrainian attack on Balakliya, a Russian-held town about 43 miles southeast of Kharkiv, emerged on unofficial Ukrainian and Russian Telegram last week. The Ukrainian ministry of defence did not comment on the reports. Anton Gerashchenko, a former Ukrainian MP, said: “They are promising good news from the Kharkiv direction, maybe Balakliya.” Announcing the apparent counter-attack, Serhiy Leshchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's presidential office, said there would be ""great news from President Zelensky on counter-offensive operation in Kharkiv region"". He later deleted the social media post, reported The Telegraph. The attack near Kharkiv, in the east of the country, comes a week after Ukraine launched a much-hyped assault against a vulnerable Russian pocket on the west bank of the Dnipro river in Kherson, on the southern front. The purpose of the assault was not immediately clear, but it may be intended as a diversion to keep the Russians from reinforcing Kherson. On Monday Ukrainian forces mounted a surprise attack across the Siversky Donets river in the Donetsk region at a village called Ozernoye. Another blast in Berdyansk was reported a few hours later but there were no immediate reports of casualties. Russia-occupied towns in southern Ukraine have seen a flurry of attacks on figures in the occupation administration in what the Ukrainian government has hailed as the work of partisans behind enemy lines."

All eyes have been focused on military events unfolding in the south of Ukraine, particularly in the Kherson region. Last Monday, a spokesperson for Ukraine's army confirmed Kyiv had launched a counteroffensive to retake Kherson. Ukraine's army made early breakthroughs in several directions towards Kherson in the first days of its southern push. It appears to have maintained its momentum, with further captures of towns and villages reported over the weekend and on Monday. However, the Kherson attack seems to have been a cover for a major assault in Ukraine's northeast, which has sent shockwaves through Putin's army. Reports are coming in of fierce fighting near the city of Balakliya, located about 40 miles from Kharkiv. The city is a major hub for Russian soldiers and equipment and according to analysts is of vital importance to their war effort on the eastern front. Anatoly Dremov, a volunteer from Saint Petersburg fighting for Putin's army, has been maintaining a blog throughout the war. He claimed that Balakliya was coming under heavy artillery fire from Ukrainian positions. He wrote: ""It appears that Ukraine's army has not been strengthening its equipment in the Kharkiv direction in vain. ""It seems that the attack in Kherson was a diversionary move. The main attack is taking place on the Kharkiv front. ""Today the Ukrainians went on the attack in the Balakliya area. ""Right now they are undermining the bridges that lead into the city. ""They are shelling the city with large calibre artillery and multiple rocket launchers."" He added: ""The enemy has strengthened its positions on the outskirts of the city ""A counter-battery fight is taking place, and aviation is working on the advancing Ukrainian forces. ""The situation in the Izyum direction has also escalated. Brutal battles are raging. ""The enemy has come alive along the entire Kharkiv front. It seems comrades, they have f***ed us hard."" Andrew Perpetual, a Ukrainian activist who is organising the purchase of winter clothing for Ukrainian soldiers, commented on the unfolding events. He said: ""Balakliya is a significant stronghold, if Russia cannot hold it they are truly screwed. ""They can’t downplay the significance of it. It is absolutely crucial for them. ""This is why you have radio silence. If their stronghold falls, imagine what happens to all the other towns."" He explained that the significance of the city lay in the fact that it was one of the places where Moscow had concentrated its depleted military resources. He said: ""They don't have the men to defend many places, so they put all their men and resources into a small number of places and this is one of them."" One of President Zelensky's officials has reportedly promised ""some big news"" about Kharkiv region on Tuesday evening."
2022-09-07,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1665663/ukraine-chimpanzee-escapes-zoo-returns-bicycle-raincoat-kharkiv,Chimpanzee escapes Ukraine zoo - returns to park on bicycle with raincoat,"In viral footage shared on Twitter by Outriders journalist Hanna Liubakova, the chimp, named Chichi, can be seen exploring the streets of Kharkiv. The video was shared on Tuesday, September 6, and has been viewed more than one million times. Ms Liubakova said: ""In Kharkiv, a chimpanzee escaped from a zoo. It was walking around the city while zoo employees tried to convince it to return. ""Suddenly it started to rain, and the ape ran to a zoo employee for a jacket and then agreed to return to the zoo."" In the video, Chichi is seen running into a park before a zoo employee in a yellow raincoat sits with the chimp in an attempt to convince her to return to the zoo. After she sits with the chimp, the video cuts to Chichi running towards the employee as she holds out her yellow jacket as it begins to rain. The chimp reaches her and turns and slips one arm into the jacket, although she requires some help from the employee to get the coat on properly. The footage then shows three people pushing a bicycle while Chichi rides along on top of the bike back to the zoo. Ukraine's public broadcaster, Suspline spoke to Kharkiv city zoo's director Oleksiy Hryhoriev who confirmed Chichi was safely back at Kharkiv zoo. The video brought a rare moment of joy to a city which is under daily bombardment by Russian forces. Chichi was moved from her original home at Feldman Ecopark, which is directly on the frontlines in the outskirts of Kharkiv. She was lucky to make it out alive as more than 100 animals were reportedly killed there, according to the owner - businessman Oleksandr Feldman. Many were evacuated, however, six volunteers were killed in the shelling trying to help the animals escape, said Mr Feldman. Russian soldiers also reportedly stole vegetables which were meant to be used to feed the animals. Chichi was moved to the Kharkiv city zoo, which is in a more central location, less subject to shelling. However, the city has been subjected to nearly nonstop attacks since the start of the war. Last week four people were killed when a rocket landed in central Kharkiv. On Facebook, the zoo gave an update about the situation there. It said: ""The zoo is closed to visitors, but the care of the animals does not stop. ""The war is causing terrible stress for the animals, so some of them have been moved to indoor enclosures and underground galleries. Veterinarians monitor their emotional state and, if necessary, provide a sedative."""
2022-09-07,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1666175/russia-news-vladimir-putin-ukraine-war-counterattacks-commanders-dilemma-update,Putin to be tested by Ukrainian counterattacks – ‘commanders face dilemma’ over focus,"Six months after Vladimir Putin announced the “special military operation” in Ukraine, Moscow’s commanders are said to be facing a “dilemma”. An intelligence update suggests they must choose between pursuing an offensive in the Donbas or to focus on defence in the south of Ukraine. The UK Ministry of Defence this morning reported: “Over the last 24 hours, heavy fighting has taken place on three fronts: in the north, near Kharkiv; in the east in the Donbas; and in the south in Kherson Oblast. “Russia’s planned main effort is probably an advance on Bakhmut in the Donbas. “But commanders face a dilemma of whether to deploy operational reserves to support this offensive, or to defend against continued Ukrainian advances in the south.” Intelligence officials at the British body added “multiple concurrent threats” over a large area will “test Russia’s ability to coordinate operational design”. This will relate not only to the designation of troops but of resources. Military economist Marcus Keupp today told German broadcaster NTV that “in a year at the latest, the Russian army will have no more tans if the rate of attrition continues at this rate”. He said: “Russia still has artillery superiority”. But within a month, the scale could be “roughly tied” between Russia and Ukraine with regards to arms. READ MORE: Weakened Putin 'running out of weapons' - could be level with Ukraine In June, some Ukrainian officials said there were plans for destroyed Russian tanks to be paraded in Europe to highlight Moscow’s failures and to maintain Western interest in the war. Kyiv Defence Minister Olejsii Reznikov told Polish broadcaster Polsat: “We’ll help to ensure that Russian tanks are in Europe, but as scrap.” British officials did not appear to rate Russia’s chances when questioning how well its troops will respond to the challenge of coordinating operational design.

This ability becomes more strained by the week, as the West’s own supplies run dry. A US defence official late last month told the Wall Street Journal that the level of military storage for certain combat resources are “uncomfortably low”. Brad Martin, Director of the Institute for Supply Chain Secure at the Rand Corporation, added: “Nations assume the risk that war is not going to take place, and have the assumption they can react when they need to. “It simply might not be true that you can ramp up [production quickly].”"
2022-09-07,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1665707/putin-energy-crisis-russia-ukraine-european-union-russia-gas-oil-world-news-ont,Putin boasts £141billion in energy profits helping fund Ukraine invasion,"On Monday, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea) published its findings that Russia had made £141billion in profit from oil, gas and coal sales since the Ukraine invasion began six months ago. The Finnish think tank also estimated that Russia has spent only £86billion on the war, but no official figures have been released. The think tank wrote: “Russia has cut gas exports to the EU by 75 percent, in an attempt to blackmail Europe. “Yet the increases in gas prices have meant that the EU is paying Russia as much for gas as a year ago.” Since the invasion of Ukraine began in February, the European Union has paid Russia £57billion and gas and oil deliveries, and Germany by itself has spent more than £16billion. Russia has also traded energy with China and received £31billion in profits. Last week, the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which is Europe’s main gas supply route from Russia. Gazprom has claimed that Europe’s sanctions on Russia for the Ukraine invasion have prevented regular maintenance of the pipeline. A representative of Gazprom told Reuters that the pipeline would remain closed until it was fixed by Siemens Energy, a German company which usually works on the Nord Stream. However, Siemens has said an oil leak would not cause a shutdown. They said: “Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site. It is a routine procedure within the scope of maintenance work.” A spokesman for President Putin, Dmitry Peskov, said: ""Pumping problems arose because of sanctions imposed against our country and against a number of companies by Western states, including Germany and the UK. ""There are no other reasons that would lead to problems with pumping."" Last year, The European Union received forty percent of its gas supply from Russia, with Germany being Europe’s biggest importer in 2021. The UK is not reliant on Russia for its gas, as in 2021 it imported only four percent of its gas from Russia. However, the crisis in Europe has raised the overall energy bills for British households, which has contributed to the cost of living crisis. President Putin’s spokesperson criticised European politicians for the current energy crisis. Mr Peskov said: “It is obvious that Europe is getting worse for people, entrepreneurs, companies, to live and work: less money is being earned, the standard of living is falling.” The European Union has said it will cut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds by 2023, but will not impose a gas ban. The EU has said its latest trade sanctions on Russia would cut the amount of oil it buys from Russia by 90 percent, but will take months to come into full effect. Ukraine’s leader has said Russia is preparing a “decisive energy attack” on all Europeans. President Zelensky said: ""It is trying to attack with poverty and political chaos where it cannot yet attack with missiles.” He added that unity among European countries would help offer protection from the crisis."
