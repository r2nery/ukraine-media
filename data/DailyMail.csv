Campaigner Igor Mangushev, 36, held what he said was the skull of an Azov regiment fighter killed in Mariupol, south-eastern Ukraine as he addressed a crowd. The twisted ultranationalist said: 'Why can't there be any reconciliation? 'Ukraine must be de-Ukrainized. 'The Russian lands of Novorossiya must be returned back. 'We are not at war with people of blood and flesh. We are at war with an idea — Ukraine as an anti-Russian state.' Holding the skull, he was quoted by Astra media as saying: 'We're alive and this guy is already dead. 'Let him burn in hell. 'He wasn't lucky. We'll make a goblet out of his skull.' In his Telegram channel, Mangushev openly calls for the killing of civilians. 'We will burn your houses, kill your families, take away your children and raise them Russians,' he posted. Mangushev is supposedly fighting against Ukraine but is also the head of nationalist movement Light Russia and a creator of a private army ENOT which is said to have links to the FSB. His real name is Reimer, and he has a 14 year old daughter. The performance with a human skull violates at least one article - 244 - of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation: 'Desecration of the bodies of the dead'. It is also a war crime in international law. The location and timing of the video's recording was not clear and could not be independently verified."
2022-08-28,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11153401/Anti-Putin-pensioner-torched-generals-BMW-faces-jail-special-military-operation.html,"Anti-Putin pensioner who torched Russian general's BMW faces 15 years in jail: Protester, 65, says she conducted her own 'special military operation' in anger over Ukraine war","A Russian anti-war protestor who set fire to a general's BMW said she was taking part in her own 'special military operation'. Elena Belova, 65, was arrested by police in Moscow after pouring petrol and throwing a match on deputy head of the General Staff Yevgeny Sektarev's luxury SUV. During her arrest, she was allegedly told by police to shout 'Azov is Power', a reference to Ukrainian resistance regiment deemed a terrorist organisation in Russia. It's unclear whether Ms Belova was acting alone or as part of a plot. But her gesture was confirmed to be an anti-war protest, independent news agency Baza reported. General Sekretarev is in charge of the Kremlin department responsible for military censorship. The dramatic incident came as Moscow faced days of turmoil in the wake of the assassination of Darya Dugin, 29, the daughter of 'Putin's Rasputin' Alexander. The oligarch's daughter was killed in an explosion on a highway near the village of Bolshiye Vyazyomy just outside the capital last Saturday night. Speaking out against the war - which must in Russia only be described as a 'special military operation' - carries a sentence of up to fifteen years behind bars. Ms Dugin's killing, which is thought to have been a Ukrainian attempt on Alexander's life, has spooked millions of Russians now facing the war's violent reality at home. But some experts have suggested that it was Putin's FSB spy agency that was behind the attack. Historian Yuri Felshtinsky, author of Blowing up Ukraine, said: 'The blowing up of the car of the famous Russian fascist and ideologist of the Putin regime, Alexander Dugin, was organized, it seems, by the Russian security services.' He added: 'On the latest Russian reports, the bomb was attached to Dugin's car inside his guarded compound. Ukraine focuses on military targets, unlike Russia, and there is no discernable gain in attacking one of Putin's media puppets or allocating scarce operatives inside the Russian Federation to such a goal that is meaningless to the liberation of Ukraine. 'The Kremlin will, however, likely exploit it to make it seem as if Ukraine is stooping to its own tactics of bombing harmless civilians in Ukraine.' Former Russian lawmaker Ilya Ponomarev also claimed that the explosion was the work of an unknown Russian group, the National Republican Party. The existence of the group could not be verified. He said on Russian TV: 'A momentous event took place near Moscow last night. This attack opens a new page in Russian resistance to Putinism. New – but not the last.'"
2022-08-28,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11153909/Nearly-three-quarters-state-pension-swallowed-energy-bills-year.html,"Nearly three-quarters of state pension will be swallowed up by energy bills next year: Pensioners face 'terrifying' winter as latest price cap predictions suggest annual gas and electricity fees could hit £7,000","Pensioners face a 'terrifying' winter as rising energy bills are set to wipe out nearly three-quarters of their annual state pension, leaving many more than £800 worse off. Elderly Britons are set to welcome a boost of around £1,000 to their state pension payments next year thanks to the return of the triple lock, however the cost of living crisis will still leave them significantly poorer. However, the price cap for energy bills will rise by 80 per cent to £3,549 in October, and it is predicted to rise over £6,600 next year according to Cornwall Insight. Higher energy bills often hurt pensioners significantly more than the rest of the population because they spend a greater amount of their income on heating their home. While the state pension has increased and will pay out an annual average of £9,623 after next April, just £3,000 will be left to live on per year once bills have been paid - even after the triple lock raise. The triple lock is a promise made by the Government to raise pension payments by either inflation, average earnings or 2.5 percent - whichever is the highest rate. However, inflation may almost double to 18.6 per cent by spring, according to analysis by Citigroup, leaving pensioners nearly £1,000 worse off. Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, is calling for additional support to help pensioners face a 'terrifying' winter. She said: 'It's a truly frightening prospect and one that most could not have prepared for, and never expected to face at this point in their lives. 'I think a lot of older people will be utterly bewildered that it has come to this and will also feel badly let down, and I can't say I blame them.' Energy prices started rising sharply after lockdown lifted and rose even further after Russia invaded Ukraine and then cut off its supplies of gas to Europe. To help those on the state pension deal with rising cots, the Government has launched a £300 payment for older households. On top of this, state pensioners on low income who claim Pension Credit will be eligible for the Government's £650 cost of living payment. The Winter Fuel Payment will also be doubled from £300 to £600 for more than eight million pensioner households ahead of this winter. The full new state pension comes to £185.15 per week, while the basic state pension comes to a weekly rate of £141.85 per week. Four in 10 people over the age of 66 rely on the state pension as their main source of income, according to the Money and Pensions Service. Lis Truss is reportedly mulling sweeping tax cuts including the 'nuclear option' of slashing VAT by 5% - a move which alone could save the average UK household more than £1,300 a year - in a bid to ease Britain's cost of living crisis as families battle sky-high inflation and bills. The Tory leadership frontrunner has urged the public not to surrender to fear over soaring energy prices as she thrashes out the details of a plan to tackle rising household bills. The VAT cut - which would be the biggest on record if implemented - is one of a series of possible strategies being drawn up by the Treasury, based on plans modelled on Gordon Brown's response to the economic crisis in 2008, for Britain's new Prime Minister to look at when they take office. Truss allies also believe the cut would protect businesses from collapsing and could be brought in along with more targeted measures to assist struggling families with energy bills, The Sunday Telegraph reports. It comes as energy regulator Ofgem announced on Friday that the price cap would rise from £1,971 to £3,549 a year on October 1, with analysts forecasting further rises to as much as £7,000 by April next year. Ms Truss has said that no decisions on economic support packages will be made until the Tory leadership contest concludes, but she is said to have discussed the VAT cut with her team. If the Foreign Secretary wins the leadership vote, the Treasury will present her with a number of strategies including a 2.5 per cent or a five per cent reduction in VAT - down from the current rate of 20 per cent. The cut would cost taxpayers £3.2 billion each month, equivalent to £38bn annually, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says, and would help reduce inflation by around two per cent. But a source from rival Rishi Sunak's campaign said this would be 'incredibly regressive'. Ms Truss' team is also understood to believe that personal allowance, the amount of income you do not have to pay tax on, currently £12,750, should be lifted ahead of the current schedule. Her team is said to have also raised the idea of increasing the figure at which individuals move into the higher rate of tax, 40 per cent, which is currently £50,270. And an extension to the 5p cut in fuel duty announced by Mr Sunak at his most recent Budget is among options being discussed by the Truss team. Ms Truss has vowed to strike an optimistic tone if, as expected, she forms the next Government in just over a week. 'I have a clear plan to get Britain through this storm and out the other side, and the determination to deliver it,' she told The Mail on Sunday. 'A recession is not inevitable, but we need to make sure we do not talk ourselves into one. I don't believe in managed decline and I won't accept it. I believe in hope over fear.' Ms Truss's remarks follow apocalyptic forecasts that without significant Government intervention the combined effect of the bills with double-digit inflation and rising interest rates will wipe out the savings of millions of households. The Bank of England has projected inflation will reach 13 per cent, though bankers at Citi have warned it may rise as high as 18 per cent. A source told The Telegraph: 'Cutting VAT is the nuclear option. They [the Treasury] have talked about the Gordon Brown approach that he took at the time, when it looked as though consumer confidence was falling. 'They are talking about the last big economic shock that hit the whole economy and consumers in 2008, and the Treasury's response to that.' Wholesale gas and electricity prices have been driven to record highs as a result of Vladimir Putin curbing gas supplies to Europe after Russia invaded Ukraine. Energy companies have called on the Government to freeze the cap at its current level for two years – something that would cost the taxpayer upwards of £100 billion. The Foreign Secretary is working on plans to provide billions of pounds in targeted support to pensioners and the poorest households, in addition to her existing pledges to reverse rises in National Insurance contributions and to abolish green levies on energy bills. Ms Truss, who is devising the package of support with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, widely expected to become her Chancellor, said: 'Ultimately I am an optimist and I believe things can and will get better, but only if we take tough and decisive action. 'I know that times are difficult and families are under huge financial strain. I get it, and if I become Prime Minister I will offer immediate support to make life easier. I will focus on growing the economy and fixing the root causes of the challenges we face now – I will take action to make sure Britain is not in this position again.' She added: 'To realise a better future we have to do things differently and be prepared to be bold. As Prime Minister, I will unleash Britain's post-Brexit potential. I will unshackle our businesses in order to drive our growth. 'I will lower the tax burden from its 70-year high, so that businesses aren't penalised for creating jobs or providing the goods and services we use every day and so people can keep more of their money. 'I will reverse the National Insurance hike so businesses don't pay more to hire people. Pessimism and a managerial approach to Government will not work. 'My plan will unleash our great country's full potential and get our economy growing again – it is the only way to get us through the tough times ahead.' It comes after Boris Johnson said whoever succeeds him in No 10 would announce 'another huge package of financial support' as Britain faces sky-high costs this winter. The outgoing Prime Minister hinted at the scale of the options to ease the burden being teed up for either Ms Truss or Mr Sunak to consider, as he insisted 'we must and we will help people through the crisis'. Cabinet minister George Eustice added that it is 'right' that the next leader waits until they take office to weigh up all the potential moves to combat the cost-of-living crunch. In an article for Mail+, Mr Johnson acknowledged the next few months will be difficult - 'perhaps very tough' - as 'eye-watering' energy bills take their toll, but he forecast the UK will emerge 'stronger and more prosperous (on) the other side'. He said 'colossal sums of taxpayers' money' had already been committed to assisting people with their bills. But he added: 'Next month - whoever takes over from me - the Government will announce another huge package of financial support.' Mr Eustice said both leadership candidates had already set out 'some specific things' they would do to ease the strain, but argued it was right that whoever secures the keys to No 10 would 'want to look at all of the options properly costed' once they started in the role. It comes as Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has suggested people earning around £45,000 per year could be among those struggling to cope with soaring living costs as the energy price cap is hiked again. The Cabinet minister, who is unlikely to be Chancellor if Ms Truss gets the keys to No10, said things will be 'really hard' for middle-earners on £45,000, as well as society's most vulnerable, with the price rise set to push the average household's yearly bill up from £1,971 to £3,549. Mr Sunak has already said he will provide additional support targeted at the most vulnerable. He reiterated this in an article for The Times on Saturday, arguing efforts should be focused on low-income households and pensioners, with help delivered through the welfare system, winter fuel and cold weather payments. The ex-Chancellor said it is 'right to caution against providing definitive answers before getting into Downing Street', as it is 'responsible' to first have 'full command of the fiscal situation'. But he acknowledged that providing 'meaningful support' would be a 'multibillion-pound undertaking'. Ms Truss, meanwhile, has promised 'decisive action' to deliver 'immediate support' if she wins the contest. She has also argued it is not 'right' to announce her full plan before the contest is over or she has seen all the analysis being prepared in Whitehall. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: 'We know people are concerned about rising prices, and that's why we've introduced £37 billion help for households, targeted at the most in need. 'We are also making the necessary preparations to ensure a new government has options to deliver additional support as quickly as possible, as the Chancellor has made clear. 'And as the Prime Minister has made clear, no major fiscal decisions will be taken until the new prime minister is in post.' By Boris Johnson for the Daily Mail The months ahead are going to be tough, perhaps very tough. Our energy bills are going to be eye-watering. For many of us, the cost of heating our homes is already frightening. And yet I have never been more certain that we will come through this well – and that Britain will emerge stronger and more prosperous the other side. Let us remember who caused this global surge in the cost of energy, and what is at stake. Yes, we were already seeing supply chain pressures last year, caused by the aftershocks of Covid, and that was causing a rise in some global prices. But by the end of last year we were fixing it. The world was finding the lorry drivers. The container ships were moving. We were sourcing the silicon chips. What no one had bargained for was the decision of Vladimir Putin – and it was his decision alone – to launch a vicious and irrational attack, on February 24, against an innocent European country. It was Putin's barbaric invasion that spooked the energy markets. It is Putin's war that is costing British consumers. That is why your energy bill is doubling. I am afraid Putin knows it. He likes it. And he wants us to buckle. He believes that soft European politicians will not have the stomach for the struggle – that this coming winter we will throw in the sponge, take off the sanctions and go begging for Russian oil and gas. He believes we will tire of backing Ukraine and begin discreetly to encourage the Ukrainians to do a deal, however nauseating, with the tyrant in the Kremlin. That would be utter madness. In this brutal arm-wrestle, the Ukrainian people can and will win. And so will Britain. With every month that goes by Putin's position grows weaker. His ability to bully and blackmail is diminishing. And Britain's position will grow stronger. We must and we will help people through the crisis. Colossal sums of taxpayers' money are already committed to helping people pay their bills. That cash is flowing now – and will continue to flow in the months ahead. Another chunk of the £650 is already due to go to the eight million most vulnerable households this autumn. There is another £300 going to pensioners in November, £150 for the disabled and £400 for all energy bill payers. Next month – whoever takes over from me – the Government will announce another huge package of financial support. It is worth remembering why we are in a position to make these payments. We have the cash to support families across the country because we have already proved the pessimists wrong. I remember sitting in the Cabinet room for an economic briefing in 2020 as the waves of the pandemic broke over the world and we saw the biggest drop in output for 300 years. They told me UK unemployment would top 14 per cent. They said that millions would be thrown on to the economic scrapheap – with all the consequent costs to the Exchequer. They were wrong. After becoming the first country in the world to approve an effective vaccine, we staged the fastest vaccine roll-out in Europe, the fastest exit from Covid. As a result we had the fastest growth in the G7 last year and instead of mass unemployment we have about 640,000 MORE people in payrolled employment than before the pandemic began. Instead of being at 14 per cent, unemployment is at 3.8 per cent, nearly the lowest for almost 50 years. That is giving us the fundamental economic strength to endure this crisis – as the Russian economy continues to melt down. We are ending our dependency on Russian hydrocarbons. In June, for the first time in decades, we did not import any fuel from Russia. The UK has already stepped up production of domestic gas – 26 per cent more this year than last. With every new wind farm we build offshore, with every new nuclear project we approve, we strengthen our strategic position. We become less vulnerable to the vagaries of the global gas price and less vulnerable to Putin's pressure. It is this Government that has reversed the apathy of decades and greenlighted new nuclear plants. For 13 wasted years Labour refused to approve a single new project, with the result that the nuclear industry was heading for near collapse. We are going to build a new reactor every year and will have a colossal 50 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030 – almost half our total electricity consumption. This British Energy Security Strategy is just a part of a vast programme to make the economy more productive and competitive. In just three years we have increased the coverage of gigabit broadband from seven per cent of households to 70 per cent. We are strengthening the economic sinews of the country with the biggest investment in rail – three new high speed lines – for a century. We have invested massively in skills, so that people can improve their qualifications throughout their lives. We have taken decisive steps to make this the best place in the world to invest and start a business. We are axeing dozens of burdensome EU laws that acted as unnecessary deterrents to investment. We are creating eight new free-ports, cutting taxes on investment and lengthening our lead as a science superpower – with £22 billion of investment in science and a new Advanced Research agency to crack the big problems of our time, from dementia to zero carbon aviation. All this is paying off in jobs and growth. In the first quarter of this year the UK attracted more venture capital investment in technology than China. We have more tech investment than France, Germany and Israel combined and we produce a new billion-pound 'unicorn' company roughly every two weeks. These new ideas are blooming not just in the golden triangle of Oxford, Cambridge and London but across the whole UK as we drive forward our levelling up agenda. We have laid the foundations for long-term gains in prosperity and productivity. We know we will bounce back from the crisis in the cost of energy as we rapidly build up our own UK supplies. That is why we will succeed and why we cannot flinch now. If Putin is allowed to get away with his murder and mayhem, and to change the borders of Europe by force, then he will simply do it again, elsewhere on the periphery of the former Soviet Union. Other countries will draw the lesson that violence and aggression can pay off and that will usher in a new cycle of political and economic instability. That is why we must continue to back the Ukrainians – and their military success continues to be remarkable. Volodymyr Zelensky has shown his country is fundamentally unconquerable. Now is the time for the West to double down our support, not to go wobbly. Now is the time to keep our nerve and ignore Labour and the union barons with their calls for endless fools' gold – inflationary pay rises and taxpayer-funded support to some of the richest households. We have more than enough resilience to get through tough months ahead. We have shown that before. And we have made the long term decisions – including on domestic energy supply – to ensure that our bounceback can and should be remarkable and that our future will be golden. Boris Johnson vows that Britain will not buckle in the face of the cost-of-living crisis while No 10 contender Liz Truss has turned 'more than half an eye to Government' as leadership race nears its conclusion By Glen Owen, Political Editor for The Mail on Sunday Boris Johnson has vowed that Britain will not 'buckle' under the pressure of the soaring cost of living, as he predicts a 'golden' future under his successor as Prime Minister. With just over a week to go before he leaves Downing Street, Mr Johnson uses a valedictory article in The Mail on Sunday to argue that the country will emerge 'stronger and more prosperous' after the crisis, which he blames on Russian President Vladimir Putin's disruptions to gas supplies. The Prime Minister writes: 'It is Putin's war that is costing British consumers. That is why your energy bill is doubling. I am afraid Putin knows it. He likes it. And he wants us to buckle.' He adds: 'With every month that goes by Putin's position grows weaker. His ability to bully and blackmail is diminishing. And Britain's position will grow stronger. 'We must and we will help people through the crisis. Colossal sums of taxpayers' money are already committed to helping people pay their bills. 'That cash is flowing now – and will continue to flow in the months ahead.' Mr Johnson, who will resign on 6 September, concludes: 'We have more than enough resilience to get through the tough months ahead. 'We have shown that before. And we have made the long-term decisions – including on domestic energy supply – to ensure our bounceback can, and should, be remarkable, and that our future will be golden.' His vow comes as his likely successor, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, is drawing up a multi-billion-pound package of targeted support for households, which she is planning to announce in an emergency Budget next month. It will come in addition to support already put forward by the Government, including £650 for the eight million most vulnerable households. Ms Truss, who holds a substantial poll lead over her leadership rival Rishi Sunak, tells The Mail on Sunday that the public should not fear the coming months. 'I have a clear plan to get Britain through this storm and out the other side, and the determination to deliver it,' she says. 'A recession is not inevitable, but we need to make sure we do not talk ourselves into one. I don't believe in managed decline and I won't accept it. I believe in hope over fear.' The war in Ukraine has triggered huge hikes in energy bills, which analysts fear will combine with double-digit inflation and rising interest rates to wipe out the savings of millions of households. On Friday, the regulator Ofgem announced that the energy price cap would rise from £1,971 to £3,549 a year on October 1, with experts forecasting further rises to as much as £7,000 by April. In other developments: Ms Truss is planning to emulate Margaret Thatcher by appointing her own personal economics guru to advise her on the Government's response to the growing economic crisis and maximise the UK's post-Brexit opportunities; The Foreign Secretary is planning to 'rehabilitate' some supporters of Mr Sunak when she makes the expected appointments to her Government, as part of a philosophy of having the 'best players on the pitch'. Sunak backers, such as former Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick, will be offered jobs if they have behaved with 'decorum' during the contest; The bosses of Britain's biggest energy and utility companies pocketed £30 million in pay between them last year as families face an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis; Despite the catastrophic price rises, every energy user will end up paying a levy of £250 to pay for the failures of utility bosses. A source on the Truss campaign said: 'There's no complacency in our camp. This contest isn't over and Liz is fighting for every vote, but we are turning more than half an eye to government. 'Liz will cut the c**p, cut the infighting in Downing Street, and make sure the whole operation of government is focused on delivering the things people care about.' The source added: 'Liz gets that things will be difficult this autumn and winter, but fundamentally she is optimistic and hopeful about the future. 'She's got a clear plan to get us through tough times and out the other side, and a clear plan to get the country firing on all cylinders in the longer term.'"

Martial arts enthusiast Mr Raab was seen taking part in the two-hour session at a Laser Tag centre in Horsham, West Sussex, on Wednesday. He was pictured wearing a camouflage hat and was said to have been part of a winning team of martial arts instructors and their families, The Sun reports. Organiser Matt Leyh, 45, told the publication he was 'surprised' to see the deputy prime minister, who is a karate black belt. He said: 'I didn't realise until later that it was the same day Boris was in Kyiv - so Dominic Raab probably should have been elsewhere.' The Prime Minister meanwhile travelled to the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday to mark the country's independence day, which marks 31 years since Ukraine broke free from Soviet rule. Mr Johnson used the trip - his third to Kyiv since the start of Russia's barbaric invasion in late February - to announce a new £54million package of British military support. He also held a final round of face-to-face talks with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, as the country prepares to enter winter still in conflict with Russia. With both the premier and his deputy away from Downing Street on Wednesday, political opponents have accused Mr Johnson of leading a 'zombie government' during the worst economic climate Britain has experienced in 50 years. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: 'At a time of national economic crisis, the first duty of any government is to reassure people and show they've got a plan. 'But this zombie government isn't stepping up to the plate.' A Government spokeswoman said the Prime Minister was in contact with officials while in Ukraine on Wednesday and therefore there was no need to delegate any duties. She added that Mr Rabb was on annual leave on that day."

Pessimism and a managerial approach to Government will not work. ‘My plan will unleash our great country’s full potential and get our economy growing again – it is the only way to get us through the tough times ahead.’ It comes after Boris Johnson said whoever succeeds him in No 10 would announce 'another huge package of financial support' as Britain faces sky-high costs this winter. The outgoing Prime Minister hinted at the scale of the options to ease the burden being teed up for either Ms Truss or Mr Sunak to consider, as he insisted 'we must and we will help people through the crisis'. Cabinet minister George Eustice added that it is 'right' that the next leader waits until they take office to weigh up all the potential moves to combat the cost-of-living crunch. In an article for Mail+, Mr Johnson acknowledged the next few months will be difficult - 'perhaps very tough' - as 'eye-watering' energy bills take their toll, but he forecast the UK will emerge 'stronger and more prosperous (on) the other side'. He said 'colossal sums of taxpayers' money' had already been committed to assisting people with their bills. But he added: 'Next month - whoever takes over from me - the Government will announce another huge package of financial support.' Mr Eustice said both leadership candidates had already set out ""some specific things"" they would do to ease the strain, but argued it was right that whoever secures the keys to No 10 would ""want to look at all of the options properly costed"" once they started in the role. It comes as Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has suggested people earning around £45,000 per year could be among those struggling to cope with soaring living costs as the energy price cap is hiked again. The Cabinet minister, who is unlikely to be Chancellor if Ms Truss gets the keys to No10, said things will be 'really hard' for middle-earners on £45,000, as well as society's most vulnerable, with the price rise set to push the average household's yearly bill up from £1,971 to £3,549. Mr Sunak has already said he will provide additional support targeted at the most vulnerable. He reiterated this in an article for The Times on Saturday, arguing efforts should be focused on low-income households and pensioners, with help delivered through the welfare system, winter fuel and cold weather payments. The ex-Chancellor said it is 'right to caution against providing definitive answers before getting into Downing Street', as it is 'responsible' to first have 'full command of the fiscal situation'. But he acknowledged that providing 'meaningful support' would be a 'multibillion-pound undertaking'. Ms Truss, meanwhile, has promised 'decisive action' to deliver 'immediate support' if she wins the contest. She has also argued it is not 'right' to announce her full plan before the contest is over or she has seen all the analysis being prepared in Whitehall. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: 'We know people are concerned about rising prices, and that's why we've introduced £37 billion help for households, targeted at the most in need. 'We are also making the necessary preparations to ensure a new government has options to deliver additional support as quickly as possible, as the Chancellor has made clear. 'And as the Prime Minister has made clear, no major fiscal decisions will be taken until the new prime minister is in post.' By Boris Johnson for the Daily Mail The months ahead are going to be tough, perhaps very tough. Our energy bills are going to be eye-watering. For many of us, the cost of heating our homes is already frightening. And yet I have never been more certain that we will come through this well – and that Britain will emerge stronger and more prosperous the other side. Let us remember who caused this global surge in the cost of energy, and what is at stake. Yes, we were already seeing supply chain pressures last year, caused by the aftershocks of Covid, and that was causing a rise in some global prices. But by the end of last year we were fixing it. The world was finding the lorry drivers. The container ships were moving. We were sourcing the silicon chips. What no one had bargained for was the decision of Vladimir Putin – and it was his decision alone – to launch a vicious and irrational attack, on February 24, against an innocent European country. It was Putin’s barbaric invasion that spooked the energy markets. It is Putin’s war that is costing British consumers. That is why your energy bill is doubling. I am afraid Putin knows it. He likes it. And he wants us to buckle. He believes that soft European politicians will not have the stomach for the struggle – that this coming winter we will throw in the sponge, take off the sanctions and go begging for Russian oil and gas. He believes we will tire of backing Ukraine and begin discreetly to encourage the Ukrainians to do a deal, however nauseating, with the tyrant in the Kremlin. That would be utter madness. In this brutal arm-wrestle, the Ukrainian people can and will win. And so will Britain. With every month that goes by Putin’s position grows weaker. His ability to bully and blackmail is diminishing. And Britain’s position will grow stronger. We must and we will help people through the crisis. Colossal sums of taxpayers’ money are already committed to helping people pay their bills. That cash is flowing now – and will continue to flow in the months ahead. Another chunk of the £650 is already due to go to the eight million most vulnerable households this autumn. There is another £300 going to pensioners in November, £150 for the disabled and £400 for all energy bill payers. Next month – whoever takes over from me – the Government will announce another huge package of financial support. It is worth remembering why we are in a position to make these payments. We have the cash to support families across the country because we have already proved the pessimists wrong. I remember sitting in the Cabinet room for an economic briefing in 2020 as the waves of the pandemic broke over the world and we saw the biggest drop in output for 300 years. They told me UK unemployment would top 14 per cent. They said that millions would be thrown on to the economic scrapheap – with all the consequent costs to the Exchequer. They were wrong. After becoming the first country in the world to approve an effective vaccine, we staged the fastest vaccine roll-out in Europe, the fastest exit from Covid. As a result we had the fastest growth in the G7 last year and instead of mass unemployment we have about 640,000 MORE people in payrolled employment than before the pandemic began. Instead of being at 14 per cent, unemployment is at 3.8 per cent, nearly the lowest for almost 50 years. That is giving us the fundamental economic strength to endure this crisis – as the Russian economy continues to melt down. We are ending our dependency on Russian hydrocarbons. In June, for the first time in decades, we did not import any fuel from Russia. The UK has already stepped up production of domestic gas – 26 per cent more this year than last. With every new wind farm we build offshore, with every new nuclear project we approve, we strengthen our strategic position. We become less vulnerable to the vagaries of the global gas price and less vulnerable to Putin’s pressure. It is this Government that has reversed the apathy of decades and greenlighted new nuclear plants. For 13 wasted years Labour refused to approve a single new project, with the result that the nuclear industry was heading for near collapse. We are going to build a new reactor every year and will have a colossal 50 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030 – almost half our total electricity consumption. This British Energy Security Strategy is just a part of a vast programme to make the economy more productive and competitive. In just three years we have increased the coverage of gigabit broadband from seven per cent of households to 70 per cent. We are strengthening the economic sinews of the country with the biggest investment in rail – three new high speed lines – for a century. We have invested massively in skills, so that people can improve their qualifications throughout their lives. We have taken decisive steps to make this the best place in the world to invest and start a business. We are axeing dozens of burdensome EU laws that acted as unnecessary deterrents to investment. We are creating eight new free-ports, cutting taxes on investment and lengthening our lead as a science superpower – with £22 billion of investment in science and a new Advanced Research agency to crack the big problems of our time, from dementia to zero carbon aviation. All this is paying off in jobs and growth. In the first quarter of this year the UK attracted more venture capital investment in technology than China. We have more tech investment than France, Germany and Israel combined and we produce a new billion-pound ‘unicorn’ company roughly every two weeks. These new ideas are blooming not just in the golden triangle of Oxford, Cambridge and London but across the whole UK as we drive forward our levelling up agenda. We have laid the foundations for long-term gains in prosperity and productivity. We know we will bounce back from the crisis in the cost of energy as we rapidly build up our own UK supplies. That is why we will succeed and why we cannot flinch now. If Putin is allowed to get away with his murder and mayhem, and to change the borders of Europe by force, then he will simply do it again, elsewhere on the periphery of the former Soviet Union. Other countries will draw the lesson that violence and aggression can pay off and that will usher in a new cycle of political and economic instability. That is why we must continue to back the Ukrainians – and their military success continues to be remarkable. Volodymyr Zelensky has shown his country is fundamentally unconquerable. Now is the time for the West to double down our support, not to go wobbly. Now is the time to keep our nerve and ignore Labour and the union barons with their calls for endless fools’ gold – inflationary pay rises and taxpayer-funded support to some of the richest households. We have more than enough resilience to get through tough months ahead. We have shown that before. And we have made the long term decisions – including on domestic energy supply – to ensure that our bounceback can and should be remarkable and that our future will be golden. Boris Johnson vows that Britain will not buckle in the face of the cost-of-living crisis while No 10 contender Liz Truss has turned 'more than half an eye to Government' as leadership race nears its conclusion By Glen Owen, Political Editor for The Mail on Sunday Boris Johnson has vowed that Britain will not ‘buckle’ under the pressure of the soaring cost of living, as he predicts a ‘golden’ future under his successor as Prime Minister. With just over a week to go before he leaves Downing Street, Mr Johnson uses a valedictory article in The Mail on Sunday to argue that the country will emerge ‘stronger and more prosperous’ after the crisis, which he blames on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s disruptions to gas supplies. The Prime Minister writes: ‘It is Putin’s war that is costing British consumers. That is why your energy bill is doubling. I am afraid Putin knows it. He likes it. And he wants us to buckle.’ He adds: ‘With every month that goes by Putin’s position grows weaker. His ability to bully and blackmail is diminishing. And Britain’s position will grow stronger. ‘We must and we will help people through the crisis. Colossal sums of taxpayers’ money are already committed to helping people pay their bills. ‘That cash is flowing now – and will continue to flow in the months ahead.’ Mr Johnson, who will resign on 6 September, concludes: ‘We have more than enough resilience to get through the tough months ahead. ‘We have shown that before. And we have made the long-term decisions – including on domestic energy supply – to ensure our bounceback can, and should, be remarkable, and that our future will be golden.’ His vow comes as his likely successor, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, is drawing up a multi-billion-pound package of targeted support for households, which she is planning to announce in an emergency Budget next month. It will come in addition to support already put forward by the Government, including £650 for the eight million most vulnerable households. Ms Truss, who holds a substantial poll lead over her leadership rival Rishi Sunak, tells The Mail on Sunday that the public should not fear the coming months. ‘I have a clear plan to get Britain through this storm and out the other side, and the determination to deliver it,’ she says. ‘A recession is not inevitable, but we need to make sure we do not talk ourselves into one. I don’t believe in managed decline and I won’t accept it. I believe in hope over fear.’ The war in Ukraine has triggered huge hikes in energy bills, which analysts fear will combine with double-digit inflation and rising interest rates to wipe out the savings of millions of households. On Friday, the regulator Ofgem announced that the energy price cap would rise from £1,971 to £3,549 a year on October 1, with experts forecasting further rises to as much as £7,000 by April. In other developments: Ms Truss is planning to emulate Margaret Thatcher by appointing her own personal economics guru to advise her on the Government’s response to the growing economic crisis and maximise the UK’s post-Brexit opportunities; The Foreign Secretary is planning to ‘rehabilitate’ some supporters of Mr Sunak when she makes the expected appointments to her Government, as part of a philosophy of having the ‘best players on the pitch’. Sunak backers, such as former Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick, will be offered jobs if they have behaved with ‘decorum’ during the contest; The bosses of Britain’s biggest energy and utility companies pocketed £30 million in pay between them last year as families face an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis; Despite the catastrophic price rises, every energy user will end up paying a levy of £250 to pay for the failures of utility bosses. A source on the Truss campaign said: ‘There’s no complacency in our camp. This contest isn’t over and Liz is fighting for every vote, but we are turning more than half an eye to government. ‘Liz will cut the c**p, cut the infighting in Downing Street, and make sure the whole operation of government is focused on delivering the things people care about.’ The source added: ‘Liz gets that things will be difficult this autumn and winter, but fundamentally she is optimistic and hopeful about the future. ‘She’s got a clear plan to get us through tough times and out the other side, and a clear plan to get the country firing on all cylinders in the longer term.’"
2022-08-28,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11153303/Inflatable-incubators-created-UK-inventor-sent-save-premature-babies-Ukraine.html,Inflatable incubators created by award-winning UK inventor are being sent to help save premature babies in war-torn Ukraine,"Inflatable incubators made in Britain are helping to save the lives of premature babies in war-torn Ukraine. Nearly 35 of the so-called 'Mom' incubators have already been delivered to the country, and 16 more are on the way. A further 100 have been requested by the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, while it is estimated that as many as 400 may be needed to meet growing demand. The portable device, which has scooped a James Dyson Award for Innovation, is cheaper and easier to deliver, set up, clean and use than its traditional counterpart, offering much-needed flexibility to doctors and nurses battling to deliver and look after babies in dangerous conditions. Inventor James Roberts got the idea after watching a news item on the difficulties of providing newborn care in poorer regions of the world while he was a design student at Loughborough University. He said: 'Hospitals are being bombed – when air-raid sirens sound they cannot move the conventional systems. Our Mom device can be unplugged and transported to bunkers or shelters incredibly quickly, meaning that both nurses and the babies are protected and survive.' Some 15million babies are born prematurely every year, accounting for about one in ten of all births worldwide. Those born too early often have more health issues than babies born full-term and may face long-term problems that affect the brain, lungs, hearing or vision. Premature birth remains the leading cause of death in children under the age of five across the world. Made in Felixstowe, Suffolk, the new-style incubators are also being used in the UK on a smaller scale – four major NHS hospitals have them, including St Peter's in Chertsey, Surrey, and the Norfolk and Norwich, but with wider use in the pipeline. Incubators are critical to saving premature babies' lives as they keep them in a 'thermal neutral zone', which means they expend their energy growing as quickly as possible rather than in keeping warm. For every one degree Celsius a premature baby loses, it increases its chance of death by 28 per cent. Premature birth rates in Ukraine have soared since the outbreak of the war, due to the vulnerability of pregnant women forced to shelter in basements and bomb shelters with little or no medical help."
2022-08-28,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11153089/Putins-unhinged-TV-attack-dogs-say-delusional-Liz-Truss-belongs-kitchen-sexist-rants.html,Putin's unhinged TV attack dogs say 'delusional' Liz Truss 'belongs in the kitchen' in sexist rants after Britain's would-be PM warned 'Russia cannot prevail' in its war on Ukraine,"Putin's vile TV attack dogs have made a series of sexist slurs about Liz Truss, calling the Tory frontrunner 'delusional' and claiming that she 'belongs in the kitchen' - after she warned that Russia 'cannot prevail' in its war on Ukraine. The coverage of Britain's leadership election has turned increasingly misogynistic after the UK's Foreign Secretary said the Kremlin could not be allowed to get away with its barbaric invasion of its neighbour. 'Liz Truss doesn’t belong in politics, but in the kitchen,' said Igor Korotchenko, an analyst on Rossiya One. Korotchenko said Truss should 'demonstrate a woman's best qualities' and not 'behave like a vulgar woman at a political striptease show'. He also called Truss 'uneducated' and 'dangerous', hinting that he preferred her opponent Rishi Sunak, the former UK chancellor who is looking to replace sitting Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has promised to step down in September. He also claimed Truss said she would start a nuclear war with Russia. The remarks could have been an allusion to the Foreign Secretary vowing to push ahead with renewing Trident, the UK's nuclear programme, if she becomes Prime Minister. Meanwhile, the figurehead of Putin's propagandists Vladimir Solovyov, accused Truss of starting a religious war after Britain announced sanctions on the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox church. 'She has such delusions of grandeur. Such phantasmagoric audacity is unheard of since the times of the Tartars and the Mongols,' he said. 'Who does she think she is?' The pundits pointed to Truss' reaction to Talk TV new anchor Kate McCann fainting on air as an example of her weakness. The fall caused the Foreign Secretary to hold her face in shock and exclaim: 'Oh my God!' Less than 20 per cent of Russia’s MPs are women, reported the Telegraph, who quoted analysts saying that the attack on Truss should not come as a surprise. Russian pundits often attack Europe's female leaders — including Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin. On Saturday, Truss' campaign team set out her agenda for keeping Britain 'safe' after the ongoing war in Ukraine reached six months since Putin's army attempted to seize Kyiv by force. 'We thought that peace and stability were inevitable - but they aren't,' she said 'The era of complacency is over. We are living in an increasingly dangerous world and our security is under more threat than it has been in decades. 'We need to make sure that Britain has the deterrents it needs to lead the global efforts to tackle aggression from the likes of Russia and other authoritarian regimes.' The Foreign Secretary would see through the renewal of Britain's nuclear deterrent, which is 'the ultimate guarantee of our sovereignty', her campaign said. She would also update the Integrated Review of defence and foreign policy to 'reflect the evolving geopolitical landscape and increased malevolent activity that we have seen since it was first published in 2021'. Ms Truss said the country must rise to a 'generation-defining moment for freedom, security and liberty'. She added: 'We simply cannot allow aggressors to think they will go unchallenged.' Mr Sunak has said he views the Nato defence spending target of 2% of GDP as a 'floor and not a ceiling' and noted that spending is set to rise to 2.5% 'over time', but has refused to set 'arbitrary' goals. Speaking at the penultimate leadership hustings in Norwich on Thursday, he said: 'If Liz is here, as she probably said in her speech, she will invest 3% of GDP. 'Now, I'm not going to say that, not because I don't believe in investing in our armed forces, of course I do, and my record demonstrates that. 'It's just I don't believe in arbitrary targets when it comes to something as serious as the security of our realm.' It comes days after Truss vowed to declassify more intelligence on Russian activity, if she becomes prime minister next month, in a bid to further expose Putin's 'lies'. She has publicly recommitted British support for Ukraine should she replace Johnson in Downing Street. It has been reported that Truss is considering making a trip to Ukraine one of her first acts in office in a public show of support for Kyiv. Sunak, also pledging Britain's assistance to the embattled nation despite the outcome of the leadership contest, wrote an open letter in the Kyiv Post newspaper offering his reassurance to Ukrainians of continued UK support."
2022-08-28,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11144239/Real-reasons-Australian-construction-collapsing-Oracle-Homes-catastrophe.html,The REAL reason Australia's construction industry is collapsing - and it's not all Ukraine and supply chains as expert warns families wanting to build a house about the risk of a new 'vicious circle' in the sector,"The domino-like collapse of construction giants and property developers around Australia has largely been blamed on rising costs but that is only half the story. It has been a devastating period as many families have watched their 'great Australian dream' of home ownership turn to dust - and there is set to be more pain on the way. The story of why this is happening is not a simple one but what is easier to understand is the devastation wrought on people's lives as company after company collapses. While the war in Ukraine and delays in materials caused by Covid-disrupted supply chains have mostly been blamed for the chaos, others suggest the real reason for so many companies now going to the wall is because of their 'greed'. Specifically, some home builders scaled up their operations in response to the Federal government's building stimulus scheme, HomeBuilder, introduced in June 2020 during the Covid pandemic. The consequence of over-committed construction companies has been carnage in the industry. In the case of Oracle Building Corporation Pty Ltd - also known as Oracle Hunter Homes and Oracle Platinum Homes - there were 300 homes left in unfinished limbo in Queensland and NSW when it went into administration on Wednesday. But that's been far from the only such horror story this year. In Queensland Brisbane-based Besse Construction collapsed owing $1.7million and leaving 30 people out of work. Also in that state, Solido Builders Pty Ltd went into liquidation in May and Pivotal Homes Pty Ltd in June. Victorian builders Wulfrun Constructions Pty Ltd went into liquidation in July. Another Victorian builder, Waterford Homes, went bust a week earlier, owing at least $600,000 to 60 creditors. Construction giant Probuild went under in March owing more than $14million to 784 workers, while Gold Coast-based Condev appointed liquidators weeks later leaving creditors out of pocket $31million. Developers have also not been spared. It was reported in the Herald Sun this week that Victorian developer Caydon, which went into administration in July, owed a staggering $200million with around 130 apartments unsold. A number of high-profile projects have been scrapped or put on hold around Australia. Perth developer Sirona Urban has abandoned a $165million luxury tower, while Melbourne developer Central Equity has stopped a $500million apartment tower on the Gold Coast. Melbourne-based construction giant Metricon - one of the nation's largest companies - last month sparked rumours it was in trouble after holding crisis talks with clients and meeting with the Victorian Treasurer. The owners injected $30million into the embattled company, although bosses have denied it is at risk of entering liquidation. Sadly the swathe of destruction is unlikely to stop there with one liquidator saying the collapses are having a ripple effect through the industry. Bill Cotter from Robson Cotter Insolvency Group, the liquidators who have taken control of Oracle's assets, said the construction sector was at risk of entering a 'vicious circle' because of shortages of material. 'People won't pay the company because they are worried about not getting supplies, the company won't get its money so they can't pay their supplier,' Mr Cotter told Daily Mail Australia. 'Their suppliers don't get their money so they don't provide the goods or the subbies don't do the work. A homeowner won't pay the next instalment, so it is a vicious circle.' Mr Cotter called this a 'storm' of increasing costs, where delays in getting product become 'self-fulfilling'. Oracle's managing director Tom Orel also laid blame on the 'storm' of increased costs, according to the liquidators. 'Mr Orel has highlighted the well known difficult circumstances prevailing in the construction industry, including the recent and rapid rise in construction costs,' the liquidators said. 'These factors resulted in cost overruns and delays in project completions, which severely impacted the company's cash flows and its capacity to continue to operate despite the owners and staff's best endeavours.' While supply issues and shortages of staff have driven up prices it leaves out the other side of the economic equation - demand. Dale Liston learnt of Oracle's collapse by idly scrolling through Facebook while he was laid up in hospital recovering from an operation for Crohn's Disease. For Mr Liston this was catastrophic news. Oracle was building his house on Logan Reserve on the outer southern outskirts of Brisbane. As it stands Mr Liston has been left with a 'shell' of a house that has brick wall and a roof but is largely unfinished inside and out. While Mr Liston understands that there are factors inflating the costs of construction, he has another explanation for what happened. 'It's all based around greed in my opinion,' he said. 'He (Mr Orel) bit off more than he can chew.' Mr Liston said that with buyers spurred on by the Morrison government's HomeBuilder scheme, Oracle took on more projects than it could reasonably deliver. 'They've just seen all these dollar signs and said ""so we'll take on four times what they have built in the past and hope it all works"",' Mr Liston said. Records kept by the state's industry watchdog, the Queensland Building and Construction Commission industry, back up Mr Liston's claim. Oracle quadrupled the amount of contracts in the space of a year. During the financial year 2019-20 it signed on 76 home contracts at a value of $22.4million. The next financial year it began 316 contracts increasing the value of work overseen to $90million. Russ Stephens, co-founder of Association of Professional Builders which advises on housing finance, said this was a staggering increase and a real warning sign. 'You can't scale a building company four times in a 12-month period,' he told the Australian Financial Review. Mr Stephens said with such a backlog of work the companies were struggling to deliver what they promised and that increased demand, along with supply constraints, sent costs soaring. 'Because costs kept going up 25 per cent a year … they were losing fortunes on every build,' he said. He pointed the finger at stimulus programs such as HomeBuilder, which provided up to $25,000 to buy a new house or to make a significant renovation. It was intended to act as a stimulus measure to boost the economy as Covid lockdowns, border closures and other restrictions began to bite. 'Whoever was advising the government gave them very poor advice because they didn't need stimulus,' Mr Stephens said. 'All we did was inflate the property market unnecessarily – we poured even more fuel on the fire for construction and did it while allowing builders to commit to fixed-price contracts without allowing escalation clauses.' Mr Liston has asked what watchdogs such as the QBCC were doing allowing builders to load up with work they could not possibly deliver. 'They are a contributing factor, I believe,' he said. 'They (the QBCC) are the ones that issued them (Oracle) with how much work they are meant to complete,' he said. '[They've] allowed these people to nearly quadruple the number of builds these people are allowed to complete in one year.' Mr Orel and the QBCC have been approached for comment. Mr Liston also said the QBCC were not being proactive enough in helping those left in the lurch with unfinished homes by Oracle's collapse. 'They are being reactive, which I understand, but being reactive to a problem doesn’t solve anything,' he said. 'They have got to help us. Sitting there and saying we are going to make a team to do this, it’s all well and good but it’s all words. 'I’ve had to call my mother in to try to help with this. 'I’ve got to jump through all these hoops to sort something out that isn’t my fault.' Master Builders Queensland CEO Paul Bidwell admitted Homebuilder, and another $40,000 package offer by the Queensland government to build in the regions, had pumped up demand. However, he said it was easy to say the market was overstimulated with the benefit of hindsight. 'Looking back a number of builders have said 'we didn't need HomeBuilder' - well that's OK but in 2019 we did need it,' he said. 'And there was a case for that stimulus... in 2019 we saw a bloodbath coming in 2020. 'These things are blunt instruments - when they turn them on it takes a while for them to gear up.' Mr Bidwell admitted some builders 'were more circumspect than others' in terms of how much work they loaded up. 'I am aware of some builders who thought it was a great opportunity to get a quantum leap in the size of their business, a one-off opportunity to go from a small to medium builder to be a big builder' he said. He pointed to a builder in Rockhampton who had pursued that opportunity and was 'probably regretting it'. 'At one point he was getting up and losing money everyday,' Mr Bidwell said. 'The contracts that he was signing when I last talked to him, he expected to make a profit from but he had a lot of work in progress that was losing money. 'Things got pretty grim. He's confident he will come out the other end but in a diminished state and that he will survive. 'That's because he was selling whatever assets he has to prop up his business and a lot of people have done that, so they have proved to be quite resilient. 'That story has played out to a greater or lesser extent across the board.' Looking ahead Mr Bidwell said there were 'mixed views' as to whether the worst was behind the industry. Sadly he predicted more failures but said he had actually predicted there would be more before now. 'If you tease it out more builders have got to fail but that hasn't happened,' he said. 'And that's because they are throwing whatever they can in to prop up their business but it's not sustainable. 'You'd hope conditions would ease as we go into next year but it's not going to right itself neatly.' He argued that multiple factors such as Covid smashing global supply chains, natural disasters, the war in Ukraine, and people in lockdown looking around their homes and deciding they wanted renovations, were unpredictable elements playing into the crisis. 'Who would have thought that all those things would coalesce and just sort of add on top of each other? Just sort of pile on?' he said. His main advice to builders and their clients was to talk to each other. He said some people were able to cover extra costs when asked by their builders, especially as rising property prices showed them the value of their investment. He also said there were 'some deals being done'. 'A guy on the Sunshine Coast ... the builder said to him the ""costs have gone up $30,000, how about I come back next year and build a pool"",' Mr Bidwell said. 'The owner said ""sure"".' However, this could only happen where the builder 'has been communicating with their clients - those who don't communicate don't do well'. 'They're going to feel the pain a lot sooner and a lot more harshly,' he said For Mr Liston, 33, he had hoped the house he was building would be his first and last home for himself, wife Peita and their three children aged four, 10 and 12. 'I was building something for my family for years and years,' he said. Even having already sunk $350,000 into the land and what has been completed of his house, Mr Liston now despairs that he will ever get to move into it. Mr Bidwell was quick to point to Queensland's 'statutory home warranty insurance scheme' which will pay up to $200,000 to complete works on insured homes. 'Everyone will get their home finished,' Mr Bidwell said, although he admitted it might take a long time and might be 'cold comfort' for some. Mr Liston said for him the whole experience of buying a first home had been 'marred'. If he got a payout where he broke even he would be happy to walk away 'and never think about this again'. Others are likely to feel the same way as long as the 'great Australian dream' continues to turn into a nightmare."

Sanctions have hit the Russian billionaire hard – his close ties to Vladimir Putin have led to accusations that he has blood on his hands over Ukraine – but onlookers said he seemed perfectly at ease. He ate and drank well, enjoying chateaubriand steak and expensive red wine. Ramazan Cesaret, owner of the CaesarEt Lounge steakhouse in the Turkish port of Gocek, was stunned to see the ‘globally famous’ guest at his table. He admitted to being nervous. These are troubling times for Kremlin-linked oligarchs. Turkey, though, is fast becoming the bolthole of choice for their super-yachts. No fewer than 11 of them – including four belonging to the former Chelsea FC owner – are berthed here, beyond UK, EU and US sanctions. It also helps that president Recep Erdogan’s regime is also close to Russia. Some of the yachts are still available for hire for rich party-goers. At least one of them is crewed by British staff. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Abramovich quickly moved his collection of boats – worth an estimated £1.1billion – from berths across the world to this part of the Mediterranean. The Mail on Sunday found two of them in Gocek last week. One is the Eclipse, a 533ft vessel worth more than £400million with two helicopter pads, two swimming pools, a disco and even an anti-missile system. It was anchored about two miles out at sea. It has the feel of a ghost ship, with five or six staff on board, instead of the usual 95. Turkish media reports claim most staff left after sanctions came into force because their salaries went unpaid. In the exclusive Azure Marina we spotted Abramovich’s Garcon – 219ft long and worth £17million – whose transponder, known as the Automatic Identification System (AIS), has been switched off since August 8 in what appears to be an attempt to avoid detection. Another Abramovich vessel, Halo – 180ft long and worth £32million which flies under the flag of the South Pacific’s Cook Islands – is also believed to be in Gocek. The billionaire’s fourth superyacht, My Solaris – 456ft long and worth about £430million, equipped with a helipad, gym, spa and several swimming pools – is anchored down the coast in Bodrum. Other yachts belonging to oligarchs in Gocek’s crystal-blue waters include the Flying Fox, anchored next to Garcon at Azure Marina. The 446ft vessel, worth more than £339million, is owned by Dmitry Kamenshchik, a Putin ally and boss of Moscow Domodedovo airport, which has had its AIS switched off since August 3. It appears the Flying Fox has resumed its charter service and has been hired at least three times for an astonishing £3million per week since its arrival in Gocek. One marine security guard told The Mail on Sunday an Arab prince had chartered it recently. Rory Jackson, an expert at Vessels Value, said Turkey is popular because it can ‘offer better yachting grounds’ than somewhere like Dubai, whose only appeal is the city itself. It is also beyond sanctions. He said: ‘When the sanctions fell it was not the Mediterranean season, so the oligarchs had time to think where they could take their yachts.’ Residents and businesses have mixed opinions about the influx of Russians into Gocek since Western sanctions were imposed. Sukru Aydin, 54, a tour boat operator, said: ‘Of course these yachts are a problem. Firstly they are anchored at sea and are obstructing small boats like ours. We cannot go near them as it triggers their alarm systems.’ But there is some support. Zeynep Ketenci, the owner of a boutique clothes shop, said: ‘Of course we have more Russians compared with last year. They are here because you want to take away their possessions. This is imperial.’ Back at the Caesar-Et Lounge, owner Mr Cesaret says the yachts do bring in business. He said that the Flying Fox’s mainly British crew are regulars in his restaurant. ‘Sometimes they come as a couple, and sometimes there are 30 of them. They eat and then they just drink and drink, usually red wine. They never care about money.’ When asked if Abramovich had enjoyed his meal, Mr Cesaret showed a gift that the billionaire had sent him the following day. It was a plaque with Eclipse on it – a celebration of a super-yacht evading sanctions."
2022-08-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11152903/Boris-Johnson-vows-Britain-not-buckle-fuel-crisis-leadership-race-nears-conclusion.html,Boris Johnson vows that Britain will not buckle in the face of the cost-of-living crisis while No 10 contender Liz Truss has turned 'more than half an eye to Government' as leadership race nears its conclusion,"Boris Johnson has vowed that Britain will not ‘buckle’ under the pressure of the soaring cost of living, as he predicts a ‘golden’ future under his successor as Prime Minister. With just over a week to go before he leaves Downing Street, Mr Johnson uses a valedictory article in The Mail on Sunday to argue that the country will emerge ‘stronger and more prosperous’ after the crisis, which he blames on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s disruptions to gas supplies. The Prime Minister writes: ‘It is Putin’s war that is costing British consumers. That is why your energy bill is doubling. I am afraid Putin knows it. He likes it. And he wants us to buckle.’ He adds: ‘With every month that goes by Putin’s position grows weaker. His ability to bully and blackmail is diminishing. And Britain’s position will grow stronger. ‘We must and we will help people through the crisis. Colossal sums of taxpayers’ money are already committed to helping people pay their bills. ‘That cash is flowing now – and will continue to flow in the months ahead.’ Mr Johnson, who will resign on 6 September, concludes: ‘We have more than enough resilience to get through the tough months ahead. ‘We have shown that before. And we have made the long-term decisions – including on domestic energy supply – to ensure our bounceback can, and should, be remarkable, and that our future will be golden.’ His vow comes as his likely successor, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, is drawing up a multi-billion-pound package of targeted support for households, which she is planning to announce in an emergency Budget next month. It will come in addition to support already put forward by the Government, including £650 for the eight million most vulnerable households. Ms Truss, who holds a substantial poll lead over her leadership rival Rishi Sunak, tells The Mail on Sunday that the public should not fear the coming months. ‘I have a clear plan to get Britain through this storm and out the other side, and the determination to deliver it,’ she says. ‘A recession is not inevitable, but we need to make sure we do not talk ourselves into one. I don’t believe in managed decline and I won’t accept it. I believe in hope over fear.’ The war in Ukraine has triggered huge hikes in energy bills, which analysts fear will combine with double-digit inflation and rising interest rates to wipe out the savings of millions of households. On Friday, the regulator Ofgem announced that the energy price cap would rise from £1,971 to £3,549 a year on October 1, with experts forecasting further rises to as much as £7,000 by April. In other developments: BORIS JOHNSON: Yes, the next few months will be very tough but I'm absolutely convinced Britain's bounceback will be golden The months ahead are going to be tough, perhaps very tough. Our energy bills are going to be eye-watering. For many of us, the cost of heating our homes is already frightening. And yet I have never been more certain that we will come through this well – and that Britain will emerge stronger and more prosperous the other side. Let us remember who caused this global surge in the cost of energy, and what is at stake. Yes, we were already seeing supply chain pressures last year, caused by the aftershocks of Covid, and that was causing a rise in some global prices. But by the end of last year we were fixing it. The world was finding the lorry drivers. The container ships were moving. We were sourcing the silicon chips. What no one had bargained for was the decision of Vladimir Putin – and it was his decision alone – to launch a vicious and irrational attack, on February 24, against an innocent European country. It was Putin’s barbaric invasion that spooked the energy markets. It is Putin’s war that is costing British consumers. That is why your energy bill is doubling. I am afraid Putin knows it. He likes it. And he wants us to buckle. He believes that soft European politicians will not have the stomach for the struggle – that this coming winter we will throw in the sponge, take off the sanctions and go begging for Russian oil and gas. He believes we will tire of backing Ukraine and begin discreetly to encourage the Ukrainians to do a deal, however nauseating, with the tyrant in the Kremlin. That would be utter madness. In this brutal arm-wrestle, the Ukrainian people can and will win. And so will Britain. With every month that goes by Putin’s position grows weaker. His ability to bully and blackmail is diminishing. And Britain’s position will grow stronger. We must and we will help people through the crisis. Colossal sums of taxpayers’ money are already committed to helping people pay their bills. That cash is flowing now – and will continue to flow in the months ahead. Another chunk of the £650 is already due to go to the eight million most vulnerable households this autumn. There is another £300 going to pensioners in November, £150 for the disabled and £400 for all energy bill payers. Next month – whoever takes over from me – the Government will announce another huge package of financial support. It is worth remembering why we are in a position to make these payments. We have the cash to support families across the country because we have already proved the pessimists wrong. I remember sitting in the Cabinet room for an economic briefing in 2020 as the waves of the pandemic broke over the world and we saw the biggest drop in output for 300 years. They told me UK unemployment would top 14 per cent. They said that millions would be thrown on to the economic scrapheap – with all the consequent costs to the Exchequer. They were wrong. After becoming the first country in the world to approve an effective vaccine, we staged the fastest vaccine roll-out in Europe, the fastest exit from Covid. As a result we had the fastest growth in the G7 last year and instead of mass unemployment we have about 640,000 MORE people in payrolled employment than before the pandemic began. Instead of being at 14 per cent, unemployment is at 3.8 per cent, nearly the lowest for almost 50 years. That is giving us the fundamental economic strength to endure this crisis – as the Russian economy continues to melt down. We are ending our dependency on Russian hydrocarbons. In June, for the first time in decades, we did not import any fuel from Russia. The UK has already stepped up production of domestic gas – 26 per cent more this year than last. With every new wind farm we build offshore, with every new nuclear project we approve, we strengthen our strategic position. We become less vulnerable to the vagaries of the global gas price and less vulnerable to Putin’s pressure. It is this Government that has reversed the apathy of decades and greenlighted new nuclear plants. For 13 wasted years Labour refused to approve a single new project, with the result that the nuclear industry was heading for near collapse. We are going to build a new reactor every year and will have a colossal 50 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030 – almost half our total electricity consumption. This British Energy Security Strategy is just a part of a vast programme to make the economy more productive and competitive. In just three years we have increased the coverage of gigabit broadband from seven per cent of households to 70 per cent. We are strengthening the economic sinews of the country with the biggest investment in rail – three new high speed lines – for a century. We have invested massively in skills, so that people can improve their qualifications throughout their lives. We have taken decisive steps to make this the best place in the world to invest and start a business. We are axeing dozens of burdensome EU laws that acted as unnecessary deterrents to investment. We are creating eight new free- ports, cutting taxes on investment and lengthening our lead as a science superpower – with £22 billion of investment in science and a new Advanced Research agency to crack the big problems of our time, from dementia to zero carbon aviation. All this is paying off in jobs and growth. In the first quarter of this year the UK attracted more venture capital investment in technology than China. We have more tech investment than France, Germany and Israel combined and we produce a new billion-pound ‘unicorn’ company roughly every two weeks. These new ideas are blooming not just in the golden triangle of Oxford, Cambridge and London but across the whole UK as we drive forward our levelling up agenda. We have laid the foundations for long-term gains in prosperity and productivity. We know we will bounce back from the crisis in the cost of energy as we rapidly build up our own UK supplies. That is why we will succeed and why we cannot flinch now. If Putin is allowed to get away with his murder and mayhem, and to change the borders of Europe by force, then he will simply do it again, elsewhere on the periphery of the former Soviet Union. Other countries will draw the lesson that violence and aggression can pay off and that will usher in a new cycle of political and economic instability. That is why we must continue to back the Ukrainians – and their military success continues to be remarkable. Volodymyr Zelensky has shown his country is fundamentally unconquerable. Now is the time for the West to double down our support, not to go wobbly. Now is the time to keep our nerve and ignore Labour and the union barons with their calls for endless fools’ gold – inflationary pay rises and taxpayer-funded support to some of the richest households. We have more than enough resilience to get through tough months ahead. We have shown that before. And we have made the long term decisions – including on domestic energy supply – to ensure that our bounceback can and should be remarkable and that our future will be golden."
2022-08-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11152465/Seventh-American-die-Ukraine-Russian-invasion-began-confirms.html,"Tennessee man, 24, whose death was confirmed on Friday is at least the seventh American to die fighting in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began","A 24-year-old man from Tennessee, who went to the frontlines to fight with the Ukrainian army, was killed by Russian forces this week, officials said. The soldier's name has been released by the Russian media, but his name was not released by the US government out of respect for the family, a State Department spokesperson said on Friday, Newsweek reported. The State Department spokesperson did confirm the young man's death. Oleg Kozhemyako, governor of Russia's far eastern Primorsky Krai region, made the announcement. He revealed the soldier's name and said that volunteers from the Primorsky 'Tiger' Detachment were responsible, the news outlet reported. 'An American mercenary has been destroyed in Ukraine. And this is in the first clash literally immediately after arriving at the front line!' Kozhemyako wrote in a telegram, a report said. The man was part of a group of trained foreign mercenaries and was killed by Russian volunteers from the Primorsky 'Tiger' Detachment unit. Kozhemyako said when the mercenaries approached the 'Tiger' volunteers they 'did not flinch and repulsed the attack, a report said. The governor would not reveal where the killing took place but did share some documents that indicated that the man had enrolled with Ukraine's armed forces nearly five weeks ago, on July 24, with the A344 military unit. The soldier may have been a 'marksman or shooter,' according to some images that are circulating online but the US State Department could not confirm the authenticity of the photos. Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) ombudsman for human rights Daria Morozova said the American was killed on Tuesday while fighting in the Kharkiv region. She said his body has been transferred to a mortuary in the DPR, CNN reported. Morozova said she had informed US officials and the head of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission confirmed their 'readiness to hand over his remains to his relatives for burial,' Morozova said, the news outlet reported. 'I want to reiterate that mercenaries are not being considered as combatants and the international humanitarian laws are not valid in their cases. These individuals are stripped of any immunity during the fighting,' she said. Morozova urged that 'any foreign nationals who came to Ukraine with militaristic purposes immediately leave the territory of the said country She added: 'Otherwise nobody will be held responsible for their lives and security.' This week marked six months since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an unprovoked war with Ukraine that started on February 24, 2022. It has been described as the 'largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled the war-torn region with parts of the Ukrainian region completely decimated by heavy artillery and bombing. Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers and innocent civilians have been killed. Seven American soldiers have been killed since the war began. Among the deceased are Luke Lucyszyn; Bryan Young; Willy Joseph Cancel and Stephen Zabielski."
2022-08-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11152001/Radiation-disaster-fears-grow-Putins-forces-accused-shelling-Ukraine-nuclear-plant.html,Radiation disaster fears grow as Putin's forces are accused of shelling Ukraine nuclear plant,"Russia was today again accused of shelling Europe's biggest nuclear power plant as the Ukrainian scientists in charge warned that 'radioactive substances' could leak. Operator Energoatom wrote via Telegram this afternoon that Russian bombing and weapons storage at the site posed 'serious risks' to the Zaporizhzhia power plant. They wrote: 'Over the past day, the Russian military has repeatedly shelled the site. The damage is currently being investigated. 'As a result of periodic shelling, the infrastructure of the station has been damaged, there are risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is high. 'The Ukrainian staff of [Zaporizhzhia] continues to work and make every effort to ensure nuclear and radiation safety.' As of midday local time, they added, the site 'operates with the risk of violating radiation and fire safety standards'. 'Ukraine calls on the world community to take immediate measures to force Russia to release [Zaporizhzhia] and transfer the power plant to the control of our state for the sake of the security of the whole world.' Russia accused Ukraine of shelling the plant, claiming 17 missiles were fired by Kyiv forces in the past 24 hours alone. Kremlin defence spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said: 'The Kyiv regime continues acts of nuclear terrorism at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.' Both sides' claims remain independently unverified. Locals in nearby Enerhodar have been prescribed iodine tablets in case radioactive leaks pose a threat to the resident population in the 50,000-strong town. A mission from the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency is expected to visit next week. Russia and Ukraine have continued to trade blame for shelling near the plant, which on Thursday sparked fires in the ash pits of a nearby coal power station that disconnected the plant from the power grid for the first time in its 30-year history. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday the situation at Zaporizhzhia remained 'very risky' after two of its six reactors were reconnected to the grid following shelling. Energoatom said on Friday evening that both of the plant's two functioning reactors had been reconnected to the grid and were again supplying electricity after they were fully disconnected on Thursday. The Russian ministry, in its daily briefing, also said it had destroyed a large ammunition depot in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region that had contained US-made HIMARS rocket systems and shells for M777 Howitzers. The Russian Air Force shot down a MiG-29 aircraft in the eastern Donetsk region, the ministry said, and destroyed another six missile and artillery weapons depots in the Donetsk, Mykolaiv and Kherson regions. Meanwhile dramatic surveillance footage shows the moment a Russian puppet official who switched sides in Ukraine was assassinated by resistance forces. Askyar Laishev worked for Ukraine's internal security service (SBU) before joining the Moscow-backed Luhansk People's Republic as head of intelligence in 2014. But members of Ukraine's National Resistance in the war-torn Donbas, eastern Ukraine got revenge by bombing his car as he drove through the city on August 11. It follows the similar killing of Putin official Ivan Sushko in Zaporizhzhia this week. The National Resistance stated: 'We emphasize once again that collaborationism is harmful to your health, so every traitor has vain hopes that retribution will not come to him.' External power is essential to cool the two reactors still in operation at the Zaporizhzhia site. Without electricity to power the pumps which keep the hot reactor core cool, nuclear fuel will start to melt. Last week, while the final power line was still connected, Ukraine's nuclear agency said losing the supply would lead to this happening, 'resulting in a release of radioactive substances to the environment'. A power supply is also vital to keep spent radioactive fuel stored in special onsite facilities cool. Speaking last week, Professor Paul Norman, Professor of Nuclear Physics & Nuclear Energy at the University of Birmingham told the Science Media Centre that nuclear reactors need constant cooling, even after they have been shut down. He added that: 'Damaging certain cooling systems could also prevent the reactor from properly cooling itself and lead to overheating – a 'meltdown'.' The plant has backup diesel generators to provide electricity if it is disconnected from the grid but Ukraine has warned these are unlikely to be reliable in the long-term."
2022-08-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11151763/EXCLUSIVE-Energy-bosss-plan-save-1-000-bills-cap-huge-oil-gas-profits.html,"EXCLUSIVE Energy boss's plan to save YOU £1,000 off your bills: Multimillionaire tycoon says government can slash gas and electricity prices in a moment if they target North Sea producers' record profits","An energy boss has called for a price cap on North Sea oil and gas producers, which he said could save British households £1,000 a month as families buckle under the strain of rising energy bills. Dale Vince, 60, founder of green energy company Ecotricity and owner of vegan football team Forest Green Rovers, told MailOnline the plan was 'the biggest single thing bar none' to tackle spiraling energy bills. Mr Vince said the 'exceptional' cost of living crisis would need a similar response from the government as the Covid-19 pandemic to help families through the winter, as hundreds of thousands face being pushed into poverty. UK gas prices have quadrupled since mid-June, sending bills sky-high for Brits struggling to make ends meet as prices continue to soar. Ofgem announced yesterday the energy price cap for an average household would increase to £3,549 a year from October. Mr Vince argued that to address the crisis, a limit should be set on the profits made by oil and gas producers in the UK North Sea - as there is on energy retailers, whose profits are capped at two per cent. His comments come as Harbour Energy, the biggest North Sea oil and gas producer, saw its profits increase by twentyfold this year from £102 million to an astonishing £1.3 billion as energy prices soar. Mr Vince told MailOnline: 'We have a price cap in [energy] retail sales to homes, we don’t have one on wholesale. We’ve done half a job, which causes lopsided problems. 'It’s simple in retail: energy companies are allowed to make two per cent profit, set by Ofgem. So you can have two per cent top of that for wholesale. 'Currently we let those guys sell it to us at global commodity prices set by the international market - that doesn’t make any sense to me. 'The government made a late and halfhearted attempt at a windfall tax on profits which will make next to no difference. 'We pay £1,800 for gas - that’s half of our energy bills. In broad terms, take that gas half away from bills and you could be saving £1,000 per household. Dale Vince, 60, is the founder of renewable company Ecotricity and self-made millionaire Once a penniless New Age traveler, Mr Vince first garnered attention when he won a battle to build his first wind turbine in Gloucestershire in 1996 Estimated to be worth £100 million, he is the owner of League One football team Forest Green Rovers The club became the first ever vegan football team in 2017 He said in April he would start the sale Ecotricity to fund a campaign in the next election, which he called 'the most important of my lifetime' Mr Vince has not declared for any political party, but he has donated to both Labour and the Greens in the past He is estimated to have made £100 million in the past 26 years and is expected to double that from the sale of Ecotricity 'Put it in and you take the problem away. 'It’s not just homes being affected, it’s small businesses - they can’t afford to pay their bills 'The government have to see it like the pandemic - an exceptional event.' Mr Vince estimated the amount saved by British households if the price cap was brought in would be £28 billion in total. He added that because the cost of all other energy sources is tied to gas, a profit limit on the North Sea industry would have a major impact. He said: 'In terms of solving the problem without throwing public money at it, it’s the biggest single thing bar none. 'You don’t need a tax for it and it could take £30 billion off energy bills.' 'A lot of people can’t pay for it, so the solutions are either public money or changing the system. '40 percent of our electricity comes from gas, but [gas prices] set the price for nuclear, coal and renewables - every other kind of energy we pay for. 'That could half the electricity bill if we did that, and half gas bills.' Oil and gas manufacturers have strongly opposed increased taxes, but the government u-turned to introduce a windfall tax in May to levy money from the industry as profits boom. Liz Truss, likely Britain's next Prime Minister, has repeatedly said she wants to cut taxes, and wants to 'maximise' oil and gas production, although output in the North Sea peaked 20 years ago. Soaring energy prices are partly the result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has caused energy company profits to soar. Households, meanwhile, face a potentially disastrous winter as average gas and electricity bills hit £3,549. There are concerns they could rise to over £5,000 next year Boris Johnson said yesterday his successor will 'plainly' have to help families out with paying their bills this winter. He said cash handouts are: 'Clearly going to be augmented, increased, by extra cash that the government is plainly going to be announcing in September.' He added: 'What I don't think what we should be doing is capping things for absolutely everybody, the richest households in the country. 'This will go on for a few months and it will go on over the winter. And it will be tough – and I'd be very clear about that – but in the end, we are also putting in the measures we need to ensure that we have the energy independence to get through this.' Charities have warned lives could be at risk this winter after the latest price hike, as the cost of heating homes is pushed beyond the reach of many. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi went as far as to suggest people should cut down on energy usage this winter. He said: 'The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption. It is a difficult time. There is war on our continent' He added the government 'know we need to do more' and said 'more help is on its way'. Money saving expert Martin Lewis said he was concerned about people dying this winter amid the cost of energy crisis. He told BBC News: 'This isn't about mechanics, this is about the will. We're going to have to take government funds whether from taxpayers or from debt and redistribute it down to some of the most vulnerable and stretching up to some middle earners. 'That is what we are going to have to do. 'I am begging and praying and pleading that there is more government help this winter so that people do not die.' 1) The government has to intervene to protect people from these madly high energy bills. It will cost some £40 billion to do it this winter, just 10 per cent of pandemic spending. The government has to recognise that the energy price crisis is an exceptional event like the pandemic and increase borrowing to protect millions of people from the consequences. Not doing so will be a false economy 2) Price cap North Sea gas and ban exports. Allow the same two per cent profit margin that OFGEM allows energy retailers - and fix the price. Half our gas comes from the North Sea (or could) and that will take away half the price rise problem. It will also stop windfall profits before they occur - leaving no need for proper windfall tax, which government clearly has no appetite for 3) Decouple the price of electricity from the price of gas. It makes no sense to let gas, from which we maybe get 40 per cent of our electricity, set the price for all the electricity we make in Britain. Especially when the price for gas is set by global commodity markets. We need to break the link 4) Launch a proper public information campaign, helping people to save energy. For example, changing the flow temperature on a gas boiler can reduce consumption by 10 per cent with no temperature reduction. The government needs to share this vital information to help people use less energy 5) Beyond this winter and these immediate moves - a national energy efficiency programme is urgently needed. We can knock maybe 30 per cent of our energy bills permanently this way 6) Unshackle onshore wind and solar - the fastest, cleanest and the cheapest form of new energy available to us bar none. And they need no public money - it's a free option the government could take 7) We need a green energy sprint. From the 50 per cent green electricity we have on the grid now - to 100 per cent. We could do it in 10 years easily enough or five if we deal with it as a national emergency 8) Replace fossil gas with green grass. We have the potential to make all the gas we need from grass - and create 160,000 jobs in the rural economy (providing a transition for farmers) with a big biodiversity boost. We can keep the gas grid we have and the gas appliances, just change the gas we put into it Source: Twitter/Dale Vince What is the energy price cap? The energy price cap decides the maximum cost per unit that energy companies can charge for both gas and electricity. This is then used to calculate a typical annual bill. The price cap was introduced in January 2019 as a way to ensure that households who do not have fixed deals - and who are, in some cases, less financially savvy - are not ripped off by their energy suppliers. Twice a year, energy regulator Ofgem would set the maximum price that households on their supplier's default tariff would have to pay for every unit of gas and electricity they used for the next six months. It allowed for a small profit - capped at 1.9 per cent - that energy suppliers were permitted to take for supplying the service. The frequency of the cap was increased on August 4 from every six to every three months. How is the price cap calculated? The cap is calculated by Ofgem based on the wholesale price of gas and electricity and also includes allowances for tax, charges paid to the energy networks, green levies and social payments. What is happening to the price cap? The price cap is going up significantly. The 80 per cent rise announced today - which comes into force from October 1 - will push the cap to £3,549 per year for the average household. This is the highest it has ever been. Can my bills be higher than the price cap? Experts warn there is no cap on the maximum households pay – but the cap is actually a maximum cost per unit that firms can charge for gas and electricity. The actual cap for each home therefore varies according to use. Ofgem said that from October 1 the equivalent per unit level of the price cap to the nearest pence for a typical customer paying by direct debit will be 52p per kWh for electricity customers and a standing charge of 46p per day. The equivalent per unit level for a typical gas customer is 15p per kWh with a standing charge of 28p per day. Why is the price cap going up? The price cap on energy bills is linked to the wholesale price of gas and electricity, which is itself based on what happens on European markets. The wholesale price of gas has soared by around eightfold in the last year. That rise has been passed onto customers in increments - the price cap was already at a record £1,971 over the summer. Gas prices were already increasing last summer as demand bounced as countries emerged from lockdown but the situation was made much worse when Russia invaded Ukraine and started to restrict gas exports to Europe. Gas prices are also decisive for electricity prices, because gas is so important for the generation of electricity. Over the last year, 42 per cent of the UK's electricity came from burning gas. Ofgem said the increase reflected the continued rise in global wholesale gas prices, which began to surge as the world unlocked from the Covid pandemic, and had been driven still higher to record levels by Russia's actions. When will the price cap change again? The price cap will be changed again in January 2023. It used to be changed twice a year, but changes announced on August 4 mean it will be reviewed every three months. It will change again in April, July and October 2023. What is the price cap likely to be like next year? Experts expect the cap to rise significantly in January 2023 and again in April, and then to fall back again in July and October next year - but the exact levels of the cap remains to be seen. Experts at Cornwall Insight expect the cap to hit £5,387 in January 2023, while those at consultancy Auxilione think it will hit £5,405. In April, Cornwall expects a £6,616 cap, while Auxilione believe it could reach £7,263. There is then an expectation that the price will fall. Cornwall's forecasts for the July and October 2023 caps are £5,897 and £5,887 respectively, while Auxilione expects it to reach £6,485 and £6,006. What does the new price cap mean for monthly bills? Experts at Uswitch estimate that monthly bills in October, November and December this year will hit between £243 and £513 a month, depending on the size of the home and usage, and based on the October price cap. They say 'low user groups' are usually one or two people living in a one to two-bedroom flat, who are at home in the evenings and weekends and have a weekly laundry cycle. They also use the heating occasionally and don't use a dishwasher or tumble dryer. These people are likely to spend around £243 a month on energy bills from October. Then, 'medium user groups' are typically families of three or four people living in a three-bedroom house. Some members are home in the day as well as in the evening and weekends. The heating is used regularly, and electrical appliances are often turned on. Laundry is done three times a week. Their average energy bill is likely to be £363. Finally, 'high user groups' tend to be large families with five or more living together in a four-bedroom house or larger. There is always someone at home in the day and and in the evenings and on weekends. There could be multiple television in use as well as a tumble dryer and dishwasher which are used regularly. Laundry is done daily. These groups are likely to face a bill of £513 a month from October. What is the cap's purpose? When Theresa May's government introduced the cap in January 2019, the aim was to protect households against profiteering energy giants. It would also, in theory, protect customers against sudden increases in bills. More recently, Ofgem has allowed the cap to rise in a way that protects energy firms from going bust amid the soaring cost of wholesale gas and therefore electricity. The effect is that bills are rising more sharply, and more often, to ensure suppliers can cover the spike in the wholesale prices of gas and electricity, which are around ten times higher than normal. Who is affected by the price cap? The new cap will come into effect for around 24million households in England, Scotland and Wales on default energy tariffs on October 1, and will remain in place until December 31, when it will be adjusted again. A few million people are on long-term fixed rates - which are not affected by the cap. However, many of these deals are expiring in the next few months. What is the cheapest way of paying for energy? Paying by direct debit tends to be the cheapest way of paying for electricity and gas, because energy companies normally provide a discount for those using this method as it reduces their costs and administration time. What about those on pre-payment meters? The 4.5million pre-payment meter customers, who are often the most vulnerable and already in fuel poverty, will see an even more punishing increase, with their average annual bill set to go up to £3,608. What support is available for you? It depends on your personal situation. All households have been promised a £400 discount on their energy bills. This support was announced in May, and will be paid in six monthly payments from October. For direct debit customers this will be taken off their payments, while prepayment meter customers will be given discount vouchers from the first week of every month. These will be issued by text, email or by post. Eight million of the most vulnerable households will also get extra support, taking the total they can get to £1,200. These include a £650 one-off payment to households on means-tested benefits, a £300 payment to pensioners, and £150 for six million people who receive disability benefits. Will the Government announce more support? Charities, think tanks, opposition parties and potential future prime ministers have said the Government will need to do more for struggling households. But extra support will have to wait until the next prime minister is in place. Consumer watchdog Which? has said the Government's financial support for all households must increase from the current £400 to £1,000 - or from £67 to £167 per month from October to March. However, no immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 after the Tory leadership contest. The current Government has said that it is exploring the options and will present them to the new prime minister when he or she comes into office next month. Should I switch tariffs? There are no fixed deals on the open market that come close to the incoming price cap. Yesterday, the cheapest one-year tariffs were priced at around £4,700. Forecaster Cornwall Insight suggests the cap will rise again to £5,386 in January and £6,616 in April. But anyone fixing with a £4,700 deal today will miss out on at least four months of savings when the price cap is cheaper. Overall, the average household would save just under £300 by fixing, if Cornwall Insight's figures are correct. But experts say this saving is still probably too marginal to risk switching. Joe Malinowski, of comparison service The Energy Shop, said: 'You would ideally want to fix to a tariff that is significantly below £5,000. 'Anyone who signs up to a £4,700 deal could end up regretting it if there is some kind of price freeze.' He added: 'In my opinion, there are too many uncertainties.' Is £3,549 what I'll be paying? This figure is based on the average energy use of a typical household. If you use more energy, your annual bills will be higher. This is because the price cap limits what suppliers can charge for the gas and electricity they sell per kilowatt hour (kWh) as well as their daily standing charges, which cover the cost of supplying your home. From October, your energy provider will be able to charge up to 52p per kWh for electricity and 15p per kWh for gas, up from 28p and 7p respectively. What if I'm on a pre-payment meter? Around 4.5million households use energy pre-payment meters and the price cap has historically been higher for these customers. From October the average pre-payment meter household will pay £3,608. Critics have long argued that this is unfair, when most prepayment customers are on low incomes. But energy firms argue that they face extra administrative costs for these households.

Putin sends scores of armoured vehicles including T80 and T72 tanks and self-propelled howitzers to Crimea as his henchman Medvedev claims Russians do NOT target civilians in Ukraine,"Dozens of Russian tanks and armoured cars were seen arriving in Crimea on Russian trains as Putin prepares to send more troops into Ukraine via the annexed region. Fighting in the crucial Donbas region has intensified in recent weeks as Moscow has sought to gain control of eastern Ukraine. But a series of Ukrainian strikes on valuable Russian fighter jets and ammunition warehouses in Crimea has reportedly forced Putin to change tack. The eerie footage recorded yesterday shows scores of T-80 and T-72 tanks as well as howitzer rocket launchers and armoured cars close to Taman in mainland Russia. Just across the Kerch Bridge is the Black Sea peninsula, which Putin stole in 2014. Other weaponry on the train included 152mm self-propelled Msta-S launchers and the 122mm regimental self-propelled 2S1 Gvozdika. Putin is thought to be moving new weaponry to the key Kherson region, where his forces are under threat of a Ukrainian fightback. The footage was revealed by Krym.Realii under the US government-backed Radio Liberty. Russia's reinforcements came as ex-president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev claimed his boss was 'most sparing' in his use of aggression in Ukraine. The Putin lackey said: 'We understand that [the war] is now proceeding in line with the most sparing, moderate option.' Claiming without evidence that there have been no civilian casualties, he said: 'Our country, as well as the forces of the Donetsk Republic and the Luhansk Republic, act only against the armed forces of Ukraine.' Russia could have ended the war by unleashing shock and awe on major cities, he said - but 'we didn't go for that option.' He insisted: 'This military campaign could have ended much faster. But there would have been completely different consequences for Ukraine. 'Its infrastructure would be completely destroyed, decision-making centers, authorities and so on would be destroyed.' Medvedev is now deputy head of Russia's powerful security council. He claimed Russia was 'forced' to invade Ukraine. The hardliner also blamed Kyiv leaders for failing to recognise the geopolitical realities and 'persecuting its own people' in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions."

Askyar Laishev worked for Ukraine's internal security service (SBU) before joining the Moscow-backed Luhansk People's Republic as head of intelligence in 2014. But members of Ukraine's National Resistance in the war-torn Donbas, eastern Ukraine got revenge by bombing his car as he drove through the city on August 11. Laishev made his way out of the car after the explosion, the underground fighters said, but died days later in hospital. It follows the similar killing of Putin official Ivan Sushko in Zaporizhzhia this week. The National Resistance stated: 'We emphasize once again that collaborationism is harmful to your health, so every traitor has vain hopes that retribution will not come to him.' Newly released CCTV video shows Laishev's car explode on Shevchenko Street, Staroblisk in Russian-held Luhansk, which fell under Russian control in early July. The huge explosion is followed by the flaming wreckage continuing to move down the street. Photos taken in the wake of the bombing show black patches and skid marks on the road. The footage has been widely shared among Ukrainian Telegram channels after it was leaked yesterday. Video of the audacious assassination plot came as Putin planned to pull his entire fleet of fighter jets out of Crimea following a flurry of Ukrainian hits on the planes. A secret document dated August 22 reported that Russia has already moved ten of its most capable fighter planes - six Su-35S and four MiG-31BM jets - out of the territory it annexed from Ukraine in 2014. They will return to airbases in mainland Russia. Ukraine has not officially taken responsibility for the attacks but multiple sources, including some Ukrainian officials, have suggested their special forces are likely to have been behind the blasts. The NATO document seen by Insider said that for now the Belbek airfield, close to Russia's Black Sea Fleet HQ in Sevastopol, still boasts a considerable number of military aircraft, but these are not thought adequate to maintain a consistent level of air support in the region. Moscow has instead deployed a greater number of surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft weapons systems in an attempt to protect against further strikes, according to the document."
2022-08-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11150993/Panicking-Putin-pulls-fighter-jets-Crimea-string-daring-Ukrainian-attacks.html,"'Panicking' Putin 'pulls all fighter jets out of Crimea after Ukraine special forces staged a string of daring attacks on Russian military bases deep in occupied peninsula', NATO report claims","An increasingly panicked Vladimir Putin is pulling all his fighter jets out of Crimea after Ukrainian special forces staged a series of daring attacks on Russian military bases deep in the occupied peninsula, NATO officials reportedly believe. The secret document dated August 22 reported that Russia has already moved 10 of its most capable fighter planes - six Su-35S and four MiG-31BM jets - out of the territory it annexed from Ukraine in 2014 and back to airbases in mainland Russia. The remainder of Putin's air force is expected to follow suit in the coming days, according to the report which was seen by Insider. Recent weeks have seen a trio of notable attacks strike the Sevastopol headquarters of Russia's famous Black Sea Fleet, an airbase in Saki - which resulted in the destruction of at least nine Russian jets and considerable damage to infrastructure - and an ammunition depot near Dzhankoi. Ukraine has not officially taken responsibility for the attacks but multiple sources, including some Ukrainian officials, have suggested their special forces are likely to have been behind the blasts. The hasty recall of Russian fighter jets from the occupied peninsula - an area Moscow previously considered secure and out of range of Ukrainian strikes - comes after Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) claimed 'more than half' of the combat jets stationed at the Saki airbase were either destroyed or damaged in the August 9 attack. Footage from Saki showed huge plumes of smoke rising from the brutalised base as beachgoers fled the nearby shores, piling into cars and causing huge queues on the motorways in their attempts to flee the peninsula which had previously remained untouched by the war. This month's unprecedented strikes on Russian positions in Crimea demonstrated both the Russians' vulnerability and the Ukrainians' capacity to strike deep behind enemy lines. One Western official said: 'Ukraine is now consistently achieving kinetic effects deep behind Russia's lines. 'The incidents have been having a material effect on Russia's logistics support, but as importantly, there's a significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership.' They added that the attacks had forced the Black Sea Fleet into a defensive posture and stymied Russia's ability to launch a successful amphibious assault on Odesa on Ukraine's coast, which would cut off much of Ukraine's access to the sea. The NATO document seen by Insider said that for now the Belbek airfield, close to Russia's Black Sea Fleet HQ in Sevastopol, still boasts a considerable number of military aircraft, but these are not thought adequate to maintain a consistent level of air support in the region. Moscow has instead deployed a greater number of surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft weapons systems in an attempt to protect against further strikes, according to the document. MailOnline has contacted NATO spokespeople for comment. Meanwhile in Ukraine, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant came back online Friday after power to the facility was severed on Thursday for the first time in its four-decade history due to 'actions of the invaders', state nuclear body Energoatom said. The operator said that as of 2:04 pm local time on Friday the plant 'is connected to the grid and produces electricity for the needs of Ukraine' once again. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country's nuclear experts had managed to protect the plant 'from the worst case scenario which is constantly being provoked by Russian forces.' But he added: 'I want to underline that the situation remains very risky and dangerous.' 'Russia has put Ukrainians as well as all Europeans one step away from radiation disaster,' he said. Energoatom said the outage was caused by ash pit fires at an adjacent thermal power plant, which damaged a line connecting the only two of the plant's six reactors in operation. Blaming Russian attacks for damage to the three other power lines linking the complex to the national grid, Energoatom said Friday afternoon one reactor had been reconnected 'and capacity is being added'. International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Mariano Grossi said Thursday he wants to visit the site within days, warning of potential disaster. Ukraine energy minister adviser Lana Zerkal said an IAEA inspection 'is planned for the next week'. Zelensky said Friday that the team needs to get there as soon as possible 'and help maintain the station under Ukrainian control on a permanent basis.' The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's largest - has been cause for mounting concern since Russian troops seized it in early March. In recent weeks, Kyiv and Moscow have traded blame for rocket strikes around the facility in the southern Ukrainian city of Energodar. Kyiv suspects Moscow intends to divert power from the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russian troops in 2014. On Thursday, Washington warned against any such move. 'The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine,' State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters, saying attempts to redirect power to occupied areas were 'unacceptable'. Britain's defence ministry said satellite imagery showed an increased presence of Russian troops at the power plant with armoured personnel carriers deployed within 200 feet of one reactor."

Fire damage to a transmission line at Europe’s largest nuclear plant caused a blackout across the region on Thursday and heightened fears of a catastrophe in a country still haunted by the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. Lana Zerkal, an adviser to Ukraine’s energy minister, said logistical issues were being worked out for the UN International Atomic Energy Agency team to head to Zaporizhzhia. The site has been occupied by Russian forces and run by Ukrainian workers since the early days of the invasion. Ukraine has accused Russia of trying to sabotage the visit and essentially holding the plant hostage, storing weapons there and launching attacks from around it. Moscow accuses Ukraine of recklessly firing on the facility. ‘Despite the fact that the Russians agreed for the mission to travel through the territory of Ukraine, they are now artificially creating all the conditions for the mission not to reach the facility,’ Miss Zerkal said. The atomic agency’s head, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said he hoped to send a team to the plant within days. Negotiations over how the experts would gain access are complicated but advancing, he added. Ukrainian officials said an area close to the plant came under a barrage of shelling yesterday morning. Its emergency generators were used to keep it working when it was cut off from the grid earlier in the week. That led Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to accuse Russia of nearly causing a ‘radiation disaster’. Russia blamed the transmission-line damage on a Ukrainian attack. Kyiv cannot shut down the country’s nuclear reactors because its four stations provide half its electricity. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is facing demands to call for an end to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and engage in negotiations with Vladimir Putin. MPs and MEPs from Mr Scholz’s pacifist SPD party wrote: ‘The weapons must be silent.’ It follows Germany’s precedent-breaking arms shipments to Ukraine and £85billion (€100billion) boost to its military budget. Parts of the SPD struggled to support the measures, prompting their intervention, but Ukraine’s ambassador to Berlin, Andrij Melnyk, branded the letter ‘heartless and oblivious to history’. Mr Scholz has stressed: ‘Ukraine must not lose.’"
2022-08-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11150635/Energy-crisis-Price-hike-wipe-savings-6-MILLION-families.html,"Britain's Big Squeeze 'is going to REALLY clobber the middle class': Chancellor Zahawi warns households on £45,000 could struggle with soaring living costs amid fears 80% energy price cap hike will wipe out savings of SIX MILLION families","Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has warned that millions of British households are going to struggle to pay soaring living costs as the country braces for an eyewatering 80 per cent hike in energy tariffs from October which experts fear could wipe out the savings of six million families. The Cabinet minister, who is unlikely to be Chancellor if Tory frontrunner Liz Truss gets the keys to No10, said things will be 'really hard' for middle-earners on £45,000, as well as society's most vulnerable, with the price rise set to push the average household's yearly bill up from £1,971 to £3,549. Industry regulator Ofgem warned the Government it must act urgently to 'match the scale of the crisis we have before us' as Britain faced the bleak news on Friday. The unprecedented hike means double-digit inflation is here to stay until possibly next winter, and dual-fuel bills could hit £6,600 a year. Mr Zahawi has declared he is working 'flat out' to draw up options for a plan of action for the next Prime Minister so they can 'hit the ground running' when they take office in September. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, he said he is exploring ways to ensure 'we help those who really need the help'. 'My concern is there are those who aren't on benefits,' he said. 'If you are a senior nurse or a senior teacher on £45,000 a year, you're having your energy bills go up by 80 per cent and will probably rise even higher in the new year - it's really hard. 'If you're a pensioner, it's really hard. So Universal Credit is a really effective way of targeting, but I'm looking at what else we can do to make sure we help those who really need the help. We're looking at all the options.' The newspaper said he refused to rule out freezing the energy cap as suggested by Labour, insisting 'nothing is off the table'. But he said: 'My concern about it is that it is universal. You're helping wealthier households, households like mine, where we can withstand the additional pressure of high energy costs, and that takes away from your ability to be resilient over the long term. 'It would be about £100 billion in about 18, 24 months. If I targeted that help, I'd be able to deliver more help to the most vulnerable.' He also reportedly said he is weighing up potential action to help small firms including Covid-style cuts to VAT and business rates to support the hospitality and leisure sectors. 'If we don't help those small and medium enterprises, my concern is the scarring effect, the longer-term scarring effect on the economy,' he said. Six million families could see their savings wiped out by the 80 per cent hike in energy tariffs, economists warned last night. Demands for higher direct debit payments – at an average of an extra £1,600 a year – will be sent out within days. And a second raid on family budgets is expected before Christmas when direct debits go up again in anticipation of another punishing price cap rise in the New Year. Energy costs are expected to stay sky-high until at least 2024. The price surge will drive inflation up to 14.2 per cent by January, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Professor Stephen Millard, its deputy director, said: 'The poorest households will now be spending 25 per cent of their income just on energy bills. 'Around 2.2million additional households [than previously predicted] will run out of savings by April 2024, bringing the total to around six million, nearly one in four.' The institute said the only answer to poverty and destitution was targeted assistance for the poorest households, rather than a general subsidy for all. Charities warned that the sick and elderly would die of illnesses made worse by the cold and damp. Adam Scorer of National Energy Action, a fuel poverty charity, said: 'There will be a cost in lives, not just a cost of living crisis.' In other developments: Ruby Blaken, 32, never used to have to worry about her energy bills. However, the mother-of three has already seen her direct debits rise by £100 in the last six months. And the latest price cap increase could raise them again to £334, more than three times what she was paying this time last year. She and her husband Michael have already gone through their bank statements to see where they can make savings. And so far the couple have cancelled several subscriptions and even some of their children's after-school clubs. Mrs Blaken, who lives in Wiltshire, said: 'We've had to ask if we can justify them doing things like swimming club, which is hard especially when they're at school and other kids are still going.' However as she runs her second-hand clothes business Second Snuggle from the family home, there is little she can do cut their energy costs. 'I'm trying to do anything I can, turning things like chargers, toasters and microwaves off at the wall and doing things quickly, but I'm not sure how I'm going to keep going,' Mrs Blaken added. 'We are just going to have to find the extra cash from other outgoings.' Should I switch tariffs? There are no fixed deals on the open market that come close to the incoming price cap. Yesterday, the cheapest one-year tariffs were priced at around £4,700. Forecaster Cornwall Insight suggests the cap will rise again to £5,386 in January and £6,616 in April. But anyone fixing with a £4,700 deal today will miss out on at least four months of savings when the price cap is cheaper. Overall, the average household would save just under £300 by fixing, if Cornwall Insight's figures are correct. But experts say this saving is still probably too marginal to risk switching. Joe Malinowski, of comparison service The Energy Shop, said: 'You would ideally want to fix to a tariff that is significantly below £5,000. 'Anyone who signs up to a £4,700 deal could end up regretting it if there is some kind of price freeze.' He added: 'In my opinion, there are too many uncertainties.' Is £3,549 what I'll be paying? This figure is based on the average energy use of a typical household. If you use more energy, your annual bills will be higher. This is because the price cap limits what suppliers can charge for the gas and electricity they sell per kilowatt hour (kWh) as well as their daily standing charges, which cover the cost of supplying your home. From October, your energy provider will be able to charge up to 52p per kWh for electricity and 15p per kWh for gas, up from 28p and 7p respectively. What if I'm on a pre-payment meter? Around 4.5million households use energy pre-payment meters and the price cap has historically been higher for these customers. From October the average pre-payment meter household will pay £3,608. Critics have long argued that this is unfair, when most prepayment customers are on low incomes. But energy firms argue that they face extra administrative costs for these households. By FIONA PARKER Ofgem changed the rules earlier this year to allow energy firms to change prices four times a year, rather than two. As a result, customers face one increase on October 1, another in January and then further changes in April and July. Joe Malinowski, of TheEnergyShop.com, said: 'As horrifying as this energy price cap increase is, the outlook is truly terrifying. 'With wholesale energy costs further accelerating even since this cap was set, energy bills of £5,000 and even £6,000 into 2023 start to come into sharp focus.' The energy cap announced yesterday is a limit on the price suppliers can charge per unit, not a cap on the total bill. This means some could be left paying significantly more than £3,549, which is the yearly calculation for the average household. Significantly, there is no cap on how much suppliers can charge firms. As a result, businesses from chip shops to industry, some producing vital CO2 gas, face closure. Ofgem chief Jonathan Brearley said: 'It will be devastating for many families when they hear how much their bills will go up. 'We have seen the slow and deliberate shut- off of one of Europe's major suppliers – Russia – of their gas. That has caused enormous price spikes in the market. So right now winter prices are 15 times the normal price. If that were happening with petrol, to fill your car would cost £400 to £500.' He urged people not to join protest campaigns such as Don't Pay UK because the cost of bad debts will be passed on to all customers. Asked whether bills could remain high for two years, he replied: 'We do need to prepare for a world where this does last some time.' Mr Zahawi said he was working on options to help householders through the winter, adding: 'We should all look at our energy consumption. It is a difficult time. There is war on our continent.' Mr Johnson attempted to offer reassurance, saying extra help was coming and accusing Putin of 'gas price blackmail'. Tory leadership frontrunner Liz Truss has promised an emergency budget to address the cost of living crunch if she enters No 10. Her spokesman said she would 'ensure people get the support needed to get through these tough times'. Her opponent Rishi Sunak told broadcasters that protecting households from rising energy bills would be his 'immediate priority'. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the rise in the energy price cap was 'nothing short of a catastrophe for millions of families and pensioners'. Labour's Rachel Reeves said the announcement would 'strike fear in the heart of many families, and force many to make unthinkable choices this winter'. The Government is offering all households a minimum of £400 in support with up to £1,200 for the poorest. Charities and consumer groups insist this does not reflect the magnitude of the bills shock. The energy industry argued the situation demanded a package on a par with the billions spent in the pandemic. Widow Yvonne Bailey has already lost 11 kilos this year as she cannot afford to properly feed herself. And the 77-year-old is concerned the winter will be much worse once the price cap rises. Miss Bailey, a former receptionist from West Oxfordshire, said: 'I'm worried I'm going to end up in serious debt. 'I would like to see how government ministers could live on my income. When I saw the price cap rise, I felt sick. 'There is no way out of it for pensioners. It already feels like every time I go to the supermarket costs have gone up again.' Heating crisis 'will cost lives' warns charity who claim only a massive intervention by ministers will help householders By SEAN POULTER Charities warned yesterday that the soaring cost of heating your home will cost lives this winter. An estimated two-thirds of households – or 45million Britons – could soon be pushed into fuel poverty, when more than 10 per cent of disposable income is spent on energy bills, analysis shows. The forecast from the University of York came as the charity National Energy Action said the number in this category has already doubled in a year to 8.9million households. As the nation faces an unprecedented rise in bills, charities and consumer groups warned that only massive government intervention – on the same scale as support during the pandemic – will help Britons to survive. Adam Scorer, the NEA's chief executive, said: 'The scale of harm caused by these price rises needs to sink in. A warm home this winter will be a pipedream for millions as they are priced out of a decent and healthy quality of life. Without bold action to support the most vulnerable and those on the lowest incomes, this will effectively prise their fingers from the cliff edge and push them over the precipice.' He added: 'Households need money in their pockets to weather this storm or we are going to see millions in dangerously cold homes, suffering in misery with unimaginable debt and ill health. Even with a mild winter, millions are facing a big freeze. Action is needed now to prevent the bleakest of winters. 'When we are in winter, we will be looking at people who cannot afford to keep warm, who cannot afford to cook food, who cannot afford to give their children a bath. It has a real impact of people's mental and physical well-being. There will be a cost in lives, not just a cost of living crisis.' Consumer campaigner Martin Lewis described the increases as a catastrophe and also warned lives will be lost. 'We are in an absolutely horrendous situation and it will get worse in January [when the next rise comes in],' he said. Mr Lewis stressed that yesterday's new price cap only relates to a limit on the amount that energy companies can charge for each unit of gas and electricity – and is not a cap on overall bills. The new cap will mean a typical annual bill of £3,549 for normal use – but some will be paying considerably more. 'I've been accused of catastrophising over this situation,' he said. 'Well, the reason I have catastrophised is this is a catastrophe, plain and simple. If we do not get further government intervention... lives will be lost this winter.' Accusing ministers of failing to respond to warnings, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the scale of the increase had been widely predicted – and announcements to head off the effects should have already been in place. Citizens Advice chief executive Dame Clare Moriarty said: 'Every single day we're already helping people in the most heart-breaking circumstances, trying to scrape together enough to feed their kids and keep the lights on. 'This will get far, far worse unless the Government acts.' Matthew Reed, chief executive of the end-of-life care charity Marie Curie, said: 'The need to stay warm to keep pain at bay – and power specialist medical equipment – means that energy bills for some terminally ill people will be thousands of pounds higher than the average household. 'Many won't be able to afford this. With 30 per cent of excess winter deaths attributable to cold, damp housing, this could cost lives.' Tom Marsland of the disability equality charity Scope said the price cap announcement 'confirms disabled people's fears', adding: 'We've been inundated with calls from disabled people who don't know which way to turn and feel like they are being punished for using more energy.' Rocio Concha of consumer group Which? said the 'eye-watering increases' will be unaffordable for households 'up and down the country' while Sara Ogilvie, policy director for the Child Poverty Action Group, said yesterday's announcement 'will terrify many low-income families'. She continued: 'We know that families with children spend 30 per cent more on energy bills – yet the Government has completely failed to recognise the extra costs facing households with children. 'The next prime minister will be on a collision course with reality unless they increase support to reflect the scale of need, and uprate benefits in line with inflation.'"

Olga Kolobova, a member of Putin's GRU military intelligence service, began spying as early as 2006 when she assumed the identity of 'Maria Adela Kuhfeldt Rivera'. 'Maria' introduced herself to all who came into contact with her as the daughter of a Peruvian mother and German father, born in Peru but later abandoned as a child in Moscow and raised by adoptive parents. For years she travelled across Europe, moving to Malta and Rome in 2010 where she befriended Marcelle D'Argy Smith - former editor of Cosmopolitan magazine - before jetting to Paris and registering a trademark to open a jewellery company. Returning to Italy in 2012, she married a Russian-Ecuadorian man but their romance was short lived. He died mysteriously just one year later, leaving 'Maria' free to roam around Italy again before settling in Naples - the home of NATO's Allied Joint Force Command. It is there that Peruvian-born 'Maria' established herself as a custom jewellery-maker and nightclub owner, whose fun-loving and outgoing nature allowed her to strike up friendships and romances with dozens of NATO employees and even high-ranking colonels. But in actual fact, Kolobova is the daughter of a Russian military official who was flogging Chinese made knock-off jewellery while luring European and US security officials to unwittingly divulge sensitive information for her bosses in the Kremlin. MailOnline has contacted NATO spokespeople for comment. Kolobova, now believed to be in her mid 40s, was part of Russia's infamous 'illegals' programme - a network of agents who undergo years of intense training to prepare them for long-term assignments abroad. Once prepared, illegals are given carefully crafted fake identities and are inserted into a country where they spend years or even decades living a double life. The deep cover agents are expected to build careers, cultivate relationships and in some cases even start a family and raise kids while secretly pursuing a far more sinister agenda on behalf of the Kremlin. Their elaborate cover stories, high-levels of training and the length of their missions make them incredibly difficult to track down - and so it was that Kolobova operated successfully for more than a decade as 'Maria' until she returned to Moscow in 2018. Kolobova was never caught by authorities, meaning she was likely recalled from Naples by her superiors in the GRU. The final Facebook post shared by 'Maria' a few months after she left Italy said she had to 'reveal the truth' that she was suffering from cancer and underwent chemotherapy - likely a ploy designed to help her withdraw from her friendship groups with little suspicion. Her real name was only revealed after Bellingcat investigators discovered the 'Maria' identity had been designated false by the Peruvian Ministry of Justice and that Russian domestic passports issued to the alias bore numbers closely matching those of other previously identified agents, including a GRU officer involved in the poisoning of Russian defector Sergey Skripal on British soil in March 2018. It is unknown whether Kolobova's mission was a success or a failure, but Bellingcat investigators she mixed on a regular basis with NATO and US Navy officers, including some 'who would have had access to on-base photographs or confidential legal files and databases'. The spy is believed to have attended a variety of events organised by NATO or the US military, including NATO annual balls, various fund-raising dinners and the annual US Marine Corps balls, as well as making countless house calls to the personal residences of many NATO officials. In addition to her robust network of friends and romantic partners employed by NATO, Kolobova also travelled extensively throughout Europe, southeast Asia and the Middle East - destinations she claimed were related to her jewellery business Serein which seemingly granted her access to events attended by high-ranking foreign officials. One image posted on the company's now deleted Facebook page but unearthed by Bellingcat seemingly showed 'Maria' shaking hands with Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the former Prime Minister of Bahrain, having gifted him a pair of custom-made cufflinks. But many of the products shared on Serein's Facebook page and now defunct website appeared to match cheap, low-end jewellery made in China. Kolobova is not believed to have left Russia since her mission in Naples finished in 2018. Bellingcat declared she has acquired two properties in Moscow - one in 2013 while 'Maria' travelled to Russia and one in 2020 - and said order records obtained from a Russian food delivery company showed the GRU agent had repeatedly ordered food to the offices of the Russian Pension Fund. Her current activities are unknown, but it is unlikely that Kolobova has quit the spy game. Phone records show that a number associated with the agent made a call to one of the GRU's top chiefs, Igor Kostyukov, in February of this year on Russia's 'Day of Defenders of the Motherland', a widely observed military celebration. Not only did she manage to return to her homeland without getting caught, but investigators claim European and US secret service organisations were not even aware of Kolobova's existence. 'There is no evidence that Western counter-intelligence services or NATO's own internal security service were aware of the presence of a Russian military spy placed strategically close to NATO's Joint Force Command Center in Europe,' Bellingcat said. The revelation of Kolobova's true identity will pose serious security questions to NATO and Western intelligence agencies, particularly amid the backdrop of Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin's threat of severe consequences should Western forces join the fight."
2022-08-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11150389/The-worst-come-Britons-told-expect-double-digit-inflation-winter.html,The worst is yet to come: Britons are told to expect double digit inflation until NEXT winter after Ofgem's energy price cap hike as UK faces the biggest cost of living squeeze since the 1950s,"Are you going to struggle with energy bills this winter? Please email: james.robinson@mailonline.co.uk Millions of British households have been warned to brace for double digit inflation to last until winter next year - as energy bills are set to rocket a staggering 80% in October in the biggest crunch to living standards the country has faced since the 1950s. Economists have said that Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation - the UK Government's official measure of the rate of rising prices - could remain above 10% for the next year and more. Already spiralling costs are set to surge even if Bank of England chiefs hike interest rates, Bank of America economist Robert Wood has forecast. It comes amid warnings that the savings of around six million British households could be wiped out after energy regulator Ofgem raised the price cap by 80% - sending the average household's yearly bill from £1,971 to £3,549 from October. There are also around 2.2million additional households who will be forced to use up every penny of their savings come April 2024, according to research by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). The poorest households will be forced to spend 25% of their income just to keep their lights on. The grim predictions have piled even more pressure on Tory leadership rivals Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss to pledge further action to combat the rising bills. The Ofgem cap announcement today will come into effect for around 24million households in England, Scotland and Wales on default energy tariffs on October 1, and will remain in place until December 31, when it will be adjusted again. The 4.5million pre-payment meter customers across Britain, who are often the most vulnerable and already in fuel poverty, will see an even more punishing increase - with their average annual bill set to go up to £3,608. And things could get even worse next year, with experts at consultancy Auxilione using latest gas prices to predict that the cap will rise by another 52 per cent to £5,405 in January 2023, then by a further 34 per cent to £7,263 in April - before falling slightly, by 11 per cent to £6,485 in July and by another 7 per cent to £6,006 in October. MoneySavingExpert founder Mr Lewis, who became emotional at times while giving passionate interviews to TV and radio shows this morning, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I've been accused of catastrophising over this situation. Well, the reason I have catastrophised is this is a catastrophe, plain and simple. If we do not get further government intervention on top of what was announced in May, lives will be lost this winter.' The consumer champion also said the latest rise in the cap means some people will pay up to £10,000 a year in bills. And he warned that there is no cap on the maximum you pay – but the cap is actually a maximum cost per unit that firms can charge for gas and electricity. Currently, this equates to £1,971 a year for the average home. Ofgem said that from October 1 the equivalent per unit level of the price cap to the nearest pence for a typical customer paying by direct debit will be 52p per kWh for electricity customers and a standing charge of 46p per day. The equivalent per unit level for a typical gas customer is 15p per kWh with a standing charge of 28p per day. As business groups and think tanks offered stark warnings over the crisis throughout the course of today: Ofgem's chief executive Jonathan Brearley warned of the hardship energy prices will cause this winter and urged the incoming prime minister and new Cabinet 'to provide an additional and urgent response to continued surging energy prices'. He also said that the gas price this winter was 15 times more than the cost two years ago. The regulator said the increase reflected the continued rise in global wholesale gas prices, which began to surge as the pandemic eased, and had been driven still higher by Russia slowly switching off gas supplies to Europe. Ofgem also warned that energy prices could get 'significantly worse' next year. The regulator said that some suppliers might start increasing the amount that direct debit customers pay before October 1, to spread out payments, but any money taken by suppliers will only ever be spent on supplying energy to households. Philippe Commaret, the managing director of energy giant EDF, has warned that half of UK households could be in fuel poverty in January as a result of rocketing prices. And the Trades Union Congress has said energy bills will rise 35 times faster than wages and 57 times faster than benefits in the last three months of this year. Which? has urged the Government to raise its energy bills discount by at least 150 per cent or risk pushing millions of people into financial distress. The consumer watchdog said Ministers' financial support for all households must increase from the current £400 to £1,000 - or from £67 to £167 per month from October to March. However, no immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 after the Tory leadership contest. Miss Truss pledged 'immediate support' to help with soaring bills if she becomes prime minister, saying she would use an emergency budget next month to 'ensure support is on its way to get through these tough times'. Miss Truss and her rival Mr Sunak have also both pledged to continue a £15billion support package unveiled in June. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the increase in the cap would cause 'stress and anxiety' for people but that the Government was working to develop more options to support households. He also blamed Russian president Vladimir Putin for 'driving up energy prices in revenge for our support of Ukraine's brave struggle for freedom'. He also suggested people could need to ration energy, saying: 'The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption. It is a difficult time. There is war on our continent. Very few people anticipated war. Wars happen in far-flung places. It is now here with us. We have to remain resilient. My responsibility is to deliver that help.' The charity National Energy Action said the number of UK households in fuel poverty will have doubled in a year when the October cap rise takes effect. It calculates that 8.9million homes will be in fuel poverty from October - up from 4.5 million last October – and also takes into account the Government's support package revealed in May. Mr Lewis has said the rise in the price cap means some people will pay up to £10,000 a year in bills. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain the situation is a 'genuine social and financial catastrophe that is putting lives at risk'. He went on: 'I'm noticing many media organisations saying that the price cap is £3,549 a year - that isn't correct. The price cap is actually a cap on the standing charges and unit rates that you pay, they have gone up by around 80 per cent. What is the energy price cap? The energy price cap decides the maximum cost per unit that energy companies can charge for both gas and electricity. This is then used to calculate a typical annual bill. The price cap was introduced in January 2019 as a way to ensure that households who do not have fixed deals - and who are, in some cases, less financially savvy - are not ripped off by their energy suppliers. Twice a year, energy regulator Ofgem would set the maximum price that households on their supplier's default tariff would have to pay for every unit of gas and electricity they used for the next six months. It allowed for a small profit - capped at 1.9 per cent - that energy suppliers were permitted to take for supplying the service. The frequency of the cap was increased on August 4 from every six to every three months. How is the price cap calculated? The cap is calculated by Ofgem based on the wholesale price of gas and electricity and also includes allowances for tax, charges paid to the energy networks, green levies and social payments. What is happening to the price cap? The price cap is going up significantly. The 80 per cent rise announced today - which comes into force from October 1 - will push the cap to £3,549 per year for the average household. This is the highest it has ever been. Can my bills be higher than the price cap? Experts warn there is no cap on the maximum households pay – but the cap is actually a maximum cost per unit that firms can charge for gas and electricity. The actual cap for each home therefore varies according to use. Ofgem said that from October 1 the equivalent per unit level of the price cap to the nearest pence for a typical customer paying by direct debit will be 52p per kWh for electricity customers and a standing charge of 46p per day. The equivalent per unit level for a typical gas customer is 15p per kWh with a standing charge of 28p per day. Why is the price cap going up? The price cap on energy bills is linked to the wholesale price of gas and electricity, which is itself based on what happens on European markets. The wholesale price of gas has soared by around eightfold in the last year. That rise has been passed onto customers in increments - the price cap was already at a record £1,971 over the summer. Gas prices were already increasing last summer as demand bounced as countries emerged from lockdown but the situation was made much worse when Russia invaded Ukraine and started to restrict gas exports to Europe. Gas prices are also decisive for electricity prices, because gas is so important for the generation of electricity. Over the last year, 42 per cent of the UK's electricity came from burning gas. Ofgem said the increase reflected the continued rise in global wholesale gas prices, which began to surge as the world unlocked from the Covid pandemic, and had been driven still higher to record levels by Russia's actions. When will the price cap change again? The price cap will be changed again in January 2023. It used to be changed twice a year, but changes announced on August 4 mean it will be reviewed every three months. It will change again in April, July and October 2023. What is the price cap likely to be like next year? Experts expect the cap to rise significantly in January 2023 and again in April, and then to fall back again in July and October next year - but the exact levels of the cap remains to be seen. Experts at Cornwall Insight expect the cap to hit £5,387 in January 2023, while those at consultancy Auxilione think it will hit £5,405. In April, Cornwall expects a £6,616 cap, while Auxilione believe it could reach £7,263. There is then an expectation that the price will fall. Cornwall's forecasts for the July and October 2023 caps are £5,897 and £5,887 respectively, while Auxilione expects it to reach £6,485 and £6,006. What does the new price cap mean for monthly bills? Experts at Uswitch estimate that monthly bills in October, November and December this year will hit between £243 and £513 a month, depending on the size of the home and usage, and based on the October price cap. They say 'low user groups' are usually one or two people living in a one to two-bedroom flat, who are at home in the evenings and weekends and have a weekly laundry cycle. They also use the heating occasionally and don't use a dishwasher or tumble dryer. These people are likely to spend around £243 a month on energy bills from October. Then, 'medium user groups' are typically families of three or four people living in a three-bedroom house. Some members are home in the day as well as in the evening and weekends. The heating is used regularly, and electrical appliances are often turned on. Laundry is done three times a week. Their average energy bill is likely to be £363. Finally, 'high user groups' tend to be large families with five or more living together in a four-bedroom house or larger. There is always someone at home in the day and and in the evenings and on weekends. There could be multiple television in use as well as a tumble dryer and dishwasher which are used regularly. Laundry is done daily. These groups are likely to face a bill of £513 a month from October. What is the cap's purpose? When Theresa May's government introduced the cap in January 2019, the aim was to protect households against profiteering energy giants. It would also, in theory, protect customers against sudden increases in bills. More recently, Ofgem has allowed the cap to rise in a way that protects energy firms from going bust amid the soaring cost of wholesale gas and therefore electricity. The effect is that bills are rising more sharply, and more often, to ensure suppliers can cover the spike in the wholesale prices of gas and electricity, which are around ten times higher than normal. Who is affected by the price cap? The new cap will come into effect for around 24million households in England, Scotland and Wales on default energy tariffs on October 1, and will remain in place until December 31, when it will be adjusted again. A few million people are on long-term fixed rates - which are not affected by the cap. However, many of these deals are expiring in the next few months. What is the cheapest way of paying for energy? Paying by direct debit tends to be the cheapest way of paying for electricity and gas, because energy companies normally provide a discount for those using this method as it reduces their costs and administration time. What about those on pre-payment meters? The 4.5million pre-payment meter customers, who are often the most vulnerable and already in fuel poverty, will see an even more punishing increase, with their average annual bill set to go up to £3,608. What support is available for you? It depends on your personal situation. All households have been promised a £400 discount on their energy bills. This support was announced in May, and will be paid in six monthly payments from October. For direct debit customers this will be taken off their payments, while prepayment meter customers will be given discount vouchers from the first week of every month. These will be issued by text, email or by post. Eight million of the most vulnerable households will also get extra support, taking the total they can get to £1,200. These include a £650 one-off payment to households on means-tested benefits, a £300 payment to pensioners, and £150 for six million people who receive disability benefits. Will the Government announce more support? Charities, think tanks, opposition parties and potential future prime ministers have said the Government will need to do more for struggling households. But extra support will have to wait until the next prime minister is in place. Consumer watchdog Which? has said the Government's financial support for all households must increase from the current £400 to £1,000 - or from £67 to £167 per month from October to March. However, no immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 after the Tory leadership contest. The current Government has said that it is exploring the options and will present them to the new prime minister when he or she comes into office next month. 'The figure that's quoted, the £3,549, is what the cap would be for someone who has typical usage - of course, most people don't have typical usage, they're more or less. 'That means there is no maximum amount that you can pay for gas or electricity. 'You could easily be paying £5,000 or £10,000 a year if you have high usage. 'I worry terribly for some of those who have disabled children or disabilities themselves who need lots of electrical equipment to keep their houses warm because of medical conditions.' He also said energy prices will be 'unaffordable' this winter. Mr Lewis said: 'The prediction now in January is up another 51 per cent on top of where we are now and that would take a typical bill and direct debit to £5,386 a year. 'And that is not such a crystal ball prediction because we are seven months through the 10-month assessment period for the January price cap. 'So if we look at the totality across the winter, from October until March, you are probably talking on typical use an average bill of over £4,400 a year, typical pro rata - it is totally unaffordable.' He also said a movement to refuse to pay energy bills is 'growing', as he called on the next Prime Minister to spend billions to solve the crisis. Mr Lewis told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I think the Don't Pay movement is growing. There are dangers to being in the Don't Pay movement as an individual. 'All I can say is what would happen in a typical case scenario where an individual refused to pay - what is far more difficult to predict is if there is a massive movement not to pay. 'I think what is safest for me to say is while I think it should have come earlier, my hope is on September 5 there will be a new Prime Minister. We've heard from both the candidates, but they seem to indicate they understand the scale of the crisis - what we need to hear is concrete solutions. 'And let's be absolutely plain: there are many methods that you can put in place to alleviate and mitigate some of the terrible damage that the rising energy prices are causing. 'So I'm going to be agnostic over the solution, but it will involve spending substantial amounts, billions of pounds of Government money, to stop some of the most vulnerable and many middle income earners from having some terrible choices to make this winter. We have to hope that will be in place. 'And I suspect if it isn't in place, then people coming from the Don't Pay movement are going to become a louder voice in this country.' Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Government will announce 'extra cash' in September to support households during the energy crisis. Speaking on a visit to South West London Elective Orthopaedic Centre in Surrey, he said: 'Of course, we could see this coming (energy bills rising) and that's why we've put the steps in place that we already have. 'And don't forget that, although there will be more announcements next month, more cash coming from September onwards, you shouldn't forget that the pipeline of cash stretches out throughout the autumn. 'So, there's going to be another £650 coming for every one of the eight million most vulnerable households in October. 'In November, another £300 to help every pensioner, £150 extra for everybody who is entitled to disability benefits. On top of what we're doing with Universal Credit and the living wage, lifting both of those up.' He added: 'There's a pipeline of cash coming through over the next few months and through the autumn and the winter. But that is clearly now going to be augmented, increased, by extra cash that the Government is plainly going to be announcing in September.' Mr Johnson also said he does not think the Government should 'cap the whole thing' for 'the richest households in the country'. He said: 'We want to target the households so most of the money will go to the eight million most-vulnerable households, that's the right thing to do. A lot of money will be going to absolutely everybody. 'What don't think we should be doing is trying to cap the whole thing for absolutely everybody, the richest households in the country. This will go on for a few months and it will go on over the winter. 'And it will be tough - and I'd be very clear about that - but in the end, we are also putting in the measures we need to ensure that we have the energy independence to get through this. 'And we are putting in more nuclear, and we are putting in more wind power. We have already seen a 26 per cent increase in British gas now from the North Sea.' And Mr Johnson said that eventually energy bills will come down as Vladimir Putin's ability to 'exercise leverage over us and the rest of the world will diminish'. The Prime Minister told broadcasters: 'I think that we will do everything we can to help. 'We want to make sure that we get people through the next few months, and we can, and we will because we took the right steps. We have a big, big package of help and support. 'But the message I want to get over to people is that I'm afraid that there's a global spike in energy costs driven by Putin's aggression in Ukraine. 'Putin's position, Putin's ability to blackmail, to exercise leverage over us and over the rest of the world will diminish week by week, month by month, and we will get through this and in the end, we will be in a much better position. 'The other side will have more of our own UK energy to rely on, and the bills will eventually come down. But Sir Keir Starmer has said it is 'absolutely unforgivable' that the Government is 'missing in action' during the cost-of-living crisis. The Labour Party leader asked Mr Johnson 'where are you?'. He told reporters: 'I do think the Government has to take responsibility in a situation like this. 'But on the cost of living crisis you've got a Prime Minister who insisted on staying in office, recognises there's a problem with energy prices, shrugs his shoulders and does nothing about it. 'You've got two leadership candidates who are fighting with each other about how appalling they have been in government, but neither has come up with any plan to deal with this problem. Unforgivable.' Sir Keir added: 'My challenge for the Government is where are you? Join us in this challenge and do something about it because at the moment being missing in action is absolutely unforgivable.' Sir Keir has also not ruled out Labour's £30 billion plan to tackle the cost of living needing to be adjusted to a higher amount. The Labour Party leader was asked if his plan to freeze energy prices, unveiled last week, could more than triple in cost to £100billion if utility bills keep soaring into next spring. He said: 'What we've got is a fully costed, comprehensive plan for this winter which will freeze those prices - that is welcome news to so many people who are worried sick today.' But Sir Keir added: 'I accept that in April, May next year we need to look forward then to the proposals in place. 'That's why I've said, alongside our plan, we need medium and long-term solutions. We need to be much more self-sufficient when it comes to energy.' Sir Keir reiterated his call, made a year ago, for a 'national mission to insulate homes'. Miss Truss, the frontrunner in the Tory leadership contest, has insisted that she will 'ensure people get the support needed' in the coming months after the rise. A Truss campaign spokesman said: 'Today's announcement will cause grave concern to many people across the UK who will be worried about paying their bills. 'As Prime Minister, Liz would ensure people get the support needed to get through these tough times. She will immediately take action to put more money back in people's pockets by cutting taxes and suspending green energy tariffs. 'This is on top of ongoing work such as the Energy Bills Support Scheme, which will see a £400 discount paid to consumers from October, and the £1,200 package of support for the most vulnerable. 'Liz will work flat-out to deliver long term energy affordability and security, unleashing more energy by maximising our North Sea oil and gas production - helping keep bills down in the future.' And former chancellor Mr Sunak called surging energy bills the 'most pressing challenge' facing the UK. 'I've said that consistently, and as chancellor I announced significant support to help people. But the situation has deteriorated and as prime minister, I would go further. 'My priority is to protect the most vulnerable in society, including pensioners, and I want them to have certainty that extra help is coming - that is what I would put in place. 'Alternative plans, which are doing different things - borrowing tens of billions for permanent, unfunded tax cuts - don't actually do anything to help those most in need, risk making inflation worse and putting our nation's finances at risk as well.' He said his plan was the 'right one' for the country. Mr Sunak also said that protecting people from rising energy bills will be his 'immediate priority' as prime minister. He said that people can judge him on his 'track record' as chancellor, pointing to the package of supports he announced for people to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. Electric vehicle (EV) owners will be badly hit by the energy price cap rise, new analysis shows. The RAC said the cost of a full charge at home for an EV with a 64-kilowatt hour battery - such as a Kia e-Niro - will be £33.80 under the new cap which comes into force on October 1. That is compared with £18.37 under the current cap, and £13.69 for last winter's price limit. The figures represent the cost when using a seven-kilowatt charger. EVs have soared in popularity in recent months, ahead of the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the UK from 2030. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show there was a 50% increase in registrations of pure electric cars during the first seven months of the year compared with the same period in 2021. RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said: 'The impact of the energy price cap increase will certainly be felt by drivers who charge their electric cars at home, with a full charge of a typical family-sized electric SUV costing 84% more from 1 October than it does under the current cap. 'Despite recent falls in the price of petrol and diesel, the cost of charging at home is still good value compared to paying for either fuel, but again underlines just how the rising cost of electricity is affecting so many areas of people's lives. 'We're also aware that public chargepoint operators are having no choice but to increase their prices to reflect the rising wholesale costs they're faced with, which will heavily impact drivers who have no choice other than to charge up away from home. 'The RAC continues to support the FairCharge's campaign for the Government to cut the VAT rate levied on electricity from public charge points to 5%, to mirror the rate charged on domestic electricity.' Ben Nelmes, co-founder and head of policy at green consultancy New AutoMotive, said: 'Even with rising electricity prices, EVs will continue to be much cheaper to run than petrol or diesel cars. 'There are still great offers for EV electricity tariffs to further reduce the cost of charging. 'EVs can and should be part of the solution to the cost-of-living crisis.' 'It was acknowledged as being commensurate with the scale of the challenge, targeted at the people most in need,' Mr Sunak told broadcasters. 'That is my track record in grappling with this issue. I moved quickly as chancellor and this will be my immediate priority as prime minister and I'd like to try and do the same thing and make sure that we protect the most vulnerable as much as we can from this significant increase in bills.' Ofgem's Mr Brearley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he knew the increase in the cap would come as 'devastating' news for struggling households. He called on the Government and the next prime minister to take urgent action. He said: 'I know this will be devastating for many families, when they hear how much their energy bills are going to go up. We have done and looked at everything we can do as a regulator to address this figure. 'There's a number of things we do to make sure that companies treat their vulnerable customers well. There's a number of vulnerability schemes that we run. But the truth is this is beyond the capacity of the regulator and the industry to address. 'So what we are saying today is, look we have 10 days now until we have a new administration, have a new prime minister and a new ministerial team. What I am clear about is the prime minister with his or her ministerial team will need to act urgently and decisively to address this.' Mr Brearley also said the Government would need to add to the support it announced in May when bills were only expected to jump to £2,800. 'The Government support package is delivering help right now, but it's clear the new prime minister will need to act further to tackle the impact of the price rises that are coming in October and next year,' he added. 'We are working with ministers, consumer groups and industry on a set of options for the incoming prime minister that will require urgent action. 'The response will need to match the scale of the crisis we have before us. With the right support in place and with regulator, government, industry and consumers working together, we can find a way through this.' He added: 'The price of energy has reached record levels driven by an aggressive economic act by the Russian state. They have slowly and deliberately turned off the gas supplies to Europe causing harm to our households, businesses and wider economy. Ofgem has no choice but to reflect these cost increases in the price cap.' Mr Brearley also said that the gas price this winter was 15 times more than the cost two years ago. He told BBC Breakfast: 'When I look at what... gas now costs this winter, it is 15 times the normal price that we were expected to pay two years ago. 'Now if that were happening in petrol, it would cost us £400 to £500 just to fill up our car. So because those costs are changing, the price needs to change and that's why the price cap is now changing to £3,549'. When asked why Ofgem was not protecting the consumer by having a lower price cap, he said: 'The reason we don't have a lower price cap is because if the companies cannot recover the amount of money it costs for them to buy the energy, then ultimately, they will be unable to function.' 'They would have been unable to give us the energy that we need. So what the price cap does, and this is really important, it stops those companies charging excess profits over and above the cost of energy. The energy price cap could top £7,000 next year, experts warned for the first time, as Ofgem announced the highest cap on record. The energy regulator said that the price cap for the average household would increase by 80 per cent to £3,549 for the three months starting in October. But experts at energy consultancy Auxilione warned that the cap could double even from that record high by April next year, hitting £7,263. The prediction is based on the current cost of buying energy on global markets and also sees bills hitting £5,405 in January. Fellow consultants at Cornwall Insight are a little more optimistic. Their model expects the cap to only reach £5,387 in January and then £6,616 from April. Both consultancies then expect bills to fall by between £700 to £800 in July when compared to the April cap. It is the grimmest forecast yet from the two outfits, whose predictions for October's price cap were close to Ofgem's decision. Auxilione's final forecast was just £27 above what the cap was set at, while Cornwall Insight's prediction was £5 above. The predictions are largely based on what gas prices are doing at the moment, so are subject to a lot of change between now and January, let alone before April. 'While there is still some time until the January and April caps are set, the energy crisis is showing no sign of abating,' said Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight. 'A key focus for the next Prime Minister and for Ofgem must be protecting consumers, and the wider economy from the impact of this rise,' he added. 'There are several avenues that can be explored including a review and expansion of the current support package of at least £400 per household. 'However, all of these are temporary solutions and must be accompanied by a focus on implementing a viable long-term solution.' He said that the purpose of the price cap is being undermined by the unprecedented rises in bills that are hitting households. 'Throughout the energy crisis, the Government and Ofgem have remained committed to the cap, and in its ability to shield consumers from a volatile energy market. 'However, the cap was never meant to be a permanent solution, it was created for a different energy market than the one we face today and has not protected consumers from what will be incredible hardship this winter.' 'But what it can not do is set a price that is less than the cost of the energy that we buy, and that's why we have to make the change that we are making today.' Mr Brearley added that it was 'devastating news' for many families. He also said that 'there are no easy answers' to the energy crisis. He told Good Morning Britain: 'Genuinely, there are no easy answers, but there are some big decisions that ultimately ministers will need to make.' He added: 'To be honest I never imagined when I took this role that I would have to make an announcement that we made today.' When asked about senior people in the energy industry receiving bonuses, he urged them to 'be thoughtful' about their pay and remuneration. He said: 'For example, the senior Ofgem team has given away any bonuses to charity because we recognise the situation that we are in right now.' The boss of Ofgem also said the regulator has had countless meetings with the current Government, and called on the next prime minister to take decisions to 'match the scale of the problem'. 'This is a major issue for the country next year. This is a major set of decisions that the new government will need to make, that the new prime minister and his or her ministerial team will need to make,' Mr Brearley said on a call with reporters. He added: 'It's not for me to comment on the proposals that are out there for politicians. My point is very simple, it is going to need to be taken urgently and it's going to need to be decisive. 'And it's going to need to match the scale of the problem that we see - which version of that that the Government chooses to pursue really is a matter for them.' The Confederation of British Industry said the scale of Government help needs to be 'urgently reviewed'. 'Government must also step up and deliver a national energy efficiency programme that will help reduce household bills as soon as this winter,' said Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief policy director. And the trade body for energy suppliers in the UK has said the charges its members will be forced to pass onto households will be 'simply unaffordable', after Ofgem hiked the cap. 'This rise, while widely predicted, will be hugely worrying to customers. We know many customers are already struggling with energy bills and other costs and for millions of households, these latest increases will be simply unaffordable,' Energy UK's director of regulation Dan Alchin said. 'The rise is driven by the cost of buying gas on the wholesale market, which has been at record levels for about a year now - with prices this week 10 times what they were before the crisis. 'These costs are out of the control of energy retail suppliers who need to recoup them, otherwise we risk more going out of business in addition to the 30 that have done so since last August - causing huge cost and disruption to customers. 'However bills of this size were unimaginable a few months ago and we cannot expect customers to bear the brunt. 'Retail suppliers will continue to do all they can to offer help and support, especially to their most vulnerable customers, but faced with bill increases of this size and the numbers of customers who will need support, it won't be enough. 'The Government must step in urgently and put in place further support for this winter and with energy costs likely to remain high for the foreseeable future, look at ways to keep bills down next year as well - as we outlined in our letter to the Chancellor last week.' Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of Energy UK, said the new price cap will be 'really scary' for a lot of people and businesses across the country. She told Sky News: 'This is a crisis that has been caused by the international gas market and so we need to tackle that at a systemic level, as well as making sure that people have urgent help right now.' She added: 'We need something that is broad-brush that supports vulnerable people and really tackles what will be a massive cost-of-living crisis, but also something that helps middle income households and the wider economy.' Addressing politicians, she said: 'This is bigger than you think that it is. This is a whole-economy problem. This is urgent and we need to do more than you think that you need to do, and you need to do it now.' By JASON GROVES FOR THE DAILY MAIL Liz Truss today pledges 'immediate support' to help with soaring power bills if she becomes prime minister. The price cap was raised to more than £3,500 per household today – almost treble the figure a year ago. Analysts say bills could rise by a further £1,000 in January, with more pain in April as Vladimir Putin 'weaponises' his gas resources. But writing in the Daily Mail, Miss Truss says she would use an emergency budget next month to 'ensure support is on its way to get through these tough times'. Energy firms warn that millions of families may be unable to pay their bills this winter without government help. And business leaders predict that many firms will go under unless action is taken to rein in their exorbitant power costs. Miss Truss and her rival for No 10, Rishi Sunak, have both pledged to continue a £15billion support package unveiled in June. But the Foreign Secretary today indicates she will go significantly further to ease the squeeze on cash-strapped homes. She says Britain is facing 'extraordinarily difficult economic times', as a result of stagnant growth, high taxes and Russia 'using gas supply as a weapon'. But she claims she can 'chart a confident course through this economic storm' and stave off a recession with her tax-cutting agenda. 'The impact on our cost of living is clear at the supermarket checkout, at the petrol pump and on our latest energy bills,' she writes. 'I know how hard it is for millions of Britons, and how grave concerns are about the consequences of today's decision by Ofgem on the next energy price cap. The rest of Europe is facing the same challenge, which will loom large as winter sets in. 'If I am elected leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister, I will take decisive action on entering No 10 to provide immediate support, but will also tackle the root causes of these issues so we are never again in this difficult position. To those of you feeling the squeeze, my message is clear: I will ensure support is on its way and we get through these tough times.' In today's article, Miss Truss says she will press ahead with her plan to slash taxes, with cuts expected to both national insurance and corporation tax in next month's 'fiscal event'. And she stresses the need to push for growth and avoid a recession that would take a 'terrible toll'. Miss Truss has already pledged a suspension of green levies on energy, taking around £150 off bills. She gives few details today of what additional help she is planning – or how much cash she is prepared to devote to the crisis – saying she has yet to see options being drawn up by the Treasury for the incoming prime minister. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who is tipped to be her chancellor, has held talks with energy bosses about a £100billion plan to freeze bills for two years. But insiders played down the prospect of it being approved. Government sources said the Treasury was working up options for providing short-term help, allowing the new PM to 'hit the ground running'. These include increases in the winter fuel allowance for pensioners, targeted help to those on low incomes through the Warm Homes Discount Scheme or a general rebate on energy bills. Mr Sunak yesterday indicated he would offer further support to pensioners and low income households if he won, along with cutting VAT on energy bills. But he warned against Miss Truss's plans for 'unfunded' tax cuts, saying that tackling inflation had to be the priority. Mr Zahawi said Ministers were working to develop more options to support households amid the price cap rise. 'I know the energy price cap announcement this morning will cause stress and anxiety for many people, but help is coming with £400 off energy bills for all, the second instalment of a £650 payment for vulnerable households, and £300 for all pensioners,' he said. 'While Putin is driving up energy prices in revenge for our support of Ukraine's brave struggle for freedom, I am working flat out to develop options for further support. 'This will mean the incoming prime minister can hit the ground running and deliver support to those who need it most, as soon as possible.' He also said the Government knows it has 'got to do more' to support households through the energy crisis. The Chancellor also indicated that the crisis would not be temporary, suggesting that it could last well into next year. He said that help from the Government is coming but admitted: 'We know that's not enough. We've got to do more.' 'We need to make sure that this isn't a sticking plaster, that for the long term we continue to help the most vulnerable who have no cushion. And that's what I'm determined to do. 'And we're working up those options for both households and for business for the incoming prime minister on the 5th of September to take those decisions. 'So my message today is we'll get this £37 billion to people to help them for now, and then more will be coming because we know this will continue in January and of course on to April and next year and we have to remain resilient.' He also said that his aim is to make sure vulnerable UK households are 'resilient through next year'. The Chancellor declined to give specifics about what a package of funding might look like, but insisted that the Treasury was working on proposals to present to the next Prime Minister. Mr Zahawi is not expected to retain his portfolio if frontrunner Miss Truss wins the contest to replace Boris Johnson. 'We know we need to do more because actually the most vulnerable households have no cushion, have nothing available to them,' he told broadcasters. 'So what I'm looking at is how I can target that help for those people, not just to January, but we need to make sure that we're resilient through next year. 'More help is on its way because we know that the most vulnerable households need that additional help. And I'm doing the work to make sure that that will be in place throughout next year.' In addition, the Chancellor denied that there was a lack of action from Government amid the Tory leadership contest. It was put to him by broadcasters that it was 'intolerable' to 'leave people in the dark' at the moment. Mr Zahawi said: 'That sounds like we're not acting on this.' Setting out the work of his team over the last month, he said: 'We know (Vladimir) Putin has now worked out that actually this is quite a potent lever. You look at what's happening in Germany and the rest of Europe. 'We need to make sure there's more support. My preference is for it to be targeted. 'Why? Because it will give us a much longer, more leeway, to be able to face down Putin and send a very important message to him that this is not going to work.' And the Chancellor suggested that the public does now need to look at how they use energy. Speaking to broadcasters, Mr Zahawi was asked if people should start reducing their energy use. He said: 'The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption. It is a difficult time. There is war on our continent. 'Very few people anticipated war. Wars happen in far-flung places. It is now here with us. We have to remain resilient. My responsibility is to deliver that help.' On Wednesday, Mr Zahawi insisted 'nothing is off the table' when it comes energy bills, but added that a freeze in the price cap would not deliver 'targeted help' for those who need it most. Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves tweeted today: 'This is incredibly worrying and will strike fear in the heart of many families. We cannot wait any longer to act. Many households are facing the stark reality of being unable to afford their energy bills this winter. Consumers are currently hearing a lot about options for handling their bills, ranging from asking for help from their supplier to refusing to pay at all. Here we look at the pros and cons of each, and where to turn for advice and help. - The 'Don't Pay' option The 'Don't Pay' group describes itself as 'a grassroots movement demanding a fair price for energy for everyone'. More than 100,000 people have signed up to support a pledge to cancel their direct debits if the Government and energy firms 'refuse to act' by October 1. However, refusing to pay has serious consequences and households are strongly advised against taking this option - no matter how difficult their financial situation might be. If you are on a pre-payment meter, failing to pay will mean your supply being cut off. If you are on a regular or smart meter and you do not reach an agreement with your supplier before cancelling your direct debit, the firm may try to force you to have a pre-payment meter installed. This means you will have to pay for your energy usage upfront and a weekly payment to cover any debts - which can be as high as 90% of energy top-ups and 100% of electricity top-ups. Pre-payment customers also pay more than others. The current energy price cap is £1,971 for households with a standard meter, but £46 higher at £2,017 for those on a pre-payment meter. Failure to reach an agreement with your supplier may also result in them applying for a court warrant so they can visit your home and disconnect your energy supply. This can be done remotely if you have a smart meter, but your energy company must visit you to identify and assess your situation. An Ofgem spokeswoman said: 'We know that people are under huge pressure, but we do not think it's in consumers' best interest to not pay their bills, and most leading charities and consumer groups agree. 'The knock-on effects of not paying bills can be huge for people. They could lose their direct debit discounts or be forced to move to a pre-payment meter. It could also damage their credit rating.' - Moving off direct debits to paying for what you use - or a 'standing order' As households' monthly direct debits soar by hundreds of pounds, many are considering stopping them and paying for the energy they actually use in three-month chunks in the form of a standing order. While this may give a sense of control, anyone paying on receipt of a three-monthly bill for actual usage will pay considerably more than direct debit customers as almost all providers add a discount for direct debit payments. Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy for Citizens Advice, said: 'Paying as you go can give you more control over the amount you pay, but you might pay more for that control. It's unlikely that you would save money by moving to pay-as-you-go, because you can't spread your costs over a year.' - Direct debits remain the best option Despite sickening increases, staying on a direct debit plan remains the most cost-effective option for paying for your energy. However, customers have the right to challenge any increase that goes above the increased price cap - Ofgem is carefully monitoring this and has already warned firms that direct debits must be set correctly and they must 'clearly communicate any changes in a way that helps consumers understand their payments'. - I'm really struggling, where can I turn? You should first contact your supplier and notify them that you want to pay off your debt through a payment plan. They should discuss your options with you and come to an agreement. When coming to an agreement, your supplier should consider what you can afford to pay based on your income, outgoings, and any other debts you have. They will also consider how much energy you are likely to use in the future by looking at your past usage. To ensure your energy bill is accurate, send your supplier readings from your gas and electricity meter. It is very important to resist, if at all possible, being moved on to a pre-payment meter as this is the least cost-effective way of paying for energy. Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: 'We strongly encourage anyone concerned about being able to pay rising energy bills to speak to their supplier as energy firms have a duty to agree a payment plan that households can afford. 'Depending on the supplier, customers can ask for a review of their payments, a reduction in or break from their payments, more time to pay or access to hardship funds.' 'This is a national emergency. The Tories must freeze energy bills now so households don't pay a penny more in winter.' She also said in a statement that the Government must choose between letting families suffer, or stop the oncoming rise. 'Today's announcement will strike fear in the heart of many families, and force many to make unthinkable choices this winter. The Tories now face an urgent choice. 'They can carry on letting oil and gas companies make huge profits whilst every family suffers with bills rising this winter. Or they can act now and stop the energy price cap rising, by bringing in a windfall tax on those oil and gas profits. 'People deserve a government that can meet the scale of this national emergency - not this spectacle of a Tory leadership race or a Prime Minister that put his out of office on months ago. 'Labour is on your side, and our fully-funded plan to freeze the price cap will make sure households don't pay a penny more this winter, saving you £1,000. 'Our mission for home grown renewable energy and to insulate 19 million homes will keep bills down for the long term too.' Appearing on BBC Breakfast, Ms Reeves urged the Government to act to protect the public from soaring energy bills. She accused ministers of being nowhere to be seen on the morning of the announcement. The Labour MP said people are 'worried sick' about what is happening and is 'striking fear in the hearts of families right across the country'. She called on the Government to freeze energy fills and follow Labour's own proposals. She said: 'The fact that no Government minister is available to come on your programme today is just appalling. They are not here to give assurances they are not here to set out what they are going to do. That is a dereliction of duty.' Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said that rise in the cap is 'nothing short of a catastrophe' for millions of households. 'The only option is for energy prices to be frozen before these rises wreak havoc on our communities. Then we need a proper plan to be put in place to bring bills down next year,' he said. 'As millions suffer the Conservatives do nothing. No policy from the government, no plan from Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak. They have no idea how much pain these energy prices will cause our country. They are simply unfit to govern.' Chairman of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, Darren Jones, also warned 'many businesses will face bankruptcy because there is no price cap on their energy bills'. 'The scale of the challenge will mean that the next chancellor will have to offer business grants and not just temporary tax and business rate cuts,' the Labour MP said. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the energy price cap rise is 'simply unaffordable for millions' and must be cancelled. And Scotland's Energy Secretary Michael Matheson said the increase is 'unsustainable' and warned it would push millions into fuel poverty. Ms Sturgeon said the rise should not be allowed to happen. She tweeted: 'This is simply unaffordable for millions. It cannot be allowed to go ahead. 'This rise must be cancelled, with the UK gov and energy companies then agreeing a package to fund the cost of a freeze over a longer period, coupled with fundamental reform of the energy market.' Mr Matheson told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme households were already struggling with the cap increase in April this year, and that 'increasing it by another 80 per cent is simply unsustainable.' He said: 'It will force quite literally millions of households into fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty and is unsustainable.' In a statement issued after the increase was confirmed today, Mr Matheson called on the UK Government to act. He said: 'Today's price cap announcement and increase imposes a burden that customers simply cannot be expected to carry. 'The only acceptable course of action now is for the UK Government, who have the necessary policy levers and borrowing powers at their disposal, to take immediate steps to cancel the increase for all households.' Mr Matheson added: 'No single government, company or organisation can solve this crisis alone. It requires a collective response commensurate to the situation. 'We will continue to work with our partners, energy companies and stakeholders to do everything we can to help the people of Scotland through this deeply unsettling time. 'We will also continue to press the UK Government to reform the energy market to prevent this situation occurring again in the future.' Mr Matheson said the Scottish Government is treating the situation as a 'public emergency' and has prepared a £1.2 million package to enable the immediate expansion of energy advice services. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton called for energy prices to be frozen. Mr Sarwar said: 'This eye-watering price hike risks plunging millions of people into fuel poverty. This is a national emergency and our governments have a moral duty to act.' Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: 'This energy price rise will be devastating for hundreds of thousands of Scottish families and pensioners already struggling to make ends meet.' ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson, said: 'The size and scale of this issue is truly catastrophic for UK households and that's why only a big solution can tackle it once and for all to shelter people from the worst this winter. 'We have offered the Government a plan, backed by the industry, that can be delivered this year, tailored in line with their priorities and will support the UK economy - with the cap set at £3,549, what billpayers need now is to hear what additional help is coming.' Richard Neudegg, director of regulation at Uswitch.com, said: 'Here is the signal that the summer holidays are over. After seemingly endless predictions, the true magnitude of the October energy price cap is now clear. 'Ofgem has rubber-stamped the letters from suppliers that will now start landing on millions of doorsteps informing customers of exactly how much they'll need to pay for their energy as we go into winter. Millions of hard-up families could save hundreds of pounds on their energy bills this winter in a few simple steps without making their homes any colder, experts have said. Record-breaking energy prices are likely to affect many over the next few months as Ofgem hiked its energy price cap today. Experts warn that worse is to come when the cap is updated in January. But two small changes to the way your boiler works could save up to 18 per cent, or around £324, according to experts at the Heating Hub, which provides advice on energy efficiency. - Turning down your flow temperature The flow temperature on a boiler regulates how hot the water is when it leaves the boiler to go to your radiators. Most condensing combi boilers in the UK are still set to their factory setting, which tends to be around 80C, but at this temperature boilers cannot operate at their most efficient. When a condensing boiler burns gas, a lot of the heat can escape out of the flue and out on to the street - this heat literally disappears into thin air. Steam coming out of a flue is a sign that flow temperature is high and heat is escaping. At lower temperatures the boiler works to recycle a lot of this heat back into the water it is trying to warm up. Jo Alsop of the Heating Hub said that by turning down the flow temperature, households could save around 6% to 8% of their annual gas usage. 'It's worth making the point that condensing boilers, even though they're A-rated on the box (for efficiency), they don't necessarily achieve A-rating in the home,' she said. Some A-rated boilers have been found to operate at E-rated efficiency levels in the home, at just 75 per cent. Turning down the flow temperature is not the same as turning down the thermostat. The boiler and radiators will still work to keep rooms at the same temperature as before, but it might take a little longer for the house to heat up. Ms Alsop said families should experiment with lowering the flow temperature. The colder it is, the more efficient the boiler will run. 'We would advise to do that to around 60C and if they find that's a bit too cool on a very cold day, they can always notch it back up, but importantly reduce it down again when the weather gets a bit warmer, and keep reducing it down,' she said. How to do this depends on the boiler, but it is a fairly simple process. It should say how in the boiler manual, which can often be found online. The Heating Hub also has a guide on its website on how to change the flow temperature. It is important to remember only to do this if you have a condensing combi boiler which is not connected to a hot water cylinder. Also be careful about keeping rooms cold if you have vulnerable people in the home. Several energy suppliers are also keen for households to turn down flow temperatures. Rebecca Dibb-Simkin, chief product officer at Octopus Energy, said: 'Safely turning down the water flow temperature of your gas boiler is a little-known but very effective tip for saving gas whilst staying warm, and could save people up to 8% off their gas bills. 'Over 100,000 of our customers who took part in our energy efficiency scheme last winter told us they tried it, with some of them knocking nearly £100 off their bills.' - Turning off your boiler's pre-heat function The pre-heat function on a boiler is designed to ensure that hot water is ready to flow to the taps at a moment's notice. It means the boiler always keeps a small amount of water hot. It is a handy function when you want to wash your hands and do not want to wait for water to heat up, but the boiler is heating up water when you do not need it. 'If the boiler is not on and heating the home, it will fire anyway, just to keep that water at temperature, even if someone is not home during the day, and certainly it will fire all through the night, even when hot water is not in demand,' Ms Alsop said. That means burning gas through the night, every night, for nothing. Turning off the pre-heat function might mean a longer wait for the shower to get warm in the morning, but it is a small inconvenience for the hundreds of pounds that can be saved. Ms Alsop estimates households could save around 5 per cent to 10 per cent of their gas use. Guides on how to turn off the pre-heat function should be in the boiler manual or online. However Ms Alsop said people should consider turning the pre-heat on during droughts if they have to wait an exceptionally long time for hot water to reach the taps. They can still turn it off during the day and night. 'Households will face average monthly charges of £362 based on expected usage - almost three times more than the same period in 2021. 'Even after the £66 monthly discount currently on the table from the Government, families will need to find on average an extra £169 per month compared to last year, when many household budgets are already maxed out. 'The energy crisis we face this winter must never be allowed to happen again. This is a failure of the wholesale market and, until that is resolved, we won't have a long-term solution. 'The Government has made it clear that it will not intervene further until a new Prime Minister is confirmed. As concerning as this is, there does seem to be consensus that more support will be made available, but it remains to be seen if it will be enough. 'Until the Government acts, which we expect will be in the coming weeks, consumers are being held in a cost-of-living limbo.' The next prime minister will most likely be unable to avoid introducing a fresh package of support, a leading think tank has said. Respected think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested on Friday that whoever becomes the next prime minister would be unable to avoid putting together a 'substantial package of support', no matter what is said on the campaign trail. The new rise in the price cap, the IFS said, means the current Government supports will cover only 47 per cent of the rise in bills. It said covering the same proportion of the energy price rise now would cost a further £14 billion. The IFS said it was difficult to assess the impact of Ms Truss's plans to cut green levies. 'Cutting only those levies that still add to bills would be complex as they are linked to various schemes and subsidies and apply to business as well as households, but would save households around £50 on average over the three months from October,' the think tank said. Mr Sunak's plan to cut VAT on household energy bills, the IFS said, would save a typical household £51 between October and December at a cost of £1.4 billion. 'Looking beyond this winter, energy prices also look like they will remain very high well into next year, which will put pressure on the government to provide further support in the coming months,' IFS economist Isaac Delestre said. 'Whoever becomes the next prime minister will most likely be announcing a substantial package of support very soon after taking office.' In Scotland, the £2million Social Housing Fuel Support Fund, administered by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, will open on Monday to provide help to the most vulnerable households. Citizens Advice Scotland also said the increase should not be allowed to happen. The charity's chief executive, Derek Mitchell, said: 'This increase should not go ahead. It is absolutely horrifying for people who are hanging on by a thread financially.' Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: 'Today's Ofgem price hike is like a dagger to the heart of millions of people up and down the country. 'As a result of the decision, parents will be unable to feed their children, the sick and elderly will be condemned to worsening health, disabled people will go without vital medical equipment and households will be forced into poverty for the first time in generations. 'All the solutions lie at the Westminster Government's door, yet it is silent in the face of this looming disaster.' And Andrew Forsey, national director of anti-hunger charity Feeding Britain, said: 'Unless significant additional help is offered by the new prime minister, these eye-watering prices will spring a vicious hunger trap; leaving millions of families unable to afford heating or eating. 'Eighty years after the Beveridge Report set the framework for a welfare state that could eliminate destitution from our shores, the threat of destitution now hangs over us again like the Sword of Damocles.' Meanwhile Sara Ogilvie, policy director at Child Poverty Action Group, said: 'Today's energy cap announcement will terrify many low-income families. Their budgets have been overstretched for months, and soaring prices will make it practically impossible to escape the tightening grip of poverty. 'We know that families with children spend 30 per cent more on energy bills than households without kids - yet Government has completely failed to recognise the extra costs facing households with children. 'The next prime minister will be on a collision course with reality unless they increase support to reflect the scale of need, and uprate benefits in line with inflation.' And a charity which supports the vulnerable said families are facing one of the 'bleakest Christmases' for years. Rossanna Trudgian, head of campaigns and public affairs at Action for Children, said: 'Today's announcement, and warnings of even worse rises to come next year, makes it clear that the country is facing a national emergency. 'The families we support are already under enormous pressure and are now set to face a relentless wave of energy price hikes and inflation all while coping with the colder weather. The rising cost of living is placing increasing pressure on household budgets, but there are a number of pieces of technology which could help people make some vital savings. Here is a look at some of the tech which could make a difference. - Smart meters Getting a smart meter is a key step in making your home more energy efficient, as it can help bring an end to the use of estimated bills and give users an insight into how much energy they are using and which appliances use the most - giving an incentive to change some usage habits. Smart meters enable both users and energy suppliers to track the energy consumption of a home, making it possible to more easily understand when a home uses more energy and how it could become more efficient, and potentially highlight where a household could switch to a cheaper tariff based on their usage. - Smart home tools Given the increased connectivity in many homes today thanks to the rise of smart devices, it is now also possible to control many appliances and other items from a smartphone. A number of apps enable users to set routines to turn connected appliances and electronics on and off at certain times, a feature which could be used to improve efficiency and save money. The major smart home apps from the likes of Apple, Amazon and Google all offer their own variations of these tools - depending on which smart home devices a household already has. Another app worth noting is Samsung's SmartThings - which is available on both Android and iOS - and enables users to not only connect to and control appliances and other devices from a range of brands, but also has the ability to connect to the home's smart meter and allow energy consumption and costs tracking from a user's smartphone. - Spending tracking apps Beyond trying to make savings just on energy bills, there are a number of apps and online tools that can help people better track their spending and budget more generally each month. Online banks such as Monzo and others send notifications to a user's phone every time money is spent, but also allow users to organise money into different 'pots' and see breakdowns of what they are spending money on each month to help with budgeting. For those who do not use an online or app-based bank, there is a range of budgeting apps available such as Emma or Snoop Finance's Budget Planner which can be connected to bank accounts to help track spending and set monthly budgets. Some of these apps also offer tips and guidance on better money-saving, and can even flag cheaper deals for certain services when they become available. However, be aware that while many of these apps are initially free to download and use, some charge a subscription fee for some features. - Connectivity and social tariffs Staying online is vital for many people for school or work, but also to access vital online public services, as well as staying in touch with friends and family, but is becoming increasingly difficult for many as the cost of living rises. Some broadband and mobile phone providers have begun to introduce what are known as social tariffs - cheaper connectivity deals for lower-income households and those receiving universal credit, with more likely to be rolled out in the coming months. In addition, the charity Good Things Foundation is working with Virgin Media O2, Vodafone and Three to provide free mobile data to people via The National Databank. The scheme provides free mobile data, texts and calls to people in need, and works in a similar fashion as a foodbank, but for internet connectivity data. Local community partners within the Good Things Foundation's network can apply to access the databank, enabling them to provide free data to those in their communities who need it. 'We are seeing more and more frightened families who are reaching crisis point. 'Some parents are coming to us in tears, terrified about how they are going to feed their children, with some missing rent payments so their child can have a meal - one family has even resorted to taking seats out of their car to save on fuel. Many of these families have already cut back to the bone and have nowhere left to cut.' 'They are facing one of the bleakest Christmases in recent years. The next prime minister must provide emergency relief to struggling parents by committing to further targeted support for low-income families through the social security system. 'Families with children also face higher costs, so it is vital that any financial support takes into account family size and need.' The StepChange debt charity said a third of its new clients were in energy arrears in July, before the latest rise, and this could rise to more than half after the next price cap increase in January. Chief executive Phil Andrew said: 'Household budgets are being pushed to the absolute limit and it's inevitable this will lead to more people experiencing debt. 'The demand for debt advice is rising across the sector as the cost-of-living crisis bites. 'Many of our existing clients are also having to amend their arrangements as they can no longer afford their previous payments.' And Mike Childs, head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said: 'Today's news will be life-changing for millions of people. 'The government, and the two frontrunners to be Prime Minister, have had all summer to set out how they'll shield households from these colossal price hikes, yet we still don't have a credible plan. 'Decision-makers must urgently commit to much greater levels of emergency financial support and the rapid roll-out of a nationwide, street-by-street home insulation programme targeted at those who need it most. 'There are almost 5 million homes in England and Wales that lack even the most basic insulation measures, meaning too many households are paying through the roof to heat their homes. 'At this stage there's no justifying the total absence of plans to improve the energy efficiency of UK homes, when it would help to slash energy use, reduce climate-changing emissions, and save households hundreds of pounds each year on their bills.' Becca Lyon, head of child poverty at Save the Children, called the price cap rise 'a full-blown economic crisis for thousands of families'. She said: 'Children are at serious risk from today's announcement and could spend this winter in cold homes, with fewer hot meals, despite the best efforts of their parents and carers. Our children deserve better. 'Families are already squeezed to the limit and while facing increased energy costs, they could also be paying £1,000 a month or more on childcare, even with Government help. 'Parents want to do their best for their children but how can they when they're facing costs per month that come to more than their incomes? Debt and hardship are the only likely outcome from today's price cap rise.' Disabled people 'feel like they are being punished for using more energy', the disability equality charity Scope warned. Policy manager Tom Marsland said: 'After months of harrowing predictions about energy bills, today's announcement confirms disabled people's fears. Life already costs more for disabled people. 'Now the cost of charging a wheelchair or using a breathing machine will have almost trebled in a year. We've been inundated with calls from disabled people who don't know which way to turn and feel like they are being punished for using more energy. 'The government must intervene now. They should start by doubling the support package, and look at bringing in discounted tariffs for disabled customers who need more energy.' Matthew Reed, chief executive of end-of-life care charity Marie Curie, said: 'Terminally ill people could freeze to death this winter without further support. 'The need to stay warm to keep pain at bay and power specialist medical equipment means that energy bills for some terminally ill people will be thousands of pounds higher than the average household. 'Many won't be able to afford this. With 30% of excess winter deaths attributable to cold, damp housing, this could cost lives. 'Our research shows that working age people are at a huge risk of falling into poverty after a terminal diagnosis. They often have to give up work. 'They don't qualify for their state pension. They cannot claim Winter Fuel Payments and do not automatically qualify for the Warm Home Discount scheme either. - First step: switch off and unplug Households should by now have done a complete check of every power outlet, unplugging anything that is not necessary and turning devices off standby mode - and getting into the habit of doing this regularly. Energy Saving Trust calculates that you can save around £55 a year just by remembering to turn your appliances off standby mode. Almost all electrical appliances can be turned off at the plug without upsetting their programming. You may want to think about getting a standby saver or smart plug which allows you to turn all your appliances off standby in one go. Check the instructions for any appliances you're not sure about. Some satellite and digital TV recorders may need to be left plugged in so they can keep track of any programmes you want to record. - Check your boiler A recent report by the Heating and Hot Water Council found that households can save around 6% to 8% on their gas bill just by turning down the heating flow temperature on their condensing combi boiler. Doing this will allow the boiler to run more efficiently and could save around £200 off an average energy bill. Use the controls on the front of your boiler - not your room thermostat - to set the flow temperature for the boiler, which is the temperature your boiler heats the water to before sending it off to your radiators. The way you adjust the flow temperature and the display information available varies a great deal. There is a handy online guide at theheatinghub.co.uk. Another easy saving is to turn off the pre-heat mode on the boiler, which could mean hot water taps taking longer to heat up, but could save hundreds of pounds a year. - Forget about your tumble dryer and use other appliances wisely Tumble dryers are massive energy drains, so on warm days hang clothes outside to dry instead and invest in a drying rack for cooler months. Use your washing machine on a 30C cycle and reduce use by one run a week. Only run your dishwasher when it is full and use eco settings if possible. Avoid overfilling the kettle - only boil the amount you need. - Defrost your fridge and freezer Remember to regularly defrost your fridge and freezer, as the more they ice up the more energy they will use. A full freezer is more economical to run. With a full freezer, the cold air does not need to circulate as much, so less power is needed. If you have lots of free space, half-fill plastic bottles with water and use these to fill gaps. BBC Good Food suggests you fill the freezer with everyday items you are bound to use, such as sliced bread, milk or frozen peas. - Turn off lights Turn lights off when you are not using them or when you leave a room. Replacing all the lights in your home with LED bulbs could help you save even more. - Keep windows closed when temperatures get hot The obvious thing to do when homes warm up is to open all the windows. However all this does is fill the house with hot air. It is best to use blinds and curtains to block direct sunlight during the day and then open the windows at night when temperatures drop, helping you to save energy by reducing the need for power-hungry fans. - Use fans sparingly and wisely Fans, even when used on cooling settings, will send bills soaring. You should not stop using them when necessary, but there are ways of maximising their effect and cutting the time they are switched on. Putting fans at floor level helps to circulate the lower cold air rather than the warmer air that naturally rises in a room. You can also create the ideal combination for energy saving by pairing smart fan usage with closed windows, keeping the fans working during the day and the windows open at night. - Invest in insulation New analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit has found homes rated band F on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) system, a measure of the home's efficiency, are set to have a gas bill £968 higher than a home rated EPC band C, the Government's target for 2035. The average home in the UK is rated band D and these homes will pay £420 more for their gas this winter, compared with band C. Energy Saving Trust also says that for those wishing to future-proof their homes, investing in professional draught-proofing and insulation in preparation for the winter months could lead to a reduction in bills by £405 for a semi-detached home. DIY draught-proofing is much cheaper and anything is better than nothing. Installing solar panels for a similar property could lead to additional annual savings of around £450. A quarter of heat in an uninsulated home is lost through the roof. Most homes have at least some loft insulation but often not enough. Topping up from 120mm to at least 270mm of insulation will help. - And here are some myths... Turning boilers off is not advisable or an effective way to save energy. Instead, thermostats and timers should be used effectively to regulate their operation. Fridges and freezers are designed to be kept on all the time and energy will not be saved by turning them off for short periods because more energy will be used to cool them down again when turned back on. There are also important safety issues that can arise if food partially defrosts before it is prepared for eating. 'Dying people are falling through the cracks. They need targeted Government support now.' Thomas Lawson, chief executive of national poverty Turn2us, said the 'meteoric rise' will be crippling. He said: 'This is no longer a choice between heating and eating, but not being able to afford either. 'This is as big an emergency as the impact of Covid and needs a similarly confident Government response. As one of the wealthiest economies, it's simply not acceptable to consign more than a quarter of us into poverty. 'We implore the Government to act with urgency and introduce a cap on energy costs that means that we can heat our homes and turn on the lights as we head into winter.' Rethink Mental Illness called the news of the cap rise a 'hammer blow' to households across the country. Alexa Knight, its associate director for policy and practice, said: 'Mental health and money worries are intrinsically linked, and we urgently need a clear response from Government to an economic crisis that has the potential to fuel a mental health emergency. 'There is a growing feeling of powerlessness which will not subside until we see concrete plans from the Government about how they will provide targeted support through the difficult months ahead. 'With mental health services already facing record demand, we need more than a recognition of the problem. 'We need urgent action to address the gravity of the situation people are facing. This cannot arrive a minute too soon.' The Trades Union Congress has said energy bills will rise 35 times faster than wages and 57 times faster than benefits in the last three months of this year, after the energy price cap was hiked by 80 per cent. It added that while average nominal wages will rise by £1,470 in the year to October, energy bills will soar by £2,270 in the same period, leaving workers £800 worse off. 'Nobody should have to worry about heating their homes this winter,' said TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady. 'But millions are facing bankrupting bills in the months ahead. 'Today's energy price rise will be a hammer blow to family budgets and tip many households into fuel poverty. Ministers must immediately cancel this catastrophic increase. 'This is the worst possible time for the government to go missing in action. And to make sure energy remains affordable to everyone, they should bring the energy retail companies into public ownership.' Sharon Graham, the general secretary of trade union Unite, said that the fuel crisis is set to become worse for workers after the energy price was set 80 per cent higher. 'We know now that rampant corporate profiteering is at the very heart of our soaring energy bills and Ofgem's soaring price cap. 'Until this corporate looting of our energy networks is confronted, the fuel crisis will become more and more perilous for workers and their families.' And Katie Schmuecker, principal policy adviser for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said households are 'crying out for certainty and security'. She said: 'It is simply unthinkable that the price rises announced today can go ahead without further Government intervention on a significant scale. 'To force the burden of rising wholesale energy prices onto households will plunge many into destitution. 'Millions more will face the threat of bills they simply cannot pay, homes they cannot heat and stomachs they cannot fill. It is the job of Government to decide how the burden is fairly shared between families, businesses and the public finances. 'Whoever occupies Number 10 next will be remembered for who they protect - they must make sure energy doesn't become a luxury only the wealthy can afford.' Energy consultants warned households could see their fuel bills cost more than their monthly mortgage payments next year as energy prices skyrocket. Many people are set to see their disposable incomes shrink significantly in the new year with some seeing the cost of their utility bills catching up with, or overtaking, their mortgage. Energy prices could spike at as much as £6,823 per year for the average household from next April, according to the latest forecast by energy consultancy Auxilion, which amounts to about £569 a month. In comparison, the average bill in October 2021 was £1,400 a year. Homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages pay £741 a month on average, according to the latest data from trade body UK Finance, compiled in December. That means homeowners could see just a £172 difference in the cost of paying their mortgage and heating their home. For those with a standard variable rate (SVR) mortgage, the figures are even starker. The average SVR mortgage monthly repayment, which borrowers can be transferred to once their fixed or tracker mortgage deal comes to an end, amounts to £516, UK Finance said. That means that some households could end up paying £53 more on their utility bills than their mortgage as runaway energy prices overtake the cost of owning a home. Meanwhile, people tied to a tracker mortgage, which directly track the Bank of England's base rate, will see around £50 added to their typical costs, according to calculations by the trade body. And renters are set to face even more drastic mounting costs amid the cost-of-living crisis. Rents have spiralled over the past few years and the average monthly cost of a newly let property reached £1,166 in July, or £2,008 for Greater London, according to figures from estate agents Hamptons. Such rapid price growth means that the average two-bed home, at £1,068pcm, now costs what the average three-bed cost just 16 months ago. While the average one-bed, at £929pcm, is now worth what the average two-bed cost two years ago, Hamptons said. The combined effect of higher mortgage repayments or monthly rent and surging bills could put some people under serious financial pressure in the months ahead. Several high street banks have set aside hundreds of millions of pounds to prepare for an increase in customers defaulting on their loan repayments. Households and businesses have been warned that the 'era of cheap energy is over', after energy regulator Ofgem hiked bills today. The UK is going to see gas prices remain high over the next few years, even if some of the current extreme costs ease off, said Nathan Piper, an oil and gas analyst at Investec. As Europe severs ties with Russia, the UK is going to become increasingly reliant on liquified natural gas (LNG), which is transported around the world on ships, he said. This is naturally more expensive than gas piped across continents, and will mean prices stay well above the historical average. In the 10 years before the current gas crisis, prices averaged around 50p per therm, a popular unit of measurement. Now it stands closer to £6, a 12-fold increase. 'The crazy thing is we are experiencing record UK gas prices at the moment, in the middle of summer, which just doesn't normally happen,' Mr Piper said. He said that if you want to buy your gas in advance for 2025 at the moment you are still going to pay several times more than in the past. Data from the Intercontinental Exchange shows that gas prices for the winter of 2024 and 2025 is trading at nearly 420p. 'For the UK, in particular, we are going to be more and more reliant upon LNG imports to satisfy our gas demand. And as a consequence, we will have to get used to higher gas prices into the long term,' Mr Piper said. 'I think we have to accept that we'll have to endure much higher gas prices than we've been to. And the era of cheap energy is over.' For households this will mean incredible pain this winter which is unlikely to subside for years to come. The sheer longevity of the increase is the perhaps the most unusual part of this crisis. 'You occasionally get gas price spikes. So for a very short duration, because you get a cold snap, Beast from the East, whatever it is, you get short-lived spikes in gas prices, and everyone goes 'goodness me, look at that',' Mr Piper said. But afterwards things used to quickly return to normal. This is not what is happening now. Prices were already rising before Russia invaded Ukraine, but since then the situation has worsened. Problems in France's nuclear plants have also pushed up the price of electricity, a hot dry summer has reduced power production from Norway's rivers, and low water levels on the Rhine have made it harder to transport coal in Germany. Asked what else could go wrong, Mr Piper said that LNG terminals might break down, and Russia could cut off its remaining gas flows to Europe. 'What we're relying upon is that all the LNG terminals are able to produce gas,' he said. 'A lot of these terminals are running almost at maximum capacity. And if you run anything at maximum capacity, there is the issue that it could break down. The other thing is that the Russians could shut off the Nord Stream 1 pipeline completely.' Gas prices spiked earlier this week after Gazprom announced it would shut the pipe for three days of maintenance next week. 'The question mark is will they turn it back on,' Mr Piper said. What happens next remains to be seen. 'Blackouts will be avoided by what economists call demand destruction, where businesses and people cut their usage because they can't afford to keep it up. 'Heavy industry across Germany across Europe elsewhere, is effectively shutting down because they can't secure gas or electricity prices at anything like a competitive level over the next two or three years,' he said. 'If it was a spike, you'd go 'oh this is terrible, but actually we can lock in competitive prices for the next two years and we can still produce fertiliser, cement, glass, whatever, at an economic price'.' In comparison, US manufacturers are seeing much higher prices, but still far below what Europe is seeing, making them more competitive than European counterparts. Lloyds Banking Group said it had put aside £377 million to cover loan losses, while Barclays reported it set aside £341 million in July as the economic outlook worsened. Charities have warned that many people could face hardship during the colder months of the year when they may be forced to choose between 'eating or heating'. Citizens Advice said that a quarter of people in the UK will not be able to afford to pay their energy bills in October based on current forecasts, jumping to a third of people in January when prices will soar higher. It said its analysis took into account the energy rebate and cost-of-living payments offered by the Government, showing that the support on offer does not go far enough to protect households from spiralling costs. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: 'Every single day at Citizens Advice we're already helping people in the most heart-breaking circumstances, trying to scrape together enough to feed their kids and keep the lights on. This will get far, far worse unless the Government acts. 'It's becoming increasingly clear that skyrocketing prices will swallow up all of the help that has been announced so far.' Furthermore, disability charity Scope said that disabled people are likely to be harder hit when October's energy price hikes come into force. 'Scope has been inundated with calls from disabled people who have been forced to make dire cutbacks on personal care, hygiene, food and energy because of rampaging inflation,' said Tom Marsland, policy manager at Scope. 'This is having a devastating impact on disabled people's lives, and the support from Government just won't touch the side.' Scope said it had heard from people who are forced to stop heating their homes to power lifesaving equipment and others who are skipping meals so their children can eat, the charity said. It also noted that referrals to its disability energy support service had increased five-fold between February and July, compared to the same period last year, partly because of rising costs. Meanwhile Miss Truss is set to end the ban on fracking as part of a plan to make the UK an 'energy-secure dynamo'. The Foreign Secretary said Britain cannot be 'held hostage' by authoritarian regimes and must end its reliance on foreign imports within a decade. She pledged to win the support of local communities for fracking by 'ensuring' they see the benefits, and said new projects will only go ahead if there is a 'clear public consensus' in their favour. It came as one fracking company in the North of England claimed, in a letter to the Treasury, that it would be likely to be able to inject shale gas into the energy market by January if it were granted a licence immediately. Writing in today's Daily Mail, Miss Truss said: 'In a world where authoritarian regimes are willing to weaponise energy, we cannot afford to be held hostage... 'We do not rely on Russian gas, unlike our European allies, but no country is safe from malign efforts to push up energy prices. Energy security starts at home, which is why we must radically boost our domestic supplies. 'We will end the effective ban on extracting our huge reserves of shale gas by fracking but be led by science, setting out a plan to ensure communities benefit. Fracking will only take place in areas with a clear public consensus behind it.' The comments suggest she will go considerably further than previous Tory administrations to win over local communities. Boris Johnson placed a moratorium on fracking in 2019 after widespread opposition from the public, and concerns over earthquakes. YouGov polling recently found 53 per cent of Britons would support fracking if it meant a reduction in bills for people in the community. Miss Truss also today states her support for nuclear power, citing small modular reactors made by Rolls-Royce, and promises to 'champion renewables such as wind and tidal'. She concluded: 'This is why I believe our great country can become over the next decade an energy-secure dynamo, which could be powering Europe as a net energy secure exporter.' Her comments came as Mr Zahawi held meetings with nuclear and renewable energy producers to discuss how Britain can reduce its reliance on international markets. Treasury officials have put a menu of options together for the new prime minister, including a recommendation to re-start fracking to secure the nation's energy security. The new 'three winter' plan aims to bring down energy bills between now and 2025. A Treasury source told The Daily Telegraph: 'The third winter is about increasing our general energy supply through things like North Sea drilling, more nuclear, more renewable, more wind.' Support for fracking has grown as soaring gas prices have hit household budgets, with Tory members voicing their support for new drillings in leadership hustings. A mining engineer, speaking at the hustings in Manchester, said: 'You cannot run, you cannot grow, you cannot progress a modern economy without a secure supply of cheap, abundant, readily available energy. Right below our feet is the largest energy bonanza this country has ever discovered, bigger than coal and bigger than the North Sea.' Fracking involves injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into boreholes a mile underground to fracture the rock and release gas or oil. A Treasury source said: 'The Chancellor wants to see a proper cost-benefit analysis of fracking, with safety and the environment taken in as considerations. 'Energy bills are rising... and we need to look at everything on our disposal.' Fracking started in Lancashire at two sites run by Cuadrilla in 2010, but the Government imposed a seven-year moratorium in 2011 because of tremors. When the sites reopened, they were met with protests from locals and groups including Extinction Rebellion. In November 2019, the Government announced a moratorium, citing a report that found current technology could not predict the likelihood of tremors. ** Are you going to struggle with energy bills this winter? Please email: james.robinson@mailonline.co.uk ** Here is a selection of thoughts from Britons around the country about the latest energy price cap rise which will send the average household's yearly bill from £1,971 now to £3,549 from October: Esme Marshwitch - Alton, Hampshire (glass worker at The Glassy Witch) 'This is nothing short of catastrophic, which in fairness, I am rather resigned to due to our government. Calling it a 'cap' is laughable. Just as when University fees came in, as soon as they were allowed to charge 'up to 9k' per year, whoosh! Up they ALL went. Meddling in the prices levied by the energy companies is what has brought us to these spikes in the first place. I fear for the winter, and how many more will suffer from lack of food, or heat. And I don't know what the answer is. Maybe heavy investment in renewables, and retaining public ownership of such ventures, rather than selling off to some venture capitalist somewhere might be an idea? Won't do much right now, but it would at least be the start of a push that ought to have started in the Thatcher years, rather than chasing the next commodity sell off.' Lee Chambers - Preston, Lancashire (psychologist for Essentialise Workplace Wellbeing) 'We are in for a winter of discontent with both businesses and consumers backed into a corner with a necessity more than doubling in price. This isn't an incremental rise, it's more like a volcano erupting. This will skittle some businesses that simply can't absorb the costs, and sadly they will be the same small businesses that were neglected during the pandemic. We have to look at why so much pressure has built in the system. But more than anything, I'm concerned about the mental toll and distress this will cause, as it's not as easy to measure as a price cap but in our work it's already becoming a priority concern and stressor for people struggling from a variety of walks of life. Energy bills don't discriminate.' Jackie Mulligan - Shipley, West Yorkshire (founder of local shopping platform ShopAppy) 'This latest energy price cap increase will pummel small businesses and the people who run them up and down the country. Many are already at breaking point after two years of the pandemic, with a significant percentage now paying off the Government-backed loans they had to take out to survive. Unless the Government acts soon and acts decisively, many small businesses, which are the beating heart of our communities, will struggle to survive. The UK economy is on red alert and millions of small family-run businesses are facing an existential threat from rising inflation and interest rates, and falling sales. We have come out of the pandemic pan into the inflationary fire.' Graham Wells - Haddington, East Lothian (financial adviser at GroWiser Financial Coaching) 'We're all suffering from the unintended consequences of government meddling with the pricing of privately owned energy supplies. From 2019, the price of energy units has been capped in an attempt to stop consumers being ripped off. That sounds fine, but it means the short sighted, vote-winning policy has landed us with huge price spikes, rather than more gradual increases, which are easier to plan for. It's now vital that the Government provides the support that's needed to cushion consumers from these excruciating price increases. Maybe it's time for leaders to re-consider the sale of publicly-owned utility provision and properly embrace the UK's potential for hydro, wind, wave and tidal power.' Natalie Bamford - Derby (chief executive of gift box company Colleague Box) 'This is just another dagger in the heart for small business owners. The crushing realisation that no matter what you do, your performance, sales, your deemed success will inevitably be out of your hands and instead controlled by the greedy corrupt few at the top who only care about profit. The reality is that those in power couldn't care less about small business owners so you're left to fend for yourself, hope and pray that you make it through yet another avalanche of adversity.' Lewis Shaw - Mansfield, Nottinghamshire (mortgage expert at Shaw Financial Services) 'Welcome to our winter of discontent. We are utterly rudderless in a storm with nobody on deck taking charge. This has all the hallmarks of serious civil unrest if we're not careful. People are already stretched beyond breaking point, which will be the last straw. The worst thing is that even an emergency budget won't be able to tackle the crisis due to the time it takes to get through Parliament and the OBR. With further base rate increases to contend with and another price cap hike in January, it's fair to say our economy is broken, and we're teetering on the brink. Nikki Collier - Sudbury, Suffolk (owner of baby clothes firm BiNibabies) 'This could be the end. I've survived a pandemic, I've survived a post pandemic shift in shopping habits but today's news may just topple my business. My bills have already doubled from February to August, so just what do we do? I'm absolutely lost for words. The country is crumbling and on its knees. We really do need to keep local businesses going otherwise millions of people will be in severe financial difficulty. Samuel Mather-Holgate - Swindon, Wiltshire (financial advisor at Mather and Murray Financial) 'I am really worried about the energy market in the UK. Prices are up by 80% or an average of over £130 per month but the UK Government is spending less on support than our European neighbours like Germany, Italy and France. We need much more help. For some low and medium income families, finding an extra £130 each month will be impossible and, as we know, things are going to get worse in the winter. The new Prime Minister needs to make this their number one priority, by immediately increasing the £400 rebate.' Maddy Alexander-Grout - Southampton (chief executive at money saving app My VIP Rewards) 'This latest announcement is going to ruin Christmas for countless families around the UK and make winter potentially brutal. Millions of people simply can't afford their energy bills already and it's only going to get worse. Employers need to be doing more to support their staff but most can't afford pay rises as the economic climate is volatile at best, with a recession looming. This next six months will be an extremely testing time for everyone.' Rhys Schofield - Belper, Derbyshire (mortgage and insurance expert at Peak Money) 'It's catastrophic. The Government isn't just asleep at the wheel, it genuinely feels like they couldn't care less about the plight of normal people and businesses. They botched Brexit, they botched the response to Covid and now they're botching handling the cost of living crisis.' Lucie Mann - Southampton (regenerative culture expert at New Forest Aquaponics) 'The impact on our non-profit could be catastrophic. We are an aquaponic farm and have to pump water and oxygen around the systems to keep the fish alive. This week, we will be working on the systems so we can reduce the number of pumps running. However, there will be a limit of how many times we can do this, with the survival of many fish at risk. The Government needs to act and act now.' Graham Cox - Bristol (mortgage expert at SelfEmployedMortgageHub.com) 'The energy price cap has almost tripled already this year, with further hikes to come. Clearly, this is unsustainable. The case for expanding the windfall tax is now overwhelming. The £5 billion it's currently set to raise will barely touch the sides. And with the cost of renewable energy about a tenth of gas last week, the government needs to double down on wind and solar power. Mortgage affordability is going to become even tougher. I expect more lenders to decline deals that would have sailed through a year ago, down valuations to increase and property prices to fall sharply over the next year.' Suzanne Noble - Kilburn, North West London (education expert at Startup School for Seniors) 'We've noticed a rise in applications to our programme, Startup School for Seniors, supporting people to start a business, caused by many people's concerns about how they will pay their bills this winter. The money has to come from somewhere, and creating a side hustle is one way to try and fill an income gap.' Ryan Joyce - Nottingham (mortgages expert at Key Mortages) 'This will undoubtedly have an impact for consumers as we are not talking about a slight increase, we are talking about hundreds of pounds a month which will cause a squeeze for anybody. I expect to see a shift in how much consumers are able to borrow as lenders will no doubt adjust their affordability calculations. This will mean people cannot afford the houses they would like to buy and therefore demand for property is likely to fall. However, what we may also see is people being unable to afford their mortgages when their fixed deals end due to rising interest rates, which may cause people to look to sell and downsize.' Luke Loveridge - Bristol (founder of property data experts Propflo) 'This huge increase highlights our over-reliance on fossil fuels. We need a carbon net neutral, more resilient energy system. There is general lack of awareness of the wider benefits of more energy efficient homes. In addition to the temporary help with bills, the Government should phase out the cap altogether and provide support for people to finance green improvements to their homes and incentives for landlords.' Small firms are pleading for the Government to step in over sky-high energy bills, which have soared by as much as 400 per cent in some cases, leaving many fearing they could be put out of business by the end of the year. More than half of small companies — 54 per cent — fear their running costs could force them to close, according to a report by SME Insights and insurer Simply Business. Businesses are not protected by energy watchdog Ofgem's price cap and they face paying 20 per cent VAT on their energy bills, whereas most ordinary households pay five per cent. The crippling energy price increases are forcing many of Britain's remaining pubs, restaurants and high street businesses - which have scraped through lockdown - to reduce their hours, and in some cases, close permanently.

Murray in Bristol — known as 'Murray's' to its loyal regulars — closed its doors for the final time this month after 28 years at the premises, which has been occupied by a long line of butchers since the 1800s. Tom Murray, 65, had planned to leave his beloved business in the safe hands of Nathan Havnes, 32, who joined Murray's as an apprentice when he was 16. But supply costs have risen drastically, the price of beef and cheese for the deli counter is up 15 per cent, and the shop's £11,000 business rates bill is also expected to escalate. When Mr Martin's energy supplier raised his annual bill from £7,000 to £22,000, he says it left him with no choice but to close. 'It was the straw that broke the camel's back,' Mr Martin said. 'We made a £30,000 profit in a good year, but those energy bills would have left us with a loss. Abby McKellar, 46, is considering closing the holiday let business she runs with her husband Matt, 50, over winter in order to stay afloat. Little Norton Mill, which comprises four self-catering cottages and four apartments in rural Somerset, relies solely on electricity. In January, their energy bills increased by 70 per cent from £10,000 to £17,000 a year. And the couple fear they could spiral further when their fixed deal ends at the beginning of next year. Abby says: 'To soak up the electricity cost alone, we would have had to increase our prices by 10 per cent this year — and that does not even include all the other costs that are going up. 'If you raise those prices, people will just stop coming. It's a perfect storm.' 'Nathan has two sons and the last thing I wanted was to put him in a situation where he would struggle, which could affect his family life. 'It feels that while there is some support for households, small businesses have just been dropped by local councils and the government,' he adds. The story is far from isolated as thousands of small businesses, many of which struggled to survive through the pandemic, are on the verge of collapse due to the cost-of-living crisis. Last night, experts warned that the energy crisis could 'shut down' Britain this winter, leaving high streets devoid of pubs, shops and restaurants. Lily and Stuart Beaton have also been left with no alternative but to shut up shop. The family-run Ainsty Farm Shop in Green Hammerton, North Yorkshire, which has a butcher, baker and deli, has served its local community for 22 years. During the pandemic, they boxed up and hand-delivered food to older people in the nearby area who weren't able to leave their homes. But when the couple's gas and electricity deal ends in September, their bills are set to more than triple, from £20,000 to £76,000 a year. Lily, 52, says: 'We have no choice but to shut. Myself, my husband and my 18-year-old son Henry all work here full time, so we have basically all lost our jobs. 'You watch the news and hope that somebody is going to step in and do something about the energy crisis, but nobody has. 'I think we've been overlooked. Most small businesses don't run on big margins. We realised we would be making a loss once we paid that first bill. 'We can't pass on higher costs to our local customers, many of whom are retired. People are going to have to shop at places they can afford.' And Lily fears other enterprises will be forced to follow in their footsteps. 'At some point soon, people are going to want to treat themselves to fish and chips or want to pop to the local farm shop, and they won't be there,' the mother-of-three adds. Nearly three-quarters of pub landlords say they have seen their utility bills double as they urged the Government to reduce VAT and business rates. Critics fear this could be the death knell for many of Britain's high streets. Pubs are being driven towards 'extinction' by soaring energy bills – with as many as seven in ten saying they will not survive the winter. Two-thirds of pubs said their bills have more than doubled this year, while almost one in ten (8 per cent) have seen them rise by more than 500 per cent. And around 70 per cent of pubs surveyed by industry magazine The Morning Advertiser said they would go bust this winter without Government support – which the magazine warned amounts to 'extinction'. Businesses are not protected by the energy regulator's price cap, meaning pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK will be forced to pay market rates for gas and electricity. While Ofgem's household price cap is expected to rise from £2,700 to £3,700 in October – and by much more after that – businesses will be left at the mercy of volatile markets. It comes after industry leaders pointed out that if the price of beer had risen at the same rate as wholesale gas, a pint would cost £25. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said the sector was facing 'unsustainable' energy hikes, and called for business rates relief and the removal of VAT from energy bills until prices become affordable. She said: 'Without this support there is no doubt that many of the UK's most loved pubs and bars will not survive to see the New Year, robbing many of their livelihoods and ripping the heart out of communities across the UK.' Heath Ball, from the Frisco Group of three pubs in south-east England, warned the soaring bills posed an even bigger threat to the sector than the pandemic. Mr Ball said: 'Brits face the prospect of losing thousands of pubs if something isn't done soon to help.' Sacha Lord, Greater Manchester's night-time economy adviser, said staying in business was becoming 'near impossible' for many. 'I think we will see pubs closing at a record rate over the next 12 months,' he added. There were 20,200 fewer businesses between April and June this year than there were during the same period last year — the largest loss recorded by Labour researchers in five years. Clive Betts, Labour MP for Sheffield South East and chair of the Levelling Up Committee, says: 'I think for many struggling businesses, these soaring bills could be the tipping point. 'Empty shops make up 20 per cent of some high streets, and if this figure continues to multiply they will just become redundant because shoppers won't visit them. 'People looking to set up new businesses such as cafes and restaurants may also reconsider opening at all.' Independent retail expert Clare Bailey adds: 'The combination of these rising costs will inevitably prompt some small firms to reconsider if they need high street premises or whether they can do everything online instead. 'This will potentially lead to an increase in shops leaving the high street.' There was also a sharp increase in the number of companies applying for credit between April and July this year, research by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) shows. About 11.5 per cent made a credit application compared to a record low of 9.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Small businesses, which employ 16 million people among them, are particularly vulnerable to bill increases. This is because they are not protected by energy watchdog Ofgem's price cap — currently an average of £1,971 a year. Firms are also not entitled to government support, so are missing out on the £400 discount and £150 council tax rebate announced earlier this year. On top of this, many pay 20 per cent in VAT on energy bills — whereas most ordinary households pay 5 per cent. The FSB is now calling for the Government to step in and extend the price cap to Britain's smallest firms. While some local councils offer general hardship funds for firms in financial difficulties, there is no specific help with energy bill hikes. Alan Soady, an FSB spokesman, says: 'Small businesses are seeing astronomical and unsustainable hikes in energy bills right now. Without urgent support this is fast becoming an existential threat to some small firms, coming on top of a wider cost of doing business crisis. 'While domestic consumers quite rightly have at least some protection through the price cap and are being given direct cash support, there is no cap for small businesses and currently no financial support either, despite many seeing bills going up three-fold, four-fold and more.' In Droxford, Hampshire, pub landlord Shekhar Nailwal, 45, said he was left 'on his knees' with rocketing fuel, food and alcohol bills. It led to him and his wife, Alex, 39, to take the 'heartbreakingly sad' decision to close their much-loved The White Horse after eight years. The quaint village pub was well-loved in its local community for its unusual Indian menu served alongside traditional lagers and cosy inn decor, with a sprawling terrace garden. The closure means Mr and Mrs Nailwal may now have to move their two sons Rudra, 10, and Prem, 14, away from the village they have called home for the best part of a decade. The pub's energy bills have doubled and the price of a box of chicken has gone up by a whopping £25 from £30 to £55, leaving running costs completely unsustainable. The couple say Admiral Taverns, who they rented the pub from, refused to help Mr Nailwal said: 'The cost of everything is rising and we can't keep passing that on to the customers because people are already suffering. 'In a cost of living crisis, the first thing to go is going to the pub and going out to eat. It's not just simple numbers, it's a lot of factors. 'We have been trying to sustain the costs since January. We luckily made it out of lockdown thanks to our customers and help from the government. But the cost of supplies and fuel has gone up so suddenly. 'It's just all these small things adding up and adding up and suddenly the business is just not financially viable anymore. 'The worst part for us is our kids go to school here, we have brought our family up living upstairs from this pub. 'People travel for miles to come and eat here and they're all devastated. We're all just really, really upset.' Mrs Nailwal added: 'We've invested so much time and effort into this place, even sacrificing our time with the kids for the sake of this pub and the community, which we love. 'It's so heartbreaking because we feel like we're all part of a big happy family but now we have to break up with them.' A spokesperson from Admiral Taverns said: 'We have 1,600 pubs across the country, and we work hard to work in partnership with all our licensees. 'The licensee has taken the decision to leave, and we are in the process of looking for a new licensee to take on the pub, and ensure the White Horse has a long-term, sustainable future.' In south Wales, pub landlords Colin Ross and Tom Davies say they were forced to quit their beloved pub due to 'astronomical' energy bills. The lifelong friends told Wales Online they are leaving the Hafodyrynys Inn, near Crumlin, 'with a tear in their eye' after 26 years . After narrowly making it through Covid restrictions, Mr Ross said a 'ridiculously high' increase in energy costs was 'the final nail in the coffin'. He said: 'Gas and electricity have more than doubled. Our contract expired at the end of July and we're on a new rate which is astronomical. Before, it was £700 monthly, which is high anyway, and it's gone up to near enough £2,000. It makes it impossible to stay here. 'I think something should be done about it because at the end of the day, more places are going to go out of business. It's not just businesses facing high bills, it's the customers, and they're not going to be coming out with extra money to spend on beer and food.' They said they were unable to negotiate a reduction in rent with owner Admiral Taverns, despite the sharp rise in inflation. The pair's last day will be September 4 and their Facebook page has been flooded with comments from saddened customers. One said: 'How sad to be reading this, you have dished up the best ever Sunday lunch and your staff are amazing.' Another wrote: 'Such devastating news. You have both worked so hard to build up the pub over the years, you're a credit to the trade.' Elsewhere, The Hand Hotel in the village of Llanarmon, near Wrexham, north Wales, is faced with running costs that have soared from £1,900 to £9,500 per month. Owner Jonathan Greatorex says he was shocked to open his renewal quote to see the eye-watering sums for the fine dining restaurant, which is featured in the Michelin Guide. He is now calling on the government to take action - and says ensuring that his staff are well-provided for is his priority. Mr Greatorex said: 'It is staggering. For many businesses these increases are not survivable. The increase in costs would see us paying four times our monthly mortgage for energy. 'Without action and support we will have to look at options like closing a couple of days a week or shorter opening hours. 'As with the Covid pandemic our first concern is the staff we have here, we feel that responsibility and will always put staff first.' Mr Greatorex says businesses are set to suffer with the surge in power bills - and warns jobs across the country will be at risk. He said: 'We have this moribund government playing a second rate game of The Apprentice and we can't wait until the September 5, when the winner will be announced, for action on this. 'There is also the obsession with the household cap and it is horrendous and invidious that families will be in the situation of choosing between eating and heating. But they have totally missed the effects on businesses. 'This will affect the very fabric of society once food shops and petrol stations start to close as they inevitably will without intervention. 'And how are households going to manage their bills if people are losing their jobs.' 'We can't just blame this on Russia, energy companies are making billions of pounds of extra profits this year. This is not a luxury item and they have a moral responsibility to do more to help.' The Hand's financial woes are a sad turnout for a restaurant which has been praised for offering 'destination dining at its best' in a review this month by Mail on Sunday. Reviewer Simon Hepinstall praised The Hand's head chef, Greg Mulholland, who has two AA Rosettes for 'culinary excellence' and has led its fine dining over the past 18 years. In another case, David Bright is CEO of Renovare Group, which has seven hospitality venues. He says one of its holdings, a small hotel in Wales, had an average monthly electricity bill of £2,000 prior to April of this year but his July bill has now come in at £7,000. Its heating system runs on oil and that was 35p a litre on average a year ago, yet this is now 92p. Mr Bright said: 'While we took a beating during covid which had a major impact on our situation, we are now faced with the inevitability of a stagnant 2023/24. 'It is clear that any profits we had projected will be swallowed up by the ridiculous raises in energy that we are being forced to swallow. Our losses will most likely equal those during covid. 'At the moment, I have made the difficult decision to shut two of the seven venues and I hope that with the savings made, we will be able to weather the storm. We employ over 70 people and I am pleased to say that those affected by the closures were either students returning to school or they were rehoused at other venues. 'This will not resolve itself soon. I have been forced to raise my prices by 5 per cent in the immediate future and we will have to look at it again before Christmas.' In Rotherham, South Yorkshire, couple Damien and Maxine Bailey closed their tattoo parlour Bailey's Body Art after 16 years, saying they could no longer manage the rising costs. Mrs Bailey told Mail Online they were devastated at its loss. She said: 'We gave our blood, sweat and tears, sometimes starved and went without anything good to keep it afloat and now it has gone. What a waste of our lives. 'We have children we hoped to pass it on to.... I worked in lockdown for this country and for what. We never had any financial assistance.' In a parting message, Mr Bailey posted that their 'hearts were broken' and they 'gave it all they had over 16 years'. In Edinburgh, much-loved pub Monty's in the popular Haymarket, says it is being forced to shut down after the double whammy of the pandemic and the rising cost in bills. The pub, which opened to much fanfare in 2016, has not announced a closure date yet said it would continue to serve 'while supplies last'. The pub made the announcement to customers on Instagram this month. They posted: 'After almost six years of building up our wee business, serving some of the best beers in town, amazing selection of whiskies and local spirits, and some amazing products, I have to announce that Monty's will be closing at the end of the month. 'Unfortunately the high rent, the pandemic, cost of living, rising costs of everything, it doesn't work in our favour. I have tried to fight for a rent reduction, unfortunately our landlords would like someone in with a more commercial offering.' Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, says scores of firms have been struggling since late last year. He predicts many will try to stay open over Christmas, hoping for increased sales, but that the crunch point will come in the New Year. And with households having to tighten their own purse strings, he fears a bleak winter ahead. 'That's when the cash flow is normally under pressure and it could be the tipping point for many. We should have had this debate nine months ago. The warning signs were there,' Mr Goodacre adds. Tarun Gidoomal, general manager of wholesale marketplace Ankorstore, said: '(Today) marks the announcement of a new energy price cap for consumers, however, it's remarkable that no such cap exists to protect Britain's independent retailers and small businesses. 'With the traditional renewal date of October 1st for fixed price energy contracts looming, 92 per cent of British independent retailers have stated that their local high street is already struggling, with three-quarters (74 per cent) believing that an upcoming recession will provide the largest threat to their survival, almost double the threat posed by COVID. Simply put - time is running out for the government to step up and protect retailers. 'We urge the government to introduce a price cap for British SMEs, including independent retailers and brands, as well as supporting BCC's proposal for a temporary cut in VAT to 5 per cent to reduce energy costs for businesses.' Nearly seven in ten firms now expect their energy bills to rise in the next three months, with almost a third predicting increases of more than 30 per cent, according to research by the Confederation of British Industry. Matthew Fell, chief policy director at the lobby group, says: 'The guiding principles for any intervention must be to act at speed, and to target help at those households and firms that need it most.' Tory leadership front runner Liz Truss has hinted she may help smaller companies but would not 'reach first for the handout'. In an interview with the Sun on Sunday she said: 'I'm very, very aware that it's not just customers, or consumers, that are facing energy price problems, it's small businesses.' But along with rocketing energy bills, small businesses are also facing increased costs in supply chains with the hike in food and fuel costs, and many are juggling debt repayments after signing up for bounce-back loans during the pandemic. Independent retailers were given 100 per cent relief on business rates in 2020, to help them through the pandemic. But this relief was slashed to 66 per cent in July 2021, and then to 50 per cent in April this year. Meanwhile, most Scottish firms are now back to paying full business rates —unless they are eligible for Scotland's Small Business Bonus Scheme And rates are set to surge even higher next year — as increases are pegged against next month's Consumer Price Index inflation figure, which is predicted to hit 13.3 per cent. Real estate advisory firm Altus Group estimates that even at 11 per cent, it would add £3 billion to businesses' tax bills in England — the single biggest jump in the space of a year since the tax was introduced in 1990. Val Burrows, 64, who runs a launderette in East Grinstead, West Sussex, saw her energy bills rise by 173 per cent when her fixed offer ended in July. And unlike other high street businesses, she says she cannot cut back on energy usage. Miss Burrows, who lives in nearby Lindfield, thinks that the Government should impose a blanket energy cap for businesses, and that there should be emergency funds available like those given out during the pandemic. As a sole trader, she says she has to continue until her lease ends next year. 'But then I may have to consider shutting up shop if I don't get financial help,' she says. A spokesman from the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy says: 'No national government can control the global factors pushing up the price of energy, but we will continue to support business in navigating the months ahead.' It adds that this support includes slashing fuel duty by 5p per litre for a year until March 2023, and the 50 per cent business rates relief."
2022-08-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11150407/Protesters-outside-Ofgem-HQ-Canary-Wharf-chant-amid-mounting-public-anger-energy-price-cap.html,"'Freeze profits, not people': Furious protesters take to the streets outside Ofgem HQ as anger mounts at 80% energy price cap hike - and Chancellor Zahawi faces backlash for urging people to RATION to save money","Around 100 angry protesters gathered outside Ofgem 's headquarters in London today chanting 'freeze profits, not people' amid mounting public anger over soaring bills - and after Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi warned that Britons will need to ration their energy use to save money. Members of the crowd shouted 'enough is enough' and said the energy regulators 'don't care about us at all' as they gathered on the street in Canary Wharf amid grim predictions about the impact the 80 per cent hike in the price cap will have on households across the UK. Frustrated demonstrators said Ofgem's decision to increase the cap will plunge millions of children below the poverty line - as campaigners, including MoneySavingExpert's Martin Lewis warned that vulnerable people will died in the coming months as a result of the cost of living cirsis. Ten officers were present on the other side of the street, as well as security guards, with police vans lining the road outside the building. It comes as Mr Zahawi, who is likely to be out of a job in the coming days if Liz Truss wins the keys to No10, faces a backlash for suggesting that people should be starting to ration their electricity and gas use to save money, blaming Vladimir Putin's barbaric war in Ukraine for the biggest cost of living squeeze on British households since the 1950s. His advice to people to start rationing their energy comes as Ofgem confirmed an 80 per cent rise in the price cap which will send the average household's yearly bill rocketing from £1,971 to £3,549. The move will affect 24million Britons from October 1, while the 4.5million on pre-payment meters - who are often the most vulnerable and already in fuel poverty - could see even higher average bills of £3,608. In response to the price cap rise, more than 100 protestors turned up to demonstrate against the energy price hikes outside Ofgem's headquarters in Canary Wharf. Angry members of the crowd shouted 'enough is enough' and 'freeze profits, not people' as they gathered on the street. The protest had been promoted by Don't Pay UK - a grassroots movement that describes its aim as 'building a mass non-payment strike of energy bills starting on October 1.' Some masked demonstrators took to a microphone to lament the 'exorbitant' bills. Britons could die this winter due to surging energy prices, Martin Lewis warned today after Ofgem confirmed an 80 per cent rise in the price cap - sending the average household's yearly bill from £1,971 to £3,549 from October. The cap announcement today will come into effect for around 24million households in England, Scotland and Wales on default energy tariffs on October 1, and will remain in place until December 31, when it will be adjusted again. The 4.5million pre-payment meter customers across Britain, who are often the most vulnerable and already in fuel poverty, will see an even more punishing increase - with their average annual bill set to go up to £3,608. And things could get even worse next year, with experts at consultancy Auxilione using latest gas prices to predict that the cap will rise by another 52 per cent to £5,405 in January 2023, then by a further 34 per cent to £7,263 in April - before falling slightly, by 11 per cent to £6,485 in July and by another 7 per cent to £6,006 in October. MoneySavingExpert founder Mr Lewis, who became emotional at times while giving passionate interviews to TV and radio shows this morning, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I've been accused of catastrophising over this situation. Well, the reason I have catastrophised is this is a catastrophe, plain and simple. If we do not get further government intervention on top of what was announced in May, lives will be lost this winter.' The consumer champion also said the latest rise in the cap means some people will pay up to £10,000 a year in bills. And he warned that there is no cap on the maximum you pay – but the cap is actually a maximum cost per unit that firms can charge for gas and electricity. Currently, this equates to £1,971 a year for the average home. Ofgem said that from October 1 the equivalent per unit level of the price cap to the nearest pence for a typical customer paying by direct debit will be 52p per kWh for electricity customers and a standing charge of 46p per day. The equivalent per unit level for a typical gas customer is 15p per kWh with a standing charge of 28p per day. Jamie Grey, 34, a teacher from Tower Hamlets, said Ofgem 'don't care about us at all'. Ms Grey said she has children well below the poverty line in her class who come from families that will be unable to pay to heat their homes this winter. Vulnerable people will die in the coming months as a result of the cost-of-living crisis, she said. 'I'm teaching children who live below the poverty line already. Most are on a pay-as-you-go energy tariff,' Ms Grey said. 'Ofgem don't care about us. All we have is each other - historically we know mass non-payment and mass movements do work. 'The Government have shown they do not care enough to treat us with humanity.' Ten officers were present on the other side of the street as well as security guards, with police vans lining the road outside the building. Asked by broadcasters if it was time for people to look at their energy use, the Chancellor said: 'The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption. It is a difficult time. There is war on our continent. 'Very few people anticipated war. Wars happen in far-flung places. It is now here with us. We have to remain resilient. My responsibility is to deliver that help.' Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley said the regulator had to make 'difficult trade-offs' when setting the new price cap. He said costs would come back to customers in the long run if companies were to fail. Speaking to Channel 4 News, Mr Brearley said: 'The price cap was designed to do one thing, and that was to make sure that unfair profits aren't charged by those companies that buy and sell energy. And, right now, those profits in that market are 0%. 'What it can't do is it can't say given the cost of the energy that we can force companies to get from customers less than it costs to buy the energy that they need, because otherwise they simply can't buy the energy for those customers' He added: 'What we know from last year is that when companies fail those costs come back to all of us. So, over and above the price we pay, we'd be paying more to re-buy the energy for the customers that come from failed companies. 'So we have had to make some difficult trade-offs, and we have had to make some difficult choices.' Mr Zahawi acknowledged the increase in the price cap would cause 'stress and anxiety' for people, but that the Government was working 'flat out' to develop more options to support households. 'While Putin is driving up energy prices in revenge for our support of Ukraine's brave struggle for freedom, I am working flat out to develop options for further support,' he said. 'This will mean the incoming prime minister can hit the ground running and deliver support to those who need it most, as soon as possible.' Today MoneySavingExpert founder Martin Lewis warned people could die this winter because they could not afford to pay for their energy. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I've been accused of catastrophising over this situation. 'Well, the reason I have catastrophised is this is a catastrophe, plain and simple. 'If we do not get further government intervention on top of what was announced in May, lives will be lost this winter.' The consumer champion also said the latest rise in the cap means some people will pay up to £10,000 a year in bills. And he warned that there is no cap on the maximum you pay – but the cap is actually a maximum cost per unit that firms can charge for gas and electricity. Currently, this equates to £1,971 a year for the average home. Ofgem said that from October 1 the equivalent per unit level of the price cap to the nearest pence for a typical customer paying by direct debit will be 52p per kWh for electricity customers and a standing charge of 46p per day. The equivalent per unit level for a typical gas customer is 15p per kWh with a standing charge of 28p per day. Ofgem's chief executive Jonathan Brearley warned of the hardship energy prices will cause this winter and urged the incoming prime minister and new Cabinet 'to provide an additional and urgent response to continued surging energy prices'. He also said that the gas price this winter was 15 times more than the cost two years ago. The regulator said the increase reflected the continued rise in global wholesale gas prices, which began to surge as the pandemic eased, and had been driven still higher by Russia slowly switching off gas supplies to Europe. Ofgem also warned that energy prices could get 'significantly worse' next year. The regulator said that some suppliers might start increasing the amount that direct debit customers pay before October 1, to spread out payments, but any money taken by suppliers will only ever be spent on supplying energy to households. Philippe Commaret, the managing director of energy giant EDF, has warned that half of UK households could be in fuel poverty in January as a result of rocketing prices. And the Trades Union Congress has said energy bills will rise 35 times faster than wages and 57 times faster than benefits in the last three months of this year. Which? has urged the Government to raise its energy bills discount by at least 150 per cent or risk pushing millions of people into financial distress. The consumer watchdog said Ministers' financial support for all households must increase from the current £400 to £1,000 - or from £67 to £167 per month from October to March. However, no immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 after the Tory leadership contest. What is the energy price cap? The energy price cap decides the maximum cost per unit that energy companies can charge for both gas and electricity. This is then used to calculate a typical annual bill. The price cap was introduced in January 2019 as a way to ensure that households who do not have fixed deals - and who are, in some cases, less financially savvy - are not ripped off by their energy suppliers. Twice a year, energy regulator Ofgem would set the maximum price that households on their supplier's default tariff would have to pay for every unit of gas and electricity they used for the next six months. It allowed for a small profit - capped at 1.9 per cent - that energy suppliers were permitted to take for supplying the service. The frequency of the cap was increased on August 4 from every six to every three months. How is the price cap calculated? The cap is calculated by Ofgem based on the wholesale price of gas and electricity and also includes allowances for tax, charges paid to the energy networks, green levies and social payments. What is happening to the price cap? The price cap is going up significantly. The 80 per cent rise announced today - which comes into force from October 1 - will push the cap to £3,549 per year for the average household. This is the highest it has ever been. Can my bills be higher than the price cap? Experts warn there is no cap on the maximum households pay – but the cap is actually a maximum cost per unit that firms can charge for gas and electricity. The actual cap for each home therefore varies according to use. Ofgem said that from October 1 the equivalent per unit level of the price cap to the nearest pence for a typical customer paying by direct debit will be 52p per kWh for electricity customers and a standing charge of 46p per day. The equivalent per unit level for a typical gas customer is 15p per kWh with a standing charge of 28p per day. Why is the price cap going up? The price cap on energy bills is linked to the wholesale price of gas and electricity, which is itself based on what happens on European markets. The wholesale price of gas has soared by around eightfold in the last year. That rise has been passed onto customers in increments - the price cap was already at a record £1,971 over the summer. Gas prices were already increasing last summer as demand bounced as countries emerged from lockdown but the situation was made much worse when Russia invaded Ukraine and started to restrict gas exports to Europe. Gas prices are also decisive for electricity prices, because gas is so important for the generation of electricity. Over the last year, 42 per cent of the UK's electricity came from burning gas. Ofgem said the increase reflected the continued rise in global wholesale gas prices, which began to surge as the world unlocked from the Covid pandemic, and had been driven still higher to record levels by Russia's actions. When will the price cap change again? The price cap will be changed again in January 2023. It used to be changed twice a year, but changes announced on August 4 mean it will be reviewed every three months. It will change again in April, July and October 2023. What is the price cap likely to be like next year? Experts expect the cap to rise significantly in January 2023 and again in April, and then to fall back again in July and October next year - but the exact levels of the cap remains to be seen. Experts at Cornwall Insight expect the cap to hit £5,387 in January 2023, while those at consultancy Auxilione think it will hit £5,405. In April, Cornwall expects a £6,616 cap, while Auxilione believe it could reach £7,263. There is then an expectation that the price will fall. Cornwall's forecasts for the July and October 2023 caps are £5,897 and £5,887 respectively, while Auxilione expects it to reach £6,485 and £6,006. What does the new price cap mean for monthly bills? Experts at Uswitch estimate that monthly bills in October, November and December this year will hit between £243 and £513 a month, depending on the size of the home and usage, and based on the October price cap. They say 'low user groups' are usually one or two people living in a one to two-bedroom flat, who are at home in the evenings and weekends and have a weekly laundry cycle. They also use the heating occasionally and don't use a dishwasher or tumble dryer. These people are likely to spend around £243 a month on energy bills from October. Then, 'medium user groups' are typically families of three or four people living in a three-bedroom house. Some members are home in the day as well as in the evening and weekends. The heating is used regularly, and electrical appliances are often turned on. Laundry is done three times a week. Their average energy bill is likely to be £363. Finally, 'high user groups' tend to be large families with five or more living together in a four-bedroom house or larger. There is always someone at home in the day and and in the evenings and on weekends. There could be multiple television in use as well as a tumble dryer and dishwasher which are used regularly. Laundry is done daily. These groups are likely to face a bill of £513 a month from October. What is the cap's purpose? When Theresa May's government introduced the cap in January 2019, the aim was to protect households against profiteering energy giants. It would also, in theory, protect customers against sudden increases in bills. More recently, Ofgem has allowed the cap to rise in a way that protects energy firms from going bust amid the soaring cost of wholesale gas and therefore electricity. The effect is that bills are rising more sharply, and more often, to ensure suppliers can cover the spike in the wholesale prices of gas and electricity, which are around ten times higher than normal. Who is affected by the price cap? The new cap will come into effect for around 24million households in England, Scotland and Wales on default energy tariffs on October 1, and will remain in place until December 31, when it will be adjusted again. A few million people are on long-term fixed rates - which are not affected by the cap. However, many of these deals are expiring in the next few months. What is the cheapest way of paying for energy? Paying by direct debit tends to be the cheapest way of paying for electricity and gas, because energy companies normally provide a discount for those using this method as it reduces their costs and administration time. What about those on pre-payment meters? The 4.5million pre-payment meter customers, who are often the most vulnerable and already in fuel poverty, will see an even more punishing increase, with their average annual bill set to go up to £3,608. What support is available for you? It depends on your personal situation. All households have been promised a £400 discount on their energy bills. This support was announced in May, and will be paid in six monthly payments from October. For direct debit customers this will be taken off their payments, while prepayment meter customers will be given discount vouchers from the first week of every month. These will be issued by text, email or by post. Eight million of the most vulnerable households will also get extra support, taking the total they can get to £1,200. These include a £650 one-off payment to households on means-tested benefits, a £300 payment to pensioners, and £150 for six million people who receive disability benefits. Will the Government announce more support? Charities, think tanks, opposition parties and potential future prime ministers have said the Government will need to do more for struggling households. But extra support will have to wait until the next prime minister is in place. Consumer watchdog Which? has said the Government's financial support for all households must increase from the current £400 to £1,000 - or from £67 to £167 per month from October to March. However, no immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 after the Tory leadership contest. The current Government has said that it is exploring the options and will present them to the new prime minister when he or she comes into office next month. Miss Truss pledged 'immediate support' to help with soaring bills if she becomes prime minister, saying she would use an emergency budget next month to 'ensure support is on its way to get through these tough times'. Miss Truss and her rival Mr Sunak have also both pledged to continue a £15billion support package unveiled in June. The charity National Energy Action said the number of UK households in fuel poverty will have doubled in a year when the October cap rise takes effect. It calculates that 8.9million homes will be in fuel poverty from October - up from 4.5 million last October – and also takes into account the Government's support package revealed in May. Meanwhile, Mr Lewis has said the rise in the price cap means some people will pay up to £10,000 a year in bills. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain the situation is a 'genuine social and financial catastrophe that is putting lives at risk'. He went on: 'I'm noticing many media organisations saying that the price cap is £3,549 a year - that isn't correct. The price cap is actually a cap on the standing charges and unit rates that you pay, they have gone up by around 80 per cent. 'The figure that's quoted, the £3,549, is what the cap would be for someone who has typical usage - of course, most people don't have typical usage, they're more or less. 'That means there is no maximum amount that you can pay for gas or electricity. 'You could easily be paying £5,000 or £10,000 a year if you have high usage. 'I worry terribly for some of those who have disabled children or disabilities themselves who need lots of electrical equipment to keep their houses warm because of medical conditions.' He also said energy prices will be 'unaffordable' this winter. Mr Lewis said: 'The prediction now in January is up another 51 per cent on top of where we are now and that would take a typical bill and direct debit to £5,386 a year. 'And that is not such a crystal ball prediction because we are seven months through the 10-month assessment period for the January price cap. 'So if we look at the totality across the winter, from October until March, you are probably talking on typical use an average bill of over £4,400 a year, typical pro rata - it is totally unaffordable.' He also said a movement to refuse to pay energy bills is 'growing', as he called on the next Prime Minister to spend billions to solve the crisis. Mr Lewis told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I think the Don't Pay movement is growing. There are dangers to being in the Don't Pay movement as an individual. 'All I can say is what would happen in a typical case scenario where an individual refused to pay - what is far more difficult to predict is if there is a massive movement not to pay. 'I think what is safest for me to say is while I think it should have come earlier, my hope is on September 5 there will be a new Prime Minister. We've heard from both the candidates, but they seem to indicate they understand the scale of the crisis - what we need to hear is concrete solutions. 'And let's be absolutely plain: there are many methods that you can put in place to alleviate and mitigate some of the terrible damage that the rising energy prices are causing. 'So I'm going to be agnostic over the solution, but it will involve spending substantial amounts, billions of pounds of Government money, to stop some of the most vulnerable and many middle income earners from having some terrible choices to make this winter. We have to hope that will be in place. 'And I suspect if it isn't in place, then people coming from the Don't Pay movement are going to become a louder voice in this country.' Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Government will announce 'extra cash' in September to support households during the energy crisis. Speaking on a visit to South West London Elective Orthopaedic Centre in Surrey, he said: 'Of course, we could see this coming (energy bills rising) and that's why we've put the steps in place that we already have. 'And don't forget that, although there will be more announcements next month, more cash coming from September onwards, you shouldn't forget that the pipeline of cash stretches out throughout the autumn. 'So, there's going to be another £650 coming for every one of the eight million most vulnerable households in October. 'In November, another £300 to help every pensioner, £150 extra for everybody who is entitled to disability benefits. On top of what we're doing with Universal Credit and the living wage, lifting both of those up.' He added: 'There's a pipeline of cash coming through over the next few months and through the autumn and the winter. But that is clearly now going to be augmented, increased, by extra cash that the Government is plainly going to be announcing in September.' Mr Johnson also said he does not think the Government should 'cap the whole thing' for 'the richest households in the country'. He said: 'We want to target the households so most of the money will go to the eight million most-vulnerable households, that's the right thing to do. A lot of money will be going to absolutely everybody. 'What don't think we should be doing is trying to cap the whole thing for absolutely everybody, the richest households in the country. This will go on for a few months and it will go on over the winter. 'And it will be tough - and I'd be very clear about that - but in the end, we are also putting in the measures we need to ensure that we have the energy independence to get through this. 'And we are putting in more nuclear, and we are putting in more wind power. We have already seen a 26 per cent increase in British gas now from the North Sea.' And Mr Johnson said that eventually energy bills will come down as Vladimir Putin's ability to 'exercise leverage over us and the rest of the world will diminish'. The Prime Minister told broadcasters: 'I think that we will do everything we can to help. 'We want to make sure that we get people through the next few months, and we can, and we will because we took the right steps. We have a big, big package of help and support. 'But the message I want to get over to people is that I'm afraid that there's a global spike in energy costs driven by Putin's aggression in Ukraine. 'Putin's position, Putin's ability to blackmail, to exercise leverage over us and over the rest of the world will diminish week by week, month by month, and we will get through this and in the end, we will be in a much better position. 'The other side will have more of our own UK energy to rely on, and the bills will eventually come down. But Sir Keir Starmer has said it is 'absolutely unforgivable' that the Government is 'missing in action' during the cost-of-living crisis. The Labour Party leader asked Mr Johnson 'where are you?'. He told reporters: 'I do think the Government has to take responsibility in a situation like this. 'But on the cost of living crisis you've got a Prime Minister who insisted on staying in office, recognises there's a problem with energy prices, shrugs his shoulders and does nothing about it. 'You've got two leadership candidates who are fighting with each other about how appalling they have been in government, but neither has come up with any plan to deal with this problem. Unforgivable.' Sir Keir added: 'My challenge for the Government is where are you? Join us in this challenge and do something about it because at the moment being missing in action is absolutely unforgivable.' Sir Keir has also not ruled out Labour's £30 billion plan to tackle the cost of living needing to be adjusted to a higher amount. The Labour Party leader was asked if his plan to freeze energy prices, unveiled last week, could more than triple in cost to £100billion if utility bills keep soaring into next spring. He said: 'What we've got is a fully costed, comprehensive plan for this winter which will freeze those prices - that is welcome news to so many people who are worried sick today.' But Sir Keir added: 'I accept that in April, May next year we need to look forward then to the proposals in place. 'That's why I've said, alongside our plan, we need medium and long-term solutions. We need to be much more self-sufficient when it comes to energy.' Sir Keir reiterated his call, made a year ago, for a 'national mission to insulate homes'. Miss Truss, the frontrunner in the Tory leadership contest, has insisted that she will 'ensure people get the support needed' in the coming months after the rise. A Truss campaign spokesman said: 'Today's announcement will cause grave concern to many people across the UK who will be worried about paying their bills. 'As Prime Minister, Liz would ensure people get the support needed to get through these tough times. She will immediately take action to put more money back in people's pockets by cutting taxes and suspending green energy tariffs. 'This is on top of ongoing work such as the Energy Bills Support Scheme, which will see a £400 discount paid to consumers from October, and the £1,200 package of support for the most vulnerable. 'Liz will work flat-out to deliver long term energy affordability and security, unleashing more energy by maximising our North Sea oil and gas production - helping keep bills down in the future.' And former chancellor Mr Sunak called surging energy bills the 'most pressing challenge' facing the UK. 'I've said that consistently, and as chancellor I announced significant support to help people. But the situation has deteriorated and as prime minister, I would go further. 'My priority is to protect the most vulnerable in society, including pensioners, and I want them to have certainty that extra help is coming - that is what I would put in place. The energy price cap could top £7,000 next year, experts warned for the first time, as Ofgem announced the highest cap on record. The energy regulator said that the price cap for the average household would increase by 80 per cent to £3,549 for the three months starting in October. But experts at energy consultancy Auxilione warned that the cap could double even from that record high by April next year, hitting £7,263. The prediction is based on the current cost of buying energy on global markets and also sees bills hitting £5,405 in January. Fellow consultants at Cornwall Insight are a little more optimistic. Their model expects the cap to only reach £5,387 in January and then £6,616 from April. Both consultancies then expect bills to fall by between £700 to £800 in July when compared to the April cap. It is the grimmest forecast yet from the two outfits, whose predictions for October's price cap were close to Ofgem's decision. Auxilione's final forecast was just £27 above what the cap was set at, while Cornwall Insight's prediction was £5 above. The predictions are largely based on what gas prices are doing at the moment, so are subject to a lot of change between now and January, let alone before April. 'While there is still some time until the January and April caps are set, the energy crisis is showing no sign of abating,' said Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight. 'A key focus for the next Prime Minister and for Ofgem must be protecting consumers, and the wider economy from the impact of this rise,' he added. 'There are several avenues that can be explored including a review and expansion of the current support package of at least £400 per household. 'However, all of these are temporary solutions and must be accompanied by a focus on implementing a viable long-term solution.' He said that the purpose of the price cap is being undermined by the unprecedented rises in bills that are hitting households. 'Throughout the energy crisis, the Government and Ofgem have remained committed to the cap, and in its ability to shield consumers from a volatile energy market. 'However, the cap was never meant to be a permanent solution, it was created for a different energy market than the one we face today and has not protected consumers from what will be incredible hardship this winter.' 'Alternative plans, which are doing different things - borrowing tens of billions for permanent, unfunded tax cuts - don't actually do anything to help those most in need, risk making inflation worse and putting our nation's finances at risk as well.' He said his plan was the 'right one' for the country. Mr Sunak also said that protecting people from rising energy bills will be his 'immediate priority' as prime minister. He said that people can judge him on his 'track record' as chancellor, pointing to the package of supports he announced for people to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. 'It was acknowledged as being commensurate with the scale of the challenge, targeted at the people most in need,' Mr Sunak told broadcasters. 'That is my track record in grappling with this issue. I moved quickly as chancellor and this will be my immediate priority as prime minister and I'd like to try and do the same thing and make sure that we protect the most vulnerable as much as we can from this significant increase in bills.' Ofgem's Mr Brearley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he knew the increase in the cap would come as 'devastating' news for struggling households. He called on the Government and the next prime minister to take urgent action. He said: 'I know this will be devastating for many families, when they hear how much their energy bills are going to go up. We have done and looked at everything we can do as a regulator to address this figure. 'There's a number of things we do to make sure that companies treat their vulnerable customers well. There's a number of vulnerability schemes that we run. But the truth is this is beyond the capacity of the regulator and the industry to address. 'So what we are saying today is, look we have 10 days now until we have a new administration, have a new prime minister and a new ministerial team. What I am clear about is the prime minister with his or her ministerial team will need to act urgently and decisively to address this.' Mr Brearley also said the Government would need to add to the support it announced in May when bills were only expected to jump to £2,800. 'The Government support package is delivering help right now, but it's clear the new prime minister will need to act further to tackle the impact of the price rises that are coming in October and next year,' he added. 'We are working with ministers, consumer groups and industry on a set of options for the incoming prime minister that will require urgent action. 'The response will need to match the scale of the crisis we have before us. With the right support in place and with regulator, government, industry and consumers working together, we can find a way through this.' He added: 'The price of energy has reached record levels driven by an aggressive economic act by the Russian state. They have slowly and deliberately turned off the gas supplies to Europe causing harm to our households, businesses and wider economy. Ofgem has no choice but to reflect these cost increases in the price cap.' Mr Brearley also said that the gas price this winter was 15 times more than the cost two years ago. He told BBC Breakfast: 'When I look at what... gas now costs this winter, it is 15 times the normal price that we were expected to pay two years ago. 'Now if that were happening in petrol, it would cost us £400 to £500 just to fill up our car. So because those costs are changing, the price needs to change and that's why the price cap is now changing to £3,549'. When asked why Ofgem was not protecting the consumer by having a lower price cap, he said: 'The reason we don't have a lower price cap is because if the companies cannot recover the amount of money it costs for them to buy the energy, then ultimately, they will be unable to function.' 'They would have been unable to give us the energy that we need. So what the price cap does, and this is really important, it stops those companies charging excess profits over and above the cost of energy. Many households are facing the stark reality of being unable to afford their energy bills this winter. Consumers are currently hearing a lot about options for handling their bills, ranging from asking for help from their supplier to refusing to pay at all. Here we look at the pros and cons of each, and where to turn for advice and help. - The 'Don't Pay' option The 'Don't Pay' group describes itself as 'a grassroots movement demanding a fair price for energy for everyone'. More than 100,000 people have signed up to support a pledge to cancel their direct debits if the Government and energy firms 'refuse to act' by October 1. However, refusing to pay has serious consequences and households are strongly advised against taking this option - no matter how difficult their financial situation might be. If you are on a pre-payment meter, failing to pay will mean your supply being cut off. If you are on a regular or smart meter and you do not reach an agreement with your supplier before cancelling your direct debit, the firm may try to force you to have a pre-payment meter installed. This means you will have to pay for your energy usage upfront and a weekly payment to cover any debts - which can be as high as 90% of energy top-ups and 100% of electricity top-ups. Pre-payment customers also pay more than others. The current energy price cap is £1,971 for households with a standard meter, but £46 higher at £2,017 for those on a pre-payment meter. Failure to reach an agreement with your supplier may also result in them applying for a court warrant so they can visit your home and disconnect your energy supply. This can be done remotely if you have a smart meter, but your energy company must visit you to identify and assess your situation. An Ofgem spokeswoman said: 'We know that people are under huge pressure, but we do not think it's in consumers' best interest to not pay their bills, and most leading charities and consumer groups agree. 'The knock-on effects of not paying bills can be huge for people. They could lose their direct debit discounts or be forced to move to a pre-payment meter. It could also damage their credit rating.' - Moving off direct debits to paying for what you use - or a 'standing order' As households' monthly direct debits soar by hundreds of pounds, many are considering stopping them and paying for the energy they actually use in three-month chunks in the form of a standing order. While this may give a sense of control, anyone paying on receipt of a three-monthly bill for actual usage will pay considerably more than direct debit customers as almost all providers add a discount for direct debit payments. Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy for Citizens Advice, said: 'Paying as you go can give you more control over the amount you pay, but you might pay more for that control. It's unlikely that you would save money by moving to pay-as-you-go, because you can't spread your costs over a year.' - Direct debits remain the best option Despite sickening increases, staying on a direct debit plan remains the most cost-effective option for paying for your energy. However, customers have the right to challenge any increase that goes above the increased price cap - Ofgem is carefully monitoring this and has already warned firms that direct debits must be set correctly and they must 'clearly communicate any changes in a way that helps consumers understand their payments'. - I'm really struggling, where can I turn? You should first contact your supplier and notify them that you want to pay off your debt through a payment plan. They should discuss your options with you and come to an agreement. When coming to an agreement, your supplier should consider what you can afford to pay based on your income, outgoings, and any other debts you have. They will also consider how much energy you are likely to use in the future by looking at your past usage. To ensure your energy bill is accurate, send your supplier readings from your gas and electricity meter. It is very important to resist, if at all possible, being moved on to a pre-payment meter as this is the least cost-effective way of paying for energy. Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: 'We strongly encourage anyone concerned about being able to pay rising energy bills to speak to their supplier as energy firms have a duty to agree a payment plan that households can afford. 'Depending on the supplier, customers can ask for a review of their payments, a reduction in or break from their payments, more time to pay or access to hardship funds.' 'But what it can not do is set a price that is less than the cost of the energy that we buy, and that's why we have to make the change that we are making today.' Mr Brearley added that it was 'devastating news' for many families. He also said that 'there are no easy answers' to the energy crisis. He told Good Morning Britain: 'Genuinely, there are no easy answers, but there are some big decisions that ultimately ministers will need to make.' He added: 'To be honest I never imagined when I took this role that I would have to make an announcement that we made today.' When asked about senior people in the energy industry receiving bonuses, he urged them to 'be thoughtful' about their pay and remuneration. He said: 'For example, the senior Ofgem team has given away any bonuses to charity because we recognise the situation that we are in right now.' The boss of Ofgem also said the regulator has had countless meetings with the current Government, and called on the next prime minister to take decisions to 'match the scale of the problem'. 'This is a major issue for the country next year. This is a major set of decisions that the new government will need to make, that the new prime minister and his or her ministerial team will need to make,' Mr Brearley said on a call with reporters. He added: 'It's not for me to comment on the proposals that are out there for politicians. My point is very simple, it is going to need to be taken urgently and it's going to need to be decisive. 'And it's going to need to match the scale of the problem that we see - which version of that that the Government chooses to pursue really is a matter for them.' The Confederation of British Industry said the scale of Government help needs to be 'urgently reviewed'. 'Government must also step up and deliver a national energy efficiency programme that will help reduce household bills as soon as this winter,' said Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief policy director. And the trade body for energy suppliers in the UK has said the charges its members will be forced to pass onto households will be 'simply unaffordable', after Ofgem hiked the cap. 'This rise, while widely predicted, will be hugely worrying to customers. We know many customers are already struggling with energy bills and other costs and for millions of households, these latest increases will be simply unaffordable,' Energy UK's director of regulation Dan Alchin said. 'The rise is driven by the cost of buying gas on the wholesale market, which has been at record levels for about a year now - with prices this week 10 times what they were before the crisis. 'These costs are out of the control of energy retail suppliers who need to recoup them, otherwise we risk more going out of business in addition to the 30 that have done so since last August - causing huge cost and disruption to customers. 'However bills of this size were unimaginable a few months ago and we cannot expect customers to bear the brunt. 'Retail suppliers will continue to do all they can to offer help and support, especially to their most vulnerable customers, but faced with bill increases of this size and the numbers of customers who will need support, it won't be enough. 'The Government must step in urgently and put in place further support for this winter and with energy costs likely to remain high for the foreseeable future, look at ways to keep bills down next year as well - as we outlined in our letter to the Chancellor last week.' Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of Energy UK, said the new price cap will be 'really scary' for a lot of people and businesses across the country. She told Sky News: 'This is a crisis that has been caused by the international gas market and so we need to tackle that at a systemic level, as well as making sure that people have urgent help right now.' She added: 'We need something that is broad-brush that supports vulnerable people and really tackles what will be a massive cost-of-living crisis, but also something that helps middle income households and the wider economy.' Addressing politicians, she said: 'This is bigger than you think that it is. This is a whole-economy problem. This is urgent and we need to do more than you think that you need to do, and you need to do it now.' Mr Zahawi said Ministers were working to develop more options to support households amid the price cap rise. 'I know the energy price cap announcement this morning will cause stress and anxiety for many people, but help is coming with £400 off energy bills for all, the second instalment of a £650 payment for vulnerable households, and £300 for all pensioners,' he said. 'While Putin is driving up energy prices in revenge for our support of Ukraine's brave struggle for freedom, I am working flat out to develop options for further support. 'This will mean the incoming prime minister can hit the ground running and deliver support to those who need it most, as soon as possible.' He also said the Government knows it has 'got to do more' to support households through the energy crisis. The Chancellor also indicated that the crisis would not be temporary, suggesting that it could last well into next year. Millions of hard-up families could save hundreds of pounds on their energy bills this winter in a few simple steps without making their homes any colder, experts have said. Record-breaking energy prices are likely to affect many over the next few months as Ofgem hiked its energy price cap today. Experts warn that worse is to come when the cap is updated in January. But two small changes to the way your boiler works could save up to 18 per cent, or around £324, according to experts at the Heating Hub, which provides advice on energy efficiency. - Turning down your flow temperature The flow temperature on a boiler regulates how hot the water is when it leaves the boiler to go to your radiators. Most condensing combi boilers in the UK are still set to their factory setting, which tends to be around 80C, but at this temperature boilers cannot operate at their most efficient. When a condensing boiler burns gas, a lot of the heat can escape out of the flue and out on to the street - this heat literally disappears into thin air. Steam coming out of a flue is a sign that flow temperature is high and heat is escaping. At lower temperatures the boiler works to recycle a lot of this heat back into the water it is trying to warm up. Jo Alsop of the Heating Hub said that by turning down the flow temperature, households could save around 6% to 8% of their annual gas usage. 'It's worth making the point that condensing boilers, even though they're A-rated on the box (for efficiency), they don't necessarily achieve A-rating in the home,' she said. Some A-rated boilers have been found to operate at E-rated efficiency levels in the home, at just 75 per cent. Turning down the flow temperature is not the same as turning down the thermostat. The boiler and radiators will still work to keep rooms at the same temperature as before, but it might take a little longer for the house to heat up. Ms Alsop said families should experiment with lowering the flow temperature. The colder it is, the more efficient the boiler will run. 'We would advise to do that to around 60C and if they find that's a bit too cool on a very cold day, they can always notch it back up, but importantly reduce it down again when the weather gets a bit warmer, and keep reducing it down,' she said. How to do this depends on the boiler, but it is a fairly simple process. It should say how in the boiler manual, which can often be found online. The Heating Hub also has a guide on its website on how to change the flow temperature. It is important to remember only to do this if you have a condensing combi boiler which is not connected to a hot water cylinder. Also be careful about keeping rooms cold if you have vulnerable people in the home. Several energy suppliers are also keen for households to turn down flow temperatures. Rebecca Dibb-Simkin, chief product officer at Octopus Energy, said: 'Safely turning down the water flow temperature of your gas boiler is a little-known but very effective tip for saving gas whilst staying warm, and could save people up to 8% off their gas bills. 'Over 100,000 of our customers who took part in our energy efficiency scheme last winter told us they tried it, with some of them knocking nearly £100 off their bills.' - Turning off your boiler's pre-heat function The pre-heat function on a boiler is designed to ensure that hot water is ready to flow to the taps at a moment's notice. It means the boiler always keeps a small amount of water hot. It is a handy function when you want to wash your hands and do not want to wait for water to heat up, but the boiler is heating up water when you do not need it. 'If the boiler is not on and heating the home, it will fire anyway, just to keep that water at temperature, even if someone is not home during the day, and certainly it will fire all through the night, even when hot water is not in demand,' Ms Alsop said. That means burning gas through the night, every night, for nothing. Turning off the pre-heat function might mean a longer wait for the shower to get warm in the morning, but it is a small inconvenience for the hundreds of pounds that can be saved. Ms Alsop estimates households could save around 5 per cent to 10 per cent of their gas use. Guides on how to turn off the pre-heat function should be in the boiler manual or online. However Ms Alsop said people should consider turning the pre-heat on during droughts if they have to wait an exceptionally long time for hot water to reach the taps. They can still turn it off during the day and night. He said that help from the Government is coming but admitted: 'We know that's not enough. We've got to do more.' 'We need to make sure that this isn't a sticking plaster, that for the long term we continue to help the most vulnerable who have no cushion. And that's what I'm determined to do. 'And we're working up those options for both households and for business for the incoming prime minister on the 5th of September to take those decisions. 'So my message today is we'll get this £37 billion to people to help them for now, and then more will be coming because we know this will continue in January and of course on to April and next year and we have to remain resilient.' He also said that his aim is to make sure vulnerable UK households are 'resilient through next year'. The Chancellor declined to give specifics about what a package of funding might look like, but insisted that the Treasury was working on proposals to present to the next Prime Minister. Mr Zahawi is not expected to retain his portfolio if frontrunner Miss Truss wins the contest to replace Boris Johnson. 'We know we need to do more because actually the most vulnerable households have no cushion, have nothing available to them,' he told broadcasters. 'So what I'm looking at is how I can target that help for those people, not just to January, but we need to make sure that we're resilient through next year. 'More help is on its way because we know that the most vulnerable households need that additional help. And I'm doing the work to make sure that that will be in place throughout next year.' In addition, the Chancellor denied that there was a lack of action from Government amid the Tory leadership contest. It was put to him by broadcasters that it was 'intolerable' to 'leave people in the dark' at the moment. Mr Zahawi said: 'That sounds like we're not acting on this.' Setting out the work of his team over the last month, he said: 'We know (Vladimir) Putin has now worked out that actually this is quite a potent lever. You look at what's happening in Germany and the rest of Europe. 'We need to make sure there's more support. My preference is for it to be targeted. 'Why? Because it will give us a much longer, more leeway, to be able to face down Putin and send a very important message to him that this is not going to work.' And the Chancellor suggested that the public does now need to look at how they use energy. Speaking to broadcasters, Mr Zahawi was asked if people should start reducing their energy use. He said: 'The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption. It is a difficult time. There is war on our continent. 'Very few people anticipated war. Wars happen in far-flung places. It is now here with us. We have to remain resilient. My responsibility is to deliver that help.' On Wednesday, Mr Zahawi insisted 'nothing is off the table' when it comes energy bills, but added that a freeze in the price cap would not deliver 'targeted help' for those who need it most. Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves tweeted today: 'This is incredibly worrying and will strike fear in the heart of many families. We cannot wait any longer to act. 'This is a national emergency. The Tories must freeze energy bills now so households don't pay a penny more in winter.' She also said in a statement that the Government must choose between letting families suffer, or stop the oncoming rise. 'Today's announcement will strike fear in the heart of many families, and force many to make unthinkable choices this winter. The Tories now face an urgent choice. 'They can carry on letting oil and gas companies make huge profits whilst every family suffers with bills rising this winter. Or they can act now and stop the energy price cap rising, by bringing in a windfall tax on those oil and gas profits. 'People deserve a government that can meet the scale of this national emergency - not this spectacle of a Tory leadership race or a Prime Minister that put his out of office on months ago. 'Labour is on your side, and our fully-funded plan to freeze the price cap will make sure households don't pay a penny more this winter, saving you £1,000. 'Our mission for home grown renewable energy and to insulate 19 million homes will keep bills down for the long term too.' Appearing on BBC Breakfast, Ms Reeves urged the Government to act to protect the public from soaring energy bills. She accused ministers of being nowhere to be seen on the morning of the announcement. The Labour MP said people are 'worried sick' about what is happening and is 'striking fear in the hearts of families right across the country'. She called on the Government to freeze energy fills and follow Labour's own proposals. - First step: switch off and unplug Households should by now have done a complete check of every power outlet, unplugging anything that is not necessary and turning devices off standby mode - and getting into the habit of doing this regularly. Energy Saving Trust calculates that you can save around £55 a year just by remembering to turn your appliances off standby mode. Almost all electrical appliances can be turned off at the plug without upsetting their programming. You may want to think about getting a standby saver or smart plug which allows you to turn all your appliances off standby in one go. Check the instructions for any appliances you're not sure about. Some satellite and digital TV recorders may need to be left plugged in so they can keep track of any programmes you want to record. - Check your boiler A recent report by the Heating and Hot Water Council found that households can save around 6% to 8% on their gas bill just by turning down the heating flow temperature on their condensing combi boiler. Doing this will allow the boiler to run more efficiently and could save around £200 off an average energy bill. Use the controls on the front of your boiler - not your room thermostat - to set the flow temperature for the boiler, which is the temperature your boiler heats the water to before sending it off to your radiators. The way you adjust the flow temperature and the display information available varies a great deal. There is a handy online guide at theheatinghub.co.uk. Another easy saving is to turn off the pre-heat mode on the boiler, which could mean hot water taps taking longer to heat up, but could save hundreds of pounds a year. - Forget about your tumble dryer and use other appliances wisely Tumble dryers are massive energy drains, so on warm days hang clothes outside to dry instead and invest in a drying rack for cooler months. Use your washing machine on a 30C cycle and reduce use by one run a week. Only run your dishwasher when it is full and use eco settings if possible. Avoid overfilling the kettle - only boil the amount you need. - Defrost your fridge and freezer Remember to regularly defrost your fridge and freezer, as the more they ice up the more energy they will use. A full freezer is more economical to run. With a full freezer, the cold air does not need to circulate as much, so less power is needed. If you have lots of free space, half-fill plastic bottles with water and use these to fill gaps. BBC Good Food suggests you fill the freezer with everyday items you are bound to use, such as sliced bread, milk or frozen peas. - Turn off lights Turn lights off when you are not using them or when you leave a room. Replacing all the lights in your home with LED bulbs could help you save even more. - Keep windows closed when temperatures get hot The obvious thing to do when homes warm up is to open all the windows. However all this does is fill the house with hot air. It is best to use blinds and curtains to block direct sunlight during the day and then open the windows at night when temperatures drop, helping you to save energy by reducing the need for power-hungry fans. - Use fans sparingly and wisely Fans, even when used on cooling settings, will send bills soaring. You should not stop using them when necessary, but there are ways of maximising their effect and cutting the time they are switched on. Putting fans at floor level helps to circulate the lower cold air rather than the warmer air that naturally rises in a room. You can also create the ideal combination for energy saving by pairing smart fan usage with closed windows, keeping the fans working during the day and the windows open at night. - Invest in insulation New analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit has found homes rated band F on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) system, a measure of the home's efficiency, are set to have a gas bill £968 higher than a home rated EPC band C, the Government's target for 2035. The average home in the UK is rated band D and these homes will pay £420 more for their gas this winter, compared with band C. Energy Saving Trust also says that for those wishing to future-proof their homes, investing in professional draught-proofing and insulation in preparation for the winter months could lead to a reduction in bills by £405 for a semi-detached home. DIY draught-proofing is much cheaper and anything is better than nothing. Installing solar panels for a similar property could lead to additional annual savings of around £450. A quarter of heat in an uninsulated home is lost through the roof. Most homes have at least some loft insulation but often not enough. Topping up from 120mm to at least 270mm of insulation will help. - And here are some myths... Turning boilers off is not advisable or an effective way to save energy. Instead, thermostats and timers should be used effectively to regulate their operation. Fridges and freezers are designed to be kept on all the time and energy will not be saved by turning them off for short periods because more energy will be used to cool them down again when turned back on. There are also important safety issues that can arise if food partially defrosts before it is prepared for eating. She said: 'The fact that no Government minister is available to come on your programme today is just appalling. They are not here to give assurances they are not here to set out what they are going to do. That is a dereliction of duty.' Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said that rise in the cap is 'nothing short of a catastrophe' for millions of households. 'The only option is for energy prices to be frozen before these rises wreak havoc on our communities. Then we need a proper plan to be put in place to bring bills down next year,' he said. 'As millions suffer the Conservatives do nothing. No policy from the government, no plan from Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak. They have no idea how much pain these energy prices will cause our country. They are simply unfit to govern.' Chairman of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, Darren Jones, also warned 'many businesses will face bankruptcy because there is no price cap on their energy bills'. 'The scale of the challenge will mean that the next chancellor will have to offer business grants and not just temporary tax and business rate cuts,' the Labour MP said. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the energy price cap rise is 'simply unaffordable for millions' and must be cancelled. And Scotland's Energy Secretary Michael Matheson said the increase is 'unsustainable' and warned it would push millions into fuel poverty. Ms Sturgeon said the rise should not be allowed to happen. She tweeted: 'This is simply unaffordable for millions. It cannot be allowed to go ahead. 'This rise must be cancelled, with the UK gov and energy companies then agreeing a package to fund the cost of a freeze over a longer period, coupled with fundamental reform of the energy market.' Mr Matheson told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme households were already struggling with the cap increase in April this year, and that 'increasing it by another 80 per cent is simply unsustainable.' He said: 'It will force quite literally millions of households into fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty and is unsustainable.' In a statement issued after the increase was confirmed today, Mr Matheson called on the UK Government to act. He said: 'Today's price cap announcement and increase imposes a burden that customers simply cannot be expected to carry. 'The only acceptable course of action now is for the UK Government, who have the necessary policy levers and borrowing powers at their disposal, to take immediate steps to cancel the increase for all households.' Mr Matheson added: 'No single government, company or organisation can solve this crisis alone. It requires a collective response commensurate to the situation. 'We will continue to work with our partners, energy companies and stakeholders to do everything we can to help the people of Scotland through this deeply unsettling time. 'We will also continue to press the UK Government to reform the energy market to prevent this situation occurring again in the future.' Mr Matheson said the Scottish Government is treating the situation as a 'public emergency' and has prepared a £1.2 million package to enable the immediate expansion of energy advice services. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton called for energy prices to be frozen. Mr Sarwar said: 'This eye-watering price hike risks plunging millions of people into fuel poverty. This is a national emergency and our governments have a moral duty to act.' Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: 'This energy price rise will be devastating for hundreds of thousands of Scottish families and pensioners already struggling to make ends meet.' ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson, said: 'The size and scale of this issue is truly catastrophic for UK households and that's why only a big solution can tackle it once and for all to shelter people from the worst this winter. 'We have offered the Government a plan, backed by the industry, that can be delivered this year, tailored in line with their priorities and will support the UK economy - with the cap set at £3,549, what billpayers need now is to hear what additional help is coming.' Richard Neudegg, director of regulation at Uswitch.com, said: 'Here is the signal that the summer holidays are over. After seemingly endless predictions, the true magnitude of the October energy price cap is now clear. 'Ofgem has rubber-stamped the letters from suppliers that will now start landing on millions of doorsteps informing customers of exactly how much they'll need to pay for their energy as we go into winter. 'Households will face average monthly charges of £362 based on expected usage - almost three times more than the same period in 2021. 'Even after the £66 monthly discount currently on the table from the Government, families will need to find on average an extra £169 per month compared to last year, when many household budgets are already maxed out. 'The energy crisis we face this winter must never be allowed to happen again. This is a failure of the wholesale market and, until that is resolved, we won't have a long-term solution. 'The Government has made it clear that it will not intervene further until a new Prime Minister is confirmed. As concerning as this is, there does seem to be consensus that more support will be made available, but it remains to be seen if it will be enough. 'Until the Government acts, which we expect will be in the coming weeks, consumers are being held in a cost-of-living limbo.' The next prime minister will most likely be unable to avoid introducing a fresh package of support, a leading think tank has said. Respected think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested on Friday that whoever becomes the next prime minister would be unable to avoid putting together a 'substantial package of support', no matter what is said on the campaign trail. The new rise in the price cap, the IFS said, means the current Government supports will cover only 47 per cent of the rise in bills. It said covering the same proportion of the energy price rise now would cost a further £14 billion. The IFS said it was difficult to assess the impact of Ms Truss's plans to cut green levies. 'Cutting only those levies that still add to bills would be complex as they are linked to various schemes and subsidies and apply to business as well as households, but would save households around £50 on average over the three months from October,' the think tank said. Mr Sunak's plan to cut VAT on household energy bills, the IFS said, would save a typical household £51 between October and December at a cost of £1.4 billion. 'Looking beyond this winter, energy prices also look like they will remain very high well into next year, which will put pressure on the government to provide further support in the coming months,' IFS economist Isaac Delestre said. 'Whoever becomes the next prime minister will most likely be announcing a substantial package of support very soon after taking office.' In Scotland, the £2million Social Housing Fuel Support Fund, administered by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, will open on Monday to provide help to the most vulnerable households. Citizens Advice Scotland also said the increase should not be allowed to happen. The charity's chief executive, Derek Mitchell, said: 'This increase should not go ahead. It is absolutely horrifying for people who are hanging on by a thread financially.' Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: 'Today's Ofgem price hike is like a dagger to the heart of millions of people up and down the country. 'As a result of the decision, parents will be unable to feed their children, the sick and elderly will be condemned to worsening health, disabled people will go without vital medical equipment and households will be forced into poverty for the first time in generations. 'All the solutions lie at the Westminster Government's door, yet it is silent in the face of this looming disaster.' And Andrew Forsey, national director of anti-hunger charity Feeding Britain, said: 'Unless significant additional help is offered by the new prime minister, these eye-watering prices will spring a vicious hunger trap; leaving millions of families unable to afford heating or eating. 'Eighty years after the Beveridge Report set the framework for a welfare state that could eliminate destitution from our shores, the threat of destitution now hangs over us again like the Sword of Damocles.' Meanwhile Sara Ogilvie, policy director at Child Poverty Action Group, said: 'Today's energy cap announcement will terrify many low-income families. Their budgets have been overstretched for months, and soaring prices will make it practically impossible to escape the tightening grip of poverty. 'We know that families with children spend 30 per cent more on energy bills than households without kids - yet Government has completely failed to recognise the extra costs facing households with children. 'The next prime minister will be on a collision course with reality unless they increase support to reflect the scale of need, and uprate benefits in line with inflation.' And a charity which supports the vulnerable said families are facing one of the 'bleakest Christmases' for years. Rossanna Trudgian, head of campaigns and public affairs at Action for Children, said: 'Today's announcement, and warnings of even worse rises to come next year, makes it clear that the country is facing a national emergency. Can my bills be higher than the energy price cap? Will it get worse? How 80% rise will affect YOU - as it's revealed a family of five in a four-bed home face monthly bills of £513 from October The energy price cap, which regulates the amount that 24million UK households pay for gas and electricity, will jump by 80 per cent from October - sending the average household's yearly bill from £1,971 to £3,549. The cap affects those in England, Scotland and Wales on default energy tariffs, and the new level announced by regulator Ofgem this morning will remain in place until December 31, when it will be adjusted again. Research by Uswitch found monthly bills in October, November and December this year will hit around £243 for low usage, £363 for medium usage and £513 for high usage - also depending on the size of the home. Experts at consultancy Auxilione used latest gas prices to predict the cap will rise by another 52 per cent to £5,405 in January 2023, then by a further 34 per cent to £7,263 in April - before falling, to £6,485 in July. So what is the price cap, what will happen to it in future and what help is available for households this winter? What is the energy price cap? The energy price cap decides the maximum cost per unit that energy companies can charge for both gas and electricity. This is then used to calculate a typical annual bill. The price cap was introduced in January 2019 as a way to ensure that households who do not have fixed deals - and who are, in some cases, less financially savvy - are not ripped off by their energy suppliers. Twice a year, energy regulator Ofgem would set the maximum price that households on their supplier's default tariff would have to pay for every unit of gas and electricity they used for the next six months. It allowed for a small profit - capped at 1.9 per cent - that energy suppliers were permitted to take for supplying the service. The frequency of the cap was increased on August 4 from every six to every three months. How is the price cap calculated? The cap is calculated by Ofgem based on the wholesale price of gas and electricity and also includes allowances for tax, charges paid to the energy networks, green levies and social payments. What is happening to the price cap? The price cap is going up significantly. The 80 per cent rise announced today - which comes into force from October 1 - will push the cap to £3,549 per year for the average household. This is the highest it has ever been. Can my bills be higher than the price cap? Experts warn there is no cap on the maximum households pay – but the cap is actually a maximum cost per unit that firms can charge for gas and electricity. The actual cap for each home therefore varies according to use. Ofgem said that from October 1 the equivalent per unit level of the price cap to the nearest pence for a typical customer paying by direct debit will be 52p per kWh for electricity customers and a standing charge of 46p per day. The equivalent per unit level for a typical gas customer is 15p per kWh with a standing charge of 28p per day. Why is the price cap going up? The price cap on energy bills is linked to the wholesale price of gas and electricity, which is itself based on what happens on European markets. The wholesale price of gas has soared by around eightfold in the last year. That rise has been passed onto customers in increments - the price cap was already at a record £1,971 over the summer. Gas prices were already increasing last summer as demand bounced as countries emerged from lockdown but the situation was made much worse when Russia invaded Ukraine and started to restrict gas exports to Europe. Gas prices are also decisive for electricity prices, because gas is so important for the generation of electricity. Over the last year, 42 per cent of the UK's electricity came from burning gas. Ofgem said the increase reflected the continued rise in global wholesale gas prices, which began to surge as the world unlocked from the Covid pandemic, and had been driven still higher to record levels by Russia's actions. When will the price cap change again? The price cap will be changed again in January 2023. It used to be changed twice a year, but changes announced on August 4 mean it will be reviewed every three months. It will change again in April, July and October 2023. What is the price cap likely to be like next year? Experts expect the cap to rise significantly in January 2023 and again in April, and then to fall back again in July and October next year - but the exact levels of the cap remains to be seen. Experts at Cornwall Insight expect the cap to hit £5,387 in January 2023, while those at consultancy Auxilione think it will hit £5,405. In April, Cornwall expects a £6,616 cap, while Auxilione believe it could reach £7,263. There is then an expectation that the price will fall. Cornwall's forecasts for the July and October 2023 caps are £5,897 and £5,887 respectively, while Auxilione expects it to reach £6,485 and £6,006. What does the new price cap mean for monthly bills? Experts at Uswitch estimate that monthly bills in October, November and December this year will hit between £243 and £513 a month, depending on the size of the home and usage, and based on the October price cap. They say 'low user groups' are usually one or two people living in a one to two-bedroom flat, who are at home in the evenings and weekends and have a weekly laundry cycle. They also use the heating occasionally and don't use a dishwasher or tumble dryer. These people are likely to spend around £243 a month on energy bills from October. Then, 'medium user groups' are typically families of three or four people living in a three-bedroom house. Some members are home in the day as well as in the evening and weekends. The heating is used regularly, and electrical appliances are often turned on. Laundry is done three times a week. Their average energy bill is likely to be £363. Finally, 'high user groups' tend to be large families with five or more living together in a four-bedroom house or larger. There is always someone at home in the day and and in the evenings and on weekends. There could be multiple television in use as well as a tumble dryer and dishwasher which are used regularly. Laundry is done daily. These groups are likely to face a bill of £513 a month from October. What is the cap's purpose? When Theresa May's government introduced the cap in January 2019, the aim was to protect households against profiteering energy giants. It would also, in theory, protect customers against sudden increases in bills. More recently, Ofgem has allowed the cap to rise in a way that protects energy firms from going bust amid the soaring cost of wholesale gas and therefore electricity. The effect is that bills are rising more sharply, and more often, to ensure suppliers can cover the spike in the wholesale prices of gas and electricity, which are around ten times higher than normal. Who is affected by the price cap? The new cap will come into effect for around 24million households in England, Scotland and Wales on default energy tariffs on October 1, and will remain in place until December 31, when it will be adjusted again. A few million people are on long-term fixed rates - which are not affected by the cap. However, many of these deals are expiring in the next few months. What is the cheapest way of paying for energy? Paying by direct debit tends to be the cheapest way of paying for electricity and gas, because energy companies normally provide a discount for those using this method as it reduces their costs and administration time. What about those on pre-payment meters? The 4.5million pre-payment meter customers, who are often the most vulnerable and already in fuel poverty, will see an even more punishing increase, with their average annual bill set to go up to £3,608. What support is available for you? It depends on your personal situation. All households have been promised a £400 discount on their energy bills. This support was announced in May, and will be paid in six monthly payments from October. For direct debit customers this will be taken off their payments, while prepayment meter customers will be given discount vouchers from the first week of every month. These will be issued by text, email or by post. Eight million of the most vulnerable households will also get extra support, taking the total they can get to £1,200. These include a £650 one-off payment to households on means-tested benefits, a £300 payment to pensioners, and £150 for six million people who receive disability benefits. Will the Government announce more support? Charities, think tanks, opposition parties and potential future prime ministers have said the Government will need to do more for struggling households. But extra support will have to wait until the next prime minister is in place. Consumer watchdog Which? has said the Government's financial support for all households must increase from the current £400 to £1,000 - or from £67 to £167 per month from October to March. However, no immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 after the Tory leadership contest. The current Government has said that it is exploring the options and will present them to the new prime minister when he or she comes into office next month. - First step: switch off and unplug Households should by now have done a complete check of every power outlet, unplugging anything that is not necessary and turning devices off standby mode - and getting into the habit of doing this regularly.

2022-08-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11150175/Belarusian-dictator-says-planes-carry-NUKES-targets-selected-West-provokes.html,Belarus dictator Lukashenko says his warplanes have been modified to carry NUKES and 'targets have been selected' if the US and the West 'provoke' him,"Belarus's warplanes have been upgraded to carry nuclear weapons, the country's authoritarian leader President Alexander Lukashenko has said, adding it has 'selected targets' in the West if provoked. President Lukashenko, a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, warned the US and its allies against carrying out a 'provocation' against Belarus. He said the modification of the SU-24 planes followed his meeting with Putin in June, when he offered to make Belarusian combat aircraft nuclear-capable at Russian factories and to help train pilots. Belarusian state-run news agency Belta quoted the President as saying: 'They (the West) have to understand that no helicopters or aircraft will save them if they decide to aggravate the situation. 'Putin and I once said in St Petersburg that we will refit Belarusian Sukhoi aircraft among other things so that they could carry nuclear weapons. 'Do you think we talk nonsense? Everything is ready!' Lukashenko added that 'the targets have been locked in' for retaliation, if his warning is not heeded. Lukashenko did not specify how many Belarusian warplanes received the upgrade to make them capable of carrying nuclear warheads, nor did he present any evidence to back up the claim. Belarus reportedly decommissioned its fleet of Sukhoi SU-24 jets a decade ago, with the then Defense Minister saying it had 'outlived its usefulness', and does not have its own nuclear weapons. The Kremlin had no immediate comment on Lukashenko's statement. Russia has used the territory of Belarus as a staging ground to send troops into Ukraine since the invasion began in February, with Moscow and Minsk maintaining close military ties. On Wednesday August 24, the 31st anniversary of Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union, Lukashenko posted a message on his website wishing Ukrainians 'peaceful skies, tolerance, courage, strength and success in restoring a decent life'. The message was blasted by Ukrainians as 'cynical', as missile attacks on the country continue to come from Russian forces in Belarus. In February, Lukashenko said his country could host Russian nuclear weapons if the US and its allies deployed nuclear weapons to Nato members Poland and Lithuania, which border Belarus. At the June meeting between the two leaders in St Petersburg, the Belarusian President expressed concern about the 'aggressive', 'confrontational' and 'repulsive' policies of his country's neighbours. Lukashenko has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for 28 years while relying on Russia's political and economic support. In 2020, Moscow helped him survive the largest and the most sustained wave of mass protests in the country's history, which followed a presidential election that the opposition and the West denounced as rigged."
2022-08-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11149591/Vicar-officiated-Jade-Goodys-wedding-slams-Homes-Ukraine-scheme.html,EXCLUSIVE: Vicar who officiated Jade Goody's wedding slams Homes for Ukraine scheme and accuses family he housed of being 'more economic migrants than genuine refugees',"A celebrity archbishop has complained that the family of refugees he was housing through the Homes for Ukraine scheme were 'economic migrants' instead of 'genuine refugees'. Jonathan Blake, 65, who officiated at Big Brother star Jade Goody's wedding when she was terminally ill, took to social media to suggest some of those fleeing Vladimir Putin's invasion were taking advantage of the programme. Reverend Blake, who is the archbishop of the liberal Open Episcopal Church, said he was contacted by a string of families when he agreed to offer up his home in Welling, Bexley. Mr Blake, who carried out Britain's first gay wedding blessing on live TV, said in a Facebook post he eventually took in a family on May 24, consisting of a mother, father and three children aged five, 11 and 15. He claimed he spent £2,500 decorating his home ahead of their arrival and, once they had arrived, got the family registered with the local GP and the children enrolled in 'excellent schools'. But he said he was then 'surprised to discover that the family had a 'long held intention' to leave Ukraine that pre-dated Russia's invasion. He claimed they had previously been on holiday in Spain and scoped out possible places to live, adding that they 'seemed they were more economic migrants than genuine refugees'. Reverend Blake claimed the parents had told him the war had given them the 'perfect opportunity to fulfil their ambition to leave Ukraine'. The archbishop, who in 2017 was found guilty of breaching a restraining order after posting 'abusive' messages online, added that the family rarely showed 'gratitude' and suddenly vanished when he was helping them look for a property to rent. The Homes for Ukraine Scheme, which was launched in March, brought in around 75,000 fleeing refugees into the UK. Sponsors had to agree to a minimum of six months when signing up to the scheme, but the cost of living crisis has meant that more than a third of Britons are now 'struggling financially' due to the rising costs of bills, fuel and the weekly food shop. Government figures also showed that 145 placements led to the refugee becoming homeless, due to the relationship with their sponsor breaking down or the accommodation being deemed 'unsuitable' before they had even moved in. Councils have now become concerned about the number of hosts who no longer want to continue housing their refugee Mr Blake said in his 2,000-word post: 'When Russia began the war against Ukraine, we were quick to offer help to the fleeing Ukrainians, registering with national refugee agencies and on international web sites our willingness to offer refuge.' 'We were contacted by many people. Trying to assess their situation and whether we could and should help was complex.' The archbishop gave four examples of families who contacted him. Among them was a Ukrainian woman who he claimed wanted him to 'house her elderly and infirm mother and carer.' But he said that on further questioning he discovered she 'lived in America and could herself have housed her mother, but was looking for someone else to take on the responsibility.' He said his family were then contacted by two Ukrainian women who asked if they could house them and their four children on a 'short term basis'. But added that on 'on further questioning we discovered they were already safely in England' via the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Writing of the family that did eventually arrive, on May 24, he said: 'We spent £2,500 preparing the house for their arrival, decorating, beds and bedding, play equipment and garden equipment. 'Within four weeks we had the family registered with the local G.P. and dentist, equipped with bank accounts and U.K. mobile phone numbers, enrolled on English language courses, interviewed for Universal Credit, processed with their biometrics, and each of the children accepted into local excellent schools and equipped with uniforms.' He said his home was turned into a 'magical environment' for the family, with the children making use of a swimming pool. But Mr Blake then claimed: 'We were surprised though, in the first weeks to discover, that it had been their long held intention to leave Ukraine and seek a better life in Europe. 'They had already begun to prepare, holidaying in Spain, beginning to learn the language, looking at possible locations and opportunities. It seemed they were more economic migrants than genuine refugees. 'Their families and friends remained in Ukraine. This was of particular irritation to their older children. 'Allegedly, they had not been consulted about the decision to leave Ukraine, and had been fed a story about visiting their grandparents, only to find themselves being taken across the border. 'They were angry at the parents forcing them to leave their lives behind, their schools and their friends. 'We were told that the war and the chances to gain access to European countries had given the parents the perfect opportunity to fulfil their ambition. 'They had immediately left for Slovakia and managed to acquire a property, rent free. 'Then they researched the generous Homes for Ukrainians scheme that the U.K. was offering and realised this offered them a unique way to integrate into the U.K. 'Another strange feature that emerged over the weeks, was that whatever we provided, whatever we did, however imaginative, caring or thoughtful we were, we rarely, if ever received a ""thank you"". 'Gratitude was not forthcoming. Not that we wanted it for ourselves, but its absence was an unusual indicator.' The archbishop said he still helped the family to prepare to start looking for rental properties for when their six-month stay came to an end. The father had got a job in West London and a 'second income' that allegedly gave them 'a pick of rental properties'. But the churchman claimed that on August 4, he received a call from his council saying they had been told that he had evicted the family and they had been forced to sleep in their car. He wrote: 'I explained that this was false, we had not evicted them would never evict them and were committed to them staying with us for as long as was necessary, until they found their own accommodation. 'I then recalled a comment the father had made to me. That they were working on a plan. When I asked what it was, he wouldn't tell me. 'One of my sons ran up to their rooms and came down astonished - all their items had been taken and their rooms had been left dirty and their bedding unwashed. 'While we had been out, they had packed all their things into the car and headed to the council, to present themselves as homeless, expecting that the Council would provide them with a property. 'We were in shock. They had said nothing to us. They had not said goodbye. They had not said thank you. They had just vacated.' He claimed that when the family were told they would not be housed by the council because they had made themselves 'intentionally homeless', they instead sought somewhere to live in West London. He said this is the last he has heard of them. It comes after Britons who hosted families through the Homes for Ukraine Scheme complained about a breakdown in relations with their guests. British mother Clara Maguire, from Poole, Dorset, who opened her door to two Ukrainians, said she felt 'totally used and underappreciated' and has vowed to 'never again' take part in the scheme. Clara Maguire, 54, from Poole, Dorset, is one of a growing number of Britons who have quit the programme following a breakdown in relations with their displaced guests. Others claimed they have been 'duped' by 'non-vulnerable' Ukrainians, while many have yet to receive a penny of the monthly £350 payments promised by the government - some six months after Vladimir Putin's tanks rolled over the border. However, Ludmila Zosym, 44, a mother from Kiev, has hit out at some of the claims, saying it is the British hosts who cannot understand what her people are going through, as they have never fled from war. A trauma charity agreed as they called for more mental health training for hosts, and better access to services for refugees to avoid placing further strain on the NHS. In 2009, Mr Blake was arrested for child neglect after he put his sons on the roof of his home so they could fulfil a task in a school competition to read a book in an unusual place. Shocked neighbours spotted Nathan, then eight, and then seven-year-old Dominic each calmly reading a book - The Killer Underpants by Michael Lawrence - while perched on the chimney stack. Their father, instead of calling the fire brigade to rescue them, was happily taking photos in an attempt to win their primary school's book week competition. In 2017, Mr Blake was sentenced to 100 hours community service and ordered to pay £1,000 in costs after being found guilty of breaching a restraining order. He had harassed two complainants for several years by bombarding them with abusive messages. Police say he ignored repeated requests to stop contacting them and so they reported the harassment to the police on May 1 2015. Mr Blake was issued with a restraining order from Bromley Magistrates' Court on December 9, 2015, but he breached it. He was first arrested for breaching the order on March 4, 2016, and subsequently charged on June 17, 2016. But Mr Blake, from Welling, Kent, continued to breach the Restraining Order and was arrested again on July 28 2016. He was charged later that day. Mr Blake was found guilty of four counts of breach of restraining order at Woolwich Crown Court, south east London, on Monday, 13 February. Mr Blake broke away from the Church of England in 1994 - when he was serving as a vicar in Kent - to set up the Open Episcopal Church. In 2001 he conducted the first gay marriage on live television on ITV's This Morning show presented by Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan. As well as being the priest at Jade Goody's wedding, he also said prayers at her wake after she passed away."
2022-08-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11149341/Russia-burning-huge-amounts-natural-gas-June-8million-worth-DAY.html,Russia has been burning off huge amounts of natural gas since June - around £8million worth a DAY - as Europe's energy bills rocket,"Finnish citizens recently spotted a large bright jet of fire streaming over on the other side of their border with Russia. The flame was coming from the new liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant at Portovaya, near St Petersberg, sources later claimed. What they saw turned out to be a flare, a combustion device used to burn-off natural gas rather than selling it. Researchers using satellite detectors have noted a significant increase in heat emanating from the facility since June. The plant is burning an estimated £8.4million worth of gas every day, experts said. 'They don't have other places where they can sell their gas, so they have to burn it,' the German ambassador to the UK suggested to BBC News 'Flaring' means the controlled and deliberate destruction of gas by burning. Russia burns the most amount of natural gas in the world, flaring off 24.88 billion cubic metres per year as of 2020 according to World Bank data. Flaring burns off natural gas when it can't be immediately transported and no storage facilities exist. If the gas can't be stored, like in oil facilities across the region, the gas must be flared in order to maintain production levels. Gas plants can be expensive to restart if deactivated for long periods, so operators often find it cheaper to burn existing gas rather than stop production. Without the right equipment to liquefy natural gas and convert it into a liquid, plant organisers sometimes also opt to flare off the fuel. Several chemicals released through flaring, such as benzene, are named by the American Cancer Society as known carcinogens. The plant is near a compressor station where the Nord Stream 1 pipeline begins. Russia and Western powers have been in a dispute over whether to shut down the pipeline, leading some to conclude that Russia is deliberately burning away the gas. Gas prices have soared in Europe after Russia decided to invade Ukraine on February 24, spiking again when Putin cut gas supply to several European countries. 'I've never seen an LNG plant flare so much,' said Dr Jessica McCarty of Miami University. 'Starting around June, we saw this huge peak, and it just didn't go away. It's stayed very anomalously high.' Around 4.34 million cubic metres of gas are being burned by the flare every day, according to Rystad Energy. Flaring is seen as potentially deeply harmful to the environment, but is also alleged to be part of Putin’s plan to freeze the West by limiting gas supplies, so forcing a change of tack over Ukraine. Supplies of gas to Finland have been cut off since May because Helsinki refused Putin’s demand to pay in roubles. Poland and Bulgaria also refused to pay in roubles amid Russian moves to skew the rate of its currency which had collapsed when war broke out. The EU and Britain are seeking to end dependency on Russian gas, which Putin claims will trash economies across the continent. The Western action is in response to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Putin is now seen as having imposed a 'gas famine' on Europe in a bid to force NATO countries to stop supplying arms which have upset his plans to bring Ukraine to heel. Gazprom exports in July plummeted by 58 per cent, with production down one third. Russian sources claimed the flares are not due to the wanton destruction of gas. Reports by the Russian media say the LNG flare is a normal part of the production process and nothing unusual. The Finns say the flare started in June and is not a phenomenon they have spotted before across the border at such intensity. Its timing coincides with the cuts in supplies to Western customers. Britain receives minimal gas from Russia, but recently declared in June that it had gone a month without buying any fuel from Russia for the first time in recent memory. The impact of limits in Putin’s supplies to Europe is felt in the high prices paid by households across the country."
2022-08-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11149259/Nadhim-Zahawi-warns-families-save-energy.html,Now Nadhim Zahawi tells people they will have to start RATIONING their energy use to save money 'because there is a war on' – after 24m Britons are left facing a 80% energy price cap rise in October,"Nadhim Zahawi today advised Britons to start cutting their energy usage because 'there's a war on' - after Ofgem confirmed an 80 per cent rise in the price cap which will send the average household's yearly bill rocketing from £1,971 to £3,549. The move will affect 24million Britons from October 1, while the 4.5million on pre-payment meters - who are often the most vulnerable and already in fuel poverty - could see even higher average bills of £3,608. Asked by broadcasters if it was time for people to look at their energy use, the Chancellor said: 'The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption. It is a difficult time. There is war on our continent. 'Very few people anticipated war. Wars happen in far-flung places. It is now here with us. We have to remain resilient. My responsibility is to deliver that help.' As business groups and think tanks offered stark warnings over the crisis throughout the course of today: Mr Zahawi acknowledged the increase in the price cap would cause 'stress and anxiety' for people, but that the Government was working 'flat out' to develop more options to support households. Britons could die this winter due to surging energy prices, Martin Lewis warned today after Ofgem confirmed an 80 per cent rise in the price cap - sending the average household's yearly bill from £1,971 to £3,549 from October. The cap announcement today will come into effect for around 24million households in England, Scotland and Wales on default energy tariffs on October 1, and will remain in place until December 31, when it will be adjusted again. The 4.5million pre-payment meter customers across Britain, who are often the most vulnerable and already in fuel poverty, will see an even more punishing increase - with their average annual bill set to go up to £3,608. And things could get even worse next year, with experts at consultancy Auxilione using latest gas prices to predict that the cap will rise by another 52 per cent to £5,405 in January 2023, then by a further 34 per cent to £7,263 in April - before falling slightly, by 11 per cent to £6,485 in July and by another 7 per cent to £6,006 in October. MoneySavingExpert founder Mr Lewis, who became emotional at times while giving passionate interviews to TV and radio shows this morning, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I've been accused of catastrophising over this situation. Well, the reason I have catastrophised is this is a catastrophe, plain and simple. If we do not get further government intervention on top of what was announced in May, lives will be lost this winter.' The consumer champion also said the latest rise in the cap means some people will pay up to £10,000 a year in bills. And he warned that there is no cap on the maximum you pay – but the cap is actually a maximum cost per unit that firms can charge for gas and electricity. Currently, this equates to £1,971 a year for the average home. Ofgem said that from October 1 the equivalent per unit level of the price cap to the nearest pence for a typical customer paying by direct debit will be 52p per kWh for electricity customers and a standing charge of 46p per day. The equivalent per unit level for a typical gas customer is 15p per kWh with a standing charge of 28p per day. 'While Putin is driving up energy prices in revenge for our support of Ukraine's brave struggle for freedom, I am working flat out to develop options for further support,' he said. 'This will mean the incoming prime minister can hit the ground running and deliver support to those who need it most, as soon as possible.' Today MoneySavingExpert founder Martin Lewis warned people could die this winter because they could not afford to pay for their energy. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I've been accused of catastrophising over this situation. 'Well, the reason I have catastrophised is this is a catastrophe, plain and simple. 'If we do not get further government intervention on top of what was announced in May, lives will be lost this winter.'

The equivalent per unit level for a typical gas customer is 15p per kWh with a standing charge of 28p per day. Ofgem's chief executive Jonathan Brearley warned of the hardship energy prices will cause this winter and urged the incoming prime minister and new Cabinet 'to provide an additional and urgent response to continued surging energy prices'. He also said that the gas price this winter was 15 times more than the cost two years ago. The regulator said the increase reflected the continued rise in global wholesale gas prices, which began to surge as the pandemic eased, and had been driven still higher by Russia slowly switching off gas supplies to Europe. Ofgem also warned that energy prices could get 'significantly worse' next year. The regulator said that some suppliers might start increasing the amount that direct debit customers pay before October 1, to spread out payments, but any money taken by suppliers will only ever be spent on supplying energy to households. Philippe Commaret, the managing director of energy giant EDF, has warned that half of UK households could be in fuel poverty in January as a result of rocketing prices. And the Trades Union Congress has said energy bills will rise 35 times faster than wages and 57 times faster than benefits in the last three months of this year. Which? has urged the Government to raise its energy bills discount by at least 150 per cent or risk pushing millions of people into financial distress. The consumer watchdog said Ministers' financial support for all households must increase from the current £400 to £1,000 - or from £67 to £167 per month from October to March. However, no immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 after the Tory leadership contest. What is the energy price cap? The energy price cap decides the maximum cost per unit that energy companies can charge for both gas and electricity. This is then used to calculate a typical annual bill. The price cap was introduced in January 2019 as a way to ensure that households who do not have fixed deals - and who are, in some cases, less financially savvy - are not ripped off by their energy suppliers. Twice a year, energy regulator Ofgem would set the maximum price that households on their supplier's default tariff would have to pay for every unit of gas and electricity they used for the next six months. It allowed for a small profit - capped at 1.9 per cent - that energy suppliers were permitted to take for supplying the service. The frequency of the cap was increased on August 4 from every six to every three months. How is the price cap calculated? The cap is calculated by Ofgem based on the wholesale price of gas and electricity and also includes allowances for tax, charges paid to the energy networks, green levies and social payments. What is happening to the price cap? The price cap is going up significantly. The 80 per cent rise announced today - which comes into force from October 1 - will push the cap to £3,549 per year for the average household. This is the highest it has ever been. Can my bills be higher than the price cap? Experts warn there is no cap on the maximum households pay – but the cap is actually a maximum cost per unit that firms can charge for gas and electricity. The actual cap for each home therefore varies according to use. Ofgem said that from October 1 the equivalent per unit level of the price cap to the nearest pence for a typical customer paying by direct debit will be 52p per kWh for electricity customers and a standing charge of 46p per day. The equivalent per unit level for a typical gas customer is 15p per kWh with a standing charge of 28p per day. Why is the price cap going up? The price cap on energy bills is linked to the wholesale price of gas and electricity, which is itself based on what happens on European markets. The wholesale price of gas has soared by around eightfold in the last year. That rise has been passed onto customers in increments - the price cap was already at a record £1,971 over the summer. Gas prices were already increasing last summer as demand bounced as countries emerged from lockdown but the situation was made much worse when Russia invaded Ukraine and started to restrict gas exports to Europe. Gas prices are also decisive for electricity prices, because gas is so important for the generation of electricity. Over the last year, 42 per cent of the UK's electricity came from burning gas. Ofgem said the increase reflected the continued rise in global wholesale gas prices, which began to surge as the world unlocked from the Covid pandemic, and had been driven still higher to record levels by Russia's actions. When will the price cap change again? The price cap will be changed again in January 2023. It used to be changed twice a year, but changes announced on August 4 mean it will be reviewed every three months. It will change again in April, July and October 2023. What is the price cap likely to be like next year? Experts expect the cap to rise significantly in January 2023 and again in April, and then to fall back again in July and October next year - but the exact levels of the cap remains to be seen. Experts at Cornwall Insight expect the cap to hit £5,387 in January 2023, while those at consultancy Auxilione think it will hit £5,405. In April, Cornwall expects a £6,616 cap, while Auxilione believe it could reach £7,263. There is then an expectation that the price will fall. Cornwall's forecasts for the July and October 2023 caps are £5,897 and £5,887 respectively, while Auxilione expects it to reach £6,485 and £6,006. What does the new price cap mean for monthly bills? Experts at Uswitch estimate that monthly bills in October, November and December this year will hit between £243 and £513 a month, depending on the size of the home and usage, and based on the October price cap. They say 'low user groups' are usually one or two people living in a one to two-bedroom flat, who are at home in the evenings and weekends and have a weekly laundry cycle. They also use the heating occasionally and don't use a dishwasher or tumble dryer. These people are likely to spend around £243 a month on energy bills from October. Then, 'medium user groups' are typically families of three or four people living in a three-bedroom house. Some members are home in the day as well as in the evening and weekends. The heating is used regularly, and electrical appliances are often turned on. Laundry is done three times a week. Their average energy bill is likely to be £363. Finally, 'high user groups' tend to be large families with five or more living together in a four-bedroom house or larger. There is always someone at home in the day and and in the evenings and on weekends. There could be multiple television in use as well as a tumble dryer and dishwasher which are used regularly. Laundry is done daily. These groups are likely to face a bill of £513 a month from October. What is the cap's purpose? When Theresa May's government introduced the cap in January 2019, the aim was to protect households against profiteering energy giants. It would also, in theory, protect customers against sudden increases in bills. More recently, Ofgem has allowed the cap to rise in a way that protects energy firms from going bust amid the soaring cost of wholesale gas and therefore electricity. The effect is that bills are rising more sharply, and more often, to ensure suppliers can cover the spike in the wholesale prices of gas and electricity, which are around ten times higher than normal. Who is affected by the price cap? The new cap will come into effect for around 24million households in England, Scotland and Wales on default energy tariffs on October 1, and will remain in place until December 31, when it will be adjusted again. A few million people are on long-term fixed rates - which are not affected by the cap. However, many of these deals are expiring in the next few months. What is the cheapest way of paying for energy? Paying by direct debit tends to be the cheapest way of paying for electricity and gas, because energy companies normally provide a discount for those using this method as it reduces their costs and administration time. What about those on pre-payment meters? The 4.5million pre-payment meter customers, who are often the most vulnerable and already in fuel poverty, will see an even more punishing increase, with their average annual bill set to go up to £3,608. What support is available for you? It depends on your personal situation. All households have been promised a £400 discount on their energy bills. This support was announced in May, and will be paid in six monthly payments from October. For direct debit customers this will be taken off their payments, while prepayment meter customers will be given discount vouchers from the first week of every month. These will be issued by text, email or by post. Eight million of the most vulnerable households will also get extra support, taking the total they can get to £1,200. These include a £650 one-off payment to households on means-tested benefits, a £300 payment to pensioners, and £150 for six million people who receive disability benefits. Will the Government announce more support? Charities, think tanks, opposition parties and potential future prime ministers have said the Government will need to do more for struggling households. But extra support will have to wait until the next prime minister is in place. Consumer watchdog Which? has said the Government's financial support for all households must increase from the current £400 to £1,000 - or from £67 to £167 per month from October to March. However, no immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 after the Tory leadership contest. The current Government has said that it is exploring the options and will present them to the new prime minister when he or she comes into office next month. Miss Truss pledged 'immediate support' to help with soaring bills if she becomes prime minister, saying she would use an emergency budget next month to 'ensure support is on its way to get through these tough times'. Miss Truss and her rival Mr Sunak have also both pledged to continue a £15billion support package unveiled in June. The charity National Energy Action said the number of UK households in fuel poverty will have doubled in a year when the October cap rise takes effect. It calculates that 8.9million homes will be in fuel poverty from October - up from 4.5 million last October – and also takes into account the Government's support package revealed in May. Meanwhile, Mr Lewis has said the rise in the price cap means some people will pay up to £10,000 a year in bills. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain the situation is a 'genuine social and financial catastrophe that is putting lives at risk'. He went on: 'I'm noticing many media organisations saying that the price cap is £3,549 a year - that isn't correct. The price cap is actually a cap on the standing charges and unit rates that you pay, they have gone up by around 80 per cent. 'The figure that's quoted, the £3,549, is what the cap would be for someone who has typical usage - of course, most people don't have typical usage, they're more or less. 'That means there is no maximum amount that you can pay for gas or electricity. 'You could easily be paying £5,000 or £10,000 a year if you have high usage. 'I worry terribly for some of those who have disabled children or disabilities themselves who need lots of electrical equipment to keep their houses warm because of medical conditions.' He also said energy prices will be 'unaffordable' this winter. Mr Lewis said: 'The prediction now in January is up another 51 per cent on top of where we are now and that would take a typical bill and direct debit to £5,386 a year. 'And that is not such a crystal ball prediction because we are seven months through the 10-month assessment period for the January price cap. 'So if we look at the totality across the winter, from October until March, you are probably talking on typical use an average bill of over £4,400 a year, typical pro rata - it is totally unaffordable.' He also said a movement to refuse to pay energy bills is 'growing', as he called on the next Prime Minister to spend billions to solve the crisis. Mr Lewis told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I think the Don't Pay movement is growing. There are dangers to being in the Don't Pay movement as an individual. 'All I can say is what would happen in a typical case scenario where an individual refused to pay - what is far more difficult to predict is if there is a massive movement not to pay. 'I think what is safest for me to say is while I think it should have come earlier, my hope is on September 5 there will be a new Prime Minister. We've heard from both the candidates, but they seem to indicate they understand the scale of the crisis - what we need to hear is concrete solutions. 'And let's be absolutely plain: there are many methods that you can put in place to alleviate and mitigate some of the terrible damage that the rising energy prices are causing. 'So I'm going to be agnostic over the solution, but it will involve spending substantial amounts, billions of pounds of Government money, to stop some of the most vulnerable and many middle income earners from having some terrible choices to make this winter. We have to hope that will be in place. 'And I suspect if it isn't in place, then people coming from the Don't Pay movement are going to become a louder voice in this country.' Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Government will announce 'extra cash' in September to support households during the energy crisis. Speaking on a visit to South West London Elective Orthopaedic Centre in Surrey, he said: 'Of course, we could see this coming (energy bills rising) and that's why we've put the steps in place that we already have. 'And don't forget that, although there will be more announcements next month, more cash coming from September onwards, you shouldn't forget that the pipeline of cash stretches out throughout the autumn. 'So, there's going to be another £650 coming for every one of the eight million most vulnerable households in October. 'In November, another £300 to help every pensioner, £150 extra for everybody who is entitled to disability benefits. On top of what we're doing with Universal Credit and the living wage, lifting both of those up.' He added: 'There's a pipeline of cash coming through over the next few months and through the autumn and the winter. But that is clearly now going to be augmented, increased, by extra cash that the Government is plainly going to be announcing in September.' Mr Johnson also said he does not think the Government should 'cap the whole thing' for 'the richest households in the country'. He said: 'We want to target the households so most of the money will go to the eight million most-vulnerable households, that's the right thing to do. A lot of money will be going to absolutely everybody. 'What don't think we should be doing is trying to cap the whole thing for absolutely everybody, the richest households in the country. This will go on for a few months and it will go on over the winter. 'And it will be tough - and I'd be very clear about that - but in the end, we are also putting in the measures we need to ensure that we have the energy independence to get through this. 'And we are putting in more nuclear, and we are putting in more wind power. We have already seen a 26 per cent increase in British gas now from the North Sea.' And Mr Johnson said that eventually energy bills will come down as Vladimir Putin's ability to 'exercise leverage over us and the rest of the world will diminish'. The Prime Minister told broadcasters: 'I think that we will do everything we can to help. 'We want to make sure that we get people through the next few months, and we can, and we will because we took the right steps. We have a big, big package of help and support. 'But the message I want to get over to people is that I'm afraid that there's a global spike in energy costs driven by Putin's aggression in Ukraine. 'Putin's position, Putin's ability to blackmail, to exercise leverage over us and over the rest of the world will diminish week by week, month by month, and we will get through this and in the end, we will be in a much better position. 'The other side will have more of our own UK energy to rely on, and the bills will eventually come down. But Sir Keir Starmer has said it is 'absolutely unforgivable' that the Government is 'missing in action' during the cost-of-living crisis. The Labour Party leader asked Mr Johnson 'where are you?'. He told reporters: 'I do think the Government has to take responsibility in a situation like this. 'But on the cost of living crisis you've got a Prime Minister who insisted on staying in office, recognises there's a problem with energy prices, shrugs his shoulders and does nothing about it. 'You've got two leadership candidates who are fighting with each other about how appalling they have been in government, but neither has come up with any plan to deal with this problem. Unforgivable.' Sir Keir added: 'My challenge for the Government is where are you? Join us in this challenge and do something about it because at the moment being missing in action is absolutely unforgivable.' Sir Keir has also not ruled out Labour's £30 billion plan to tackle the cost of living needing to be adjusted to a higher amount. The Labour Party leader was asked if his plan to freeze energy prices, unveiled last week, could more than triple in cost to £100billion if utility bills keep soaring into next spring. He said: 'What we've got is a fully costed, comprehensive plan for this winter which will freeze those prices - that is welcome news to so many people who are worried sick today.' But Sir Keir added: 'I accept that in April, May next year we need to look forward then to the proposals in place. 'That's why I've said, alongside our plan, we need medium and long-term solutions. We need to be much more self-sufficient when it comes to energy.' Sir Keir reiterated his call, made a year ago, for a 'national mission to insulate homes'. Miss Truss, the frontrunner in the Tory leadership contest, has insisted that she will 'ensure people get the support needed' in the coming months after the rise. A Truss campaign spokesman said: 'Today's announcement will cause grave concern to many people across the UK who will be worried about paying their bills. 'As Prime Minister, Liz would ensure people get the support needed to get through these tough times. She will immediately take action to put more money back in people's pockets by cutting taxes and suspending green energy tariffs. 'This is on top of ongoing work such as the Energy Bills Support Scheme, which will see a £400 discount paid to consumers from October, and the £1,200 package of support for the most vulnerable. 'Liz will work flat-out to deliver long term energy affordability and security, unleashing more energy by maximising our North Sea oil and gas production - helping keep bills down in the future.' And former chancellor Mr Sunak called surging energy bills the 'most pressing challenge' facing the UK. 'I've said that consistently, and as chancellor I announced significant support to help people. But the situation has deteriorated and as prime minister, I would go further. 'My priority is to protect the most vulnerable in society, including pensioners, and I want them to have certainty that extra help is coming - that is what I would put in place. The energy price cap could top £7,000 next year, experts warned for the first time, as Ofgem announced the highest cap on record. The energy regulator said that the price cap for the average household would increase by 80 per cent to £3,549 for the three months starting in October. But experts at energy consultancy Auxilione warned that the cap could double even from that record high by April next year, hitting £7,263. The prediction is based on the current cost of buying energy on global markets and also sees bills hitting £5,405 in January. Fellow consultants at Cornwall Insight are a little more optimistic. Their model expects the cap to only reach £5,387 in January and then £6,616 from April. Both consultancies then expect bills to fall by between £700 to £800 in July when compared to the April cap. It is the grimmest forecast yet from the two outfits, whose predictions for October's price cap were close to Ofgem's decision. Auxilione's final forecast was just £27 above what the cap was set at, while Cornwall Insight's prediction was £5 above. The predictions are largely based on what gas prices are doing at the moment, so are subject to a lot of change between now and January, let alone before April. 'While there is still some time until the January and April caps are set, the energy crisis is showing no sign of abating,' said Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight. 'A key focus for the next Prime Minister and for Ofgem must be protecting consumers, and the wider economy from the impact of this rise,' he added. 'There are several avenues that can be explored including a review and expansion of the current support package of at least £400 per household. 'However, all of these are temporary solutions and must be accompanied by a focus on implementing a viable long-term solution.' He said that the purpose of the price cap is being undermined by the unprecedented rises in bills that are hitting households. 'Throughout the energy crisis, the Government and Ofgem have remained committed to the cap, and in its ability to shield consumers from a volatile energy market. 'However, the cap was never meant to be a permanent solution, it was created for a different energy market than the one we face today and has not protected consumers from what will be incredible hardship this winter.' 'Alternative plans, which are doing different things - borrowing tens of billions for permanent, unfunded tax cuts - don't actually do anything to help those most in need, risk making inflation worse and putting our nation's finances at risk as well.' He said his plan was the 'right one' for the country. Mr Sunak also said that protecting people from rising energy bills will be his 'immediate priority' as prime minister. He said that people can judge him on his 'track record' as chancellor, pointing to the package of supports he announced for people to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. 'It was acknowledged as being commensurate with the scale of the challenge, targeted at the people most in need,' Mr Sunak told broadcasters. 'That is my track record in grappling with this issue. I moved quickly as chancellor and this will be my immediate priority as prime minister and I'd like to try and do the same thing and make sure that we protect the most vulnerable as much as we can from this significant increase in bills.' Ofgem's Mr Brearley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he knew the increase in the cap would come as 'devastating' news for struggling households. He called on the Government and the next prime minister to take urgent action. He said: 'I know this will be devastating for many families, when they hear how much their energy bills are going to go up. We have done and looked at everything we can do as a regulator to address this figure. 'There's a number of things we do to make sure that companies treat their vulnerable customers well. There's a number of vulnerability schemes that we run. But the truth is this is beyond the capacity of the regulator and the industry to address. 'So what we are saying today is, look we have 10 days now until we have a new administration, have a new prime minister and a new ministerial team. What I am clear about is the prime minister with his or her ministerial team will need to act urgently and decisively to address this.' Mr Brearley also said the Government would need to add to the support it announced in May when bills were only expected to jump to £2,800. 'The Government support package is delivering help right now, but it's clear the new prime minister will need to act further to tackle the impact of the price rises that are coming in October and next year,' he added. 'We are working with ministers, consumer groups and industry on a set of options for the incoming prime minister that will require urgent action. 'The response will need to match the scale of the crisis we have before us. With the right support in place and with regulator, government, industry and consumers working together, we can find a way through this.' He added: 'The price of energy has reached record levels driven by an aggressive economic act by the Russian state. They have slowly and deliberately turned off the gas supplies to Europe causing harm to our households, businesses and wider economy. Ofgem has no choice but to reflect these cost increases in the price cap.' Mr Brearley also said that the gas price this winter was 15 times more than the cost two years ago. He told BBC Breakfast: 'When I look at what... gas now costs this winter, it is 15 times the normal price that we were expected to pay two years ago. 'Now if that were happening in petrol, it would cost us £400 to £500 just to fill up our car. So because those costs are changing, the price needs to change and that's why the price cap is now changing to £3,549'. When asked why Ofgem was not protecting the consumer by having a lower price cap, he said: 'The reason we don't have a lower price cap is because if the companies cannot recover the amount of money it costs for them to buy the energy, then ultimately, they will be unable to function.' 'They would have been unable to give us the energy that we need. So what the price cap does, and this is really important, it stops those companies charging excess profits over and above the cost of energy. Many households are facing the stark reality of being unable to afford their energy bills this winter. Consumers are currently hearing a lot about options for handling their bills, ranging from asking for help from their supplier to refusing to pay at all. Here we look at the pros and cons of each, and where to turn for advice and help. - The 'Don't Pay' option The 'Don't Pay' group describes itself as 'a grassroots movement demanding a fair price for energy for everyone'. More than 100,000 people have signed up to support a pledge to cancel their direct debits if the Government and energy firms 'refuse to act' by October 1. However, refusing to pay has serious consequences and households are strongly advised against taking this option - no matter how difficult their financial situation might be. If you are on a pre-payment meter, failing to pay will mean your supply being cut off. If you are on a regular or smart meter and you do not reach an agreement with your supplier before cancelling your direct debit, the firm may try to force you to have a pre-payment meter installed. This means you will have to pay for your energy usage upfront and a weekly payment to cover any debts - which can be as high as 90% of energy top-ups and 100% of electricity top-ups. Pre-payment customers also pay more than others. The current energy price cap is £1,971 for households with a standard meter, but £46 higher at £2,017 for those on a pre-payment meter. Failure to reach an agreement with your supplier may also result in them applying for a court warrant so they can visit your home and disconnect your energy supply. This can be done remotely if you have a smart meter, but your energy company must visit you to identify and assess your situation. An Ofgem spokeswoman said: 'We know that people are under huge pressure, but we do not think it's in consumers' best interest to not pay their bills, and most leading charities and consumer groups agree. 'The knock-on effects of not paying bills can be huge for people. They could lose their direct debit discounts or be forced to move to a pre-payment meter. It could also damage their credit rating.' - Moving off direct debits to paying for what you use - or a 'standing order' As households' monthly direct debits soar by hundreds of pounds, many are considering stopping them and paying for the energy they actually use in three-month chunks in the form of a standing order. While this may give a sense of control, anyone paying on receipt of a three-monthly bill for actual usage will pay considerably more than direct debit customers as almost all providers add a discount for direct debit payments. Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy for Citizens Advice, said: 'Paying as you go can give you more control over the amount you pay, but you might pay more for that control. It's unlikely that you would save money by moving to pay-as-you-go, because you can't spread your costs over a year.' - Direct debits remain the best option Despite sickening increases, staying on a direct debit plan remains the most cost-effective option for paying for your energy. However, customers have the right to challenge any increase that goes above the increased price cap - Ofgem is carefully monitoring this and has already warned firms that direct debits must be set correctly and they must 'clearly communicate any changes in a way that helps consumers understand their payments'. - I'm really struggling, where can I turn? You should first contact your supplier and notify them that you want to pay off your debt through a payment plan. They should discuss your options with you and come to an agreement. When coming to an agreement, your supplier should consider what you can afford to pay based on your income, outgoings, and any other debts you have. They will also consider how much energy you are likely to use in the future by looking at your past usage. To ensure your energy bill is accurate, send your supplier readings from your gas and electricity meter. It is very important to resist, if at all possible, being moved on to a pre-payment meter as this is the least cost-effective way of paying for energy. Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: 'We strongly encourage anyone concerned about being able to pay rising energy bills to speak to their supplier as energy firms have a duty to agree a payment plan that households can afford. 'Depending on the supplier, customers can ask for a review of their payments, a reduction in or break from their payments, more time to pay or access to hardship funds.' 'But what it can not do is set a price that is less than the cost of the energy that we buy, and that's why we have to make the change that we are making today.' Mr Brearley added that it was 'devastating news' for many families. He also said that 'there are no easy answers' to the energy crisis. He told Good Morning Britain: 'Genuinely, there are no easy answers, but there are some big decisions that ultimately ministers will need to make.' He added: 'To be honest I never imagined when I took this role that I would have to make an announcement that we made today.' When asked about senior people in the energy industry receiving bonuses, he urged them to 'be thoughtful' about their pay and remuneration. He said: 'For example, the senior Ofgem team has given away any bonuses to charity because we recognise the situation that we are in right now.' The boss of Ofgem also said the regulator has had countless meetings with the current Government, and called on the next prime minister to take decisions to 'match the scale of the problem'. 'This is a major issue for the country next year. This is a major set of decisions that the new government will need to make, that the new prime minister and his or her ministerial team will need to make,' Mr Brearley said on a call with reporters. He added: 'It's not for me to comment on the proposals that are out there for politicians. My point is very simple, it is going to need to be taken urgently and it's going to need to be decisive. 'And it's going to need to match the scale of the problem that we see - which version of that that the Government chooses to pursue really is a matter for them.' The Confederation of British Industry said the scale of Government help needs to be 'urgently reviewed'. 'Government must also step up and deliver a national energy efficiency programme that will help reduce household bills as soon as this winter,' said Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief policy director. And the trade body for energy suppliers in the UK has said the charges its members will be forced to pass onto households will be 'simply unaffordable', after Ofgem hiked the cap. 'This rise, while widely predicted, will be hugely worrying to customers. We know many customers are already struggling with energy bills and other costs and for millions of households, these latest increases will be simply unaffordable,' Energy UK's director of regulation Dan Alchin said. 'The rise is driven by the cost of buying gas on the wholesale market, which has been at record levels for about a year now - with prices this week 10 times what they were before the crisis. 'These costs are out of the control of energy retail suppliers who need to recoup them, otherwise we risk more going out of business in addition to the 30 that have done so since last August - causing huge cost and disruption to customers. 'However bills of this size were unimaginable a few months ago and we cannot expect customers to bear the brunt. 'Retail suppliers will continue to do all they can to offer help and support, especially to their most vulnerable customers, but faced with bill increases of this size and the numbers of customers who will need support, it won't be enough. 'The Government must step in urgently and put in place further support for this winter and with energy costs likely to remain high for the foreseeable future, look at ways to keep bills down next year as well - as we outlined in our letter to the Chancellor last week.' Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of Energy UK, said the new price cap will be 'really scary' for a lot of people and businesses across the country. She told Sky News: 'This is a crisis that has been caused by the international gas market and so we need to tackle that at a systemic level, as well as making sure that people have urgent help right now.' She added: 'We need something that is broad-brush that supports vulnerable people and really tackles what will be a massive cost-of-living crisis, but also something that helps middle income households and the wider economy.' Addressing politicians, she said: 'This is bigger than you think that it is. This is a whole-economy problem. This is urgent and we need to do more than you think that you need to do, and you need to do it now.' Mr Zahawi said Ministers were working to develop more options to support households amid the price cap rise. 'I know the energy price cap announcement this morning will cause stress and anxiety for many people, but help is coming with £400 off energy bills for all, the second instalment of a £650 payment for vulnerable households, and £300 for all pensioners,' he said. 'While Putin is driving up energy prices in revenge for our support of Ukraine's brave struggle for freedom, I am working flat out to develop options for further support. 'This will mean the incoming prime minister can hit the ground running and deliver support to those who need it most, as soon as possible.' He also said the Government knows it has 'got to do more' to support households through the energy crisis. The Chancellor also indicated that the crisis would not be temporary, suggesting that it could last well into next year. Millions of hard-up families could save hundreds of pounds on their energy bills this winter in a few simple steps without making their homes any colder, experts have said. Record-breaking energy prices are likely to affect many over the next few months as Ofgem hiked its energy price cap today. Experts warn that worse is to come when the cap is updated in January. But two small changes to the way your boiler works could save up to 18 per cent, or around £324, according to experts at the Heating Hub, which provides advice on energy efficiency. - Turning down your flow temperature The flow temperature on a boiler regulates how hot the water is when it leaves the boiler to go to your radiators. Most condensing combi boilers in the UK are still set to their factory setting, which tends to be around 80C, but at this temperature boilers cannot operate at their most efficient. When a condensing boiler burns gas, a lot of the heat can escape out of the flue and out on to the street - this heat literally disappears into thin air. Steam coming out of a flue is a sign that flow temperature is high and heat is escaping. At lower temperatures the boiler works to recycle a lot of this heat back into the water it is trying to warm up. Jo Alsop of the Heating Hub said that by turning down the flow temperature, households could save around 6% to 8% of their annual gas usage. 'It's worth making the point that condensing boilers, even though they're A-rated on the box (for efficiency), they don't necessarily achieve A-rating in the home,' she said. Some A-rated boilers have been found to operate at E-rated efficiency levels in the home, at just 75 per cent. Turning down the flow temperature is not the same as turning down the thermostat. The boiler and radiators will still work to keep rooms at the same temperature as before, but it might take a little longer for the house to heat up. Ms Alsop said families should experiment with lowering the flow temperature. The colder it is, the more efficient the boiler will run. 'We would advise to do that to around 60C and if they find that's a bit too cool on a very cold day, they can always notch it back up, but importantly reduce it down again when the weather gets a bit warmer, and keep reducing it down,' she said. How to do this depends on the boiler, but it is a fairly simple process. It should say how in the boiler manual, which can often be found online. The Heating Hub also has a guide on its website on how to change the flow temperature. It is important to remember only to do this if you have a condensing combi boiler which is not connected to a hot water cylinder. Also be careful about keeping rooms cold if you have vulnerable people in the home. Several energy suppliers are also keen for households to turn down flow temperatures. Rebecca Dibb-Simkin, chief product officer at Octopus Energy, said: 'Safely turning down the water flow temperature of your gas boiler is a little-known but very effective tip for saving gas whilst staying warm, and could save people up to 8% off their gas bills. 'Over 100,000 of our customers who took part in our energy efficiency scheme last winter told us they tried it, with some of them knocking nearly £100 off their bills.' - Turning off your boiler's pre-heat function The pre-heat function on a boiler is designed to ensure that hot water is ready to flow to the taps at a moment's notice. It means the boiler always keeps a small amount of water hot. It is a handy function when you want to wash your hands and do not want to wait for water to heat up, but the boiler is heating up water when you do not need it. 'If the boiler is not on and heating the home, it will fire anyway, just to keep that water at temperature, even if someone is not home during the day, and certainly it will fire all through the night, even when hot water is not in demand,' Ms Alsop said. That means burning gas through the night, every night, for nothing. Turning off the pre-heat function might mean a longer wait for the shower to get warm in the morning, but it is a small inconvenience for the hundreds of pounds that can be saved. Ms Alsop estimates households could save around 5 per cent to 10 per cent of their gas use. Guides on how to turn off the pre-heat function should be in the boiler manual or online. However Ms Alsop said people should consider turning the pre-heat on during droughts if they have to wait an exceptionally long time for hot water to reach the taps. They can still turn it off during the day and night. He said that help from the Government is coming but admitted: 'We know that's not enough. We've got to do more.' 'We need to make sure that this isn't a sticking plaster, that for the long term we continue to help the most vulnerable who have no cushion. And that's what I'm determined to do. 'And we're working up those options for both households and for business for the incoming prime minister on the 5th of September to take those decisions. 'So my message today is we'll get this £37 billion to people to help them for now, and then more will be coming because we know this will continue in January and of course on to April and next year and we have to remain resilient.' He also said that his aim is to make sure vulnerable UK households are 'resilient through next year'. The Chancellor declined to give specifics about what a package of funding might look like, but insisted that the Treasury was working on proposals to present to the next Prime Minister. Mr Zahawi is not expected to retain his portfolio if frontrunner Miss Truss wins the contest to replace Boris Johnson. 'We know we need to do more because actually the most vulnerable households have no cushion, have nothing available to them,' he told broadcasters. 'So what I'm looking at is how I can target that help for those people, not just to January, but we need to make sure that we're resilient through next year. 'More help is on its way because we know that the most vulnerable households need that additional help. And I'm doing the work to make sure that that will be in place throughout next year.' In addition, the Chancellor denied that there was a lack of action from Government amid the Tory leadership contest. It was put to him by broadcasters that it was 'intolerable' to 'leave people in the dark' at the moment. Mr Zahawi said: 'That sounds like we're not acting on this.' Setting out the work of his team over the last month, he said: 'We know (Vladimir) Putin has now worked out that actually this is quite a potent lever. You look at what's happening in Germany and the rest of Europe. 'We need to make sure there's more support. My preference is for it to be targeted. 'Why? Because it will give us a much longer, more leeway, to be able to face down Putin and send a very important message to him that this is not going to work.' And the Chancellor suggested that the public does now need to look at how they use energy. Speaking to broadcasters, Mr Zahawi was asked if people should start reducing their energy use. He said: 'The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption. It is a difficult time. There is war on our continent. 'Very few people anticipated war. Wars happen in far-flung places. It is now here with us. We have to remain resilient. My responsibility is to deliver that help.' On Wednesday, Mr Zahawi insisted 'nothing is off the table' when it comes energy bills, but added that a freeze in the price cap would not deliver 'targeted help' for those who need it most. Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves tweeted today: 'This is incredibly worrying and will strike fear in the heart of many families. We cannot wait any longer to act. 'This is a national emergency. The Tories must freeze energy bills now so households don't pay a penny more in winter.' She also said in a statement that the Government must choose between letting families suffer, or stop the oncoming rise. 'Today's announcement will strike fear in the heart of many families, and force many to make unthinkable choices this winter. The Tories now face an urgent choice. 'They can carry on letting oil and gas companies make huge profits whilst every family suffers with bills rising this winter. Or they can act now and stop the energy price cap rising, by bringing in a windfall tax on those oil and gas profits. 'People deserve a government that can meet the scale of this national emergency - not this spectacle of a Tory leadership race or a Prime Minister that put his out of office on months ago. 'Labour is on your side, and our fully-funded plan to freeze the price cap will make sure households don't pay a penny more this winter, saving you £1,000. 'Our mission for home grown renewable energy and to insulate 19 million homes will keep bills down for the long term too.' Appearing on BBC Breakfast, Ms Reeves urged the Government to act to protect the public from soaring energy bills. She accused ministers of being nowhere to be seen on the morning of the announcement. The Labour MP said people are 'worried sick' about what is happening and is 'striking fear in the hearts of families right across the country'. She called on the Government to freeze energy fills and follow Labour's own proposals. - First step: switch off and unplug Households should by now have done a complete check of every power outlet, unplugging anything that is not necessary and turning devices off standby mode - and getting into the habit of doing this regularly. Energy Saving Trust calculates that you can save around £55 a year just by remembering to turn your appliances off standby mode. Almost all electrical appliances can be turned off at the plug without upsetting their programming. You may want to think about getting a standby saver or smart plug which allows you to turn all your appliances off standby in one go. Check the instructions for any appliances you're not sure about. Some satellite and digital TV recorders may need to be left plugged in so they can keep track of any programmes you want to record. - Check your boiler A recent report by the Heating and Hot Water Council found that households can save around 6% to 8% on their gas bill just by turning down the heating flow temperature on their condensing combi boiler. Doing this will allow the boiler to run more efficiently and could save around £200 off an average energy bill. Use the controls on the front of your boiler - not your room thermostat - to set the flow temperature for the boiler, which is the temperature your boiler heats the water to before sending it off to your radiators. The way you adjust the flow temperature and the display information available varies a great deal. There is a handy online guide at theheatinghub.co.uk. Another easy saving is to turn off the pre-heat mode on the boiler, which could mean hot water taps taking longer to heat up, but could save hundreds of pounds a year. - Forget about your tumble dryer and use other appliances wisely Tumble dryers are massive energy drains, so on warm days hang clothes outside to dry instead and invest in a drying rack for cooler months. Use your washing machine on a 30C cycle and reduce use by one run a week. Only run your dishwasher when it is full and use eco settings if possible. Avoid overfilling the kettle - only boil the amount you need. - Defrost your fridge and freezer Remember to regularly defrost your fridge and freezer, as the more they ice up the more energy they will use. A full freezer is more economical to run. With a full freezer, the cold air does not need to circulate as much, so less power is needed. If you have lots of free space, half-fill plastic bottles with water and use these to fill gaps. BBC Good Food suggests you fill the freezer with everyday items you are bound to use, such as sliced bread, milk or frozen peas. - Turn off lights Turn lights off when you are not using them or when you leave a room. Replacing all the lights in your home with LED bulbs could help you save even more. - Keep windows closed when temperatures get hot The obvious thing to do when homes warm up is to open all the windows. However all this does is fill the house with hot air. It is best to use blinds and curtains to block direct sunlight during the day and then open the windows at night when temperatures drop, helping you to save energy by reducing the need for power-hungry fans. - Use fans sparingly and wisely Fans, even when used on cooling settings, will send bills soaring. You should not stop using them when necessary, but there are ways of maximising their effect and cutting the time they are switched on. Putting fans at floor level helps to circulate the lower cold air rather than the warmer air that naturally rises in a room. You can also create the ideal combination for energy saving by pairing smart fan usage with closed windows, keeping the fans working during the day and the windows open at night. - Invest in insulation New analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit has found homes rated band F on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) system, a measure of the home's efficiency, are set to have a gas bill £968 higher than a home rated EPC band C, the Government's target for 2035. The average home in the UK is rated band D and these homes will pay £420 more for their gas this winter, compared with band C. Energy Saving Trust also says that for those wishing to future-proof their homes, investing in professional draught-proofing and insulation in preparation for the winter months could lead to a reduction in bills by £405 for a semi-detached home. DIY draught-proofing is much cheaper and anything is better than nothing. Installing solar panels for a similar property could lead to additional annual savings of around £450. A quarter of heat in an uninsulated home is lost through the roof. Most homes have at least some loft insulation but often not enough. Topping up from 120mm to at least 270mm of insulation will help. - And here are some myths... Turning boilers off is not advisable or an effective way to save energy. Instead, thermostats and timers should be used effectively to regulate their operation. Fridges and freezers are designed to be kept on all the time and energy will not be saved by turning them off for short periods because more energy will be used to cool them down again when turned back on. There are also important safety issues that can arise if food partially defrosts before it is prepared for eating. She said: 'The fact that no Government minister is available to come on your programme today is just appalling. They are not here to give assurances they are not here to set out what they are going to do. That is a dereliction of duty.' Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said that rise in the cap is 'nothing short of a catastrophe' for millions of households. 'The only option is for energy prices to be frozen before these rises wreak havoc on our communities. Then we need a proper plan to be put in place to bring bills down next year,' he said. 'As millions suffer the Conservatives do nothing. No policy from the government, no plan from Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak. They have no idea how much pain these energy prices will cause our country. They are simply unfit to govern.' Chairman of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, Darren Jones, also warned 'many businesses will face bankruptcy because there is no price cap on their energy bills'. 'The scale of the challenge will mean that the next chancellor will have to offer business grants and not just temporary tax and business rate cuts,' the Labour MP said. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the energy price cap rise is 'simply unaffordable for millions' and must be cancelled. And Scotland's Energy Secretary Michael Matheson said the increase is 'unsustainable' and warned it would push millions into fuel poverty. Ms Sturgeon said the rise should not be allowed to happen. She tweeted: 'This is simply unaffordable for millions. It cannot be allowed to go ahead. 'This rise must be cancelled, with the UK gov and energy companies then agreeing a package to fund the cost of a freeze over a longer period, coupled with fundamental reform of the energy market.' Mr Matheson told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme households were already struggling with the cap increase in April this year, and that 'increasing it by another 80 per cent is simply unsustainable.' He said: 'It will force quite literally millions of households into fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty and is unsustainable.' In a statement issued after the increase was confirmed today, Mr Matheson called on the UK Government to act. He said: 'Today's price cap announcement and increase imposes a burden that customers simply cannot be expected to carry. 'The only acceptable course of action now is for the UK Government, who have the necessary policy levers and borrowing powers at their disposal, to take immediate steps to cancel the increase for all households.' Mr Matheson added: 'No single government, company or organisation can solve this crisis alone. It requires a collective response commensurate to the situation. 'We will continue to work with our partners, energy companies and stakeholders to do everything we can to help the people of Scotland through this deeply unsettling time. 'We will also continue to press the UK Government to reform the energy market to prevent this situation occurring again in the future.' Mr Matheson said the Scottish Government is treating the situation as a 'public emergency' and has prepared a £1.2 million package to enable the immediate expansion of energy advice services. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton called for energy prices to be frozen. Mr Sarwar said: 'This eye-watering price hike risks plunging millions of people into fuel poverty. This is a national emergency and our governments have a moral duty to act.' Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: 'This energy price rise will be devastating for hundreds of thousands of Scottish families and pensioners already struggling to make ends meet.' ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson, said: 'The size and scale of this issue is truly catastrophic for UK households and that's why only a big solution can tackle it once and for all to shelter people from the worst this winter. 'We have offered the Government a plan, backed by the industry, that can be delivered this year, tailored in line with their priorities and will support the UK economy - with the cap set at £3,549, what billpayers need now is to hear what additional help is coming.' Richard Neudegg, director of regulation at Uswitch.com, said: 'Here is the signal that the summer holidays are over. After seemingly endless predictions, the true magnitude of the October energy price cap is now clear. 'Ofgem has rubber-stamped the letters from suppliers that will now start landing on millions of doorsteps informing customers of exactly how much they'll need to pay for their energy as we go into winter. 'Households will face average monthly charges of £362 based on expected usage - almost three times more than the same period in 2021. 'Even after the £66 monthly discount currently on the table from the Government, families will need to find on average an extra £169 per month compared to last year, when many household budgets are already maxed out. 'The energy crisis we face this winter must never be allowed to happen again. This is a failure of the wholesale market and, until that is resolved, we won't have a long-term solution. 'The Government has made it clear that it will not intervene further until a new Prime Minister is confirmed. As concerning as this is, there does seem to be consensus that more support will be made available, but it remains to be seen if it will be enough. 'Until the Government acts, which we expect will be in the coming weeks, consumers are being held in a cost-of-living limbo.' The next prime minister will most likely be unable to avoid introducing a fresh package of support, a leading think tank has said. Respected think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested on Friday that whoever becomes the next prime minister would be unable to avoid putting together a 'substantial package of support', no matter what is said on the campaign trail. The new rise in the price cap, the IFS said, means the current Government supports will cover only 47 per cent of the rise in bills. It said covering the same proportion of the energy price rise now would cost a further £14 billion. The IFS said it was difficult to assess the impact of Ms Truss's plans to cut green levies. 'Cutting only those levies that still add to bills would be complex as they are linked to various schemes and subsidies and apply to business as well as households, but would save households around £50 on average over the three months from October,' the think tank said. Mr Sunak's plan to cut VAT on household energy bills, the IFS said, would save a typical household £51 between October and December at a cost of £1.4 billion. 'Looking beyond this winter, energy prices also look like they will remain very high well into next year, which will put pressure on the government to provide further support in the coming months,' IFS economist Isaac Delestre said. 'Whoever becomes the next prime minister will most likely be announcing a substantial package of support very soon after taking office.' In Scotland, the £2million Social Housing Fuel Support Fund, administered by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, will open on Monday to provide help to the most vulnerable households. Citizens Advice Scotland also said the increase should not be allowed to happen. The charity's chief executive, Derek Mitchell, said: 'This increase should not go ahead. It is absolutely horrifying for people who are hanging on by a thread financially.' Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: 'Today's Ofgem price hike is like a dagger to the heart of millions of people up and down the country. 'As a result of the decision, parents will be unable to feed their children, the sick and elderly will be condemned to worsening health, disabled people will go without vital medical equipment and households will be forced into poverty for the first time in generations. 'All the solutions lie at the Westminster Government's door, yet it is silent in the face of this looming disaster.' And Andrew Forsey, national director of anti-hunger charity Feeding Britain, said: 'Unless significant additional help is offered by the new prime minister, these eye-watering prices will spring a vicious hunger trap; leaving millions of families unable to afford heating or eating. 'Eighty years after the Beveridge Report set the framework for a welfare state that could eliminate destitution from our shores, the threat of destitution now hangs over us again like the Sword of Damocles.' Meanwhile Sara Ogilvie, policy director at Child Poverty Action Group, said: 'Today's energy cap announcement will terrify many low-income families. Their budgets have been overstretched for months, and soaring prices will make it practically impossible to escape the tightening grip of poverty. 'We know that families with children spend 30 per cent more on energy bills than households without kids - yet Government has completely failed to recognise the extra costs facing households with children. 'The next prime minister will be on a collision course with reality unless they increase support to reflect the scale of need, and uprate benefits in line with inflation.' And a charity which supports the vulnerable said families are facing one of the 'bleakest Christmases' for years. Rossanna Trudgian, head of campaigns and public affairs at Action for Children, said: 'Today's announcement, and warnings of even worse rises to come next year, makes it clear that the country is facing a national emergency. Can my bills be higher than the energy price cap? Will it get worse? How 80% rise will affect YOU - as it's revealed a family of five in a four-bed home face monthly bills of £513 from October The energy price cap, which regulates the amount that 24million UK households pay for gas and electricity, will jump by 80 per cent from October - sending the average household's yearly bill from £1,971 to £3,549. The cap affects those in England, Scotland and Wales on default energy tariffs, and the new level announced by regulator Ofgem this morning will remain in place until December 31, when it will be adjusted again. Research by Uswitch found monthly bills in October, November and December this year will hit around £243 for low usage, £363 for medium usage and £513 for high usage - also depending on the size of the home. Experts at consultancy Auxilione used latest gas prices to predict the cap will rise by another 52 per cent to £5,405 in January 2023, then by a further 34 per cent to £7,263 in April - before falling, to £6,485 in July. So what is the price cap, what will happen to it in future and what help is available for households this winter? What is the energy price cap? The energy price cap decides the maximum cost per unit that energy companies can charge for both gas and electricity. This is then used to calculate a typical annual bill. The price cap was introduced in January 2019 as a way to ensure that households who do not have fixed deals - and who are, in some cases, less financially savvy - are not ripped off by their energy suppliers. Twice a year, energy regulator Ofgem would set the maximum price that households on their supplier's default tariff would have to pay for every unit of gas and electricity they used for the next six months. It allowed for a small profit - capped at 1.9 per cent - that energy suppliers were permitted to take for supplying the service. The frequency of the cap was increased on August 4 from every six to every three months. How is the price cap calculated? The cap is calculated by Ofgem based on the wholesale price of gas and electricity and also includes allowances for tax, charges paid to the energy networks, green levies and social payments. What is happening to the price cap? The price cap is going up significantly. The 80 per cent rise announced today - which comes into force from October 1 - will push the cap to £3,549 per year for the average household. This is the highest it has ever been. Can my bills be higher than the price cap? Experts warn there is no cap on the maximum households pay – but the cap is actually a maximum cost per unit that firms can charge for gas and electricity. The actual cap for each home therefore varies according to use. Ofgem said that from October 1 the equivalent per unit level of the price cap to the nearest pence for a typical customer paying by direct debit will be 52p per kWh for electricity customers and a standing charge of 46p per day. The equivalent per unit level for a typical gas customer is 15p per kWh with a standing charge of 28p per day. Why is the price cap going up? The price cap on energy bills is linked to the wholesale price of gas and electricity, which is itself based on what happens on European markets. The wholesale price of gas has soared by around eightfold in the last year. That rise has been passed onto customers in increments - the price cap was already at a record £1,971 over the summer. Gas prices were already increasing last summer as demand bounced as countries emerged from lockdown but the situation was made much worse when Russia invaded Ukraine and started to restrict gas exports to Europe. Gas prices are also decisive for electricity prices, because gas is so important for the generation of electricity. Over the last year, 42 per cent of the UK's electricity came from burning gas. Ofgem said the increase reflected the continued rise in global wholesale gas prices, which began to surge as the world unlocked from the Covid pandemic, and had been driven still higher to record levels by Russia's actions. When will the price cap change again? The price cap will be changed again in January 2023. It used to be changed twice a year, but changes announced on August 4 mean it will be reviewed every three months. It will change again in April, July and October 2023. What is the price cap likely to be like next year? Experts expect the cap to rise significantly in January 2023 and again in April, and then to fall back again in July and October next year - but the exact levels of the cap remains to be seen. Experts at Cornwall Insight expect the cap to hit £5,387 in January 2023, while those at consultancy Auxilione think it will hit £5,405. In April, Cornwall expects a £6,616 cap, while Auxilione believe it could reach £7,263. There is then an expectation that the price will fall. Cornwall's forecasts for the July and October 2023 caps are £5,897 and £5,887 respectively, while Auxilione expects it to reach £6,485 and £6,006. What does the new price cap mean for monthly bills? Experts at Uswitch estimate that monthly bills in October, November and December this year will hit between £243 and £513 a month, depending on the size of the home and usage, and based on the October price cap. They say 'low user groups' are usually one or two people living in a one to two-bedroom flat, who are at home in the evenings and weekends and have a weekly laundry cycle. They also use the heating occasionally and don't use a dishwasher or tumble dryer. These people are likely to spend around £243 a month on energy bills from October. Then, 'medium user groups' are typically families of three or four people living in a three-bedroom house. Some members are home in the day as well as in the evening and weekends. The heating is used regularly, and electrical appliances are often turned on. Laundry is done three times a week. Their average energy bill is likely to be £363. Finally, 'high user groups' tend to be large families with five or more living together in a four-bedroom house or larger. There is always someone at home in the day and and in the evenings and on weekends. There could be multiple television in use as well as a tumble dryer and dishwasher which are used regularly. Laundry is done daily. These groups are likely to face a bill of £513 a month from October. What is the cap's purpose? When Theresa May's government introduced the cap in January 2019, the aim was to protect households against profiteering energy giants. It would also, in theory, protect customers against sudden increases in bills. More recently, Ofgem has allowed the cap to rise in a way that protects energy firms from going bust amid the soaring cost of wholesale gas and therefore electricity. The effect is that bills are rising more sharply, and more often, to ensure suppliers can cover the spike in the wholesale prices of gas and electricity, which are around ten times higher than normal. Who is affected by the price cap? The new cap will come into effect for around 24million households in England, Scotland and Wales on default energy tariffs on October 1, and will remain in place until December 31, when it will be adjusted again. A few million people are on long-term fixed rates - which are not affected by the cap. However, many of these deals are expiring in the next few months. What is the cheapest way of paying for energy? Paying by direct debit tends to be the cheapest way of paying for electricity and gas, because energy companies normally provide a discount for those using this method as it reduces their costs and administration time. What about those on pre-payment meters? The 4.5million pre-payment meter customers, who are often the most vulnerable and already in fuel poverty, will see an even more punishing increase, with their average annual bill set to go up to £3,608. What support is available for you? It depends on your personal situation. All households have been promised a £400 discount on their energy bills. This support was announced in May, and will be paid in six monthly payments from October. For direct debit customers this will be taken off their payments, while prepayment meter customers will be given discount vouchers from the first week of every month. These will be issued by text, email or by post. Eight million of the most vulnerable households will also get extra support, taking the total they can get to £1,200. These include a £650 one-off payment to households on means-tested benefits, a £300 payment to pensioners, and £150 for six million people who receive disability benefits. Will the Government announce more support? Charities, think tanks, opposition parties and potential future prime ministers have said the Government will need to do more for struggling households. But extra support will have to wait until the next prime minister is in place. Consumer watchdog Which? has said the Government's financial support for all households must increase from the current £400 to £1,000 - or from £67 to £167 per month from October to March. However, no immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 after the Tory leadership contest. The current Government has said that it is exploring the options and will present them to the new prime minister when he or she comes into office next month. - First step: switch off and unplug Households should by now have done a complete check of every power outlet, unplugging anything that is not necessary and turning devices off standby mode - and getting into the habit of doing this regularly. Energy Saving Trust calculates that you can save around £55 a year just by remembering to turn your appliances off standby mode. Almost all electrical appliances can be turned off at the plug without upsetting their programming. You may want to think about getting a standby saver or smart plug which allows you to turn all your appliances off standby in one go. Check the instructions for any appliances you're not sure about. Some satellite and digital TV recorders may need to be left plugged in so they can keep track of any programmes you want to record. - Check your boiler A recent report by the Heating and Hot Water Council found that households can save around 6% to 8% on their gas bill just by turning down the heating flow temperature on their condensing combi boiler. Doing this will allow the boiler to run more efficiently and could save around £200 off an average energy bill. Use the controls on the front of your boiler - not your room thermostat - to set the flow temperature for the boiler, which is the temperature your boiler heats the water to before sending it off to your radiators. The way you adjust the flow temperature and the display information available varies a great deal. There is a handy online guide at theheatinghub.co.uk. Another easy saving is to turn off the pre-heat mode on the boiler, which could mean hot water taps taking longer to heat up, but could save hundreds of pounds a year. - Forget about your tumble dryer and use other appliances wisely Tumble dryers are massive energy drains, so on warm days hang clothes outside to dry instead and invest in a drying rack for cooler months. Use your washing machine on a 30C cycle and reduce use by one run a week. Only run your dishwasher when it is full and use eco settings if possible. Avoid overfilling the kettle - only boil the amount you need. - Defrost your fridge and freezer Remember to regularly defrost your fridge and freezer, as the more they ice up the more energy they will use. A full freezer is more economical to run. With a full freezer, the cold air does not need to circulate as much, so less power is needed. If you have lots of free space, half-fill plastic bottles with water and use these to fill gaps. BBC Good Food suggests you fill the freezer with everyday items you are bound to use, such as sliced bread, milk or frozen peas. - Turn off lights Turn lights off when you are not using them or when you leave a room. Replacing all the lights in your home with LED bulbs could help you save even more. - Keep windows closed when temperatures get hot The obvious thing to do when homes warm up is to open all the windows. However all this does is fill the house with hot air. It is best to use blinds and curtains to block direct sunlight during the day and then open the windows at night when temperatures drop, helping you to save energy by reducing the need for power-hungry fans. - Use fans sparingly and wisely Fans, even when used on cooling settings, will send bills soaring. You should not stop using them when necessary, but there are ways of maximising their effect and cutting the time they are switched on. Putting fans at floor level helps to circulate the lower cold air rather than the warmer air that naturally rises in a room. You can also create the ideal combination for energy saving by pairing smart fan usage with closed windows, keeping the fans working during the day and the windows open at night. - Invest in insulation New analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit has found homes rated band F on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) system, a measure of the home's efficiency, are set to have a gas bill £968 higher than a home rated EPC band C, the Government's target for 2035. The average home in the UK is rated band D and these homes will pay £420 more for their gas this winter, compared with band C. Energy Saving Trust also says that for those wishing to future-proof their homes, investing in professional draught-proofing and insulation in preparation for the winter months could lead to a reduction in bills by £405 for a semi-detached home. DIY draught-proofing is much cheaper and anything is better than nothing. Installing solar panels for a similar property could lead to additional annual savings of around £450. A quarter of heat in an uninsulated home is lost through the roof. Most homes have at least some loft insulation but often not enough. Topping up from 120mm to at least 270mm of insulation will help. - And here are some myths... Turning boilers off is not advisable or an effective way to save energy. Instead, thermostats and timers should be used effectively to regulate their operation. Fridges and freezers are designed to be kept on all the time and energy will not be saved by turning them off for short periods because more energy will be used to cool them down again when turned back on. There are also important safety issues that can arise if food partially defrosts before it is prepared for eating."

BBC Good Food suggests you fill the freezer with everyday items you are bound to use, such as sliced bread, milk or frozen peas. - Turn off lights Turn lights off when you are not using them or when you leave a room. Replacing all the lights in your home with LED bulbs could help you save even more. - Keep windows closed when temperatures get hot The obvious thing to do when homes warm up is to open all the windows. However all this does is fill the house with hot air. It is best to use blinds and curtains to block direct sunlight during the day and then open the windows at night when temperatures drop, helping you to save energy by reducing the need for power-hungry fans. - Use fans sparingly and wisely Fans, even when used on cooling settings, will send bills soaring. You should not stop using them when necessary, but there are ways of maximising their effect and cutting the time they are switched on. Putting fans at floor level helps to circulate the lower cold air rather than the warmer air that naturally rises in a room. You can also create the ideal combination for energy saving by pairing smart fan usage with closed windows, keeping the fans working during the day and the windows open at night. - Invest in insulation New analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit has found homes rated band F on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) system, a measure of the home's efficiency, are set to have a gas bill £968 higher than a home rated EPC band C, the Government's target for 2035. The average home in the UK is rated band D and these homes will pay £420 more for their gas this winter, compared with band C. Energy Saving Trust also says that for those wishing to future-proof their homes, investing in professional draught-proofing and insulation in preparation for the winter months could lead to a reduction in bills by £405 for a semi-detached home. DIY draught-proofing is much cheaper and anything is better than nothing. Installing solar panels for a similar property could lead to additional annual savings of around £450. A quarter of heat in an uninsulated home is lost through the roof. Most homes have at least some loft insulation but often not enough. Topping up from 120mm to at least 270mm of insulation will help. - And here are some myths... Turning boilers off is not advisable or an effective way to save energy. Instead, thermostats and timers should be used effectively to regulate their operation. Fridges and freezers are designed to be kept on all the time and energy will not be saved by turning them off for short periods because more energy will be used to cool them down again when turned back on. There are also important safety issues that can arise if food partially defrosts before it is prepared for eating."

Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai claimed the Russian soldiers were killed in a Ukrainian strike on their headquarters in the city of Kadiivka, eastern Ukraine, last night. Images shared by Gaidai appear to show the damaged remains of a hotel that had been used as a base by Russian soldiers in Kadiivka. Gaidai claimed on Twitter: 'The Armed Forces of Ukraine hit battlements in occupied Kadiiva, about 200 Russian paratroopers were killed.' He added on Facebook: 'In the temporarily occupied Kadiivka, Luhansk region, Ukrainian soldiers destroyed the base of the Russians they equipped at the hotel 'Donbass'. '200 military airborne troops of the Russian Federation eliminated.' The alleged strike on the Russian HQ comes as Russia's assault on Ukraine has now almost grounded to a halt amid heavy losses - with an estimated 80,000 troops killed or injured since the war began six months ago. Russian forces control territory along Ukraine's Black Sea and Sea of Azov coasts, while the conflict has settled into a war of attrition in the eastern Donbas region, which comprises the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk. Explosions were heard in the early hours of Friday in the southern city of Mykolaiv, a key battleground as Russian forces try to push further westwards along the coast to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea. The immediate cause of the blasts was unclear, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said, adding that two villages nearby had been shelled. There were no reports of casualties. The Ukraine military said its forces had repulsed Russian assaults on the towns of Bakhmut and Soledar in the eastern Donetsk region and struck ammunition depots and enemy personnel in the southern Kherson region. Ukrainian forces fired some 10 rockets from a U.S.-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launcher at the town of Stakhanov in the eastern Donbas region, pro-Moscow breakaway officials in Luhansk were quoted by Russia's TASS news agency as saying. Reuters was unable to verify the battlefield reports of either side. Russia's defence minister Sergei Shoigu claimed on Wednesday that Russia was deliberately slowing the pace of its onslaught 'to reduce civilian casualties'. But British intelligence chiefs today dismissed this as 'deliberate information' - and said that Russia's offensive had instead stalled because of 'poor Russian military performance and fierce Ukrainian resistance'. 'Under Shoigu's orders, the forces operating in Ukraine have repeatedly missed planned operational timelines,' the UK's defence ministry said in its latest intelligence report."

2022-08-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11148523/Russia-Ukraine-war-news-Zelensky-accuses-Putin-nearly-causing-nuclear-disaster.html,Europe was ‘one step away from a nuclear disaster’ after Russian-held power plant was forced to be cut off from electrical grid and only back-up diesel generators prevented catastrophe,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of nearly causing a 'radiation disaster' after the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was temporarily cut off from the electrical grid because of fire damage. Mr Zelensky blamed Russian shelling and said the plant's emergency backup diesel generators had to be activated to supply power needed to run the plant. A loss of cooling could cause a nuclear meltdown. 'Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans one step away from a radiation disaster,' the president said in his nightly video address. 'The world must understand what a threat this is,' Zelensky said, after speaking with US president Joe Biden. 'If the diesel generators hadn't turned on, if the automation and our staff of the plant had not reacted after the blackout, then we would already be forced to overcome the consequences of the radiation incident.' A blackout across the region on Thursday heightened fears of a catastrophe in a country still haunted by the Chernobyl catastrophe. 'Every minute the Russian troops stay at the nuclear power plant is a risk of a global radiation disaster,' Zelensky said. All six reactors of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine are still disconnected from Ukraine's electricity grid, state nuclear company Energoatom said. Energoatom said electricity for the plant's own needs was currently being supplied through a power line from Ukraine's electricity system. The complex, Europe's largest nuclear plant, has been occupied by Russian forces and run by Ukrainian workers since the early days of the six-month-old war. Ukraine alleges Russia is essentially holding the plant hostage, storing weapons there and launching attacks from around it, while Moscow accuses Ukraine of recklessly firing on the facility. On Thursday, the plant was cut off from the electrical grid after fires damaged the last operating regular transmission line, according to Ukraine's nuclear power agency, Energoatom. Zaporizhzhia's Russian-installed regional governor, Yevgeny Balitsky, blamed the transmission-line damage on a Ukrainian attack. It was not immediately clear whether the damaged line carried outgoing electricity or incoming power, needed for the reactors' vital cooling systems. A backup line supplying electricity from another plant remained in place, Energoatom said. External power is essential to cool the two reactors still in operation at the Zaporizhzhia site. Without electricity to power the pumps which keep the hot reactor core cool, nuclear fuel will start to melt. Last week, while the final power line was still connected, Ukraine's nuclear agency said losing the supply would lead to this happening, 'resulting in a release of radioactive substances to the environment'. A power supply is also vital to keep spent radioactive fuel stored in special onsite facilities cool. Speaking last week, Professor Paul Norman, Professor of Nuclear Physics & Nuclear Energy at the University of Birmingham told the Science Media Centre that nuclear reactors need constant cooling, even after they have been shut down. He added that: 'Damaging certain cooling systems could also prevent the reactor from properly cooling itself and lead to overheating – a 'meltdown'.' The plant has backup diesel generators to provide electricity if it is disconnected from the grid but Ukraine has warned these are unlikely to be reliable in the long-term. But Mr Zelensky's mention of the emergency generators being activated raised questions of whether the cooling systems were endangered. Two reactors still in use — out of the plant's six — went offline, Mr Balitsky said, but one was quickly restored, as was electricity to the region. Many nuclear plants are designed to automatically shut down or at least reduce reactor output in the event of a loss of outgoing transmission lines. The UN's International Atomic Agency said Ukraine informed it that the reactors' emergency protection systems were triggered, and all safety systems remained operational. The three regular transmission lines at the plant are out of service because of previous war damage. 'Anybody who understands nuclear safety issues has been trembling for the last six months,' Mycle Schneider, a consultant and coordinator of the World Nuclear Industry Status Report, said before the latest incident. Ukraine cannot simply shut down its nuclear plants during the war because it is heavily reliant on them. Its 15 reactors at four stations provide about half of its electricity. Still, an armed conflict near a working atomic plant is troubling for many experts and people living nearby. That fear is palpable just across the Dnieper River in Nikopol, where residents have been under nearly constant Russian shelling since July 12, with eight people killed, 850 buildings damaged and over half the population of 100,000 fleeing the city. Liudmyla Shyshkina, a 74-year-old widow who lived within sight of the Zaporizhzhia plant before her apartment was bombarded and her husband killed, said she believes the Russians are capable of intentionally causing a nuclear disaster. Mr Zelensky has accused Russia of 'nuclear blackmail' at Zaporizhzhia. While no civilian nuclear plant is designed for a wartime situation, Zaporizhzhia's reactors are protected by reinforced concrete containment domes that could withstand an errant shell, experts say. The more immediate concern is that a disruption in the electrical supply could knock out cooling systems essential for the reactors' safe operation. Emergency diesel generators can be unreliable. The pools where spent fuel rods are kept while they cool are also vulnerable to shelling, which could scatter radioactive material. Energoatom confirmed via Telegram: 'The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of [Zaporizhzhia] from the power grid - the first in the history of the plant. 'There are currently no comments on the operation of automation and safety systems. 'Start-up operations are underway to connect one of the power units to the grid.' The dire update came as Ukrainian staff at the nuclear power plant said they are being tortured by FSB agents to prevent them from telling UN safety inspectors about the risks at the site. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are expected to have access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in the coming days. But workers at the occupied plant said they fear Russia will set up false flag attacks for when the IAEA inspectors arrive that they will blame on Ukraine. Continued fighting near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has heightened fears of a Chernobyl-style catastrophe that could affect hundreds of thousands of people. Regional mayor Dmytro Orlov said nearby Russian-occupied town Enerhodar was in the midst of a blackout and residents had no access to running water as a result of the disconnection. Zaporizhzhia has been occupied by Moscow's troops since the first weeks of the war. It has remained on the frontlines ever since, with Moscow and Kyiv trading blame over shelling around the complex. Energoatom said the plant was disconnected from Ukraine's national supply system after a power line was twice disconnected by fires at ash pits in an adjacent thermal power plant. The three other power lines 'were earlier damaged during terrorist attacks' by Russian forces, the operator said. As a result, the two of the plant's six reactors still functioning 'were disconnected from the network'. Kyiv officials have said they believe Moscow has seized the station in order to divert power to the Crimean peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. Energoatom could not be immediately reached for comment on whether the supply had been diverted, AFP reported. Earlier today Energoatom chief Petro Kotin said he has seen Russian engineers' detailed plans to cut off the power plant from Ukraine's power grid and instead connect it to the Russian network in the event that fighting severs the remaining power lines. Kotin feared that Putin's men are now targeting the plant's power lines connecting it to Ukraine's grid to make that scenario a reality, The Guardian reported. If Russia's plan went ahead, he said, it would lead to a catastrophic failure of the cooling systems. External power is essential not just to cool the two reactors still in operation at the Zaporizhzhia site, but also the spent radioactive fuel stored in special facilities onsite. Ukraine claims Russia is essentially holding the Soviet-era nuclear plant hostage, storing weapons there and launching attacks from around it. Kotin feared Russian forces are targeting the plant's power lines that connect the site to Ukraine's grid so that Russia can connect the plant to their power network. He told the newspaper: 'You cannot just switch from one system to another immediately. You have to shutdown everything on one side, and then you start to switch on another side.' Kotin added: 'During this disconnection, the plant won't be connected to any power supply and that is the reason for the danger. If you fail to provide cooling... for one one hour and a half, then you will have melting already.' To add to the safety concerns, shocking video that appears to have been taken from inside the plant has revealed Russian military hardware being inside a turbine hall - just feet away from one of the reactors. Footage emerged last week showing the inside of what looks like a turbo-generator hall, with at least five Russian military trucks parked inside next to a stack of crates. While it is not clear from the footage exactly what the trucks are doing there, they have 'Z' war markings on the hoods and are painted camouflage green - almost certainly meaning they are being used by the Russian armed forces. The video is the clearest evidence that has yet emerged to back Ukrainian assertions that Russia is storing explosives and other military hardware in and around the nuclear reactors, risking a disaster which could blanket Europe in radioactive ash. If the video was indeed taken in a turbo-generator hall - as seems likely from machinery visible in the footage - then it would mean the trucks are just 100ft (30m) from a reactor, putting it at risk in the event of an explosion. Kotin said he is extremely concerned about the risk that these military vehicles could blow up and cause a fire at the site. 'In case there is a fire in the turbine hall you don't even have a possibility to put it out or mitigate the consequences of this fire, because your fire brigades cannot get in, because any entry is blocked by the trucks packed in there,' he said. Kotin added: 'This situation is very dangerous not only for the plant [and] for Ukraine, but also for the whole world because you never can say what the weather would be like and what the wind direction [would be].' One engineer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told The Telegraph that many of their colleagues have been arrested on their way to work. 'Now I understand that their army is weak, but their FSB service is working. 'One of their methods here is to take the control room workers to the basement,' said the engineer, using a Russian word for detention and torture by Russia's secret police. 'Our management keeps silent about it, not to create panic, but people who return after those basement 'conversations' don't say anything at all. 'It will be no surprise if during the mission they will suddenly start saying what they were told to say.' Workers who have left the plant told the newspaper that the workforce has been cut to dangerously low levels while landmines have been placed around the cooling pond. 'It feels like we're in a strict regime prison: constant psychological pressure, no way to contact families as they cut off all communications and banned cell phones,' one said. 'We can't monitor the active equipment of the station because they prohibit movement within the territory at night. They put their equipment in the turbine halls and prohibit passage, it constantly causes conflict between the workers and the Russian troops,' another said. The fear that the ongoing conflict near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant could lead to disaster is palpable just across the Dnieper River in Nikopol, where residents have been under nearly constant Russian shelling since July 12, with eight people killed, 850 buildings damaged and over the half the population of 100,000 fleeing the city. Fighting in early March caused a brief fire at the plant's training complex, which officials said did not result in the release of any radiation. Kyiv told UN nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency that shelling earlier this week damaged transformers at a nearby conventional power plant, disrupting electricity supplies to the Zaporizhzhia plant for several hours. 'These incidents show why the IAEA must be able to send a mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant very soon,' said agency head Rafael Mariano Grossi, adding that he expected that to happen 'within the next few days, if ongoing negotiations succeed'. At a UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday, UN political chief Rosemary DiCarlo urged the withdrawal of all military personnel and equipment from the plant and an agreement on a demilitarised zone around it. Currently only one of the plant's four power lines connecting it to the grid is operational, the agency said. External power is essential not just to cool the two reactors still in operation but also the spent radioactive fuel stored in special facilities onsite. 'If we lose the last one, we are at the total mercy of emergency power generators,' said Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Southern California. If an incident at the Zaporizhzhia plant were to release significant amounts of radiation, the scale and location of the contamination would be determined largely by the weather, said Paul Dorfman, a nuclear safety expert at the University of Sussex who has advised the British and Irish governments. The massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Fukushima plant destroyed cooling systems which triggered meltdowns in three of its reactors. Much of the contaminated material was blown out to sea, limiting the damage. The April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at one of four reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear plant north of Kyiv sent a cloud of radioactive material across a wide swath of Europe and beyond. In addition to fuelling anti-nuclear sentiment in many countries, the disaster left deep psychological scars on Ukrainians."
2022-08-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11148469/Putins-troops-write-Darya-Dugina-ammo-fired-Ukrainians-killed-car-bomb.html,Putin's troops write 'For Darya Dugina' on ammo fired at Ukrainians as they seek to avenge 'Putin's Rasputin' daughter killed in car bomb... which West insists was Russian false flag attack,"Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops have been filmed writing the message 'For Darya Dugina' on shells and grenades before firing a volley of the munitions at Ukrainian forces. Russian soldiers in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine wrote on the ammunition that this was their 'revenge' for Dugina, 29, the daughter of Putin's Rasputin-esque 'guru' advisor who was killed in a car bombing at the weekend. Dugina, whose father Alexander Dugin is a notorious ultranationalist, died in an explosion on a motorway near the village of Bolshiye Vyazyomy just outside the capital on Saturday night. The Kremlin quickly announced the culprit behind the bombing, believed to be intended for Dugin instead, as 43-year-old Ukrainian mother and alleged spy Natalia Shaban-Vovk. But Ukrainian and Western officials, as well as a number of prominent Russian commentators, believe the car bomb was a 'false flag' operation by pro-Kremlin forces in order to frame Ukraine and provide a justification for a further escalation of violence. Video shows Russian forces from the Sparta Battalion in the puppet state of Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine writing 'For Darya Dugina', 'RIP Darya Dugina' and 'RIP girl, we'll avenge you' on shells and grenades. The soldiers are then seen firing the ammunition towards Ukrainian forces. A caption to a video running on Russian pro-war web channels reads: 'For Darya Dugina - fire!' Another reads: 'This is what we've been warning you about. The Nazis will have to long hear Darya's name as messages from our guys fly towards them. 'You will be punished for this crime, dear neighbours.' Russian authorities have pinned the assassination on alleged Ukrainian spy Shaban-Vovk, who they say sneaked into Russia – bringing her 12-year-old daughter with her – and tracked Dugina for weeks before activating the deadly car bomb and fleeing into Estonia, all without being caught. The chain of events leading up to Dugina's death as presented by Russia's security service included Shaban-Vovk changing her appearance and vehicle number plates to hoodwink guards before fleeing from Russia across the Estonian border. The FSB also released what it claimed was the Ukrainian mother's military documents, including a passport-style photo of her. But commentators questioned why Shaban-Vovk, if she is indeed a Ukrainian spy responsible for the killing, would leave her military identification behind and accused Russian authorities of producing a fake to pin the assassination on Ukraine. Russian ultra-right ideologue Alexander Dugin is responsible for shaping the world view of Putin's inner circle. He has called for Ukrainians to be killed and strongly pushed Russia to invade for decades. In his youth, Dugin emerged as a leader of the notorious anti-Semitic Russian nationalist organisation, Pamyat. He founded his own publishing house after the fall of the USSR, going on to win university positions for his writings. Dugin believes that the Russian Orthodox Church was destined to rule as an empire over all of Europe and Asia — uniting all the Russian-speaking peoples into a single state. He laid out his plan for achieving this aim in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics, a text which still has significant influence within Russian elites and has even been used as a textbook by the Russian military. The Russian professor formed the 'Eurasia Party' in 2001, named after the hypothetical state, which also appears in George Orwell's novel 1984. His novel calls for a Russian empire stretching from Dublin to Vladivostok, even calling for parts of China to be conquered. Dugin was dismissed from his position as head of the Department of Sociology of International Relations at Moscow University after arguing for 'people's republics' on the territory of Ukraine. Seven years later, his position would become a reality after the Kremlin annexed the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic out of Ukraine's occupied eastern territories. Dugin called for the annexation of Crimea as far back as 2008, during Russia's war with Georgia. He travelled to the disputed region of South Ossetia, where he was photographed with a rocket launcher. He was also involved with coordinating separatist movements in Ukraine during the 2014 occupation, for which the US sanctioned him. The political scientist claims he also played a key role in reconciling the relationship between Russia and Turkey in 2015 after a Russian warplane was shot down on the Syrian border. Dugin also developed links with far-right and far-left political parties in the European Union, attempting to influence EU policy on Ukraine and Russia. Estonian foreign minister Urmas Reinsalu dismissed the wild claims as a 'Russian information operation'. 'We regard this as one instance of provocation in a very long line of provocations by the Russian Federation, and we have nothing more to say about it at the moment,' said the minister, adding Russia had made no request to extradite the alleged killer. The head of the International Centre for Defence and Security (ICDS) in the Estonian capital Tallinn, Indrek Kannik, claimed that Dugina had far more likely been killed by an internal Russian operation. 'It is possible that this was the FSB's own operation, since these people had become a threat. 'At the same time, it is convenient to blame it on the Ukrainians. Now we are seeing that Estonia can also be dragged in to this.' Ukraine has strongly denied any role in the killing in Moscow, accusing the Kremlin of a 'false flag' operation to blame Kyiv. Meanwhile, respected Russian expert Andrei Piontkovsky said the murder of Dugina was professional, indicating that the Russian secret services are likely involved, while Russian-American historian Dr. Yuri Felshtinsky claimed the attack would have been authorised by the Kremlin. 'The blowing up of the car of the famous Russian fascist and ideologist of the Putin regime, Alexander Dugin, was organised, it seems, by the Russian security services,' said Felshtinsky, author of 'Blowing up Ukraine'. 'On the latest Russian reports, the bomb was attached to Dugin's car inside his guarded compound. Ukraine focuses on military targets, unlike Russia, and there is no discernible gain in attacking one of Putin's media puppets or allocating scarce operatives inside the Russian Federation to such a goal that is meaningless to the liberation of Ukraine. 'The Kremlin will, however, likely exploit it to make it seem as if Ukraine is stooping to its own tactics of bombing harmless civilians in Ukraine.' Seven hours before the assassination on Saturday night, Dugin had issued a vitriolic online post on Telegram saying that the war in Ukraine was now more important than Putin's presidency. Dugin had claimed the war and 'desperate resistance of the Atlanto-Nazi regime in Kyiv' demands from Russia 'internal transformations'. The tone was strongly critical of Putin. 'The Supreme Commander-in-Chief [Putin] said that we haven't really started anything yet. Now we have to start. Whether you want it or not, we'll have to,' the post read. 'Now the question is not whether the government wants or does not want change. Such changes are simply inevitable... The mighty forces of history have come into play, the tectonic plates have shifted. Let the old regime bury its dead. 'A new Russian time is coming. And it's coming irreversibly.' Most international observers remain convinced the assassination was actually carried out by Russian agents who wanted to silence the victim's father. Analyst Yekaterina Shulman says the outpouring of anger among pro-Kremlin commentators in response to the car bomb attack appears suspicious: 'The reaction… was immediate. It looks as if they were waiting for something like this to happen.' Shulman added the killing 'could possibly be used to ramp up some public outrage in the country to justify even more active repressive actions by the state'."
2022-08-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11148237/Ofgem-raises-energy-price-cap-eye-watering-3-549-24-million-households-face-80-bill-hike.html,"Emotional Martin Lewis warns the Big Squeeze could be FATAL for people who can't afford to heat their homes this winter after Ofgem raises energy price cap by 80% to £3,549 - amid fears it could hit £7,200 next spring","Are you going to struggle with energy bills this winter? Please email: james.robinson@mailonline.co.uk Britons could die this winter due to surging energy prices, Martin Lewis warned today after Ofgem confirmed an 80 per cent rise in the price cap - sending the average household's yearly bill from £1,971 to £3,549 from October. The cap announcement today will come into effect for around 24million households in England, Scotland and Wales on default energy tariffs on October 1, and will remain in place until December 31, when it will be adjusted again. The 4.5million pre-payment meter customers across Britain, who are often the most vulnerable and already in fuel poverty, will see an even more punishing increase - with their average annual bill set to go up to £3,608. And things could get even worse next year, with experts at consultancy Auxilione using latest gas prices to predict that the cap will rise by another 52 per cent to £5,405 in January 2023, then by a further 34 per cent to £7,263 in April - before falling slightly, by 11 per cent to £6,485 in July and by another 7 per cent to £6,006 in October. MoneySavingExpert founder Mr Lewis, who became emotional at times while giving passionate interviews to TV and radio shows this morning, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I've been accused of catastrophising over this situation. Well, the reason I have catastrophised is this is a catastrophe, plain and simple. If we do not get further government intervention on top of what was announced in May, lives will be lost this winter.' The consumer champion also said the latest rise in the cap means some people will pay up to £10,000 a year in bills. And he warned that there is no cap on the maximum you pay – but the cap is actually a maximum cost per unit that firms can charge for gas and electricity. Currently, this equates to £1,971 a year for the average home. Ofgem said that from October 1 the equivalent per unit level of the price cap to the nearest pence for a typical customer paying by direct debit will be 52p per kWh for electricity customers and a standing charge of 46p per day. The equivalent per unit level for a typical gas customer is 15p per kWh with a standing charge of 28p per day. As business groups and think tanks offered stark warnings over the crisis throughout the course of today: Ofgem's chief executive Jonathan Brearley warned of the hardship energy prices will cause this winter and urged the incoming prime minister and new Cabinet 'to provide an additional and urgent response to continued surging energy prices'. He also said that the gas price this winter was 15 times more than the cost two years ago. The regulator said the increase reflected the continued rise in global wholesale gas prices, which began to surge as the pandemic eased, and had been driven still higher by Russia slowly switching off gas supplies to Europe. Ofgem also warned that energy prices could get 'significantly worse' next year. The regulator said that some suppliers might start increasing the amount that direct debit customers pay before October 1, to spread out payments, but any money taken by suppliers will only ever be spent on supplying energy to households. Philippe Commaret, the managing director of energy giant EDF, has warned that half of UK households could be in fuel poverty in January as a result of rocketing prices. And the Trades Union Congress has said energy bills will rise 35 times faster than wages and 57 times faster than benefits in the last three months of this year. Which? has urged the Government to raise its energy bills discount by at least 150 per cent or risk pushing millions of people into financial distress. The consumer watchdog said Ministers' financial support for all households must increase from the current £400 to £1,000 - or from £67 to £167 per month from October to March. However, no immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 after the Tory leadership contest. Miss Truss pledged 'immediate support' to help with soaring bills if she becomes prime minister, saying she would use an emergency budget next month to 'ensure support is on its way to get through these tough times'. Miss Truss and her rival Mr Sunak have also both pledged to continue a £15billion support package unveiled in June. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the increase in the cap would cause 'stress and anxiety' for people but that the Government was working to develop more options to support households. He also blamed Russian president Vladimir Putin for 'driving up energy prices in revenge for our support of Ukraine's brave struggle for freedom'. He also suggested people could need to ration energy, saying: 'The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption. It is a difficult time. There is war on our continent. Very few people anticipated war. Wars happen in far-flung places. It is now here with us. We have to remain resilient. My responsibility is to deliver that help.' The charity National Energy Action said the number of UK households in fuel poverty will have doubled in a year when the October cap rise takes effect. It calculates that 8.9million homes will be in fuel poverty from October - up from 4.5 million last October – and also takes into account the Government's support package revealed in May. Mr Lewis has said the rise in the price cap means some people will pay up to £10,000 a year in bills. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain the situation is a 'genuine social and financial catastrophe that is putting lives at risk'. He went on: 'I'm noticing many media organisations saying that the price cap is £3,549 a year - that isn't correct. The price cap is actually a cap on the standing charges and unit rates that you pay, they have gone up by around 80 per cent. What is the energy price cap? The energy price cap decides the maximum cost per unit that energy companies can charge for both gas and electricity. This is then used to calculate a typical annual bill. The price cap was introduced in January 2019 as a way to ensure that households who do not have fixed deals - and who are, in some cases, less financially savvy - are not ripped off by their energy suppliers. Twice a year, energy regulator Ofgem would set the maximum price that households on their supplier's default tariff would have to pay for every unit of gas and electricity they used for the next six months. It allowed for a small profit - capped at 1.9 per cent - that energy suppliers were permitted to take for supplying the service. The frequency of the cap was increased on August 4 from every six to every three months. How is the price cap calculated? The cap is calculated by Ofgem based on the wholesale price of gas and electricity and also includes allowances for tax, charges paid to the energy networks, green levies and social payments. What is happening to the price cap? The price cap is going up significantly. The 80 per cent rise announced today - which comes into force from October 1 - will push the cap to £3,549 per year for the average household. This is the highest it has ever been. Can my bills be higher than the price cap? Experts warn there is no cap on the maximum households pay – but the cap is actually a maximum cost per unit that firms can charge for gas and electricity. The actual cap for each home therefore varies according to use. Ofgem said that from October 1 the equivalent per unit level of the price cap to the nearest pence for a typical customer paying by direct debit will be 52p per kWh for electricity customers and a standing charge of 46p per day. The equivalent per unit level for a typical gas customer is 15p per kWh with a standing charge of 28p per day. Why is the price cap going up? The price cap on energy bills is linked to the wholesale price of gas and electricity, which is itself based on what happens on European markets. The wholesale price of gas has soared by around eightfold in the last year. That rise has been passed onto customers in increments - the price cap was already at a record £1,971 over the summer. Gas prices were already increasing last summer as demand bounced as countries emerged from lockdown but the situation was made much worse when Russia invaded Ukraine and started to restrict gas exports to Europe. Gas prices are also decisive for electricity prices, because gas is so important for the generation of electricity. Over the last year, 42 per cent of the UK's electricity came from burning gas. Ofgem said the increase reflected the continued rise in global wholesale gas prices, which began to surge as the world unlocked from the Covid pandemic, and had been driven still higher to record levels by Russia's actions. When will the price cap change again? The price cap will be changed again in January 2023. It used to be changed twice a year, but changes announced on August 4 mean it will be reviewed every three months. It will change again in April, July and October 2023. What is the price cap likely to be like next year? Experts expect the cap to rise significantly in January 2023 and again in April, and then to fall back again in July and October next year - but the exact levels of the cap remains to be seen. Experts at Cornwall Insight expect the cap to hit £5,387 in January 2023, while those at consultancy Auxilione think it will hit £5,405. In April, Cornwall expects a £6,616 cap, while Auxilione believe it could reach £7,263. There is then an expectation that the price will fall. Cornwall's forecasts for the July and October 2023 caps are £5,897 and £5,887 respectively, while Auxilione expects it to reach £6,485 and £6,006. What does the new price cap mean for monthly bills? Experts at Uswitch estimate that monthly bills in October, November and December this year will hit between £243 and £513 a month, depending on the size of the home and usage, and based on the October price cap. They say 'low user groups' are usually one or two people living in a one to two-bedroom flat, who are at home in the evenings and weekends and have a weekly laundry cycle. They also use the heating occasionally and don't use a dishwasher or tumble dryer. These people are likely to spend around £243 a month on energy bills from October. Then, 'medium user groups' are typically families of three or four people living in a three-bedroom house. Some members are home in the day as well as in the evening and weekends. The heating is used regularly, and electrical appliances are often turned on. Laundry is done three times a week. Their average energy bill is likely to be £363. Finally, 'high user groups' tend to be large families with five or more living together in a four-bedroom house or larger. There is always someone at home in the day and and in the evenings and on weekends. There could be multiple television in use as well as a tumble dryer and dishwasher which are used regularly. Laundry is done daily. These groups are likely to face a bill of £513 a month from October. What is the cap's purpose? When Theresa May's government introduced the cap in January 2019, the aim was to protect households against profiteering energy giants. It would also, in theory, protect customers against sudden increases in bills. More recently, Ofgem has allowed the cap to rise in a way that protects energy firms from going bust amid the soaring cost of wholesale gas and therefore electricity. The effect is that bills are rising more sharply, and more often, to ensure suppliers can cover the spike in the wholesale prices of gas and electricity, which are around ten times higher than normal. Who is affected by the price cap? The new cap will come into effect for around 24million households in England, Scotland and Wales on default energy tariffs on October 1, and will remain in place until December 31, when it will be adjusted again. A few million people are on long-term fixed rates - which are not affected by the cap. However, many of these deals are expiring in the next few months. What is the cheapest way of paying for energy? Paying by direct debit tends to be the cheapest way of paying for electricity and gas, because energy companies normally provide a discount for those using this method as it reduces their costs and administration time. What about those on pre-payment meters? The 4.5million pre-payment meter customers, who are often the most vulnerable and already in fuel poverty, will see an even more punishing increase, with their average annual bill set to go up to £3,608. What support is available for you? It depends on your personal situation. All households have been promised a £400 discount on their energy bills. This support was announced in May, and will be paid in six monthly payments from October. For direct debit customers this will be taken off their payments, while prepayment meter customers will be given discount vouchers from the first week of every month. These will be issued by text, email or by post. Eight million of the most vulnerable households will also get extra support, taking the total they can get to £1,200. These include a £650 one-off payment to households on means-tested benefits, a £300 payment to pensioners, and £150 for six million people who receive disability benefits. Will the Government announce more support? Charities, think tanks, opposition parties and potential future prime ministers have said the Government will need to do more for struggling households. But extra support will have to wait until the next prime minister is in place. Consumer watchdog Which? has said the Government's financial support for all households must increase from the current £400 to £1,000 - or from £67 to £167 per month from October to March. However, no immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 after the Tory leadership contest. The current Government has said that it is exploring the options and will present them to the new prime minister when he or she comes into office next month. 'The figure that's quoted, the £3,549, is what the cap would be for someone who has typical usage - of course, most people don't have typical usage, they're more or less. 'That means there is no maximum amount that you can pay for gas or electricity. 'You could easily be paying £5,000 or £10,000 a year if you have high usage. 'I worry terribly for some of those who have disabled children or disabilities themselves who need lots of electrical equipment to keep their houses warm because of medical conditions.' He also said energy prices will be 'unaffordable' this winter. Mr Lewis said: 'The prediction now in January is up another 51 per cent on top of where we are now and that would take a typical bill and direct debit to £5,386 a year. 'And that is not such a crystal ball prediction because we are seven months through the 10-month assessment period for the January price cap. 'So if we look at the totality across the winter, from October until March, you are probably talking on typical use an average bill of over £4,400 a year, typical pro rata - it is totally unaffordable.' He also said a movement to refuse to pay energy bills is 'growing', as he called on the next Prime Minister to spend billions to solve the crisis. Mr Lewis told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I think the Don't Pay movement is growing. There are dangers to being in the Don't Pay movement as an individual. 'All I can say is what would happen in a typical case scenario where an individual refused to pay - what is far more difficult to predict is if there is a massive movement not to pay. 'I think what is safest for me to say is while I think it should have come earlier, my hope is on September 5 there will be a new Prime Minister. We've heard from both the candidates, but they seem to indicate they understand the scale of the crisis - what we need to hear is concrete solutions. 'And let's be absolutely plain: there are many methods that you can put in place to alleviate and mitigate some of the terrible damage that the rising energy prices are causing. 'So I'm going to be agnostic over the solution, but it will involve spending substantial amounts, billions of pounds of Government money, to stop some of the most vulnerable and many middle income earners from having some terrible choices to make this winter. We have to hope that will be in place. 'And I suspect if it isn't in place, then people coming from the Don't Pay movement are going to become a louder voice in this country.' Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Government will announce 'extra cash' in September to support households during the energy crisis. Speaking on a visit to South West London Elective Orthopaedic Centre in Surrey, he said: 'Of course, we could see this coming (energy bills rising) and that's why we've put the steps in place that we already have. 'And don't forget that, although there will be more announcements next month, more cash coming from September onwards, you shouldn't forget that the pipeline of cash stretches out throughout the autumn. 'So, there's going to be another £650 coming for every one of the eight million most vulnerable households in October. 'In November, another £300 to help every pensioner, £150 extra for everybody who is entitled to disability benefits. On top of what we're doing with Universal Credit and the living wage, lifting both of those up.' He added: 'There's a pipeline of cash coming through over the next few months and through the autumn and the winter. But that is clearly now going to be augmented, increased, by extra cash that the Government is plainly going to be announcing in September.' Mr Johnson also said he does not think the Government should 'cap the whole thing' for 'the richest households in the country'. He said: 'We want to target the households so most of the money will go to the eight million most-vulnerable households, that's the right thing to do. A lot of money will be going to absolutely everybody. 'What don't think we should be doing is trying to cap the whole thing for absolutely everybody, the richest households in the country. This will go on for a few months and it will go on over the winter. 'And it will be tough - and I'd be very clear about that - but in the end, we are also putting in the measures we need to ensure that we have the energy independence to get through this. 'And we are putting in more nuclear, and we are putting in more wind power. We have already seen a 26 per cent increase in British gas now from the North Sea.' And Mr Johnson said that eventually energy bills will come down as Vladimir Putin's ability to 'exercise leverage over us and the rest of the world will diminish'. The Prime Minister told broadcasters: 'I think that we will do everything we can to help. 'We want to make sure that we get people through the next few months, and we can, and we will because we took the right steps. We have a big, big package of help and support. 'But the message I want to get over to people is that I'm afraid that there's a global spike in energy costs driven by Putin's aggression in Ukraine. 'Putin's position, Putin's ability to blackmail, to exercise leverage over us and over the rest of the world will diminish week by week, month by month, and we will get through this and in the end, we will be in a much better position. 'The other side will have more of our own UK energy to rely on, and the bills will eventually come down. But Sir Keir Starmer has said it is 'absolutely unforgivable' that the Government is 'missing in action' during the cost-of-living crisis. The Labour Party leader asked Mr Johnson 'where are you?'. He told reporters: 'I do think the Government has to take responsibility in a situation like this. 'But on the cost of living crisis you've got a Prime Minister who insisted on staying in office, recognises there's a problem with energy prices, shrugs his shoulders and does nothing about it. 'You've got two leadership candidates who are fighting with each other about how appalling they have been in government, but neither has come up with any plan to deal with this problem. Unforgivable.' Sir Keir added: 'My challenge for the Government is where are you? Join us in this challenge and do something about it because at the moment being missing in action is absolutely unforgivable.' Sir Keir has also not ruled out Labour's £30 billion plan to tackle the cost of living needing to be adjusted to a higher amount. The Labour Party leader was asked if his plan to freeze energy prices, unveiled last week, could more than triple in cost to £100billion if utility bills keep soaring into next spring. He said: 'What we've got is a fully costed, comprehensive plan for this winter which will freeze those prices - that is welcome news to so many people who are worried sick today.' But Sir Keir added: 'I accept that in April, May next year we need to look forward then to the proposals in place. 'That's why I've said, alongside our plan, we need medium and long-term solutions. We need to be much more self-sufficient when it comes to energy.' Sir Keir reiterated his call, made a year ago, for a 'national mission to insulate homes'. Miss Truss, the frontrunner in the Tory leadership contest, has insisted that she will 'ensure people get the support needed' in the coming months after the rise. A Truss campaign spokesman said: 'Today's announcement will cause grave concern to many people across the UK who will be worried about paying their bills. 'As Prime Minister, Liz would ensure people get the support needed to get through these tough times. She will immediately take action to put more money back in people's pockets by cutting taxes and suspending green energy tariffs. 'This is on top of ongoing work such as the Energy Bills Support Scheme, which will see a £400 discount paid to consumers from October, and the £1,200 package of support for the most vulnerable. 'Liz will work flat-out to deliver long term energy affordability and security, unleashing more energy by maximising our North Sea oil and gas production - helping keep bills down in the future.' And former chancellor Mr Sunak called surging energy bills the 'most pressing challenge' facing the UK. 'I've said that consistently, and as chancellor I announced significant support to help people. But the situation has deteriorated and as prime minister, I would go further. 'My priority is to protect the most vulnerable in society, including pensioners, and I want them to have certainty that extra help is coming - that is what I would put in place. 'Alternative plans, which are doing different things - borrowing tens of billions for permanent, unfunded tax cuts - don't actually do anything to help those most in need, risk making inflation worse and putting our nation's finances at risk as well.' He said his plan was the 'right one' for the country. Mr Sunak also said that protecting people from rising energy bills will be his 'immediate priority' as prime minister. He said that people can judge him on his 'track record' as chancellor, pointing to the package of supports he announced for people to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. Electric vehicle (EV) owners will be badly hit by the energy price cap rise, new analysis shows. The RAC said the cost of a full charge at home for an EV with a 64-kilowatt hour battery - such as a Kia e-Niro - will be £33.80 under the new cap which comes into force on October 1. That is compared with £18.37 under the current cap, and £13.69 for last winter's price limit. The figures represent the cost when using a seven-kilowatt charger. EVs have soared in popularity in recent months, ahead of the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the UK from 2030. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show there was a 50% increase in registrations of pure electric cars during the first seven months of the year compared with the same period in 2021. RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said: 'The impact of the energy price cap increase will certainly be felt by drivers who charge their electric cars at home, with a full charge of a typical family-sized electric SUV costing 84% more from 1 October than it does under the current cap. 'Despite recent falls in the price of petrol and diesel, the cost of charging at home is still good value compared to paying for either fuel, but again underlines just how the rising cost of electricity is affecting so many areas of people's lives. 'We're also aware that public chargepoint operators are having no choice but to increase their prices to reflect the rising wholesale costs they're faced with, which will heavily impact drivers who have no choice other than to charge up away from home. 'The RAC continues to support the FairCharge's campaign for the Government to cut the VAT rate levied on electricity from public charge points to 5%, to mirror the rate charged on domestic electricity.' Ben Nelmes, co-founder and head of policy at green consultancy New AutoMotive, said: 'Even with rising electricity prices, EVs will continue to be much cheaper to run than petrol or diesel cars. 'There are still great offers for EV electricity tariffs to further reduce the cost of charging. 'EVs can and should be part of the solution to the cost-of-living crisis.' 'It was acknowledged as being commensurate with the scale of the challenge, targeted at the people most in need,' Mr Sunak told broadcasters. 'That is my track record in grappling with this issue. I moved quickly as chancellor and this will be my immediate priority as prime minister and I'd like to try and do the same thing and make sure that we protect the most vulnerable as much as we can from this significant increase in bills.' Ofgem's Mr Brearley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he knew the increase in the cap would come as 'devastating' news for struggling households. He called on the Government and the next prime minister to take urgent action. He said: 'I know this will be devastating for many families, when they hear how much their energy bills are going to go up. We have done and looked at everything we can do as a regulator to address this figure. 'There's a number of things we do to make sure that companies treat their vulnerable customers well. There's a number of vulnerability schemes that we run. But the truth is this is beyond the capacity of the regulator and the industry to address. 'So what we are saying today is, look we have 10 days now until we have a new administration, have a new prime minister and a new ministerial team. What I am clear about is the prime minister with his or her ministerial team will need to act urgently and decisively to address this.' Mr Brearley also said the Government would need to add to the support it announced in May when bills were only expected to jump to £2,800. 'The Government support package is delivering help right now, but it's clear the new prime minister will need to act further to tackle the impact of the price rises that are coming in October and next year,' he added. 'We are working with ministers, consumer groups and industry on a set of options for the incoming prime minister that will require urgent action. 'The response will need to match the scale of the crisis we have before us. With the right support in place and with regulator, government, industry and consumers working together, we can find a way through this.' He added: 'The price of energy has reached record levels driven by an aggressive economic act by the Russian state. They have slowly and deliberately turned off the gas supplies to Europe causing harm to our households, businesses and wider economy. Ofgem has no choice but to reflect these cost increases in the price cap.' Mr Brearley also said that the gas price this winter was 15 times more than the cost two years ago. He told BBC Breakfast: 'When I look at what... gas now costs this winter, it is 15 times the normal price that we were expected to pay two years ago. 'Now if that were happening in petrol, it would cost us £400 to £500 just to fill up our car. So because those costs are changing, the price needs to change and that's why the price cap is now changing to £3,549'. When asked why Ofgem was not protecting the consumer by having a lower price cap, he said: 'The reason we don't have a lower price cap is because if the companies cannot recover the amount of money it costs for them to buy the energy, then ultimately, they will be unable to function.' 'They would have been unable to give us the energy that we need. So what the price cap does, and this is really important, it stops those companies charging excess profits over and above the cost of energy. The energy price cap could top £7,000 next year, experts warned for the first time, as Ofgem announced the highest cap on record. The energy regulator said that the price cap for the average household would increase by 80 per cent to £3,549 for the three months starting in October. But experts at energy consultancy Auxilione warned that the cap could double even from that record high by April next year, hitting £7,263. The prediction is based on the current cost of buying energy on global markets and also sees bills hitting £5,405 in January. Fellow consultants at Cornwall Insight are a little more optimistic. Their model expects the cap to only reach £5,387 in January and then £6,616 from April. Both consultancies then expect bills to fall by between £700 to £800 in July when compared to the April cap. It is the grimmest forecast yet from the two outfits, whose predictions for October's price cap were close to Ofgem's decision. Auxilione's final forecast was just £27 above what the cap was set at, while Cornwall Insight's prediction was £5 above. The predictions are largely based on what gas prices are doing at the moment, so are subject to a lot of change between now and January, let alone before April. 'While there is still some time until the January and April caps are set, the energy crisis is showing no sign of abating,' said Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight. 'A key focus for the next Prime Minister and for Ofgem must be protecting consumers, and the wider economy from the impact of this rise,' he added. 'There are several avenues that can be explored including a review and expansion of the current support package of at least £400 per household. 'However, all of these are temporary solutions and must be accompanied by a focus on implementing a viable long-term solution.' He said that the purpose of the price cap is being undermined by the unprecedented rises in bills that are hitting households. 'Throughout the energy crisis, the Government and Ofgem have remained committed to the cap, and in its ability to shield consumers from a volatile energy market. 'However, the cap was never meant to be a permanent solution, it was created for a different energy market than the one we face today and has not protected consumers from what will be incredible hardship this winter.' 'But what it can not do is set a price that is less than the cost of the energy that we buy, and that's why we have to make the change that we are making today.' Mr Brearley added that it was 'devastating news' for many families. He also said that 'there are no easy answers' to the energy crisis. He told Good Morning Britain: 'Genuinely, there are no easy answers, but there are some big decisions that ultimately ministers will need to make.' He added: 'To be honest I never imagined when I took this role that I would have to make an announcement that we made today.' When asked about senior people in the energy industry receiving bonuses, he urged them to 'be thoughtful' about their pay and remuneration. He said: 'For example, the senior Ofgem team has given away any bonuses to charity because we recognise the situation that we are in right now.' The boss of Ofgem also said the regulator has had countless meetings with the current Government, and called on the next prime minister to take decisions to 'match the scale of the problem'. 'This is a major issue for the country next year. This is a major set of decisions that the new government will need to make, that the new prime minister and his or her ministerial team will need to make,' Mr Brearley said on a call with reporters. He added: 'It's not for me to comment on the proposals that are out there for politicians. My point is very simple, it is going to need to be taken urgently and it's going to need to be decisive. 'And it's going to need to match the scale of the problem that we see - which version of that that the Government chooses to pursue really is a matter for them.' The Confederation of British Industry said the scale of Government help needs to be 'urgently reviewed'. 'Government must also step up and deliver a national energy efficiency programme that will help reduce household bills as soon as this winter,' said Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief policy director. And the trade body for energy suppliers in the UK has said the charges its members will be forced to pass onto households will be 'simply unaffordable', after Ofgem hiked the cap. 'This rise, while widely predicted, will be hugely worrying to customers. We know many customers are already struggling with energy bills and other costs and for millions of households, these latest increases will be simply unaffordable,' Energy UK's director of regulation Dan Alchin said. 'The rise is driven by the cost of buying gas on the wholesale market, which has been at record levels for about a year now - with prices this week 10 times what they were before the crisis. 'These costs are out of the control of energy retail suppliers who need to recoup them, otherwise we risk more going out of business in addition to the 30 that have done so since last August - causing huge cost and disruption to customers. 'However bills of this size were unimaginable a few months ago and we cannot expect customers to bear the brunt. 'Retail suppliers will continue to do all they can to offer help and support, especially to their most vulnerable customers, but faced with bill increases of this size and the numbers of customers who will need support, it won't be enough. 'The Government must step in urgently and put in place further support for this winter and with energy costs likely to remain high for the foreseeable future, look at ways to keep bills down next year as well - as we outlined in our letter to the Chancellor last week.' Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of Energy UK, said the new price cap will be 'really scary' for a lot of people and businesses across the country. She told Sky News: 'This is a crisis that has been caused by the international gas market and so we need to tackle that at a systemic level, as well as making sure that people have urgent help right now.' She added: 'We need something that is broad-brush that supports vulnerable people and really tackles what will be a massive cost-of-living crisis, but also something that helps middle income households and the wider economy.' Addressing politicians, she said: 'This is bigger than you think that it is. This is a whole-economy problem. This is urgent and we need to do more than you think that you need to do, and you need to do it now.' By JASON GROVES FOR THE DAILY MAIL Liz Truss today pledges 'immediate support' to help with soaring power bills if she becomes prime minister. The price cap was raised to more than £3,500 per household today – almost treble the figure a year ago. Analysts say bills could rise by a further £1,000 in January, with more pain in April as Vladimir Putin 'weaponises' his gas resources. But writing in the Daily Mail, Miss Truss says she would use an emergency budget next month to 'ensure support is on its way to get through these tough times'. Energy firms warn that millions of families may be unable to pay their bills this winter without government help. And business leaders predict that many firms will go under unless action is taken to rein in their exorbitant power costs. Miss Truss and her rival for No 10, Rishi Sunak, have both pledged to continue a £15billion support package unveiled in June. But the Foreign Secretary today indicates she will go significantly further to ease the squeeze on cash-strapped homes. She says Britain is facing 'extraordinarily difficult economic times', as a result of stagnant growth, high taxes and Russia 'using gas supply as a weapon'. But she claims she can 'chart a confident course through this economic storm' and stave off a recession with her tax-cutting agenda. 'The impact on our cost of living is clear at the supermarket checkout, at the petrol pump and on our latest energy bills,' she writes. 'I know how hard it is for millions of Britons, and how grave concerns are about the consequences of today's decision by Ofgem on the next energy price cap. The rest of Europe is facing the same challenge, which will loom large as winter sets in. 'If I am elected leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister, I will take decisive action on entering No 10 to provide immediate support, but will also tackle the root causes of these issues so we are never again in this difficult position. To those of you feeling the squeeze, my message is clear: I will ensure support is on its way and we get through these tough times.' In today's article, Miss Truss says she will press ahead with her plan to slash taxes, with cuts expected to both national insurance and corporation tax in next month's 'fiscal event'. And she stresses the need to push for growth and avoid a recession that would take a 'terrible toll'. Miss Truss has already pledged a suspension of green levies on energy, taking around £150 off bills. She gives few details today of what additional help she is planning – or how much cash she is prepared to devote to the crisis – saying she has yet to see options being drawn up by the Treasury for the incoming prime minister. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who is tipped to be her chancellor, has held talks with energy bosses about a £100billion plan to freeze bills for two years. But insiders played down the prospect of it being approved. Government sources said the Treasury was working up options for providing short-term help, allowing the new PM to 'hit the ground running'. These include increases in the winter fuel allowance for pensioners, targeted help to those on low incomes through the Warm Homes Discount Scheme or a general rebate on energy bills. Mr Sunak yesterday indicated he would offer further support to pensioners and low income households if he won, along with cutting VAT on energy bills. But he warned against Miss Truss's plans for 'unfunded' tax cuts, saying that tackling inflation had to be the priority. Mr Zahawi said Ministers were working to develop more options to support households amid the price cap rise. 'I know the energy price cap announcement this morning will cause stress and anxiety for many people, but help is coming with £400 off energy bills for all, the second instalment of a £650 payment for vulnerable households, and £300 for all pensioners,' he said. 'While Putin is driving up energy prices in revenge for our support of Ukraine's brave struggle for freedom, I am working flat out to develop options for further support. 'This will mean the incoming prime minister can hit the ground running and deliver support to those who need it most, as soon as possible.' He also said the Government knows it has 'got to do more' to support households through the energy crisis. The Chancellor also indicated that the crisis would not be temporary, suggesting that it could last well into next year. He said that help from the Government is coming but admitted: 'We know that's not enough. We've got to do more.' 'We need to make sure that this isn't a sticking plaster, that for the long term we continue to help the most vulnerable who have no cushion. And that's what I'm determined to do. 'And we're working up those options for both households and for business for the incoming prime minister on the 5th of September to take those decisions. 'So my message today is we'll get this £37 billion to people to help them for now, and then more will be coming because we know this will continue in January and of course on to April and next year and we have to remain resilient.' He also said that his aim is to make sure vulnerable UK households are 'resilient through next year'. The Chancellor declined to give specifics about what a package of funding might look like, but insisted that the Treasury was working on proposals to present to the next Prime Minister. Mr Zahawi is not expected to retain his portfolio if frontrunner Miss Truss wins the contest to replace Boris Johnson. 'We know we need to do more because actually the most vulnerable households have no cushion, have nothing available to them,' he told broadcasters. 'So what I'm looking at is how I can target that help for those people, not just to January, but we need to make sure that we're resilient through next year. 'More help is on its way because we know that the most vulnerable households need that additional help. And I'm doing the work to make sure that that will be in place throughout next year.' In addition, the Chancellor denied that there was a lack of action from Government amid the Tory leadership contest. It was put to him by broadcasters that it was 'intolerable' to 'leave people in the dark' at the moment. Mr Zahawi said: 'That sounds like we're not acting on this.' Setting out the work of his team over the last month, he said: 'We know (Vladimir) Putin has now worked out that actually this is quite a potent lever. You look at what's happening in Germany and the rest of Europe. 'We need to make sure there's more support. My preference is for it to be targeted. 'Why? Because it will give us a much longer, more leeway, to be able to face down Putin and send a very important message to him that this is not going to work.' And the Chancellor suggested that the public does now need to look at how they use energy. Speaking to broadcasters, Mr Zahawi was asked if people should start reducing their energy use. He said: 'The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption. It is a difficult time. There is war on our continent. 'Very few people anticipated war. Wars happen in far-flung places. It is now here with us. We have to remain resilient. My responsibility is to deliver that help.' On Wednesday, Mr Zahawi insisted 'nothing is off the table' when it comes energy bills, but added that a freeze in the price cap would not deliver 'targeted help' for those who need it most. Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves tweeted today: 'This is incredibly worrying and will strike fear in the heart of many families. We cannot wait any longer to act. Many households are facing the stark reality of being unable to afford their energy bills this winter. Consumers are currently hearing a lot about options for handling their bills, ranging from asking for help from their supplier to refusing to pay at all. Here we look at the pros and cons of each, and where to turn for advice and help. - The 'Don't Pay' option The 'Don't Pay' group describes itself as 'a grassroots movement demanding a fair price for energy for everyone'. More than 100,000 people have signed up to support a pledge to cancel their direct debits if the Government and energy firms 'refuse to act' by October 1. However, refusing to pay has serious consequences and households are strongly advised against taking this option - no matter how difficult their financial situation might be. If you are on a pre-payment meter, failing to pay will mean your supply being cut off. If you are on a regular or smart meter and you do not reach an agreement with your supplier before cancelling your direct debit, the firm may try to force you to have a pre-payment meter installed. This means you will have to pay for your energy usage upfront and a weekly payment to cover any debts - which can be as high as 90% of energy top-ups and 100% of electricity top-ups. Pre-payment customers also pay more than others. The current energy price cap is £1,971 for households with a standard meter, but £46 higher at £2,017 for those on a pre-payment meter. Failure to reach an agreement with your supplier may also result in them applying for a court warrant so they can visit your home and disconnect your energy supply. This can be done remotely if you have a smart meter, but your energy company must visit you to identify and assess your situation. An Ofgem spokeswoman said: 'We know that people are under huge pressure, but we do not think it's in consumers' best interest to not pay their bills, and most leading charities and consumer groups agree. 'The knock-on effects of not paying bills can be huge for people. They could lose their direct debit discounts or be forced to move to a pre-payment meter. It could also damage their credit rating.' - Moving off direct debits to paying for what you use - or a 'standing order' As households' monthly direct debits soar by hundreds of pounds, many are considering stopping them and paying for the energy they actually use in three-month chunks in the form of a standing order. While this may give a sense of control, anyone paying on receipt of a three-monthly bill for actual usage will pay considerably more than direct debit customers as almost all providers add a discount for direct debit payments. Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy for Citizens Advice, said: 'Paying as you go can give you more control over the amount you pay, but you might pay more for that control. It's unlikely that you would save money by moving to pay-as-you-go, because you can't spread your costs over a year.' - Direct debits remain the best option Despite sickening increases, staying on a direct debit plan remains the most cost-effective option for paying for your energy. However, customers have the right to challenge any increase that goes above the increased price cap - Ofgem is carefully monitoring this and has already warned firms that direct debits must be set correctly and they must 'clearly communicate any changes in a way that helps consumers understand their payments'. - I'm really struggling, where can I turn? You should first contact your supplier and notify them that you want to pay off your debt through a payment plan. They should discuss your options with you and come to an agreement. When coming to an agreement, your supplier should consider what you can afford to pay based on your income, outgoings, and any other debts you have. They will also consider how much energy you are likely to use in the future by looking at your past usage. To ensure your energy bill is accurate, send your supplier readings from your gas and electricity meter. It is very important to resist, if at all possible, being moved on to a pre-payment meter as this is the least cost-effective way of paying for energy. Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: 'We strongly encourage anyone concerned about being able to pay rising energy bills to speak to their supplier as energy firms have a duty to agree a payment plan that households can afford. 'Depending on the supplier, customers can ask for a review of their payments, a reduction in or break from their payments, more time to pay or access to hardship funds.' 'This is a national emergency. The Tories must freeze energy bills now so households don't pay a penny more in winter.' She also said in a statement that the Government must choose between letting families suffer, or stop the oncoming rise. 'Today's announcement will strike fear in the heart of many families, and force many to make unthinkable choices this winter. The Tories now face an urgent choice. 'They can carry on letting oil and gas companies make huge profits whilst every family suffers with bills rising this winter. Or they can act now and stop the energy price cap rising, by bringing in a windfall tax on those oil and gas profits. 'People deserve a government that can meet the scale of this national emergency - not this spectacle of a Tory leadership race or a Prime Minister that put his out of office on months ago. 'Labour is on your side, and our fully-funded plan to freeze the price cap will make sure households don't pay a penny more this winter, saving you £1,000. 'Our mission for home grown renewable energy and to insulate 19 million homes will keep bills down for the long term too.' Appearing on BBC Breakfast, Ms Reeves urged the Government to act to protect the public from soaring energy bills. She accused ministers of being nowhere to be seen on the morning of the announcement. The Labour MP said people are 'worried sick' about what is happening and is 'striking fear in the hearts of families right across the country'. She called on the Government to freeze energy fills and follow Labour's own proposals. She said: 'The fact that no Government minister is available to come on your programme today is just appalling. They are not here to give assurances they are not here to set out what they are going to do. That is a dereliction of duty.' Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said that rise in the cap is 'nothing short of a catastrophe' for millions of households. 'The only option is for energy prices to be frozen before these rises wreak havoc on our communities. Then we need a proper plan to be put in place to bring bills down next year,' he said. 'As millions suffer the Conservatives do nothing. No policy from the government, no plan from Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak. They have no idea how much pain these energy prices will cause our country. They are simply unfit to govern.' Chairman of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, Darren Jones, also warned 'many businesses will face bankruptcy because there is no price cap on their energy bills'. 'The scale of the challenge will mean that the next chancellor will have to offer business grants and not just temporary tax and business rate cuts,' the Labour MP said. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the energy price cap rise is 'simply unaffordable for millions' and must be cancelled. And Scotland's Energy Secretary Michael Matheson said the increase is 'unsustainable' and warned it would push millions into fuel poverty. Ms Sturgeon said the rise should not be allowed to happen. She tweeted: 'This is simply unaffordable for millions. It cannot be allowed to go ahead. 'This rise must be cancelled, with the UK gov and energy companies then agreeing a package to fund the cost of a freeze over a longer period, coupled with fundamental reform of the energy market.' Mr Matheson told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme households were already struggling with the cap increase in April this year, and that 'increasing it by another 80 per cent is simply unsustainable.' He said: 'It will force quite literally millions of households into fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty and is unsustainable.' In a statement issued after the increase was confirmed today, Mr Matheson called on the UK Government to act. He said: 'Today's price cap announcement and increase imposes a burden that customers simply cannot be expected to carry. 'The only acceptable course of action now is for the UK Government, who have the necessary policy levers and borrowing powers at their disposal, to take immediate steps to cancel the increase for all households.' Mr Matheson added: 'No single government, company or organisation can solve this crisis alone. It requires a collective response commensurate to the situation. 'We will continue to work with our partners, energy companies and stakeholders to do everything we can to help the people of Scotland through this deeply unsettling time. 'We will also continue to press the UK Government to reform the energy market to prevent this situation occurring again in the future.' Mr Matheson said the Scottish Government is treating the situation as a 'public emergency' and has prepared a £1.2 million package to enable the immediate expansion of energy advice services. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton called for energy prices to be frozen. Mr Sarwar said: 'This eye-watering price hike risks plunging millions of people into fuel poverty. This is a national emergency and our governments have a moral duty to act.' Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: 'This energy price rise will be devastating for hundreds of thousands of Scottish families and pensioners already struggling to make ends meet.' ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson, said: 'The size and scale of this issue is truly catastrophic for UK households and that's why only a big solution can tackle it once and for all to shelter people from the worst this winter. 'We have offered the Government a plan, backed by the industry, that can be delivered this year, tailored in line with their priorities and will support the UK economy - with the cap set at £3,549, what billpayers need now is to hear what additional help is coming.' Richard Neudegg, director of regulation at Uswitch.com, said: 'Here is the signal that the summer holidays are over. After seemingly endless predictions, the true magnitude of the October energy price cap is now clear. 'Ofgem has rubber-stamped the letters from suppliers that will now start landing on millions of doorsteps informing customers of exactly how much they'll need to pay for their energy as we go into winter. Millions of hard-up families could save hundreds of pounds on their energy bills this winter in a few simple steps without making their homes any colder, experts have said. Record-breaking energy prices are likely to affect many over the next few months as Ofgem hiked its energy price cap today. Experts warn that worse is to come when the cap is updated in January. But two small changes to the way your boiler works could save up to 18 per cent, or around £324, according to experts at the Heating Hub, which provides advice on energy efficiency. - Turning down your flow temperature The flow temperature on a boiler regulates how hot the water is when it leaves the boiler to go to your radiators. Most condensing combi boilers in the UK are still set to their factory setting, which tends to be around 80C, but at this temperature boilers cannot operate at their most efficient. When a condensing boiler burns gas, a lot of the heat can escape out of the flue and out on to the street - this heat literally disappears into thin air. Steam coming out of a flue is a sign that flow temperature is high and heat is escaping. At lower temperatures the boiler works to recycle a lot of this heat back into the water it is trying to warm up. Jo Alsop of the Heating Hub said that by turning down the flow temperature, households could save around 6% to 8% of their annual gas usage. 'It's worth making the point that condensing boilers, even though they're A-rated on the box (for efficiency), they don't necessarily achieve A-rating in the home,' she said. Some A-rated boilers have been found to operate at E-rated efficiency levels in the home, at just 75 per cent. Turning down the flow temperature is not the same as turning down the thermostat. The boiler and radiators will still work to keep rooms at the same temperature as before, but it might take a little longer for the house to heat up. Ms Alsop said families should experiment with lowering the flow temperature. The colder it is, the more efficient the boiler will run. 'We would advise to do that to around 60C and if they find that's a bit too cool on a very cold day, they can always notch it back up, but importantly reduce it down again when the weather gets a bit warmer, and keep reducing it down,' she said. How to do this depends on the boiler, but it is a fairly simple process. It should say how in the boiler manual, which can often be found online. The Heating Hub also has a guide on its website on how to change the flow temperature. It is important to remember only to do this if you have a condensing combi boiler which is not connected to a hot water cylinder. Also be careful about keeping rooms cold if you have vulnerable people in the home. Several energy suppliers are also keen for households to turn down flow temperatures. Rebecca Dibb-Simkin, chief product officer at Octopus Energy, said: 'Safely turning down the water flow temperature of your gas boiler is a little-known but very effective tip for saving gas whilst staying warm, and could save people up to 8% off their gas bills. 'Over 100,000 of our customers who took part in our energy efficiency scheme last winter told us they tried it, with some of them knocking nearly £100 off their bills.' - Turning off your boiler's pre-heat function The pre-heat function on a boiler is designed to ensure that hot water is ready to flow to the taps at a moment's notice. It means the boiler always keeps a small amount of water hot. It is a handy function when you want to wash your hands and do not want to wait for water to heat up, but the boiler is heating up water when you do not need it. 'If the boiler is not on and heating the home, it will fire anyway, just to keep that water at temperature, even if someone is not home during the day, and certainly it will fire all through the night, even when hot water is not in demand,' Ms Alsop said. That means burning gas through the night, every night, for nothing. Turning off the pre-heat function might mean a longer wait for the shower to get warm in the morning, but it is a small inconvenience for the hundreds of pounds that can be saved. Ms Alsop estimates households could save around 5 per cent to 10 per cent of their gas use. Guides on how to turn off the pre-heat function should be in the boiler manual or online. However Ms Alsop said people should consider turning the pre-heat on during droughts if they have to wait an exceptionally long time for hot water to reach the taps. They can still turn it off during the day and night. 'Households will face average monthly charges of £362 based on expected usage - almost three times more than the same period in 2021. 'Even after the £66 monthly discount currently on the table from the Government, families will need to find on average an extra £169 per month compared to last year, when many household budgets are already maxed out. 'The energy crisis we face this winter must never be allowed to happen again. This is a failure of the wholesale market and, until that is resolved, we won't have a long-term solution. 'The Government has made it clear that it will not intervene further until a new Prime Minister is confirmed. As concerning as this is, there does seem to be consensus that more support will be made available, but it remains to be seen if it will be enough. 'Until the Government acts, which we expect will be in the coming weeks, consumers are being held in a cost-of-living limbo.' The next prime minister will most likely be unable to avoid introducing a fresh package of support, a leading think tank has said. Respected think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested on Friday that whoever becomes the next prime minister would be unable to avoid putting together a 'substantial package of support', no matter what is said on the campaign trail. The new rise in the price cap, the IFS said, means the current Government supports will cover only 47 per cent of the rise in bills. It said covering the same proportion of the energy price rise now would cost a further £14 billion. The IFS said it was difficult to assess the impact of Ms Truss's plans to cut green levies. 'Cutting only those levies that still add to bills would be complex as they are linked to various schemes and subsidies and apply to business as well as households, but would save households around £50 on average over the three months from October,' the think tank said. Mr Sunak's plan to cut VAT on household energy bills, the IFS said, would save a typical household £51 between October and December at a cost of £1.4 billion. 'Looking beyond this winter, energy prices also look like they will remain very high well into next year, which will put pressure on the government to provide further support in the coming months,' IFS economist Isaac Delestre said. 'Whoever becomes the next prime minister will most likely be announcing a substantial package of support very soon after taking office.' In Scotland, the £2million Social Housing Fuel Support Fund, administered by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, will open on Monday to provide help to the most vulnerable households. Citizens Advice Scotland also said the increase should not be allowed to happen. The charity's chief executive, Derek Mitchell, said: 'This increase should not go ahead. It is absolutely horrifying for people who are hanging on by a thread financially.' Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: 'Today's Ofgem price hike is like a dagger to the heart of millions of people up and down the country. 'As a result of the decision, parents will be unable to feed their children, the sick and elderly will be condemned to worsening health, disabled people will go without vital medical equipment and households will be forced into poverty for the first time in generations. 'All the solutions lie at the Westminster Government's door, yet it is silent in the face of this looming disaster.' And Andrew Forsey, national director of anti-hunger charity Feeding Britain, said: 'Unless significant additional help is offered by the new prime minister, these eye-watering prices will spring a vicious hunger trap; leaving millions of families unable to afford heating or eating. 'Eighty years after the Beveridge Report set the framework for a welfare state that could eliminate destitution from our shores, the threat of destitution now hangs over us again like the Sword of Damocles.' Meanwhile Sara Ogilvie, policy director at Child Poverty Action Group, said: 'Today's energy cap announcement will terrify many low-income families. Their budgets have been overstretched for months, and soaring prices will make it practically impossible to escape the tightening grip of poverty. 'We know that families with children spend 30 per cent more on energy bills than households without kids - yet Government has completely failed to recognise the extra costs facing households with children. 'The next prime minister will be on a collision course with reality unless they increase support to reflect the scale of need, and uprate benefits in line with inflation.' And a charity which supports the vulnerable said families are facing one of the 'bleakest Christmases' for years. Rossanna Trudgian, head of campaigns and public affairs at Action for Children, said: 'Today's announcement, and warnings of even worse rises to come next year, makes it clear that the country is facing a national emergency. 'The families we support are already under enormous pressure and are now set to face a relentless wave of energy price hikes and inflation all while coping with the colder weather. The rising cost of living is placing increasing pressure on household budgets, but there are a number of pieces of technology which could help people make some vital savings. Here is a look at some of the tech which could make a difference. - Smart meters Getting a smart meter is a key step in making your home more energy efficient, as it can help bring an end to the use of estimated bills and give users an insight into how much energy they are using and which appliances use the most - giving an incentive to change some usage habits. Smart meters enable both users and energy suppliers to track the energy consumption of a home, making it possible to more easily understand when a home uses more energy and how it could become more efficient, and potentially highlight where a household could switch to a cheaper tariff based on their usage. - Smart home tools Given the increased connectivity in many homes today thanks to the rise of smart devices, it is now also possible to control many appliances and other items from a smartphone. A number of apps enable users to set routines to turn connected appliances and electronics on and off at certain times, a feature which could be used to improve efficiency and save money. The major smart home apps from the likes of Apple, Amazon and Google all offer their own variations of these tools - depending on which smart home devices a household already has. Another app worth noting is Samsung's SmartThings - which is available on both Android and iOS - and enables users to not only connect to and control appliances and other devices from a range of brands, but also has the ability to connect to the home's smart meter and allow energy consumption and costs tracking from a user's smartphone. - Spending tracking apps Beyond trying to make savings just on energy bills, there are a number of apps and online tools that can help people better track their spending and budget more generally each month. Online banks such as Monzo and others send notifications to a user's phone every time money is spent, but also allow users to organise money into different 'pots' and see breakdowns of what they are spending money on each month to help with budgeting. For those who do not use an online or app-based bank, there is a range of budgeting apps available such as Emma or Snoop Finance's Budget Planner which can be connected to bank accounts to help track spending and set monthly budgets. Some of these apps also offer tips and guidance on better money-saving, and can even flag cheaper deals for certain services when they become available. However, be aware that while many of these apps are initially free to download and use, some charge a subscription fee for some features. - Connectivity and social tariffs Staying online is vital for many people for school or work, but also to access vital online public services, as well as staying in touch with friends and family, but is becoming increasingly difficult for many as the cost of living rises. Some broadband and mobile phone providers have begun to introduce what are known as social tariffs - cheaper connectivity deals for lower-income households and those receiving universal credit, with more likely to be rolled out in the coming months. In addition, the charity Good Things Foundation is working with Virgin Media O2, Vodafone and Three to provide free mobile data to people via The National Databank. The scheme provides free mobile data, texts and calls to people in need, and works in a similar fashion as a foodbank, but for internet connectivity data. Local community partners within the Good Things Foundation's network can apply to access the databank, enabling them to provide free data to those in their communities who need it. 'We are seeing more and more frightened families who are reaching crisis point. 'Some parents are coming to us in tears, terrified about how they are going to feed their children, with some missing rent payments so their child can have a meal - one family has even resorted to taking seats out of their car to save on fuel. Many of these families have already cut back to the bone and have nowhere left to cut.' 'They are facing one of the bleakest Christmases in recent years. The next prime minister must provide emergency relief to struggling parents by committing to further targeted support for low-income families through the social security system. 'Families with children also face higher costs, so it is vital that any financial support takes into account family size and need.' The StepChange debt charity said a third of its new clients were in energy arrears in July, before the latest rise, and this could rise to more than half after the next price cap increase in January. Chief executive Phil Andrew said: 'Household budgets are being pushed to the absolute limit and it's inevitable this will lead to more people experiencing debt. 'The demand for debt advice is rising across the sector as the cost-of-living crisis bites. 'Many of our existing clients are also having to amend their arrangements as they can no longer afford their previous payments.' And Mike Childs, head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said: 'Today's news will be life-changing for millions of people. 'The government, and the two frontrunners to be Prime Minister, have had all summer to set out how they'll shield households from these colossal price hikes, yet we still don't have a credible plan. 'Decision-makers must urgently commit to much greater levels of emergency financial support and the rapid roll-out of a nationwide, street-by-street home insulation programme targeted at those who need it most. 'There are almost 5 million homes in England and Wales that lack even the most basic insulation measures, meaning too many households are paying through the roof to heat their homes. 'At this stage there's no justifying the total absence of plans to improve the energy efficiency of UK homes, when it would help to slash energy use, reduce climate-changing emissions, and save households hundreds of pounds each year on their bills.' Becca Lyon, head of child poverty at Save the Children, called the price cap rise 'a full-blown economic crisis for thousands of families'. She said: 'Children are at serious risk from today's announcement and could spend this winter in cold homes, with fewer hot meals, despite the best efforts of their parents and carers. Our children deserve better. 'Families are already squeezed to the limit and while facing increased energy costs, they could also be paying £1,000 a month or more on childcare, even with Government help. 'Parents want to do their best for their children but how can they when they're facing costs per month that come to more than their incomes? Debt and hardship are the only likely outcome from today's price cap rise.' Disabled people 'feel like they are being punished for using more energy', the disability equality charity Scope warned. Policy manager Tom Marsland said: 'After months of harrowing predictions about energy bills, today's announcement confirms disabled people's fears. Life already costs more for disabled people. 'Now the cost of charging a wheelchair or using a breathing machine will have almost trebled in a year. We've been inundated with calls from disabled people who don't know which way to turn and feel like they are being punished for using more energy. 'The government must intervene now. They should start by doubling the support package, and look at bringing in discounted tariffs for disabled customers who need more energy.' Matthew Reed, chief executive of end-of-life care charity Marie Curie, said: 'Terminally ill people could freeze to death this winter without further support. 'The need to stay warm to keep pain at bay and power specialist medical equipment means that energy bills for some terminally ill people will be thousands of pounds higher than the average household. 'Many won't be able to afford this. With 30% of excess winter deaths attributable to cold, damp housing, this could cost lives. 'Our research shows that working age people are at a huge risk of falling into poverty after a terminal diagnosis. They often have to give up work. 'They don't qualify for their state pension. They cannot claim Winter Fuel Payments and do not automatically qualify for the Warm Home Discount scheme either. - First step: switch off and unplug Households should by now have done a complete check of every power outlet, unplugging anything that is not necessary and turning devices off standby mode - and getting into the habit of doing this regularly. Energy Saving Trust calculates that you can save around £55 a year just by remembering to turn your appliances off standby mode. Almost all electrical appliances can be turned off at the plug without upsetting their programming. You may want to think about getting a standby saver or smart plug which allows you to turn all your appliances off standby in one go. Check the instructions for any appliances you're not sure about. Some satellite and digital TV recorders may need to be left plugged in so they can keep track of any programmes you want to record. - Check your boiler A recent report by the Heating and Hot Water Council found that households can save around 6% to 8% on their gas bill just by turning down the heating flow temperature on their condensing combi boiler. Doing this will allow the boiler to run more efficiently and could save around £200 off an average energy bill. Use the controls on the front of your boiler - not your room thermostat - to set the flow temperature for the boiler, which is the temperature your boiler heats the water to before sending it off to your radiators. The way you adjust the flow temperature and the display information available varies a great deal. There is a handy online guide at theheatinghub.co.uk. Another easy saving is to turn off the pre-heat mode on the boiler, which could mean hot water taps taking longer to heat up, but could save hundreds of pounds a year. - Forget about your tumble dryer and use other appliances wisely Tumble dryers are massive energy drains, so on warm days hang clothes outside to dry instead and invest in a drying rack for cooler months. Use your washing machine on a 30C cycle and reduce use by one run a week. Only run your dishwasher when it is full and use eco settings if possible. Avoid overfilling the kettle - only boil the amount you need. - Defrost your fridge and freezer Remember to regularly defrost your fridge and freezer, as the more they ice up the more energy they will use. A full freezer is more economical to run. With a full freezer, the cold air does not need to circulate as much, so less power is needed. If you have lots of free space, half-fill plastic bottles with water and use these to fill gaps. BBC Good Food suggests you fill the freezer with everyday items you are bound to use, such as sliced bread, milk or frozen peas. - Turn off lights Turn lights off when you are not using them or when you leave a room. Replacing all the lights in your home with LED bulbs could help you save even more. - Keep windows closed when temperatures get hot The obvious thing to do when homes warm up is to open all the windows. However all this does is fill the house with hot air. It is best to use blinds and curtains to block direct sunlight during the day and then open the windows at night when temperatures drop, helping you to save energy by reducing the need for power-hungry fans. - Use fans sparingly and wisely Fans, even when used on cooling settings, will send bills soaring. You should not stop using them when necessary, but there are ways of maximising their effect and cutting the time they are switched on. Putting fans at floor level helps to circulate the lower cold air rather than the warmer air that naturally rises in a room. You can also create the ideal combination for energy saving by pairing smart fan usage with closed windows, keeping the fans working during the day and the windows open at night. - Invest in insulation New analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit has found homes rated band F on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) system, a measure of the home's efficiency, are set to have a gas bill £968 higher than a home rated EPC band C, the Government's target for 2035. The average home in the UK is rated band D and these homes will pay £420 more for their gas this winter, compared with band C. Energy Saving Trust also says that for those wishing to future-proof their homes, investing in professional draught-proofing and insulation in preparation for the winter months could lead to a reduction in bills by £405 for a semi-detached home. DIY draught-proofing is much cheaper and anything is better than nothing. Installing solar panels for a similar property could lead to additional annual savings of around £450. A quarter of heat in an uninsulated home is lost through the roof. Most homes have at least some loft insulation but often not enough. Topping up from 120mm to at least 270mm of insulation will help. - And here are some myths... Turning boilers off is not advisable or an effective way to save energy. Instead, thermostats and timers should be used effectively to regulate their operation. Fridges and freezers are designed to be kept on all the time and energy will not be saved by turning them off for short periods because more energy will be used to cool them down again when turned back on. There are also important safety issues that can arise if food partially defrosts before it is prepared for eating. 'Dying people are falling through the cracks. They need targeted Government support now.' Thomas Lawson, chief executive of national poverty Turn2us, said the 'meteoric rise' will be crippling. He said: 'This is no longer a choice between heating and eating, but not being able to afford either. 'This is as big an emergency as the impact of Covid and needs a similarly confident Government response. As one of the wealthiest economies, it's simply not acceptable to consign more than a quarter of us into poverty. 'We implore the Government to act with urgency and introduce a cap on energy costs that means that we can heat our homes and turn on the lights as we head into winter.' Rethink Mental Illness called the news of the cap rise a 'hammer blow' to households across the country. Alexa Knight, its associate director for policy and practice, said: 'Mental health and money worries are intrinsically linked, and we urgently need a clear response from Government to an economic crisis that has the potential to fuel a mental health emergency. 'There is a growing feeling of powerlessness which will not subside until we see concrete plans from the Government about how they will provide targeted support through the difficult months ahead. 'With mental health services already facing record demand, we need more than a recognition of the problem. 'We need urgent action to address the gravity of the situation people are facing. This cannot arrive a minute too soon.' The Trades Union Congress has said energy bills will rise 35 times faster than wages and 57 times faster than benefits in the last three months of this year, after the energy price cap was hiked by 80 per cent. It added that while average nominal wages will rise by £1,470 in the year to October, energy bills will soar by £2,270 in the same period, leaving workers £800 worse off. 'Nobody should have to worry about heating their homes this winter,' said TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady. 'But millions are facing bankrupting bills in the months ahead. 'Today's energy price rise will be a hammer blow to family budgets and tip many households into fuel poverty. Ministers must immediately cancel this catastrophic increase. 'This is the worst possible time for the government to go missing in action. And to make sure energy remains affordable to everyone, they should bring the energy retail companies into public ownership.' Sharon Graham, the general secretary of trade union Unite, said that the fuel crisis is set to become worse for workers after the energy price was set 80 per cent higher. 'We know now that rampant corporate profiteering is at the very heart of our soaring energy bills and Ofgem's soaring price cap. 'Until this corporate looting of our energy networks is confronted, the fuel crisis will become more and more perilous for workers and their families.' And Katie Schmuecker, principal policy adviser for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said households are 'crying out for certainty and security'. She said: 'It is simply unthinkable that the price rises announced today can go ahead without further Government intervention on a significant scale. 'To force the burden of rising wholesale energy prices onto households will plunge many into destitution. 'Millions more will face the threat of bills they simply cannot pay, homes they cannot heat and stomachs they cannot fill. It is the job of Government to decide how the burden is fairly shared between families, businesses and the public finances. 'Whoever occupies Number 10 next will be remembered for who they protect - they must make sure energy doesn't become a luxury only the wealthy can afford.' Energy consultants warned households could see their fuel bills cost more than their monthly mortgage payments next year as energy prices skyrocket. Many people are set to see their disposable incomes shrink significantly in the new year with some seeing the cost of their utility bills catching up with, or overtaking, their mortgage. Energy prices could spike at as much as £6,823 per year for the average household from next April, according to the latest forecast by energy consultancy Auxilion, which amounts to about £569 a month. In comparison, the average bill in October 2021 was £1,400 a year. Homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages pay £741 a month on average, according to the latest data from trade body UK Finance, compiled in December. That means homeowners could see just a £172 difference in the cost of paying their mortgage and heating their home. For those with a standard variable rate (SVR) mortgage, the figures are even starker. The average SVR mortgage monthly repayment, which borrowers can be transferred to once their fixed or tracker mortgage deal comes to an end, amounts to £516, UK Finance said. That means that some households could end up paying £53 more on their utility bills than their mortgage as runaway energy prices overtake the cost of owning a home. Meanwhile, people tied to a tracker mortgage, which directly track the Bank of England's base rate, will see around £50 added to their typical costs, according to calculations by the trade body. And renters are set to face even more drastic mounting costs amid the cost-of-living crisis. Rents have spiralled over the past few years and the average monthly cost of a newly let property reached £1,166 in July, or £2,008 for Greater London, according to figures from estate agents Hamptons. Such rapid price growth means that the average two-bed home, at £1,068pcm, now costs what the average three-bed cost just 16 months ago. While the average one-bed, at £929pcm, is now worth what the average two-bed cost two years ago, Hamptons said. The combined effect of higher mortgage repayments or monthly rent and surging bills could put some people under serious financial pressure in the months ahead. Several high street banks have set aside hundreds of millions of pounds to prepare for an increase in customers defaulting on their loan repayments. Households and businesses have been warned that the 'era of cheap energy is over', after energy regulator Ofgem hiked bills today. The UK is going to see gas prices remain high over the next few years, even if some of the current extreme costs ease off, said Nathan Piper, an oil and gas analyst at Investec. As Europe severs ties with Russia, the UK is going to become increasingly reliant on liquified natural gas (LNG), which is transported around the world on ships, he said. This is naturally more expensive than gas piped across continents, and will mean prices stay well above the historical average. In the 10 years before the current gas crisis, prices averaged around 50p per therm, a popular unit of measurement. Now it stands closer to £6, a 12-fold increase. 'The crazy thing is we are experiencing record UK gas prices at the moment, in the middle of summer, which just doesn't normally happen,' Mr Piper said. He said that if you want to buy your gas in advance for 2025 at the moment you are still going to pay several times more than in the past. Data from the Intercontinental Exchange shows that gas prices for the winter of 2024 and 2025 is trading at nearly 420p. 'For the UK, in particular, we are going to be more and more reliant upon LNG imports to satisfy our gas demand. And as a consequence, we will have to get used to higher gas prices into the long term,' Mr Piper said. 'I think we have to accept that we'll have to endure much higher gas prices than we've been to. And the era of cheap energy is over.' For households this will mean incredible pain this winter which is unlikely to subside for years to come. The sheer longevity of the increase is the perhaps the most unusual part of this crisis. 'You occasionally get gas price spikes. So for a very short duration, because you get a cold snap, Beast from the East, whatever it is, you get short-lived spikes in gas prices, and everyone goes 'goodness me, look at that',' Mr Piper said. But afterwards things used to quickly return to normal. This is not what is happening now. Prices were already rising before Russia invaded Ukraine, but since then the situation has worsened. Problems in France's nuclear plants have also pushed up the price of electricity, a hot dry summer has reduced power production from Norway's rivers, and low water levels on the Rhine have made it harder to transport coal in Germany. Asked what else could go wrong, Mr Piper said that LNG terminals might break down, and Russia could cut off its remaining gas flows to Europe. 'What we're relying upon is that all the LNG terminals are able to produce gas,' he said. 'A lot of these terminals are running almost at maximum capacity. And if you run anything at maximum capacity, there is the issue that it could break down. The other thing is that the Russians could shut off the Nord Stream 1 pipeline completely.' Gas prices spiked earlier this week after Gazprom announced it would shut the pipe for three days of maintenance next week. 'The question mark is will they turn it back on,' Mr Piper said. What happens next remains to be seen. 'Blackouts will be avoided by what economists call demand destruction, where businesses and people cut their usage because they can't afford to keep it up. 'Heavy industry across Germany across Europe elsewhere, is effectively shutting down because they can't secure gas or electricity prices at anything like a competitive level over the next two or three years,' he said. 'If it was a spike, you'd go 'oh this is terrible, but actually we can lock in competitive prices for the next two years and we can still produce fertiliser, cement, glass, whatever, at an economic price'.' In comparison, US manufacturers are seeing much higher prices, but still far below what Europe is seeing, making them more competitive than European counterparts. Lloyds Banking Group said it had put aside £377 million to cover loan losses, while Barclays reported it set aside £341 million in July as the economic outlook worsened. Charities have warned that many people could face hardship during the colder months of the year when they may be forced to choose between 'eating or heating'. Citizens Advice said that a quarter of people in the UK will not be able to afford to pay their energy bills in October based on current forecasts, jumping to a third of people in January when prices will soar higher. It said its analysis took into account the energy rebate and cost-of-living payments offered by the Government, showing that the support on offer does not go far enough to protect households from spiralling costs. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: 'Every single day at Citizens Advice we're already helping people in the most heart-breaking circumstances, trying to scrape together enough to feed their kids and keep the lights on. This will get far, far worse unless the Government acts. 'It's becoming increasingly clear that skyrocketing prices will swallow up all of the help that has been announced so far.' Furthermore, disability charity Scope said that disabled people are likely to be harder hit when October's energy price hikes come into force. 'Scope has been inundated with calls from disabled people who have been forced to make dire cutbacks on personal care, hygiene, food and energy because of rampaging inflation,' said Tom Marsland, policy manager at Scope. 'This is having a devastating impact on disabled people's lives, and the support from Government just won't touch the side.' Scope said it had heard from people who are forced to stop heating their homes to power lifesaving equipment and others who are skipping meals so their children can eat, the charity said. It also noted that referrals to its disability energy support service had increased five-fold between February and July, compared to the same period last year, partly because of rising costs. Meanwhile Miss Truss is set to end the ban on fracking as part of a plan to make the UK an 'energy-secure dynamo'. The Foreign Secretary said Britain cannot be 'held hostage' by authoritarian regimes and must end its reliance on foreign imports within a decade. She pledged to win the support of local communities for fracking by 'ensuring' they see the benefits, and said new projects will only go ahead if there is a 'clear public consensus' in their favour. It came as one fracking company in the North of England claimed, in a letter to the Treasury, that it would be likely to be able to inject shale gas into the energy market by January if it were granted a licence immediately. Writing in today's Daily Mail, Miss Truss said: 'In a world where authoritarian regimes are willing to weaponise energy, we cannot afford to be held hostage... 'We do not rely on Russian gas, unlike our European allies, but no country is safe from malign efforts to push up energy prices. Energy security starts at home, which is why we must radically boost our domestic supplies. 'We will end the effective ban on extracting our huge reserves of shale gas by fracking but be led by science, setting out a plan to ensure communities benefit. Fracking will only take place in areas with a clear public consensus behind it.' The comments suggest she will go considerably further than previous Tory administrations to win over local communities. Boris Johnson placed a moratorium on fracking in 2019 after widespread opposition from the public, and concerns over earthquakes. YouGov polling recently found 53 per cent of Britons would support fracking if it meant a reduction in bills for people in the community. Miss Truss also today states her support for nuclear power, citing small modular reactors made by Rolls-Royce, and promises to 'champion renewables such as wind and tidal'. She concluded: 'This is why I believe our great country can become over the next decade an energy-secure dynamo, which could be powering Europe as a net energy secure exporter.' Her comments came as Mr Zahawi held meetings with nuclear and renewable energy producers to discuss how Britain can reduce its reliance on international markets. Treasury officials have put a menu of options together for the new prime minister, including a recommendation to re-start fracking to secure the nation's energy security. The new 'three winter' plan aims to bring down energy bills between now and 2025. A Treasury source told The Daily Telegraph: 'The third winter is about increasing our general energy supply through things like North Sea drilling, more nuclear, more renewable, more wind.' Support for fracking has grown as soaring gas prices have hit household budgets, with Tory members voicing their support for new drillings in leadership hustings. A mining engineer, speaking at the hustings in Manchester, said: 'You cannot run, you cannot grow, you cannot progress a modern economy without a secure supply of cheap, abundant, readily available energy. Right below our feet is the largest energy bonanza this country has ever discovered, bigger than coal and bigger than the North Sea.' Fracking involves injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into boreholes a mile underground to fracture the rock and release gas or oil. A Treasury source said: 'The Chancellor wants to see a proper cost-benefit analysis of fracking, with safety and the environment taken in as considerations. 'Energy bills are rising... and we need to look at everything on our disposal.' Fracking started in Lancashire at two sites run by Cuadrilla in 2010, but the Government imposed a seven-year moratorium in 2011 because of tremors. When the sites reopened, they were met with protests from locals and groups including Extinction Rebellion. In November 2019, the Government announced a moratorium, citing a report that found current technology could not predict the likelihood of tremors. ** Are you going to struggle with energy bills this winter? Please email: james.robinson@mailonline.co.uk ** Here is a selection of thoughts from Britons around the country about the latest energy price cap rise which will send the average household's yearly bill from £1,971 now to £3,549 from October: Esme Marshwitch - Alton, Hampshire (glass worker at The Glassy Witch) 'This is nothing short of catastrophic, which in fairness, I am rather resigned to due to our government. Calling it a 'cap' is laughable. Just as when University fees came in, as soon as they were allowed to charge 'up to 9k' per year, whoosh! Up they ALL went. Meddling in the prices levied by the energy companies is what has brought us to these spikes in the first place. I fear for the winter, and how many more will suffer from lack of food, or heat. And I don't know what the answer is. Maybe heavy investment in renewables, and retaining public ownership of such ventures, rather than selling off to some venture capitalist somewhere might be an idea? Won't do much right now, but it would at least be the start of a push that ought to have started in the Thatcher years, rather than chasing the next commodity sell off.' Lee Chambers - Preston, Lancashire (psychologist for Essentialise Workplace Wellbeing) 'We are in for a winter of discontent with both businesses and consumers backed into a corner with a necessity more than doubling in price. This isn't an incremental rise, it's more like a volcano erupting. This will skittle some businesses that simply can't absorb the costs, and sadly they will be the same small businesses that were neglected during the pandemic. We have to look at why so much pressure has built in the system. But more than anything, I'm concerned about the mental toll and distress this will cause, as it's not as easy to measure as a price cap but in our work it's already becoming a priority concern and stressor for people struggling from a variety of walks of life. Energy bills don't discriminate.' Jackie Mulligan - Shipley, West Yorkshire (founder of local shopping platform ShopAppy) 'This latest energy price cap increase will pummel small businesses and the people who run them up and down the country. Many are already at breaking point after two years of the pandemic, with a significant percentage now paying off the Government-backed loans they had to take out to survive. Unless the Government acts soon and acts decisively, many small businesses, which are the beating heart of our communities, will struggle to survive. The UK economy is on red alert and millions of small family-run businesses are facing an existential threat from rising inflation and interest rates, and falling sales. We have come out of the pandemic pan into the inflationary fire.' Graham Wells - Haddington, East Lothian (financial adviser at GroWiser Financial Coaching) 'We're all suffering from the unintended consequences of government meddling with the pricing of privately owned energy supplies. From 2019, the price of energy units has been capped in an attempt to stop consumers being ripped off. That sounds fine, but it means the short sighted, vote-winning policy has landed us with huge price spikes, rather than more gradual increases, which are easier to plan for. It's now vital that the Government provides the support that's needed to cushion consumers from these excruciating price increases. Maybe it's time for leaders to re-consider the sale of publicly-owned utility provision and properly embrace the UK's potential for hydro, wind, wave and tidal power.' Natalie Bamford - Derby (chief executive of gift box company Colleague Box) 'This is just another dagger in the heart for small business owners. The crushing realisation that no matter what you do, your performance, sales, your deemed success will inevitably be out of your hands and instead controlled by the greedy corrupt few at the top who only care about profit. The reality is that those in power couldn't care less about small business owners so you're left to fend for yourself, hope and pray that you make it through yet another avalanche of adversity.' Lewis Shaw - Mansfield, Nottinghamshire (mortgage expert at Shaw Financial Services) 'Welcome to our winter of discontent. We are utterly rudderless in a storm with nobody on deck taking charge. This has all the hallmarks of serious civil unrest if we're not careful. People are already stretched beyond breaking point, which will be the last straw. The worst thing is that even an emergency budget won't be able to tackle the crisis due to the time it takes to get through Parliament and the OBR. With further base rate increases to contend with and another price cap hike in January, it's fair to say our economy is broken, and we're teetering on the brink. Nikki Collier - Sudbury, Suffolk (owner of baby clothes firm BiNibabies) 'This could be the end. I've survived a pandemic, I've survived a post pandemic shift in shopping habits but today's news may just topple my business. My bills have already doubled from February to August, so just what do we do? I'm absolutely lost for words. The country is crumbling and on its knees. We really do need to keep local businesses going otherwise millions of people will be in severe financial difficulty. Samuel Mather-Holgate - Swindon, Wiltshire (financial advisor at Mather and Murray Financial) 'I am really worried about the energy market in the UK. Prices are up by 80% or an average of over £130 per month but the UK Government is spending less on support than our European neighbours like Germany, Italy and France. We need much more help. For some low and medium income families, finding an extra £130 each month will be impossible and, as we know, things are going to get worse in the winter. The new Prime Minister needs to make this their number one priority, by immediately increasing the £400 rebate.' Maddy Alexander-Grout - Southampton (chief executive at money saving app My VIP Rewards) 'This latest announcement is going to ruin Christmas for countless families around the UK and make winter potentially brutal. Millions of people simply can't afford their energy bills already and it's only going to get worse. Employers need to be doing more to support their staff but most can't afford pay rises as the economic climate is volatile at best, with a recession looming. This next six months will be an extremely testing time for everyone.' Rhys Schofield - Belper, Derbyshire (mortgage and insurance expert at Peak Money) 'It's catastrophic. The Government isn't just asleep at the wheel, it genuinely feels like they couldn't care less about the plight of normal people and businesses. They botched Brexit, they botched the response to Covid and now they're botching handling the cost of living crisis.' Lucie Mann - Southampton (regenerative culture expert at New Forest Aquaponics) 'The impact on our non-profit could be catastrophic. We are an aquaponic farm and have to pump water and oxygen around the systems to keep the fish alive. This week, we will be working on the systems so we can reduce the number of pumps running. However, there will be a limit of how many times we can do this, with the survival of many fish at risk. The Government needs to act and act now.' Graham Cox - Bristol (mortgage expert at SelfEmployedMortgageHub.com) 'The energy price cap has almost tripled already this year, with further hikes to come. Clearly, this is unsustainable. The case for expanding the windfall tax is now overwhelming. The £5 billion it's currently set to raise will barely touch the sides. And with the cost of renewable energy about a tenth of gas last week, the government needs to double down on wind and solar power. Mortgage affordability is going to become even tougher. I expect more lenders to decline deals that would have sailed through a year ago, down valuations to increase and property prices to fall sharply over the next year.' Suzanne Noble - Kilburn, North West London (education expert at Startup School for Seniors) 'We've noticed a rise in applications to our programme, Startup School for Seniors, supporting people to start a business, caused by many people's concerns about how they will pay their bills this winter. The money has to come from somewhere, and creating a side hustle is one way to try and fill an income gap.' Ryan Joyce - Nottingham (mortgages expert at Key Mortages) 'This will undoubtedly have an impact for consumers as we are not talking about a slight increase, we are talking about hundreds of pounds a month which will cause a squeeze for anybody. I expect to see a shift in how much consumers are able to borrow as lenders will no doubt adjust their affordability calculations. This will mean people cannot afford the houses they would like to buy and therefore demand for property is likely to fall. However, what we may also see is people being unable to afford their mortgages when their fixed deals end due to rising interest rates, which may cause people to look to sell and downsize.' Luke Loveridge - Bristol (founder of property data experts Propflo) 'This huge increase highlights our over-reliance on fossil fuels. We need a carbon net neutral, more resilient energy system. There is general lack of awareness of the wider benefits of more energy efficient homes. In addition to the temporary help with bills, the Government should phase out the cap altogether and provide support for people to finance green improvements to their homes and incentives for landlords.' Small firms are pleading for the Government to step in over sky-high energy bills, which have soared by as much as 400 per cent in some cases, leaving many fearing they could be put out of business by the end of the year. More than half of small companies — 54 per cent — fear their running costs could force them to close, according to a report by SME Insights and insurer Simply Business. Businesses are not protected by energy watchdog Ofgem's price cap and they face paying 20 per cent VAT on their energy bills, whereas most ordinary households pay five per cent. The crippling energy price increases are forcing many of Britain's remaining pubs, restaurants and high street businesses - which have scraped through lockdown - to reduce their hours, and in some cases, close permanently. Butcher's shop T & P. A. Murray in Bristol — known as 'Murray's' to its loyal regulars — closed its doors for the final time this month after 28 years at the premises, which has been occupied by a long line of butchers since the 1800s. Tom Murray, 65, had planned to leave his beloved business in the safe hands of Nathan Havnes, 32, who joined Murray's as an apprentice when he was 16. But supply costs have risen drastically, the price of beef and cheese for the deli counter is up 15 per cent, and the shop's £11,000 business rates bill is also expected to escalate. When Mr Martin's energy supplier raised his annual bill from £7,000 to £22,000, he says it left him with no choice but to close. 'It was the straw that broke the camel's back,' Mr Martin said. 'We made a £30,000 profit in a good year, but those energy bills would have left us with a loss. Abby McKellar, 46, is considering closing the holiday let business she runs with her husband Matt, 50, over winter in order to stay afloat. Little Norton Mill, which comprises four self-catering cottages and four apartments in rural Somerset, relies solely on electricity. In January, their energy bills increased by 70 per cent from £10,000 to £17,000 a year. And the couple fear they could spiral further when their fixed deal ends at the beginning of next year. Abby says: 'To soak up the electricity cost alone, we would have had to increase our prices by 10 per cent this year — and that does not even include all the other costs that are going up. 'If you raise those prices, people will just stop coming. It's a perfect storm.' 'Nathan has two sons and the last thing I wanted was to put him in a situation where he would struggle, which could affect his family life. 'It feels that while there is some support for households, small businesses have just been dropped by local councils and the government,' he adds. The story is far from isolated as thousands of small businesses, many of which struggled to survive through the pandemic, are on the verge of collapse due to the cost-of-living crisis. Last night, experts warned that the energy crisis could 'shut down' Britain this winter, leaving high streets devoid of pubs, shops and restaurants. Lily and Stuart Beaton have also been left with no alternative but to shut up shop. The family-run Ainsty Farm Shop in Green Hammerton, North Yorkshire, which has a butcher, baker and deli, has served its local community for 22 years. During the pandemic, they boxed up and hand-delivered food to older people in the nearby area who weren't able to leave their homes. But when the couple's gas and electricity deal ends in September, their bills are set to more than triple, from £20,000 to £76,000 a year. Lily, 52, says: 'We have no choice but to shut. Myself, my husband and my 18-year-old son Henry all work here full time, so we have basically all lost our jobs. 'You watch the news and hope that somebody is going to step in and do something about the energy crisis, but nobody has. 'I think we've been overlooked. Most small businesses don't run on big margins. We realised we would be making a loss once we paid that first bill. 'We can't pass on higher costs to our local customers, many of whom are retired. People are going to have to shop at places they can afford.' And Lily fears other enterprises will be forced to follow in their footsteps. 'At some point soon, people are going to want to treat themselves to fish and chips or want to pop to the local farm shop, and they won't be there,' the mother-of-three adds. Nearly three-quarters of pub landlords say they have seen their utility bills double as they urged the Government to reduce VAT and business rates. Critics fear this could be the death knell for many of Britain's high streets. Pubs are being driven towards 'extinction' by soaring energy bills – with as many as seven in ten saying they will not survive the winter. Two-thirds of pubs said their bills have more than doubled this year, while almost one in ten (8 per cent) have seen them rise by more than 500 per cent. And around 70 per cent of pubs surveyed by industry magazine The Morning Advertiser said they would go bust this winter without Government support – which the magazine warned amounts to 'extinction'. Businesses are not protected by the energy regulator's price cap, meaning pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK will be forced to pay market rates for gas and electricity. While Ofgem's household price cap is expected to rise from £2,700 to £3,700 in October – and by much more after that – businesses will be left at the mercy of volatile markets. It comes after industry leaders pointed out that if the price of beer had risen at the same rate as wholesale gas, a pint would cost £25. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said the sector was facing 'unsustainable' energy hikes, and called for business rates relief and the removal of VAT from energy bills until prices become affordable. She said: 'Without this support there is no doubt that many of the UK's most loved pubs and bars will not survive to see the New Year, robbing many of their livelihoods and ripping the heart out of communities across the UK.' Heath Ball, from the Frisco Group of three pubs in south-east England, warned the soaring bills posed an even bigger threat to the sector than the pandemic. Mr Ball said: 'Brits face the prospect of losing thousands of pubs if something isn't done soon to help.' Sacha Lord, Greater Manchester's night-time economy adviser, said staying in business was becoming 'near impossible' for many. 'I think we will see pubs closing at a record rate over the next 12 months,' he added. There were 20,200 fewer businesses between April and June this year than there were during the same period last year — the largest loss recorded by Labour researchers in five years. Clive Betts, Labour MP for Sheffield South East and chair of the Levelling Up Committee, says: 'I think for many struggling businesses, these soaring bills could be the tipping point. 'Empty shops make up 20 per cent of some high streets, and if this figure continues to multiply they will just become redundant because shoppers won't visit them. 'People looking to set up new businesses such as cafes and restaurants may also reconsider opening at all.' Independent retail expert Clare Bailey adds: 'The combination of these rising costs will inevitably prompt some small firms to reconsider if they need high street premises or whether they can do everything online instead. 'This will potentially lead to an increase in shops leaving the high street.' There was also a sharp increase in the number of companies applying for credit between April and July this year, research by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) shows. About 11.5 per cent made a credit application compared to a record low of 9.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Small businesses, which employ 16 million people among them, are particularly vulnerable to bill increases. This is because they are not protected by energy watchdog Ofgem's price cap — currently an average of £1,971 a year. Firms are also not entitled to government support, so are missing out on the £400 discount and £150 council tax rebate announced earlier this year. On top of this, many pay 20 per cent in VAT on energy bills — whereas most ordinary households pay 5 per cent. The FSB is now calling for the Government to step in and extend the price cap to Britain's smallest firms. While some local councils offer general hardship funds for firms in financial difficulties, there is no specific help with energy bill hikes. Alan Soady, an FSB spokesman, says: 'Small businesses are seeing astronomical and unsustainable hikes in energy bills right now. Without urgent support this is fast becoming an existential threat to some small firms, coming on top of a wider cost of doing business crisis. 'While domestic consumers quite rightly have at least some protection through the price cap and are being given direct cash support, there is no cap for small businesses and currently no financial support either, despite many seeing bills going up three-fold, four-fold and more.' In Droxford, Hampshire, pub landlord Shekhar Nailwal, 45, said he was left 'on his knees' with rocketing fuel, food and alcohol bills. It led to him and his wife, Alex, 39, to take the 'heartbreakingly sad' decision to close their much-loved The White Horse after eight years. The quaint village pub was well-loved in its local community for its unusual Indian menu served alongside traditional lagers and cosy inn decor, with a sprawling terrace garden. The closure means Mr and Mrs Nailwal may now have to move their two sons Rudra, 10, and Prem, 14, away from the village they have called home for the best part of a decade. The pub's energy bills have doubled and the price of a box of chicken has gone up by a whopping £25 from £30 to £55, leaving running costs completely unsustainable. The couple say Admiral Taverns, who they rented the pub from, refused to help Mr Nailwal said: 'The cost of everything is rising and we can't keep passing that on to the customers because people are already suffering. 'In a cost of living crisis, the first thing to go is going to the pub and going out to eat. It's not just simple numbers, it's a lot of factors. 'We have been trying to sustain the costs since January. We luckily made it out of lockdown thanks to our customers and help from the government. But the cost of supplies and fuel has gone up so suddenly. 'It's just all these small things adding up and adding up and suddenly the business is just not financially viable anymore. 'The worst part for us is our kids go to school here, we have brought our family up living upstairs from this pub. 'People travel for miles to come and eat here and they're all devastated. We're all just really, really upset.' Mrs Nailwal added: 'We've invested so much time and effort into this place, even sacrificing our time with the kids for the sake of this pub and the community, which we love. 'It's so heartbreaking because we feel like we're all part of a big happy family but now we have to break up with them.' A spokesperson from Admiral Taverns said: 'We have 1,600 pubs across the country, and we work hard to work in partnership with all our licensees. 'The licensee has taken the decision to leave, and we are in the process of looking for a new licensee to take on the pub, and ensure the White Horse has a long-term, sustainable future.' In south Wales, pub landlords Colin Ross and Tom Davies say they were forced to quit their beloved pub due to 'astronomical' energy bills. The lifelong friends told Wales Online they are leaving the Hafodyrynys Inn, near Crumlin, 'with a tear in their eye' after 26 years . After narrowly making it through Covid restrictions, Mr Ross said a 'ridiculously high' increase in energy costs was 'the final nail in the coffin'. He said: 'Gas and electricity have more than doubled. Our contract expired at the end of July and we're on a new rate which is astronomical. Before, it was £700 monthly, which is high anyway, and it's gone up to near enough £2,000. It makes it impossible to stay here. 'I think something should be done about it because at the end of the day, more places are going to go out of business. It's not just businesses facing high bills, it's the customers, and they're not going to be coming out with extra money to spend on beer and food.' They said they were unable to negotiate a reduction in rent with owner Admiral Taverns, despite the sharp rise in inflation. The pair's last day will be September 4 and their Facebook page has been flooded with comments from saddened customers. One said: 'How sad to be reading this, you have dished up the best ever Sunday lunch and your staff are amazing.' Another wrote: 'Such devastating news. You have both worked so hard to build up the pub over the years, you're a credit to the trade.' Elsewhere, The Hand Hotel in the village of Llanarmon, near Wrexham, north Wales, is faced with running costs that have soared from £1,900 to £9,500 per month. Owner Jonathan Greatorex says he was shocked to open his renewal quote to see the eye-watering sums for the fine dining restaurant, which is featured in the Michelin Guide. He is now calling on the government to take action - and says ensuring that his staff are well-provided for is his priority. Mr Greatorex said: 'It is staggering. For many businesses these increases are not survivable. The increase in costs would see us paying four times our monthly mortgage for energy. 'Without action and support we will have to look at options like closing a couple of days a week or shorter opening hours. 'As with the Covid pandemic our first concern is the staff we have here, we feel that responsibility and will always put staff first.' Mr Greatorex says businesses are set to suffer with the surge in power bills - and warns jobs across the country will be at risk. He said: 'We have this moribund government playing a second rate game of The Apprentice and we can't wait until the September 5, when the winner will be announced, for action on this. 'There is also the obsession with the household cap and it is horrendous and invidious that families will be in the situation of choosing between eating and heating. But they have totally missed the effects on businesses. 'This will affect the very fabric of society once food shops and petrol stations start to close as they inevitably will without intervention. 'And how are households going to manage their bills if people are losing their jobs.' 'We can't just blame this on Russia, energy companies are making billions of pounds of extra profits this year. This is not a luxury item and they have a moral responsibility to do more to help.' The Hand's financial woes are a sad turnout for a restaurant which has been praised for offering 'destination dining at its best' in a review this month by Mail on Sunday. Reviewer Simon Hepinstall praised The Hand's head chef, Greg Mulholland, who has two AA Rosettes for 'culinary excellence' and has led its fine dining over the past 18 years. In another case, David Bright is CEO of Renovare Group, which has seven hospitality venues. He says one of its holdings, a small hotel in Wales, had an average monthly electricity bill of £2,000 prior to April of this year but his July bill has now come in at £7,000. Its heating system runs on oil and that was 35p a litre on average a year ago, yet this is now 92p. Mr Bright said: 'While we took a beating during covid which had a major impact on our situation, we are now faced with the inevitability of a stagnant 2023/24. 'It is clear that any profits we had projected will be swallowed up by the ridiculous raises in energy that we are being forced to swallow. Our losses will most likely equal those during covid. 'At the moment, I have made the difficult decision to shut two of the seven venues and I hope that with the savings made, we will be able to weather the storm. We employ over 70 people and I am pleased to say that those affected by the closures were either students returning to school or they were rehoused at other venues. 'This will not resolve itself soon. I have been forced to raise my prices by 5 per cent in the immediate future and we will have to look at it again before Christmas.' In Rotherham, South Yorkshire, couple Damien and Maxine Bailey closed their tattoo parlour Bailey's Body Art after 16 years, saying they could no longer manage the rising costs. Mrs Bailey told Mail Online they were devastated at its loss. She said: 'We gave our blood, sweat and tears, sometimes starved and went without anything good to keep it afloat and now it has gone. What a waste of our lives. 'We have children we hoped to pass it on to.... I worked in lockdown for this country and for what. We never had any financial assistance.' In a parting message, Mr Bailey posted that their 'hearts were broken' and they 'gave it all they had over 16 years'. In Edinburgh, much-loved pub Monty's in the popular Haymarket, says it is being forced to shut down after the double whammy of the pandemic and the rising cost in bills. The pub, which opened to much fanfare in 2016, has not announced a closure date yet said it would continue to serve 'while supplies last'. The pub made the announcement to customers on Instagram this month. They posted: 'After almost six years of building up our wee business, serving some of the best beers in town, amazing selection of whiskies and local spirits, and some amazing products, I have to announce that Monty's will be closing at the end of the month. 'Unfortunately the high rent, the pandemic, cost of living, rising costs of everything, it doesn't work in our favour. I have tried to fight for a rent reduction, unfortunately our landlords would like someone in with a more commercial offering.' Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, says scores of firms have been struggling since late last year. He predicts many will try to stay open over Christmas, hoping for increased sales, but that the crunch point will come in the New Year. And with households having to tighten their own purse strings, he fears a bleak winter ahead. 'That's when the cash flow is normally under pressure and it could be the tipping point for many. We should have had this debate nine months ago. The warning signs were there,' Mr Goodacre adds. Tarun Gidoomal, general manager of wholesale marketplace Ankorstore, said: '(Today) marks the announcement of a new energy price cap for consumers, however, it's remarkable that no such cap exists to protect Britain's independent retailers and small businesses. 'With the traditional renewal date of October 1st for fixed price energy contracts looming, 92 per cent of British independent retailers have stated that their local high street is already struggling, with three-quarters (74 per cent) believing that an upcoming recession will provide the largest threat to their survival, almost double the threat posed by COVID. Simply put - time is running out for the government to step up and protect retailers. 'We urge the government to introduce a price cap for British SMEs, including independent retailers and brands, as well as supporting BCC's proposal for a temporary cut in VAT to 5 per cent to reduce energy costs for businesses.' Nearly seven in ten firms now expect their energy bills to rise in the next three months, with almost a third predicting increases of more than 30 per cent, according to research by the Confederation of British Industry. Matthew Fell, chief policy director at the lobby group, says: 'The guiding principles for any intervention must be to act at speed, and to target help at those households and firms that need it most.' Tory leadership front runner Liz Truss has hinted she may help smaller companies but would not 'reach first for the handout'. In an interview with the Sun on Sunday she said: 'I'm very, very aware that it's not just customers, or consumers, that are facing energy price problems, it's small businesses.' But along with rocketing energy bills, small businesses are also facing increased costs in supply chains with the hike in food and fuel costs, and many are juggling debt repayments after signing up for bounce-back loans during the pandemic. Independent retailers were given 100 per cent relief on business rates in 2020, to help them through the pandemic. But this relief was slashed to 66 per cent in July 2021, and then to 50 per cent in April this year. Meanwhile, most Scottish firms are now back to paying full business rates —unless they are eligible for Scotland's Small Business Bonus Scheme And rates are set to surge even higher next year — as increases are pegged against next month's Consumer Price Index inflation figure, which is predicted to hit 13.3 per cent. Real estate advisory firm Altus Group estimates that even at 11 per cent, it would add £3 billion to businesses' tax bills in England — the single biggest jump in the space of a year since the tax was introduced in 1990. Val Burrows, 64, who runs a launderette in East Grinstead, West Sussex, saw her energy bills rise by 173 per cent when her fixed offer ended in July. And unlike other high street businesses, she says she cannot cut back on energy usage. Miss Burrows, who lives in nearby Lindfield, thinks that the Government should impose a blanket energy cap for businesses, and that there should be emergency funds available like those given out during the pandemic. As a sole trader, she says she has to continue until her lease ends next year. 'But then I may have to consider shutting up shop if I don't get financial help,' she says. A spokesman from the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy says: 'No national government can control the global factors pushing up the price of energy, but we will continue to support business in navigating the months ahead.' It adds that this support includes slashing fuel duty by 5p per litre for a year until March 2023, and the 50 per cent business rates relief."
2022-08-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11147511/Mail-Force-donations-helping-remove-Vladimir-Putins-mines-warzone-Ukraine.html,How your cash is rooting out Vladimir Putin's mines: Mail Force donations are helping to remove dangerous debris from warzone in Ukraine,"Deep in a forest outside Kyiv the extraordinary generosity of Mail readers is now saving civilian lives amid a brutal war. This spring the Mail Force Ukraine appeal raised more than £10million following the Russian invasion. Now almost £1.5million of that sum has been donated to the Halo Trust, the charity that is dedicated to removing land mines and other dangerous debris from war zones. Halo was a favourite cause of Princess Diana. One of the last and most defining images of the princess's life was that of her walking through a Halo-protected minefield in Angola, south-west Africa. She died months later in a car crash in Paris, 25 years ago this week. But her humanitarian legacy lives on, here, in Europe's most dangerous conflict since the Second World War. The Mail, in company with the British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, has witnessed a Halo operation in a forest an hour's drive from the centre of the Ukrainian capital. Superficially, mine clearance here is a gentle occupation. Operators work on hands and knees with garden shears and thin sticks. Birds sing in the treetops; butterflies flutter. It is peaceful. But the stakes are high. The site is close to the Kyiv satellite town of Brovary, where a Russian armoured column was stopped by a succession of Ukrainian ambushes in the early weeks of the war. The images of that clash went around the world. Blocked, the Russians established trenches and dugouts in a coniferous plantation next to the highway and surrounded their positions with mines and other booby traps. When they retreated at the end of March they did not remove these explosives. A local 41-year-old civilian was subsequently killed by a mine while walking along a forest path. Halo was called in and is currently, painstakingly, making the forest safe for locals and forestry workers. The task could take more than a year, such is the area and the challenges of clearing ground among dense woodland. Halo Trust told the Mail that across Ukraine there have been 118 incidents involving discarded military ordnance in Ukraine since the invasion. Eighty six people have been killed and 138 injured. The Trust is clearing 15 minefields in the Brovary and Bucha regions and surveying further areas near the city of Chernihiv, which was besieged by Russian forces throughout the spring. Mail Force's Ukraine Appeal gave the Halo Trust an initial £250,000 earlier this year. The total now given to the charity's work in Ukraine by our readers almost matches that which HM Government has provided. Thanks to the Mail donation Halo aims to increase its staffing in Ukraine from 400 to 600 by the end of the year. But most of the Mail Force funding will go towards mechanical mine clearance equipment that can clear ordnance from Ukraine's vast agricultural land. The Russian invasion has created a global food crisis. Ukraine is one of the world's major grain producers. The war has prevented many farmers from harvesting their crops. The Russian capture or blockade of Black Sea ports has also stopped exports to a number of Third World countries. Ambassador Simmons said: 'One cannot underestimate the work that Halo is doing in the Ukraine, not only in making these areas safe for civilians but for improving the security of food producing land that feeds the world.' A Halo Trust spokesman said: 'We are hugely grateful to the generosity of the Mail readers in providing us with this donation. 'It will make a big difference to the lives of people here in Ukraine.' Earlier I had met Serhii, a retired engineer aged 69, who lost his wife Luiba to a booby trap while they were picking mushrooms and raspberries in a wood west of Kyiv last month. The Russians had occupied their village of Myla, which sits next to the main E-40 motorway. Their apartment block was damaged in the initial fighting, the top two floors being burned out after being hit by cannon fire from tanks. The couple were originally from the Donbas and had fled their home in Kramatorsk following the Russian invasion. 'Unfortunately the war followed us here,' says Serhii. 'Fate was not kind.' They were on a forest path when Luiba, 65, triggered the explosive. She suffered catastrophic injuries to her legs. Her husband applied tourniquets using the straps of his rucksack and material from his trousers and called an ambulance. But the first responders were reluctant to go to the site of the tragedy because of the risk of other booby traps. Serhii had to carry a stretcher and give out painkillers himself. Luiba was finally rescued by a policeman who sang to her as they carried her away. But she died of blood loss in the ambulance on the way to hospital. 'We had passed that particular path several times without incident,' Serhii said. 'I feel such guilt about it. If we had been more careful Luiba would still be here.' The incident further demonstrates the brutal absurdity of this conflict. He showed me a family photo album in which there were pictures of his father, a decorated veteran who had fought in the Red Army all the way from the Soviet Union to Austria in the Second World War. The Halo Trust is now conducting a surveillance operation in the forest where Luiba died.

2022-08-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11147521/Ukraine-hits-RMT-boss-Mick-Lynch-claiming-Kyiv-provoked-invasion-Nazi-imagery.html,Ukraine hits out at rail union boss Mick Lynch for claiming government provoked Russia's invasion with 'Nazi imagery',"Ukraine's government yesterday hit back at militant rail union boss Mick Lynch for claiming that Kyiv provoked Russia's invasion by 'playing with Nazi imagery'. Oleksandr Kubrakov, Ukraine's infrastructure secretary, accused Mr Lynch of losing his 'connection with reality' by peddling Kremlin propaganda. He said the RMT boss should instead be expressing solidarity with murdered Ukrainian rail workers, who have provided a lifeline for millions of fleeing refugees. Mr Lynch has denied repeating Kremlin propaganda. Mr Kubrakov spoke to the Daily Mail as he and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps signed a deal to help restore transport links in Ukraine, bringing UK support to nearly £4billion. In an interview with the New Statesman magazine this month, Mr Lynch said: 'The EU also provoked a lot of trouble in Ukraine. It was all about being pro-EU and all the rest of it. 'There were a lot of corrupt politicians in Ukraine… There were an awful lot of people [in Ukraine] playing with Nazi imagery and going back to the [Second World] War, and all that.' The claims about the role of neo-Nazi groups in Ukraine echo those of the Kremlin. Asked about the comments, Mr Kubrakov said: 'This is absolutely the Russian narrative. In Russia they have the same rhetoric, they have the same messages. 'It's disappointing to hear such thoughts and ideas from the man representing Britain's rail community, because our people, our workers on our railway, they are heroes. 'Even yesterday, some of our railway workers and employees were killed by Russian attacks and many more were injured, and instead he [Mr Lynch] should be showing solidarity with them.' The RMT, and particularly Eddie Dempsey, Mr Lynch's deputy, have long had sympathies for the pro-Putin separatists in the east of Ukraine. Mr Dempsey visited the Donbas region in 2015, where he posed with Aleksey Mozgovoy, leader of the pro-Russian 'Ghost Brigade' of rebels. He was also one of the most high-profile signatories to a Stop the War Coalition statement that criticised Nato for showing 'disdain for Russian concerns' in Ukraine. Mr Shapps said: 'Mick Lynch should stop parroting Russian propaganda and join the British people in actually supporting Ukrainians.' Yesterday's deal will see Britain share expertise with Ukraine as part of a £10million package to help the country rebuild its infrastructure. Mr Lynch said he had not been peddling Kremlin propaganda. He told the Mail: 'I completely condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Putin is abominable. I think Russia should immediately cease fire and withdraw from Ukraine.'"
2022-08-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11147209/Liz-Truss-vows-emergency-budget-provide-support-families-Prime-Minister.html,Truss unveils plans to beat energy crisis: Tory leadership favourite 'will give multi-billion bailout to hardest-hit families',"Liz Truss today pledges 'immediate support' to help the hardest hit families with soaring power bills if she becomes prime minister and said she plans to hold an emergency budget within days of arriving at No 10. The price cap is expected to be raised to more than £3,500 per household today – almost treble the figure a year ago. Analysts say bills could rise by a further £1,000 in January, with more pain in April as Vladimir Putin 'weaponises' his gas resources. But writing in the Daily Mail, Miss Truss says she would use an emergency budget next month to 'ensure support is on its way to get through these tough times'. Energy firms warn that millions of families may be unable to pay their bills this winter without government help. And business leaders predict that many firms will go under unless action is taken to rein in their exorbitant power costs. The Foreign Secretary argued it was not 'right' to announce the full plan before the contest is over or she has seen all the analysis being prepared in Whitehall. She was looking at assistance 'across the board' despite in the past insisting she was focused on slashing taxes, rather than what she termed 'giving out handouts' but has now promised 'decisive action' to deliver 'immediate support'. The Telegraph reported that Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi is set to say measures to ease the burden will be announced as soon as possible after the winner of the Tory leadership contest is revealed in September. The newspaper cited a Treasury source as saying Mr Zahawi has been 'working flat out to develop options for further support' so that Boris Johnson's successor 'can hit the ground running'. Meanwhile, the Times reported that Truss held talks with Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary who is tipped to be her chancellor, and other senior members of her team about her plans. Miss Truss's intervention comes as: Miss Truss and her rival for No 10, Rishi Sunak, have both pledged to continue a £15billion support package unveiled in June. But the Foreign Secretary today indicates she will go significantly further to ease the squeeze on cash-strapped homes. She says Britain is facing 'extraordinarily difficult economic times', as a result of stagnant growth, high taxes and Russia 'using gas supply as a weapon'. But she claims she can 'chart a confident course through this economic storm' and stave off a recession with her tax-cutting agenda. 'The impact on our cost of living is clear at the supermarket checkout, at the petrol pump and on our latest energy bills,' she writes. 'I know how hard it is for millions of Britons, and how grave concerns are about the consequences of today's decision by Ofgem on the next energy price cap. The rest of Europe is facing the same challenge, which will loom large as winter sets in. What is the price cap? The cap decides the maximum cost per unit that energy companies can charge for both gas and electricity. This is then used to calculate a typical annual bill. Currently, the figure works out at £1,971 a year, based on typical use, but the actual bill varies according to use. Who sets it? The cap, which was introduced by Theresa May's government in January 2019, is set by the industry regulator Ofgem. Initially, it changed twice a year, however Ofgem recently changed the rules to allow four changes – January, April, July and October. This means millions of struggling households face two punishing increases this winter – in October and January. What will it increase to? Industry analysts predict the new tariffs will put the typical annual bill at £3,500-£3,700 from October 1. There are suggestions it could be £4,500 from January and over £5,500 from April. Obviously usage will affect what people pay. What is the cap's purpose? Theresa May envisaged it would protect households against profiteering energy giants. It would also, in theory, protect customers against sudden increases in bills. More recently, Ofgem has allowed the cap to rise in a way that protects energy firms from going bust amid the soaring cost of wholesale gas and therefore electricity. The effect is that bills are rising more sharply, and more often, to ensure suppliers can cover the spike in the wholesale prices of gas and electricity, which are around ten times higher than normal. Will it affect my bills? The cap applies to everyone on a standard variable tariff or pre-payment meter. This is virtually every household in the land – about 24 million. A few million are on long-term fixed rates but many of these are expiring in the next few months. 'If I am elected leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister, I will take decisive action on entering No 10 to provide immediate support, but will also tackle the root causes of these issues so we are never again in this difficult position. To those of you feeling the squeeze, my message is clear: I will ensure support is on its way and we get through these tough times.' She has also pledged to 'fix the problems at the heart of this energy crunch at their source' by 'radically' boosting domestic supplies. In today's article, Miss Truss says she will press ahead with her plan to slash taxes, with cuts expected to both national insurance and corporation tax in next month's 'fiscal event'. And she stresses the need to push for growth and avoid a recession that would take a 'terrible toll'. Miss Truss has already pledged a suspension of green levies on energy, taking around £150 off bills. She gives few details today of what additional help she is planning – or how much cash she is prepared to devote to the crisis – saying she has yet to see options being drawn up by the Treasury for the incoming prime minister. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who is tipped to be her chancellor, has held talks with energy bosses about a £100billion plan to freeze bills for two years. But insiders played down the prospect of it being approved. Supply issues linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine are one reason behind rapidly rising power bills - with recent warnings suggesting the average amount UK households pay for their gas and electricity could reach £6,000 next year. Labour has called on both Tory leadership candidates to expand the windfall tax on oil and gas companies if they become prime minister. But Ms Truss said in her piece for the Daily Mail that this approach risks 'deterring investors and slowing our pursuit of energy independence' Government sources said the Treasury was working up options for providing short-term help, allowing the new PM to 'hit the ground running'. These include increases in the winter fuel allowance for pensioners, targeted help to those on low incomes through the Warm Homes Discount Scheme or a general rebate on energy bills. Mr Sunak yesterday indicated he would offer further support to pensioners and low income households if he won, along with cutting VAT on energy bills. But he warned against Miss Truss's plans for 'unfunded' tax cuts, saying that tackling inflation had to be the priority. When the Government announced its financial support package in May, Ofgem was expected to set October's price cap at around £2,800. Instead the regulator is tipped today to raise it to beyond £3,500. Experts have warned that neither leadership candidate has produced plans that will deal with the magnitude of the crisis. Torsten Bell, of the Resolution Foundation think-tank, predicted a catastrophe if bills continued to outstrip the ability of families and businesses to pay them. He added: 'The world has changed on energy bills so policy will have to too. 'We can wake up to that reality now or later, but either way we'll be in a very different phase of this crisis policy-wise by Christmas.' Caroline Flint, the Government's fuel poverty adviser, said: 'The fear is not so much that people will be disconnected by energy companies but that they will disconnect themselves.' I know how hard it is for millions of you, but I will ensure support is on its way, writes Tory leadership hopeful LIZ TRUSS We are facing extraordinarily difficult economic times. Growth is stagnant and taxes are at their highest in 70 years. Prices are rising in the aftermath of Covid and the brutal war Russia continues to wage in Ukraine. Putin is using gas supply as a weapon against all those nations, including the United Kingdom, who have stood up to this appalling aggression. The impact on our cost of living is clear at the supermarket checkout, at the petrol pump and on our latest energy bills. Households could see their fuel bills cost more than their monthly mortgage payments next year as energy prices skyrocket, energy consultants have warned. Energy prices could spike at as much as £6,823 per year for the average household from next April, according to the latest forecast by energy consultancy Auxilion, which amounts to about £569 a month. In comparison, the average bill in October 2021 was £1,400 a year. Homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages pay £741 a month on average, according to the latest data from trade body UK Finance, compiled in December. That means homeowners could see just a £172 difference in the cost of paying their mortgage and heating their home. For those with a standard variable rate (SVR) mortgage, the figures are even starker. The average SVR mortgage monthly repayment, which borrowers can be transferred to once their fixed or tracker mortgage deal comes to an end, amounts to £516, UK Finance said. That means that some households could end up paying £53 more on their utility bills than their mortgage as runaway energy prices overtake the cost of owning a home. Meanwhile, people tied to a tracker mortgage, which directly track the Bank of England's base rate, will see around £50 added to their typical costs, according to calculations by the trade body. The combined effect of higher mortgage repayments or monthly rent and surging bills could put some people under serious financial pressure in the months ahead. Citizens Advice said that a quarter of people in the UK will not be able to afford to pay their energy bills in October based on current forecasts, jumping to a third of people in January when prices will soar higher. It said its analysis took into account the energy rebate and cost-of-living payments offered by the Government, showing that the support on offer does not go far enough to protect households from spiralling costs. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: 'Every single day at Citizens Advice we're already helping people in the most heart-breaking circumstances, trying to scrape together enough to feed their kids and keep the lights on. This will get far, far worse unless the Government acts. 'It's becoming increasingly clear that skyrocketing prices will swallow up all of the help that has been announced so far.' I know how hard it is for millions of Britons, and how grave concerns are about the consequences of today's decision by Ofgem on the next energy price cap. The rest of Europe is facing the same challenge, which will loom large as winter sets in. If I am elected leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister, I will take decisive action on entering No 10 to provide immediate support, but will also tackle the root causes of these issues so we are never again in this difficult position. To those of you feeling the squeeze, my message is clear: I will ensure support is on its way and we get through these tough times. My immediate priority will be to put more money back in people's pockets by cutting taxes, such as reversing the rise in national insurance. I would also suspend the green levy on energy bills, bringing down average energy bills by £153. This will build on the work already underway, such as the Energy Bills Support Scheme, which will see a £400 discount paid to consumers from October, and the £1,200 package of support for the most vulnerable. But that is just the start. I have a bold plan to grow the economy, which is the best tonic to deal with the cost of living and make sure we are solving these issues at source, not just throwing taxpayers' hard-earned money at problems as a quick fix rather than an enduring solution. My clear and consistently Conservative plan will deliver fundamental reforms to strengthen our energy security, get our economy onto a high-growth footing and stave off the threat of a recession. We know a recession would take a terrible toll on our country, and some say it is inevitable. But indulging the voices of decline will benefit no one. Instead, I am determined to chart a confident course through this economic storm. I am ready to take the necessary decisions when in office in light of all the facts. It isn't right to announce my chancellor's plan in August, before I have even won the leadership contest or seen all the analysis being prepared in Whitehall. Under my leadership, we will work flat out to deliver energy affordability and security. I will always be honest with the public about the time it will take to put things right. But my administration will, from day one, focus relentlessly on people's priorities – the things they need and care about and which make a real difference to their lives. In a world where authoritarian regimes are willing to weaponise energy, we cannot afford to be held hostage. We do not rely on Russian gas, unlike our European allies, but no country is safe from malign efforts to push up energy prices. Energy security starts at home, which is why we must radically boost domestic supplies. The government I lead will seek to unleash more energy by maximising our North Sea oil and gas production. We will not be swayed by short-sighted calls to hit these firms with a windfall tax, as that risks deterring investors and slowing our pursuit of energy independence. We will end the effective ban on extracting our huge reserves of shale gas by fracking but be led by science, setting out a plan to ensure communities benefit. Fracking will take place only in areas with a clear public consensus behind it. When autocrats like Putin are ready to exploit the free world's reliance on fossil fuels, we need to embrace diverse sources of energy. I will champion the UK's world-leading technologies like nuclear alongside renewables such as wind and tidal. We have huge potential to harness, whether it is through the small modular reactors made by Rolls-Royce in Derby or our nation having the largest offshore wind capacity in Europe – thanks to firms like Scottish Power. This is why I believe our great country can become over the next decade an energysecure dynamo, which could be powering Europe as a net energy secure exporter. I know the coming months will be hard, which is why we will take decisive action to grow our economy, cut taxes and fix the problems at the heart of this energy crunch at their source. By holding our nerve, we will deliver for the British people and come through the economic storm together. Families could save hundreds of pounds on their energy bills this winter by taking a few simple steps. Soaring costs are set to impact British households as the energy price cap rises on Friday, and is expected to increase yet again in January. As the country faces energy bill hell in a growing cost-of-living crisis, MailOnline reveals the expert tips that could help households save money, and improve energy efficiency... The process is different for every boiler, but it is always fairly simple. There are specific instructions how to turn down the flow in each boiler manual. The Heating Hub also has a guide on their website. It is important to only do this if you have a condensing combi boiler that is connected to a hot water cyclinder. The flow temperature on a boiler regulates how hot the water is when it leaves the boiler to go to your radiators. Most condensing combi boilers in the UK are still set to their factory setting, which tends to be around 80C, but this setting can let heat escape out of the flue and into the street. However turning down the flow temperature to 60C means the boiler works to recycle a lot of this heat back into the water it is trying to warm up. Jo Aslop of the Heating Hub said that by doing this, households could save around 6% to 8% of their annual gas usage. Ms Aslop said: 'It's worth making the point that condensing boilers, even though they're A-rated on the box (for efficiency), they don't necessarily achieve A-rating in the home. 'We would advise to lower the flow temperature to 60C and if they find that's a bit too cool on a very cold day, they can always notch it back up, but importantly reduce it down again when the weather gets a bit warmer, and keep reducing it down.' Several energy suppliers are also urging customers to turn down their boiler flow temperature. Rebecca Dibb-Simkin, chief product officer at Octopus Energy, said: 'Safely turning down the water flow temperature of your gas boiler is a little-known but very effective tip for saving gas whilst staying warm, and could save people up to 8% off their gas bills. 'Over 100,000 of our customers who took part in our energy efficiency scheme last winter told us they tried it, with some of them knocking nearly £100 off their bills. Turning boilers off is not advisable or an effective way to save energy. Instead, thermostats and timers should be used effectively to regulate their operation. Fridges and freezers are designed to be kept on all the time and energy will not be saved by turning them off for short periods because more energy will be used to cool them down again when turned back on. There are also important safety issues that can arise if food partially defrosts before it is prepared for eating. The pre-heat function makes sure that the boiler always keeps a small hot water ready to flow to the taps at a moment's notice. It is a useful function when you need hot water quickly and do not want to wait, such as washing your hands, but the boiler is using energy to heat up water when you do not need it. Ms Alsop said: 'If the boiler is not on and heating the home, it will fire anyway, just to keep that water at temperature, even if someone is not home during the day, and certainly it will fire all through the night, even when hot water is not in demand. She estimates that households could save between 5% to 10% of their gas use. Households should do a complete check of every power outlet, unplugging anything that is not necessary and turning devices off standby mode. Energy Saving Trust calculates that you can save around £55 a year just by remembering to turn your appliances off standby mode. Almost all electrical appliances can be turned off at the plug without upsetting their programming. Households can get a standby saver or smart plug which allows you to turn all your appliances off standby in one go. Tumble dryers are massive energy drains, so on warm days hang clothes outside to dry instead and invest in a drying rack for cooler months. Use washing machines on a 30C cycle and reduce use by one run a week. Only run your dishwasher when it is full and use eco settings if possible. Avoid overfilling the kettle and only boil the amount you need. The more fridges and freezers ice up, the more energy they will use, so defrosting them regularly can help improve efficiency. A full freezer is more economical to run, as the cold air does not need to circulate as much, so less power is needed. If you have lots of free space, half-fill plastic bottles with water and use these to fill the gaps. BBC Good Food suggests you fill the freezer with everyday items you are bound to use, such as sliced bread, milk or frozen peas. Turn lights off when you are not using them or when you leave a room. Replacing all the lights in your home with LED bulbs can help save even more money. When opening the windows of your house on a warm day, all it does is fill the room with hot air. It is best to use blinds and curtains to block direct sunlight during the day and then open the windows at night when temperatures drop. This helps to save energy and reduce the need for power-hungry fans. Fans can send bills soaring, and there are ways of maximising their effect but cutting the amount of time when they are on. Putting fans at floor level helps to circulate the lower cold air rather than the warmer air that naturally rises in a room. You can also create the ideal combination for energy saving by pairing smart fan usage with closed windows, keeping the fans working during the day and the windows open at night. New analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit has found homes rated band F on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) system, a measure of the home's efficiency, are set to have a gas bill £968 higher than a home rated EPC band C, the Government's target for 2035. The average home in the UK is rated band D and these homes will pay £420 more for their gas this winter, compared with band C. Energy Saving Trust also says that for those wishing to future-proof their homes, investing in professional draught-proofing and insulation in preparation for the winter months could lead to a reduction in bills by £405 for a semi-detached home. DIY draught-proofing is much cheaper and anything is better than nothing. Installing solar panels for a similar property could lead to additional annual savings of around £450. A quarter of heat in an uninsulated home is lost through the roof. Most homes have at least some loft insulation but often not enough. Topping up from 120mm to at least 270mm of insulation will help."
2022-08-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11146783/Record-20-MILLION-Americans-power-bills-face-cutoffs.html,'Expect a tsunami of cutoffs': Record 20 MILLION Americans are behind on their power bills and face shutoffs as cost of electricity jumps 16% - with inflation forcing families to choose between groceries and utilities,"The United States is facing a looming crisis of utility shutoffs, with a record number of households falling behind on their power bills, industry observers and experts say. About 20 million US households, or one out of six homes, are behind on their utility bills, the most on record, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (Neada). 'I expect a tsunami of shutoffs,' Jean Su, a senior attorney at the non-profit Center for Biological Diversity, which tracks the power industry, told Bloomberg this week. Electricity prices have soared due to rising costs for natural gas, which has skyrocketed following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February. At the same time, inflation is sending the prices of groceries and everyday necessities soaring, and many households have had to make tough choices about whether to pay utility bills or put food on the table. Millions of Americans could face utility cutoffs in the coming month, with households now owing $16 billion in late energy bills, double the pre-pandemic total, according to Neada. The average overdue balance has climbed 97 percent since 2019, to $792, the group says. 'The bills just aren't affordable,' says Mark Wolfe, Neada's executive director. 'People on the bottom, they can't pay this.' In July, the average price of electricity in the US hit a record-high $0.166 per kilowatt hour, a 4 percent jump from the prior month and up 16 percent from a year ago, according to Commerce Department data. Natural gas is the largest single source of electricity generation in the US, accounting for about 38 percent of all power generated last year, according to the Energy Information Administration. Prices for natural gas have surged worldwide following the war in Ukraine. Russia is a major supplier of natural gas to Europe, but Moscow's warmongering halted plans to open a key new pipeline, and disrupted Russian exports to Europe. The US has responded by boosting gas exports to European allies, constraining domestic supply and raising prices at home. As electricity prices soar, many Americans are being pushed closer to disaster, facing the prospect of electricity shutoffs amid dangerously hot temperatures. Single mother Adrienne Nice, 45, of Minneapolis told Bloomberg that she awoke on July 25 to find her power shut off, after racking up $3,000 in overdue utility bills. Nice, a housecleaner who lives with her teenage son, had been struggling financially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising gas prices meant that driving from job to job now takes a significant cut out of her income, and soaring utility bills made it impossible for her to keep up with payments, she said. With a heatwave approaching, Nice scrambled to find a solution, and was fortunate to get her power re-connected in three days with the assistance of a charity group. The crisis is even more dire in the UK and Europe, which rely on natural gas to generate a greater share of their electricity. In the UK, millions of people are expected to pay about 80 percent more per year on their household energy bills starting in October. The UK's main energy regulator on Friday is set to announce its new price cap, which is the maximum amount that gas suppliers can charge customers per unit of energy. Analysts expect the new cap to mean people pay up to 3,600 pounds ($4,240) a year for heating and electricity, up from a cap of 1,200 pounds last winter. US bank Citi forecast that the huge energy cost increases could drive UK inflation to 18 percent next year. The Bank of England predicts a recession starting later this year. Germany has put emergency measures in place to limit energy consumption, banning illuminated billboards and restricting heating in public buildings."

The two men both called for Russia to return access to retain of Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, amid fears of a Russian 'false flag' operation or other accident at the facility, which Russia seized months ago with a rattled crew of Ukrainians operating it. 'I spoke with President Zelenskyy to congratulate Ukraine as it marks its Independence Day,' Biden tweeted Thursday. 'I know it is a bittersweet anniversary, but I made it clear that the United States would continue to support Ukraine and its people as they fight to defend their sovereignty,' he saisd. A White House readout on the call was characteristically light on details. Biden 'expressed his admiration for the people of Ukraine, who have inspired the world as they defended their country’s sovereignty over the past six months.' The president 'reaffirmed the United States’ continued support for Ukraine and provided an update on the ongoing provision of security assistance' – including Wednesday's announcement of $3 billion for long-term defense capabilities. That package is expected to contain more funds for drones, air defenses and ammunition, and signals a longer-term commitment to Ukraine, after it has demonstrated successes destroying Russian armor and holding back its advances. 'This will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, counter-unmanned aerial systems, and radars to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term,' Biden said when announcing it Wednesday. Russia currently controls about a fifth of the country. They also called for International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to the Zaporizhzhya plant. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Russia should agree to a demilitarized zone around the plant. and allow the IAEA to check on the safety and security of the systems. The call came as Ukraine marked 31 years of independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union. With the added $3 billion, the Biden administration will have offered a total of near $14 billion over the course of 19 aid packages since February. That total is in addition to two separate aid packages, one worth $40 billion and one worth $13.6 billion, Congress has approved for Ukraine."
2022-08-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11146355/Putin-sent-army-special-services-officers-protect-daughter-romantic-dates.html,Putin 'sent an army of special services officers to protect his daughter during her romantic dates with new lover in the West',"Vladimir Putin diverted dozens of Russian intelligence officers to guard his daughter whenever she went on romantic trips to the West to meet her new lover, it is claimed. Katerina Tikhonova, 35, reportedly made repeated clandestine visits over four years to Munich and other locations - including London - mostly for assignations with Igor Zelensky, 53, then head of the Bavarian State Ballet. Each time she was said to be accompanied by an 'army of special services officers' at vast expense to Russian taxpayers, according to a revealing investigation by Important Stories media outlet and Der Spiegel based on leaked secret services papers. On a trip to London in March 2017, six intelligence agents loyal to her father were booked into three hotel rooms on her trip by Aleksey Skripchak, her personal officer in the presidential security detail. 'They had to huddle in cramped London hotels in pairs,' said a report. Her movements in Britain are not recorded. On another incognito jaunt by Putin's favourite daughter - this time to Hotel Continental Relax & Spa in Halmstad, Sweden - she was reportedly accompanied by no less than ten officers from intelligence agencies once part of the KGB. Two of them were said to be unmasked as Dmitry Dankov and Dmitry Posunenko, who had personally guarded her father. Tikhonova was once a high-kicking 'rock'n'roll' dancer who married Russia's youngest billionaire Kirill Shamalov, 40, son of a close Putin crony. But the marriage collapsed and Katerina started a relationship with ballet star Zelensky, no relation of the Ukrainian president. The pair now share a daughter. Earlier revelations show she underwent 'Vampire Facelift' treatments and Botox procedures during her trips to Germany. Putin has raged against Russians who enjoy the West, but meanwhile the leaked papers show how he was devoting vast state resources to Tikhonova's foreign travels, sometimes using a luxury Gulfstream G650 business jet. Her father apparently knew all about her love life since his spies were always present in adjacent bedrooms. 'These documents are of great public importance,' said Important Stories. 'Thanks to them, we not only found out how the Putin family lived abroad but also how an army of special service officers accompanied them everywhere.' It is claimed the agents were so mob-handed that they were noticed by German intelligence who started to monitor them, it was claimed. Tikhonova was recently parachuted in to help Russia dodge the impact of Western sanctions over her father's war in Ukraine. She was made co-chairman of a high-powered group supervising import substitution, a move seen by some as the start of a political career. She is also director-general of the National Intellectual Development Foundation in Russia. She is Putin's second daughter by former first lady Lyudmila, his ex-wife. Her elder sister is Dr Maria Vorontsova, 37m a leading researcher at the National Medical Research Centre for Endocrinology of the Ministry of Health of Russia, and an expert on dwarfism. She has a half-sister Luiza Rozova, 19, daughter of Putin's ex-lover, cleaner-turned-multimillionaire Svetlana Krivonogikh, 45. Krivonogikh is now part-owner of a major Russian bank, one of the country's wealthiest women with an estimated £74 million financial and property fortune. Putin never identifies his daughters in public. He is also believed to have multiple secret children with 'lover' Alina Kabaeva, an Olympic gold medal winning gymnast."
2022-08-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11145963/Putin-orders-army-recruit-137-000-troops-losing-estimated-75-000-Ukraine-invasion.html,"Putin orders Russian army to recruit another 137,000 troops after losing an estimated 75,000 since Ukraine invasion began","Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to recruit another 137,000 troops to replace the estimated 75,000 soldiers who have been killed or wounded since the invasion of Ukraine began. Putin signed the presidential decree which seeks to boost the number of armed forces' personnel to 2.39 million, including more than 1.15 million soldiers. The Kremlin's decree did not explain whether the military will increase its ranks by drafting a larger number of conscripts, increasing the number of volunteer soldiers or using a combination of both. But the decree, which marks the first formal increase to Russia's army since 2014, signifies the devastating losses inflicted on Russian troops by Ukrainian soldiers. Putin has been forced to react and boost the number of troops because an estimated 75,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or injured since the Ukraine war began six months ago. As Russia continues to suffer losses in its invasion, the Kremlin has refused to announce a broad mobilisation - a move that would prove unpopular for Putin - and insisted that only volunteer contract soldiers take part in the war. In an effort to bolster the number of troops, Russia has been attracting more volunteers with the promise of enlistment bonuses of around £4,000, engaging private military contractors and even offering amnesty to some prisoners in exchange for a tour of military duty. This also is happening amid reports that hundreds of Russian soldiers are refusing to fight and trying to quit the military. 'We're seeing a huge outflow of people who want to leave the war zone — those who have been serving for a long time and those who have signed a contract just recently,' said Alexei Tabalov, a lawyer who runs the Conscript's School legal aid group. Although the Russian Defense Ministry denies that any 'mobilisation activities' are taking place, authorities seem to be pulling out all the stops to bolster enlistment. Billboards and public transit ads in various regions proclaim, 'This is The Job,' urging men to join the professional army. Authorities have set up mobile recruiting centers in some cities, including one at the site of a half marathon in Siberia in May. Regional administrations are forming 'volunteer battalions' that are promoted on state television. The business daily Kommersant counted at least 40 such entities in 20 regions, with officials promising volunteers monthly salaries ranging from the equivalent of £1,821 to nearly £4,659, plus plus bonuses. The British military said earlier this month that Russia had formed a major new ground force called the 3rd Army Corps from 'volunteer battalions,' seeking men up to age 50 and requiring only a middle-school education, while offering 'lucrative cash bonuses' once they are deployed to Ukraine. But complaints also are surfacing in the media that some aren’t getting their promised payments, although those reports can’t be independently verified. The recruitment of prisoners has been going on in recent weeks in as many as seven regions, said Vladimir Osechkin, founder of the Gulagu.net prisoner rights group, citing inmates and their relatives that his group had contacted. It’s not the first time that authorities have used such a tactic, with the Soviet Union employing “prisoner battalions” during World War II. Nor is Russia alone. Early in the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy promised amnesty to military veterans behind bars if they volunteered to fight, although it remains unclear if anything came out of it. All Russian men aged 18-27 must serve one year in the military, but a large share avoid the draft for health reasons or deferments granted to university students. The share of men who avoid the draft is particularly big in Moscow and other major cities. 'The Kremlin is likely attempting to shield Moscow City residents from the military recruitment campaign, which may lead to some social tensions,' said the think tank Institute for the Study of War. The Russian military rounds up draftees twice a year, during the spring and in the fall. Putin ordered the drafting of 134,500 conscripts during the latest spring draft. In recent years, the Kremlin has emphasised increasing the share of volunteer contract soldiers as it sought to modernise the army and improve its readiness. Before the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine, the Russian military had over 400,000 contract soldiers, including 147,000 in the ground forces. Military observers have noted that if the campaign in Ukraine drags on, those numbers could be clearly insufficient to sustain the operations in Ukraine, which has declared a goal of forming a million-strong military."
2022-08-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11142139/British-hosts-reveal-difficulties-opening-homes-Ukrainian-refugees.html,EXCLUSIVE: The Ukrainians left homeless and abandoned... and the British hosts feeling 'used and underappreciated' by Homes for Ukraine scheme - as government 'fails to honour £350 payments' six months after Putin's invasion,"Ukrainian refugees and British hosts have hit out at the Homes for Ukraine scheme that has seen families on both sides feeling abandoned by the British government. A British mother who opened her door to two Ukrainians says she feels 'totally used and underappreciated' and has vowed to 'never again' take part in the scheme. Clara Maguire, 54, from Poole, Dorset, is one of a growing number of Britons who have quit the programme following a breakdown in relations with their displaced guests. Others claim they have been 'duped' by 'non-vulnerable' Ukrainians, while many have yet to receive a penny of the monthly £350 payments promised by the government - some six months after Vladimir Putin's tanks rolled over the border. Meanwhile, Ludmila Zosym, 44, a mother from Kiev, has hit out at some of the claims, saying it is the British hosts who cannot understand what her people are going through, as they have never fled from war. Email laurence.dollimore@mailonline.co.uk A trauma charity agreed as they called for more mental health training for hosts, and better access to services for refugees to avoid placing further strain on the NHS. It comes as a quarter of British families taking part in the scheme are set to quit in the coming weeks, with the majority citing a lack of support amid the cost-of-living crisis sparked by soaring inflation and sky-high energy bills. Hosts have also reported delays in receiving their monthly £350 grants, which are paid out by local councils - with pressure mounting on ministers to double the aid to £700. One furious Brit in south London told MailOnline he has not received a penny, despite looking after refugees at his home since May. Some claim they have spent thousands to care for their refugees while the Local Government Association, which represents 361 councils in England and Wales, said it only received the government grant money in June and was having to backdate payments. Single mother Ms Maguire, who lost her husband just before the Covid pandemic, said she and her 13-year-old son 'really struggled' after housing a mother and daughter for six weeks, before asking the council to re-house them. Branding the experience a 'disaster', the air stewardess, who recently took voluntary redundancy, told Mail Online she has still not received the £350 monthly grant, which is paid for each Ukrainian family taken in. Ms Maguire told MailOnline: 'We have never been made to feel so uncomfortable in our own homes as we did with them.' She said the Ukrainian mother spoke fluent English and was earning around £700 per month from a French speaking job while earning a similar amount from child benefits. Ms Maguire recalled how she cleared out two spare bedrooms and 'took them everywhere', be it to the dentist, doctors or the Polish supermarket, as they 'would not eat UK food.' She added: 'The worst bit was after everything and extending our home to them we never received one thank you... and when I told them I could no longer put up with the ingratitude and the daughter being up all night, she said they were not rude and begged to stay. 'I told them it had gone past the point of no return. They had no intention on integrating nor understood the importance of being grateful. Ludmila Zosym, a Ukrainian mother from Kiev, who lives in Chiswick, west London, was recently asked to leave by her host. The 44-year-old, who has worked as a chief financial director for several international companies, said British people fail to understand the gravity of the Ukraine war and its impact on those who have fled. She told MailOnline: 'It's not about cultural differences. It's more about understanding. People who have never lived in war conditions have difficulty understanding what it is like and how huge a stress it is. 'Then we have the added stress of adapting to a new country. Then the daily stress of ending up homeless here. One more stress is how to find a job as a professional and not cleaning toilets when you have a good education and experience and had a highly paid job in Ukraine, but here very little money is offered while there are higher living costs. 'Meanwhile members of your family and best friends are still in Ukraine and at risk of being killed.' She added: 'Houses, cars and welfare are left in Ukraine and I need to start from scratch here. 'Citizens of any other country have difficulty to understand that we still have trouble sleeping and need to recover psychologically, including using medicine to recover our nerves. It's more about this in my personal case… we have so many worries and daily stresses, so, maybe, that's why we don't satisfy the British with enough 'thank yous'. Ms Zosym said she is also struggling to bring over her 17-year-old daughter from Poland as she does not have a permanent residence or job in Britain. 'I don't know how many years I need to work here in the UK, starting with the lowest positions in finance - often with a much lower salary compared to Ukraine - in order to reach that level of living I had. 'I have been working very hard to build my career over 20 years and it's difficult to do an uninteresting and repetitive job, which does not develop my skills and for the little money which is being offered in the UK.' She added: 'But I am still thankful to the British for welcoming me,' she added, 'I am thankful to Poland too and to many countries. Maybe, my quantity of thanks is not enough but inside of me I am thankful every day.' 'They refused to walk the dogs with us, have food with us, would not even drink the water or have coffee. It was utterly horrid.' Ms Maguire added: 'I lost my husband just before Covid after five years of caring for him so we do know about loss and caring and being appreciative of the smallest things in life. 'I know there are wonderful stories out there but we really struggled and asked the council to rehouse them.' Ms Maguire said it was never about the money and she is not chasing the grant cash she is owed. 'Luckily we are in a financial position to carry it,' she said. Responding to reports of 'ungrateful' guests, Ludmila Zosym, a Ukrainian mother from Kiev, who lives in Chiswick, west London, and was recently asked to leave by her host, hit back. The 44-year-old, who has worked as a chief financial director for several international companies, said British people fail to understand the gravity of the Ukraine war and its impact on those who have fled. She told MailOnline: 'It's not about cultural differences. It's more about understanding.

'But I am still thankful to the British for welcoming me,' she added, 'I am thankful to Poland too and to many countries. 'Maybe, my quantity of thanks is not enough but inside of me I am thankful every day.' It comes after a woman known only as Jane reported having a 'terrible' experience with a young student from Ukraine. She told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: 'I feel a failure, but I feel some of it was partly my fault. Yes, some of it's cultural. 'I don't think you realise what it's like to have someone living in your own home that isn't your immediate family, but just, really be careful. 'I feel I was duped and I'm really angry with myself for that, because I feel there's a lot more people out there who I could have helped.' Another listener, who branded herself a 'life-long Guardian reader', said she was frightened to speak up after her Ukrainian guests 'drove us to despair' before she eventually asked them to leave 'for the sake of mine and my family's mental health.' She added: 'They were not vulnerable, we would not have asked them to leave if they were and if they did not have considerable private means. 'I think we underestimate the cultural differences too, we are polite and deferential as a nation while I am finding Ukrainians are more upfront… I'm shocked by what's happened to us and I wouldn't do it again.' But one listener responded to the show today to criticise the slew of negative comments from hosts. He wrote: 'My wife and I came from Ukraine, I am British, my wife is Ukrainian. We have been with a host for six months and our host would like us to move on so he can restart his life. 'He's a fantastic host, probably a friend for life... I am working, but can I rent? That is a big no, I have no history, the local government will not find a new host, so we are now thinking of going back to Ukraine, to live on hell on Earth.' He added: 'We also have a small dog and the amount of people who can be so negative feels massive.' It comes as a leading trauma charity today suggested British hosts are unable to comprehend the trauma their Ukrainian guests have been through, often leading to a breakdown in relations. Tiffany Watts, a consultant at Trauma Treatment International (TTI), told MailOnline: 'Many hosts responded to Government calls for housing through the Homes for Ukraine scheme, unaware of the high level of need to provide practical support. 'In some cases, hosting is breaking down and hosts are burning out as they effectively act as untrained case workers. One host said: 'I feel like I'm out in the abyss and can't get the Government to deliver on their promises'.' TTI's research also found that Homes for Ukraine hosts are unsure how to access mental health advice or services for their refugee guests, while they are also uncertain which ones they can trust. Ms Watts added: 'There is a plethora of online packs and advice, but they vary in quality and are not always expert reviewed. In addition, hosts are often being told to call the council or send guests to the GP if they exhibit any signs of trauma. 'The strain this could put on an already overwhelmed NHS is huge, with long waiting lists potentially compounding trauma.' Meanwhile Enver Solomon, CEO of Refugee Council, told MailOnline today the hosting arrangements between Brits and Ukrainians 'were always going to encounter challenges in the long-term.' He added: 'We are already aware of hundreds of Ukrainian refugees, predominantly women and children, at risk of homelessness due to complications with their hosting arrangements, and now the additional burden of cost of living on families here in the UK poses a further threat to vulnerable Ukrainians. 'That is why it is so vital that the government provides hosts and refugees with the right support, funding and advice - including a review of funding, and help to make arrangements for long term accommodation so Ukrainians can live independently and avoid the risk of homelessness. 'Both Homes for Ukraine, and the Family Visa scheme need sufficient attention and support to ensure they are fit for purpose to protect refugees in desperate need of a safe roof over their heads and for families and hosts who have opened their doors to be able to support them effectively.' It comes after Vicki Bridges, one of the organisers for Homes for Ukraine in Oakhill, Somerset, who has helped connect refugees with host families, warned yesterday: 'If you're a sponsor, with the best will in the world, you're inviting a complete stranger into your home and that can be quite difficult.' She told MailOnline: 'I think we have all found it harder than expected, there were always going to be teething problems.' Ms Bridges said the biggest struggles for hosts have been language barriers and cultural differences. She added: 'If they are living with you in your home, they are not going to automatically live the way that you live, we are all different. 'It can be difficult getting used to having someone living with you in close proximity, it is a gamble. 'Hosts also need to remember that if refugees have their children with them, they are not your children and there will be differences in parenting techniques.' It comes as another host in Lambeth says he has not received his grant money since first homing refugees in early May. The last correspondence he had from the south London council was on August 3, telling him the money would arrive 'in a few weeks.' He told MailOnline: 'I think it is completely unacceptable for councils not to pay host families in a timely fashion - a normal employer would not get away with telling a new employee they 'should' be paid in 'a few weeks'. Ministers could double the £350 monthly payments to British hosts of Ukrainian refugees as they face demands to provide more help. According to the PoliticsHome website, the Government could act by doubling the monthly 'thank you' payment to host households to £700 - if they are willing to extend their offer of accommodation beyond the minimum six months. Around 2,000 hosts have already signed an open letter to ministers asking for more support. In their letter, organised by the Sanctuary Foundation charity, the hosts wrote: 'Please consider increasing the amount of the 'thank you' payments, particularly where hosts are looking after multiple persons, where hosts are offering accommodation beyond six months, and for households who are bearing the brunt of the cost-of-living crisis.' They also urged ministers to provide funds to top up Universal Credit housing allowance for Ukrainian refugees, and to ensure funding to support English language lessons for those who have fled Vladimir Putin's invasion. Treasury sources told MailOnline the Government would continue to monitor and review the support provided under the 'Homes for Ukraine' scheme. They pointed to how the current £350 monthly payments have already been exempted from tax. 'While Homes for Ukraine is an excellent initiative and I am delighted to be able to help, isn't the bigger picture that, by asking private citizens to host refugees, the government is effectively moving the responsibility and expense of housing refugees away from the state to members of the public? 'I can't imagine that local councils could find housing for refugees, other than in private homes, for a mere £350 a month. At the very least then the government and local authorities could concentrate on ensuring host families are paid on time.' A spokesperson from the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities told Mail Online: 'Sponsors are the backbone of the Homes for Ukraine scheme and we know the vast majority want to provide support for longer than six months, which is a testament to the generosity of people across the country. 'All arrivals have access to benefits from day one and we are giving councils an extra £10,500 per person cover any extra costs. 'We are contacting sponsors and Ukrainians directly to outline next steps and the support available to them.' It did not comment on whether or not an increase in the grant was being considered, advising those still waiting to be paid to contact their local councils. It comes as it was revealed this week how Ukrainian refugees are being kicked out by their host families because of said payment delays. Some 1,335 people who fled to the UK after Vladimir Putin's invasion are now listed as either homeless or at high risk because of a breakdown in relations with their sponsor. The Mail on Sunday reported that in several cases this is because of long delays to the £350-a-month 'thank you' payment, which has left volunteers having to dip into their own pockets to 'cover the cracks'. Simone Schehtman, a volunteer who has paired hundreds of Ukrainian refugees with hosts across Birmingham and the West Midlands, said: 'In general, local authorities have been very slow at delivering the payments and this has put some hosts under huge pressure. 'Most hosts thought they were going to be paid by the end of April, but in Birmingham the first payments came through last month.' She added that some hosts were on benefits themselves. 'Delays and rocketing bills have caused some host-refugee relationships to fracture, and I have personally wired several hundred pounds of charity donations to hosts to cover the cracks,' she said. The Homes for Ukraine scheme launched in March with the Government giving payments to councils to distribute. But the Local Government Association, which represents 361 councils in England and Wales, told the MoS it only received the money in June and was having to backdate payments. Tetiana Bilousova, 37, and her two children were evicted last month after her sponsor said they hadn't received any payment. 'The day I was evicted, there was no discussion,' she said. 'I came home from work and suddenly I was told that tomorrow a woman would call me to move us into a hotel. 'They did not try to find a compromise or talk through any problems. I had no idea that the Government had failed to pay them. 'Nobody was at fault, but sometimes English people can forget we just fled from war and that leaving Ukraine was not a happy experience. 'I think maybe the hosts misunderstood why I was in a bad mood and crying. 'Yes, my children are safe with me, but my mother and husband are still in Ukraine.' There are fears that many more Ukrainians will be evicted in the coming weeks, with councils obliged to ensure they still have a roof over their heads. 'We are really worried about what is going to happen,' said Lauren Scott, executive director of the charity Refugees at Home. 'We have had several Ukrainians asking us to find them new hosts.' Mariia Suslova, 65, was living in a sponsor home with her daughter-in-law Natalia, 41, and three-year-old granddaughter Sofiia but they were asked to leave a few weeks ago. She said: 'At the start, everything was great and we were very grateful to be there. We were told, 'Our house is your house', but this did not last long.' Mariia said the hosts became 'annoyed' by having a toddler in the home and the family are now staying in a hotel, hoping to find private accommodation. The charity National Family Mediation, which usually works with divorced couples, is training Ukrainians to act as mediators to ease any stresses between the refugees and their hosts. Meanwhile Refugee Minister Lord Harrington and Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, have been writing to host families to encourage them to carry on. A Government spokesman said that since the February invasion, more than 115,200 Ukrainians had arrived in the UK. They added: 'The overwhelming majority of people are settling in well but in the minority of cases where family or sponsor relationships break down, councils have a duty to ensure families are not left without a roof over their head. 'Councils also have access to a rematching service to find a new sponsor in cases under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.' It comes after a survey this month found that 26 per cent of UK hosts wanted to stop housing the refugee living with them after the minimum required time of six months, with a quarter of that number blaming the burdens of the cost of living crisis, according to the Office for National Statistics. Around 70 per cent of sponsors also said that inflation and the rising costs of bills hindered their ability to provide support to their refugee, and almost all of those surveyed said they have incurred extra costs during the scheme. This is despite the Government paying them £350 a month as a 'thank you'. The Homes for Ukraine Scheme, which was launched in March, brought in around 75,000 fleeing refugees into the UK. Sponsors had to agree to a minimum of six months when signing up to the scheme, but the cost of living crisis has meant that more than a third of Britons are now 'struggling financially' due to the rising costs of bills, fuel and the weekly food shop. Government figures also showed that 145 placements led to the refugee becoming homeless, due to the relationship with their sponsor breaking down or the accommodation being deemed 'unsuitable' before they had even moved in. Councils have now become concerned about the number of hosts who no longer want to continue housing their refugee, and the Local Government Association chairman James Jamieson is calling for the Government to increase the monthly 'thank you' payments. Jamieson said: 'There is a significant risk that - even if rematching is available - many Ukrainian families may need to present as homeless because of a lack of sponsors or other options. 'We hope a number of Homes for Ukraine sponsors continue to house Ukrainian refugees with them and we are talking to the Government about how we might encourage that. 'For instance, increasing the thank you payment to a higher amount so the sponsors can be sure it's not costing them Refugees minister Lord Richard Harrington said: 'We initially asked sponsors to host for a minimum of six months and we are working closely with councils to ensure Ukrainians have a safe place to live if they decide to move on. 'We are contacting sponsors directly to outline next steps and the support available to them.' Are you part of a Ukrainian family or a host who has had problems with the scheme?

2022-08-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11145493/British-father-dumped-partner-Ukrainian-going-new-love-war-torn-homeland.html,British father who dumped his partner for Ukrainian refugee they were hosting is going with his new love to her war-torn homeland in bid 'to save hundreds of lives',"A British father who dumped his partner for a Ukrainian refugee said he is going to return with his new love to her war-torn country in a bid 'to save hundreds of lives'. Former security guard Tony Garnett left his longtime partner Lorna Garnett, the mother of their two daughters, to start a new life with Sofiia Karkadym, 22, just ten days after she arrived from war torn Ukraine to start a new life in Britain. He is now raising money through skydiving so they can help orphan children in the sovereign state that was invaded earlier this year by Russia. The 29-year-old, who claims he lost his job over the affair, has now told Yorkshire Live: 'I have seen the full scale of things since meeting Sofiia and I think people need this help. It is not a game. I need to use my influence now to do the right thing. 'The longer [the war] goes on for then there's going to be more deaths - and some could be stopped with this help. 'I could save hundreds of lives. Even if I save the life of one person then that is worth it for me.' He added: 'It's the right thing to do. People are donating to Ukraine but they are not seeing where this money is going to. 'I want to raise money for people who look after orphans and all those that have been wounded. I want to travel over there myself and document who I am helping. Sofiia will be going with me. To aid in his efforts, he will skydive and has launched a GoFundMe fundraiser. Tony previously told the MailOnline that he and Sofiia hope to have children together - if doctors can reverse the vasectomy he had after having two children with his previous partner. He added: 'I want to propose to this beautiful lady.' Sofiia added: 'We are planning our life together. I want to be a mother. I want to have children. 'I am a young woman so it can wait a few years and I hope that Tony can have his vasectomy reversed so that we can become a family together.' The new couple had known each other for two months they they were already making plans in July to visit Sofiia's family back in Ukraine so that Tony can formally ask her father for his daughter's hand in marriage. Tony said: 'I want to say that out of Putin's evil has come something really good for me and her.' Tony said he will formally propose once their situation is more stable: 'I want to make it special so we're just going to wait until we have found somewhere proper to live where we can settle.' And in a less traditional move Tony, who has worked as a tattooist, proposes to mark their planned union by giving Sofiia an inking reading 'Queen' to go with the 'King' tattoo he already has on his neck. Sofiia said: 'I want to be his queen or his princess. I love him very much. I can't wait for us to get married.' He said: 'I want to make it so special and so romantic for her. We've talked about marriage and that doesn't mean that I can't surprise her with the proposal. I'll make it one that she will never forget. Tony said he and his bride-to-be would visit her father Ilya, 46, an antiques dealer in Ukraine as soon as it was safe to do so. 'She doesn't quite understand it. But I've explained to her that it is a respectful thing that British men do to go and ask a girl's father for her hand in marriage.' He went on: 'The reaction to us being a couple has just been mad! I picked up 5,000 Instagram followers yesterday and she got 7,000 for no reason at all. People are fascinated with us.' But the couple's social media reception has not been all pleasant. Tony said: 'We've had some quite horrible stuff posted about us on Instagram and other social media. 'But these people are just morons and cannot understand how people can fall in love even if it is only been a short time that they've known each other.' The couple was shocked to find abusive messages left for them online with Sofiia being branded a homewrecker. She said: 'The news about Tony and me has reached Ukraine and my family called me and said they were very upset and at one stage they said they were never going to talk to me again. 'But I have explained to them that Tony was not married and that we innocently fell in love and this is a permanent thing.' 'I was upset that my family read the stories that say a Ukrainian girl had gone to Britain and stolen somebody's husband. 'I am worried that the Russians will use this as propaganda to try and show the Ukrainians cause trouble wherever they go. He said: 'I decided that I wanted to take a refugee from Ukraine because I just want to do something meaningful and good. 'I kept thinking if England had been invaded they would be people hopefully who would take my children in other countries to safety. We all have to do our part. 'When I went to pick up Sofiia at Manchester Airport, I had no other motive than to make her feel welcome and comfortable and safe. 'The first thing I did was take her to a McDonald's drive-through where we had a Big Mac and got chatting. 'I realised she spoke English quite well and that meant we could be friends as well. 'On another day I took her back and she asked for a burger and beer which is apparently what they can do back in Ukraine. It made me really laugh.' The mother of Tony's kids, Lorna, ordered Sofiia to leave and accused the IT worker of making passes at her husband, but Garnett decided to pack his bags and leave with his new lodger. Tony insists that Sofiia's arrival in his life was not the cause of his break up with the mother of his two children: 'Lorna and I hadn't been getting on very well. I have moved out a couple of times and really we were living as friends and parents to our daughters, who we both love. 'We never got married because it wasn't something that I was interested in with her and I didn't want to have any more kids, which is why I had a vasectomy even though I was only in my mid 20s. 'The doctor tried to talk me out of it saying that it would be unfair on my partner and that I might change my mind in later years. 'But when I had it done I wasn't with her, so they agreed to do it. Now of course I wished I hadn't because I really wanna have children with Sofiia. 'She also doesn't understand why I had a vasectomy. But both of us are praying that it can be undone and we can have our own children.' Sofiia arrived at Tony's family home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, on May 4th after fleeing the conflict in her native Ukraine, but within days the pair had developed a connection. Sofiia, who left behind her divorced parents, a stepfather and 13-year-old sister Elizabeth, said she loved the Yorkshire accents but was struggling to understand some of the terms. 'I don't understand why people call each other ' love' or say things like 'I'll see you later'. 'I thought they said they would come to your house when they said they would see you later! 'But Tony explained to me that this is just the way that people talk around here. It's cool with me.' She said she had lost family and friends to the brutal invasion by Russia and decided to leave her country when she lost her job as an IT manager when her boss had to go and fight with the defence forces. 'I also lost my home because the rent went up really high and the landlady wanted to put some of her family into the room. 'So I had nowhere to live and no job and the war was going on around me. 'I thought 'I must get out of Ukraine ' and then I saw that I could come to Britain on the Internet and Tony and I began exchanging messages. I'm glad I made that decision. ' The 29-year-old told said that he and his new love have incurred a torrent of hateful abuse online over their decision, while some people threatened to try and get Sofiia deported. His relationship with his ex partner Lorna has also soured and he said he had been in contact with lawyers to gain proper time to see his children. The 29-year-old also revealed he has lost work because of the affair, and is caring for Sofiia full time after she contracted an eye infection which left her partially blind. He told the Daily Star: 'I've been trying to get by and survive with Sofiia with nowt. 'I want to show people that I'm not a scrounger for government benefits, I know what is right. 'I used to have a very successful business. I've dedicated myself to it, some weeks I put over 80 hours a week into it.' Tony added: 'Sofiia picked up an infection while on Germany and it got really bad when she arrived at Manchester Airport. She had an operation on it. 'She can only see partially through it at the moment and that's a bit worrying. But the doctors have said it will take six months for it to heal properly. 'She has just got a National Insurance number which will help with treatment.' Tony said that he ran a security firm that had contracts he lost due to his relationship attracting so much attention. He added: 'Now and again I'm sending door staff to pubs and clubs but I've gone from earning nearly 2k a week to earning jack s***.' MailOnline also told how Tony had released a rap criticising 'an ex'. He put out a YouTube song called 'Ukraine to UK Rain' in which he accuses an 'ex' of being 'two-faced' and playing with his emotions 'like a video console'. And he raps: 'I'm now with a blonde - but yes, my ex was a brunette.' The song describes Ukraine as 'a country torn apart with war crimes and bad pain'. It also includes the lines: 'Should I have stayed there just to be with my kids? No thank you, not today. You see my mental state forbids.'"
2022-08-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11144957/Russia-loses-territory-size-Denmark-Ukraine-amid-reports-heavy-losses-low-morale.html,"Russia has now lost territory the size of Denmark in Ukraine since March – as Putin’s forces continue to suffer heavy losses, fatigue and low morale","The Russian assault on Ukraine has almost ground to a halt amid heavy losses and low morale as it emerged that Putin's troops have lost territory the size of Denmark since late March. Russian forces have relinquished an estimated 17,375 square miles of Ukrainian land since March 21, when they withdrew from the outskirts of Kyiv to focus their efforts on the eastern Donbas region, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Meanwhile, analysis of troop movements and shifts in the frontlines of eastern and southern Ukraine by the Institute suggests that Russian units have only managed to gain roughly 174 square miles of new territory since July 16, despite committing all their resources to seizing the Donbas. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu yesterday claimed the slowdown in his military's progress in eastern Ukraine and its loss of 99 per cent of the territory it occupied in March was a 'conscious decision to avoid civilian casualties'. But Britain's defence minister Ben Wallace said yesterday the latest intelligence suggests Russia has lost up to 80,000 troops since crossing the Ukrainian border on February 24, while a top Ukrainian military intelligence official cited reports of morale and physical fatigue in Russian ranks due to Moscow's 'exhausted' resource base. Despite Shoigu's parroting of the Russian defence ministry's unwavering position that it does not target civilians, dozens of Ukrainian towns suffered strikes yesterday as the nation celebrated its independence day. One particularly brutal strike which targeted a train station in Chaplyne, a town of about 3,500 people in the central Dnipropetrovsk region, killed 25 civilians including an 11-year-old boy buried under the rubble of a house and a 6-year-old who was trapped in a car set ablaze in the explosions. The deputy head of the Ukrainian presidential office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said a total of 31 people sustained injuries in the attack, and the death toll could still rise as rescuers dig through the rubble. The strike served as a painful reminder that Russia is capable of employing military force that causes civilians to suffer the most and tests Ukraine's resilience after six months of a grinding war. Elsewhere in Ukraine, three people were killed in the eastern region of Donetsk on Wednesday and one more was wounded, Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram, while territory close to Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia was shelled in yet another attack, further stoking fears of a nuclear catastrophe. But despite the brutality of Russia's latest strikes, Putin's war effort in the eastern Donbas region appears to be faltering. Ukrainian General Staff reported that recent Russian attempts to advance positions in the north of the Donetsk region towards Izyum were thwarted, and a series of Ukrainian counter attacks have pushed Putin's troops further back into Donetsk. Similar counterattacks in the southern Mykolaiv and Dnepropetrovsk regions by Ukraine's armed forces forced their Russian foes back towards the city of Kherson - one of the first Ukrainian cities to be overran and seized by pro-Russian troops earlier in the war which Ukraine is now spoiling to retake. In a holiday message to the country yesterday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky exulted over Ukraine's success in fending off Moscow's forces since the invasion. 'On February 24, we were told: ''You have no chance.'' On August 24, we say: ''Happy Independence Day, Ukraine'',' he said. Zelensky had earlier pledged that Ukraine would fight 'until the end', branding Russian forces 'terrorists' and vowing to retake all occupied territory - including Crimea, which was seized from Kyiv in 2014. Outgoing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson marked Ukraine's Independence Day with a visit to Kyiv - his third since the war broke out and his last while still in office - and used the opportunity to announce a new £54million package of British military support. He also held a final round of face-to-face talks with Zelensky, with whom he has grown close, and was awarded the Ukrainian Order of Liberty for leading European support of Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. The US meanwhile announced a major new military aid package totalling nearly $3billion to help Ukrainian forces fight for years to come. Unveiling the huge support package yesterday, US President Joe Biden said: 'I know this Independence Day is bittersweet for many Ukrainians as thousands have been killed or wounded, millions have been displaced from their homes, and so many others have fallen victim to Russian atrocities and attacks. 'But six months of relentless attacks have only strengthened Ukrainians' pride in themselves, in their country, and in their 31 years of independence.'"

Have you been forced to close or reduce your opening hours? Email: stewart.carr@mailonline.co.uk Small firms are pleading for the Government to step in over sky-high energy bills, which have soared by as much as 400 per cent in some cases, leaving many fearing they could be put out of business by the end of the year. More than half of small companies — 54 per cent — fear their running costs could force them to close, according to a report by SME Insights and insurer Simply Business. Businesses are not protected by energy watchdog Ofgem's price cap and they face paying 20 per cent VAT on their energy bills, whereas most ordinary households pay five per cent. The crippling energy price increases are forcing many of Britain's remaining pubs, restaurants and high street businesses - which have scraped through lockdown - to reduce their hours, and in some cases, close permanently. Butcher's shop T & P. A. Murray in Bristol — known as 'Murray's' to its loyal regulars — closed its doors for the final time this month after 28 years at the premises, which has been occupied by a long line of butchers since the 1800s. Tom Murray, 65, had planned to leave his beloved business in the safe hands of Nathan Havnes, 32, who joined Murray's as an apprentice when he was 16. But supply costs have risen drastically, the price of beef and cheese for the deli counter is up 15 per cent, and the shop's £11,000 business rates bill is also expected to escalate. When Mr Martin's energy supplier raised his annual bill from £7,000 to £22,000, he says it left him with no choice but to close. 'It was the straw that broke the camel's back,' Mr Martin said. 'We made a £30,000 profit in a good year, but those energy bills would have left us with a loss. Abby McKellar, 46, is considering closing the holiday let business she runs with her husband Matt, 50, over winter in order to stay afloat. Little Norton Mill, which comprises four self-catering cottages and four apartments in rural Somerset, relies solely on electricity. In January, their energy bills increased by 70 per cent from £10,000 to £17,000 a year. And the couple fear they could spiral further when their fixed deal ends at the beginning of next year. Abby says: 'To soak up the electricity cost alone, we would have had to increase our prices by 10 per cent this year — and that does not even include all the other costs that are going up. 'If you raise those prices, people will just stop coming. It's a perfect storm.' 'Nathan has two sons and the last thing I wanted was to put him in a situation where he would struggle, which could affect his family life. 'It feels that while there is some support for households, small businesses have just been dropped by local councils and the government,' he adds. The story is far from isolated as thousands of small businesses, many of which struggled to survive through the pandemic, are on the verge of collapse due to the cost-of-living crisis. Last night, experts warned that the energy crisis could 'shut down' Britain this winter, leaving high streets devoid of pubs, shops and restaurants. Lily and Stuart Beaton have also been left with no alternative but to shut up shop. The family-run Ainsty Farm Shop in Green Hammerton, North Yorkshire, which has a butcher, baker and deli, has served its local community for 22 years. During the pandemic, they boxed up and hand-delivered food to older people in the nearby area who weren't able to leave their homes. But when the couple's gas and electricity deal ends in September, their bills are set to more than triple, from £20,000 to £76,000 a year. Lily, 52, says: 'We have no choice but to shut. Myself, my husband and my 18-year-old son Henry all work here full time, so we have basically all lost our jobs. 'You watch the news and hope that somebody is going to step in and do something about the energy crisis, but nobody has. 'I think we've been overlooked. Most small businesses don't run on big margins. We realised we would be making a loss once we paid that first bill. 'We can't pass on higher costs to our local customers, many of whom are retired. People are going to have to shop at places they can afford.' And Lily fears other enterprises will be forced to follow in their footsteps. 'At some point soon, people are going to want to treat themselves to fish and chips or want to pop to the local farm shop, and they won't be there,' the mother-of-three adds. Pubs are being driven towards 'extinction' by soaring energy bills – with as many as seven in ten saying they will not survive the winter. Two-thirds of pubs said their bills have more than doubled this year, while almost one in ten (8 per cent) have seen them rise by more than 500 per cent. And around 70 per cent of pubs surveyed by industry magazine The Morning Advertiser said they would go bust this winter without Government support – which the magazine warned amounts to 'extinction'. Businesses are not protected by the energy regulator's price cap, meaning pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK will be forced to pay market rates for gas and electricity. While Ofgem's household price cap is expected to rise from £2,700 to £3,700 in October – and by much more after that – businesses will be left at the mercy of volatile markets. It comes after industry leaders pointed out that if the price of beer had risen at the same rate as wholesale gas, a pint would cost £25. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said the sector was facing 'unsustainable' energy hikes, and called for business rates relief and the removal of VAT from energy bills until prices become affordable. She said: 'Without this support there is no doubt that many of the UK's most loved pubs and bars will not survive to see the New Year, robbing many of their livelihoods and ripping the heart out of communities across the UK.' Heath Ball, from the Frisco Group of three pubs in south-east England, warned the soaring bills posed an even bigger threat to the sector than the pandemic. Mr Ball said: 'Brits face the prospect of losing thousands of pubs if something isn't done soon to help.' Sacha Lord, Greater Manchester's night-time economy adviser, said staying in business was becoming 'near impossible' for many. 'I think we will see pubs closing at a record rate over the next 12 months,' he added. Nearly three-quarters of pub landlords say they have seen their utility bills double as they urged the Government to reduce VAT and business rates. Critics fear this could be the death knell for many of Britain's high streets. There were 20,200 fewer businesses between April and June this year than there were during the same period last year — the largest loss recorded by Labour researchers in five years. Clive Betts, Labour MP for Sheffield South East and chair of the Levelling Up Committee, says: 'I think for many struggling businesses, these soaring bills could be the tipping point. 'Empty shops make up 20 per cent of some high streets, and if this figure continues to multiply they will just become redundant because shoppers won't visit them. 'People looking to set up new businesses such as cafes and restaurants may also reconsider opening at all.' Independent retail expert Clare Bailey adds: 'The combination of these rising costs will inevitably prompt some small firms to reconsider if they need high street premises or whether they can do everything online instead. 'This will potentially lead to an increase in shops leaving the high street.' There was also a sharp increase in the number of companies applying for credit between April and July this year, research by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) shows. About 11.5 per cent made a credit application compared to a record low of 9.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Small businesses, which employ 16 million people among them, are particularly vulnerable to bill increases. This is because they are not protected by energy watchdog Ofgem's price cap — currently an average of £1,971 a year. Firms are also not entitled to government support, so are missing out on the £400 discount and £150 council tax rebate announced earlier this year. On top of this, many pay 20 per cent in VAT on energy bills — whereas most ordinary households pay 5 per cent. The FSB is now calling for the Government to step in and extend the price cap to Britain's smallest firms. While some local councils offer general hardship funds for firms in financial difficulties, there is no specific help with energy bill hikes. Alan Soady, an FSB spokesman, says: 'Small businesses are seeing astronomical and unsustainable hikes in energy bills right now. Without urgent support this is fast becoming an existential threat to some small firms, coming on top of a wider cost of doing business crisis. 'While domestic consumers quite rightly have at least some protection through the price cap and are being given direct cash support, there is no cap for small businesses and currently no financial support either, despite many seeing bills going up three-fold, four-fold and more.' In Droxford, Hampshire, pub landlord Shekhar Nailwal, 45, said he was left 'on his knees' with rocketing fuel, food and alcohol bills. It led to him and his wife, Alex, 39, to take the 'heartbreakingly sad' decision to close their much-loved The White Horse after eight years. The quaint village pub was well-loved in its local community for its unusual Indian menu served alongside traditional lagers and cosy inn decor, with a sprawling terrace garden. The closure means Mr and Mrs Nailwal may now have to move their two sons Rudra, 10, and Prem, 14, away from the village they have called home for the best part of a decade. The pub's energy bills have doubled and the price of a box of chicken has gone up by a whopping £25 from £30 to £55, leaving running costs completely unsustainable. The couple say Admiral Taverns, who they rented the pub from, refused to help Mr Nailwal said: 'The cost of everything is rising and we can’t keep passing that on to the customers because people are already suffering. 'In a cost of living crisis, the first thing to go is going to the pub and going out to eat. It’s not just simple numbers, it’s a lot of factors. 'We have been trying to sustain the costs since January. We luckily made it out of lockdown thanks to our customers and help from the government. But the cost of supplies and fuel has gone up so suddenly. 'It’s just all these small things adding up and adding up and suddenly the business is just not financially viable anymore. 'The worst part for us is our kids go to school here, we have brought our family up living upstairs from this pub. 'People travel for miles to come and eat here and they’re all devastated. We’re all just really, really upset.' Mrs Nailwal added: “We’ve invested so much time and effort into this place, even sacrificing our time with the kids for the sake of this pub and the community, which we love. 'It’s so heartbreaking because we feel like we’re all part of a big happy family but now we have to break up with them.' A spokesperson from Admiral Taverns said: 'We have 1,600 pubs across the country, and we work hard to work in partnership with all our licensees. 'The licensee has taken the decision to leave, and we are in the process of looking for a new licensee to take on the pub, and ensure the White Horse has a long-term, sustainable future.' In south Wales, pub landlords Colin Ross and Tom Davies say they were forced to quit their beloved pub due to 'astronomical' energy bills. The lifelong friends told Wales Online they are leaving the Hafodyrynys Inn, near Crumlin, 'with a tear in their eye' after 26 years . After narrowly making it through Covid restrictions, Mr Ross said a 'ridiculously high' increase in energy costs was 'the final nail in the coffin'. He said: 'Gas and electricity have more than doubled. Our contract expired at the end of July and we're on a new rate which is astronomical. Before, it was £700 monthly, which is high anyway, and it's gone up to near enough £2,000. It makes it impossible to stay here. 'I think something should be done about it because at the end of the day, more places are going to go out of business. It's not just businesses facing high bills, it's the customers, and they're not going to be coming out with extra money to spend on beer and food.' They said they were unable to negotiate a reduction in rent with owner Admiral Taverns, despite the sharp rise in inflation. The pair's last day will be September 4 and their Facebook page has been flooded with comments from saddened customers. One said: 'How sad to be reading this, you have dished up the best ever Sunday lunch and your staff are amazing."" Another wrote: 'Such devastating news. You have both worked so hard to build up the pub over the years, you're a credit to the trade.' Elsewhere, The Hand Hotel in the village of Llanarmon, near Wrexham, north Wales, is faced with running costs that have soared from £1,900 to £9,500 per month. Owner Jonathan Greatorex says he was shocked to open his renewal quote to see the eye-watering sums for the fine dining restaurant, which is featured in the Michelin Guide. He is now calling on the government to take action - and says ensuring that his staff are well-provided for is his priority. Mr Greatorex said: 'It is staggering. For many businesses these increases are not survivable. The increase in costs would see us paying four times our monthly mortgage for energy. 'Without action and support we will have to look at options like closing a couple of days a week or shorter opening hours. 'As with the Covid pandemic our first concern is the staff we have here, we feel that responsibility and will always put staff first.' Mr Greatorex says businesses are set to suffer with the surge in power bills - and warns jobs across the country will be at risk. He said: 'We have this moribund government playing a second rate game of The Apprentice and we can't wait until the September 5, when the winner will be announced, for action on this. 'There is also the obsession with the household cap and it is horrendous and invidious that families will be in the situation of choosing between eating and heating. But they have totally missed the effects on businesses. 'This will affect the very fabric of society once food shops and petrol stations start to close as they inevitably will without intervention. 'And how are households going to manage their bills if people are losing their jobs.' 'We can't just blame this on Russia, energy companies are making billions of pounds of extra profits this year. This is not a luxury item and they have a moral responsibility to do more to help.' The Hand's financial woes are a sad turnout for a restaurant which has been praised for offering 'destination dining at its best' in a review this month by Mail on Sunday. Reviewer Simon Hepinstall praised The Hand's head chef, Greg Mulholland, who has two AA Rosettes for 'culinary excellence' and has led its fine dining over the past 18 years. In another case, David Bright is CEO of Renovare Group, which has seven hospitality venues. He says one of its holdings, a small hotel in Wales, had an average monthly electricity bill of £2,000 prior to April of this year but his July bill has now come in at £7,000. Its heating system runs on oil and that was 35p a litre on average a year ago, yet this is now 92p. Mr Bright said: 'While we took a beating during covid which had a major impact on our situation, we are now faced with the inevitability of a stagnant 2023/24. 'It is clear that any profits we had projected will be swallowed up by the ridiculous raises in energy that we are being forced to swallow. Our losses will most likely equal those during covid. 'At the moment, I have made the difficult decision to shut two of the seven venues and I hope that with the savings made, we will be able to weather the storm. We employ over 70 people and I am pleased to say that those affected by the closures were either students returning to school or they were rehoused at other venues. 'This will not resolve itself soon. I have been forced to raise my prices by 5 per cent in the immediate future and we will have to look at it again before Christmas.' In Rotherham, South Yorkshire, couple Damien and Maxine Bailey closed their tattoo parlour Bailey's Body Art after 16 years, saying they could no longer manage the rising costs. Mrs Bailey told Mail Online they were devastated at its loss. She said: 'We gave our blood, sweat and tears, sometimes starved and went without anything good to keep it afloat and now it has gone. What a waste of our lives. 'We have children we hoped to pass it on to.... I worked in lockdown for this country and for what. We never had any financial assistance.' In a parting message, Mr Bailey posted that their 'hearts were broken' and they 'gave it all they had over 16 years'. In Edinburgh, much-loved pub Monty's in the popular Haymarket, says it is being forced to shut down after the double whammy of the pandemic and the rising cost in bills. The pub, which opened to much fanfare in 2016, has not announced a closure date yet said it would continue to serve 'while supplies last'. The pub made the announcement to customers on Instagram this month. They posted: 'After almost six years of building up our wee business, serving some of the best beers in town, amazing selection of whiskies and local spirits, and some amazing products, I have to announce that Monty's will be closing at the end of the month. 'Unfortunately the high rent, the pandemic, cost of living, rising costs of everything, it doesn't work in our favour. I have tried to fight for a rent reduction, unfortunately our landlords would like someone in with a more commercial offering.' Half of households face fuel poverty as soaring energy bills threaten a 'dramatic and catastrophic winter', a top energy boss has warned. EDF managing director Philippe Commaret sounded the alarm over rocketing energy prices as a new industry analysis suggested the typical annual cost of heat and light could hit an astonishing £6,552 by the spring. Separately, the National Grid is war-gaming the risk of gas and electricity shortages this winter amid claims that there is a one in ten chance of blackouts. The concerns raised by EDF, which is owned by the French government, suggests almost 14million families, pensioners and others will struggle to stay warm and put food on the table. In France, the Government has forced EDF to cap energy price rises at 4 per cent with the results annual bills are around £850 - half those in the UK. The company said the British government must take urgent action, starting with scrapping planned increases and the removal of the 5 per cent VAT on bills. Meanwhile, the Confederation of British Industry group has called on ministers to 'act decisively' to help thousands of businesses where high energy costs threaten oblivion. The industry regulator, Ofgem, is set to announce an increase in the price cap on tariff on Friday, which could add as much as £1,700 to annual energy bills by taking them up to an average of around £3,700. And there are predictions the figure could rise again to over £4,500 in January and, potentially, as much as £6,552 by April. The figure comes from analysts at Auxilione and is based on the volatile wholesale gas price on Monday. Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, says scores of firms have been struggling since late last year. He predicts many will try to stay open over Christmas, hoping for increased sales, but that the crunch point will come in the New Year. And with households having to tighten their own purse strings, he fears a bleak winter ahead. 'That's when the cash flow is normally under pressure and it could be the tipping point for many. 'We should have had this debate nine months ago. The warning signs were there,' Mr Goodacre adds. Tarun Gidoomal, general manager of wholesale marketplace Ankorstore, said: 'Tomorrow marks the announcement of a new energy price cap for consumers, however, it’s remarkable that no such cap exists to protect Britain’s independent retailers and small businesses. 'With the traditional renewal date of October 1st for fixed price energy contracts looming, 92 per cent of British independent retailers have stated that their local high street is already struggling, with three-quarters (74 per cent) believing that an upcoming recession will provide the largest threat to their survival, almost double the threat posed by COVID. Simply put - time is running out for the government to step up and protect retailers. 'We urge the government to introduce a price cap for British SMEs, including independent retailers and brands, as well as supporting BCC’s proposal for a temporary cut in VAT to 5% to reduce energy costs for businesses.' Nearly seven in ten firms now expect their energy bills to rise in the next three months, with almost a third predicting increases of more than 30 per cent, according to research by the Confederation of British Industry. Matthew Fell, chief policy director at the lobby group, says: 'The guiding principles for any intervention must be to act at speed, and to target help at those households and firms that need it most.' Tory leadership front runner Liz Truss has hinted she may help smaller companies but would not 'reach first for the handout'. In an interview with the Sun on Sunday she said: 'I'm very, very aware that it's not just customers, or consumers, that are facing energy price problems, it's small businesses.' But along with rocketing energy bills, small businesses are also facing increased costs in supply chains with the hike in food and fuel costs, and many are juggling debt repayments after signing up for bounce-back loans during the pandemic. Independent retailers were given 100 per cent relief on business rates in 2020, to help them through the pandemic. But this relief was slashed to 66 per cent in July 2021, and then to 50 per cent in April this year. Meanwhile, most Scottish firms are now back to paying full business rates —unless they are eligible for Scotland's Small Business Bonus Scheme And rates are set to surge even higher next year — as increases are pegged against next month's Consumer Price Index inflation figure, which is predicted to hit 13.3 per cent. Real estate advisory firm Altus Group estimates that even at 11 per cent, it would add £3 billion to businesses' tax bills in England — the single biggest jump in the space of a year since the tax was introduced in 1990. Val Burrows, 64, who runs a launderette in East Grinstead, West Sussex, saw her energy bills rise by 173 per cent when her fixed offer ended in July. And unlike other high street businesses, she says she cannot cut back on energy usage. Miss Burrows, who lives in nearby Lindfield, thinks that the Government should impose a blanket energy cap for businesses, and that there should be emergency funds available like those given out during the pandemic. As a sole trader, she says she has to continue until her lease ends next year. 'But then I may have to consider shutting up shop if I don't get financial help,' she says. A spokesman from the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy says: 'No national government can control the global factors pushing up the price of energy, but we will continue to support business in navigating the months ahead.' It adds that this support includes slashing fuel duty by 5p per litre for a year until March 2023, and the 50 per cent business rates relief. > Has your business been affected by the energy price hike? Email: stewart.carr@mailonline.co.uk Homeowners face paying more on their energy bills than their MORTGAGES, warn experts amid fears annual bills will hit £6,823 in April... as Britons brace for Ofgem's October price cap announcement TOMORROW By Matthew Lodge and Katie Feehan for MailOnline Experts have warned homeowners face paying more on their energy bills than their mortgages amid fears annual bills will hit £6,823 in April. As Britons brace for Ofgem to announce October's price cap tomorrow, households across the country could face even more misery on the horizon after a dire warning that energy bills could top mortgage repayments next year. Energy consultancy Auxilion says prices could spike at £6,823 a year from next April, which amounts to about £569 per month - higher than the average monthly repayment for a standard variable rate (SVR) mortgage, which is £516. This means some households could end up paying £53 more on their utility bills than their mortgage as runaway energy prices overtake the cost of owning a home. Britons are set to receive an 80 per cent hike in energy bills when the autumn price cap comes into effect from October 1, with forecasts predicting average costs could increase to more than £3,500, with one think tank saying bills could be 'says could be 'a serious threat to families' physical and financial health this winter'. An analysis by Cornwall Insight predicts average costs will increase to £3,554 in October and £4,650 in January - a massive jump from today's £1,971, which is already a record, and much higher than £1,138 last winter. Experts are calling for a 1 per cent increase on income tax to help pay for energy bill reductions for the UK's poorest households amid warnings the country faces a 'catastrophe' this winter without intervention. An independent think tank has said millions of households are faced with 'totally unmanageable' increase in gas and electricity bills, with people expecting to pay around double for their energy this winter than at the same time last year. The Resolution Foundation is calling for a 30 per cent reduction in energy bills for people on benefits and households where no one earns more than £25,000, with smaller reductions for those where no one earns more than £40,000. Suppliers have attempted to step up their support of those hit hardest by the price increases, with British Gas pledging to use 10 per cent of its profits to help its worst-hit customers. Chris O'Shea, chief of executive of Centrica, which owns the company, has pledged to donate £12million this autumn, and said that grants of up to £750 would be available for customers. The Government has already pledged to £30billion to help households struggling with soaring energy bills, which have been driven up surging gas prices caused by the war in Ukraine and has contributed to levels of inflation not seen in decades. One minister has said there is 'no question' there will be a 'further package of support measures' to deal with the cost of living crisis, although what form this takes could depend on who becomes the next Prime Minister, with Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss offering different solutions. Charities have warned that many people could face hardship during the colder months of the year when they may be forced to choose between 'eating or heating'. Citizens Advice said that a quarter of people in the UK will not be able to afford to pay their energy bills in October based on current forecasts, jumping to a third of people in January when prices will soar higher. It said its analysis took into account the energy rebate and cost-of-living payments offered by the Government, showing that the support on offer does not go far enough to protect households from spiralling costs. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: 'Every single day at Citizens Advice we're already helping people in the most heart-breaking circumstances, trying to scrape together enough to feed their kids and keep the lights on. This will get far, far worse unless the Government acts. 'It's becoming increasingly clear that skyrocketing prices will swallow up all of the help that has been announced so far.' Furthermore, disability charity Scope said that disabled people are likely to be harder hit when October's energy price hikes come into force. 'Scope has been inundated with calls from disabled people who have been forced to make dire cutbacks on personal care, hygiene, food and energy because of rampaging inflation,' said Tom Marsland, policy manager at Scope. 'This is having a devastating impact on disabled people's lives, and the support from Government just won't touch the side.' Scope said it had heard from people who are forced to stop heating their homes to power lifesaving equipment and others who are skipping meals so their children can eat, the charity told the PA news agency. It also noted that referrals to its disability energy support service had increased five-fold between February and July, compared to the same period last year, partly because of rising costs. Energy prices could spike at as much as £6,823 per year for the average household from next April, according to the latest forecast by energy consultancy Auxilion, which amounts to about £569 a month. In comparison, the average bill in October 2021 was £1,400 a year. Homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages pay £741 a month on average, according to the latest data from trade body UK Finance, compiled in December. That means homeowners could see just a £172 difference in the cost of paying their mortgage and heating their home. For those with a standard variable rate (SVR) mortgage, the figures are even starker. The average SVR mortgage monthly repayment, which borrowers can be transferred to once their fixed or tracker mortgage deal comes to an end, amounts to £516, UK Finance said. That means that some households could end up paying £53 more on their utility bills than their mortgage as runaway energy prices overtake the cost of owning a home. Meanwhile, people tied to a tracker mortgage, which directly track the Bank of England's base rate, will see around £50 added to their typical costs, according to calculations by the trade body. And renters are set to face even more drastic mounting costs amid the cost-of-living crisis. Rents have spiralled over the past few years and the average monthly cost of a newly let property reached £1,166 in July, or £2,008 for Greater London, according to figures from estate agents Hamptons. Such rapid price growth means that the average two-bed home, at £1,068pcm, now costs what the average three-bed cost just 16 months ago. While the average one-bed, at £929pcm, is now worth what the average two-bed cost two years ago, Hamptons said. The combined effect of higher mortgage repayments or monthly rent and surging bills could put some people under serious financial pressure in the months ahead. In a report published this week, the Resolution Foundation said none of the plans in place at the moment are enough to help those threatened with fuel poverty this winter. The foundation, which aims to improve the standard of living for people on low or middle incomes, said the country is facing a 'catastrophe' and the 'explosion that we are now on course for will be totally unmanageable for millions of households'. It called on the new Prime Minister - whether that be Mr Sunak or Ms Truss - to 'introduce radical new policy support ' to prevent the energy crisis 'becoming a serious threat to families' physical and financial health this winter'. The think tank said energy bill freezes and solidarity taxes, or social tariffs costing billions would be needed to help families who 'simply don't have' money to pay bills which are around £2,000 more than this time last year. A letter to the Government from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has urged ministers to hand more power to Ofgem, cut VAT and introduce pandemic-style emergency grants to help enterprises facing rocketing costs. It comes as an analysis by Cornwall Insight shows that companies looking for new energy contracts this autumn will end up paying more than four times than they paid at the same time in 2020. There are concerns thousands of businesses could go bust as they struggle to keep up with the soaring energy bills. Paul Wilson, policy director of the Federation of Small Businesses, told the Financial Times: 'We don't have the luxury of waiting any longer . . . winter could spell the end for many businesses and they need help now. 'If we don't address the cost of doing business crisis we'll keep on seeing costs being passed on to hard-hit consumers, or even worse people will lose their jobs.' Shevaun Haviland, director-general of the BCC, added that its plans were 'about protecting jobs, securing livelihoods, and creating a vibrant and prosperous society for everyone'. It said the £30billion that has already been pledged is not enough, and has called for a 30 per cent bill reduction for people on benefits or with no one in the household earning more than £25,000. It also wants smaller reductions for homes with no one earning over £40,000, saying all three of these changes put in place would cost £15.4billion but would help 94 per cent of the poorest households. The foundation said this could be offset by a 'solidarity tax' rise of 1 per cent on all income tax rates, which would raise £9.5billion, 60 per cent of which would be paid by the fifth wealthiest households. It said this would be an improvement on policies suggest by Mr Sunak, Ms Truss and opposition parties. The report - titled 'A Chilling Crisis' - says Ms Truss' plans to reverse a rise National Insurance contributions and implement tax cuts 'are largely irrelevant to the problem facing the country this winter'. It said reversing the recent NI rise would see 'twice as much of the benefit go to the top twentieth as the entire bottom half', adding would raise incomes in London by twice as much as some other regions, despite energy bills rising across the country. The foundation said that Mr Sunak's plan to give targeted payments to people on benefits 'would make a major difference this winter', saying that 'there is a strong case' for his plans to give a second round of £650 Cost of Living payments to 7.3million households on means tested benefits. But it said this policy would create a 'very large cliff edge' where people not on benefits or earning just over the cut off amount end up missing out on £1,300 of support. It added this payment also wouldn't be enough to cover the expected increase in bills. The report said the price cap freeze suggested by Labour would 'have a large impact', but said it would be 'very expensive', costing £36billion this winter, and potentially a further £64billion if continued through next winter. It added the scheme would 'give marginally more help to richer than poorer households and blunt incentives that we would be more worried about for higher income households to reduce consumption'. By Richard Pendlebury for the Daily Mail Boris Johnson has warned that UK households must endure soaring energy bills for the sake of Ukrainian civilians, who are 'paying with blood' for Vladimir Putin's aggression. The Prime Minister defied Russian missile attacks to visit Kyiv on a surprise trip to mark Ukraine's Independence Day, where he was mobbed by onlookers as he strode through the sunny capital with president Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr Johnson said he had come to underline Britain's unwavering, long-term commitment to Ukraine on what is also the six-month anniversary of Putin's invasion. He told Mr Zelensky that his country 'can and will win the war' in the face of Russian imperialism, while also unveiling a new transfer of cutting-edge drones. On his trip, Mr Johnson underscored the tough domestic ramifications for the UK. He said British households would 'have to endure the cost of living crisis' in order to counter Russia's 'inevitable manipulation of energy prices'. He added: 'While people are paying energy bills, people in Ukraine are paying with blood.' The dramatic intervention on the cost of living crisis came as new figures showed that Britain imported no fuel from Russia in the month of June – for the first time since records began 25 years ago – while other imports from Russia dived by 96.6 per cent. Jonny Marshall, Senior Economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: 'A catastrophe is coming this winter as soaring energy bills risk causing serious physical and financial damage to families across Britain. 'We are on course for thousands to see their energy cut off entirely, while millions will be unable to pay bills and build up unmanageable arrears. 'The new Prime Minister will need to think the unthinkable in terms of the policies needed to get sufficient support to where it's needed most. 'Significant additional support should be targeted at those most exposed to rising bills and least able to cope with them, and be watertight so that no-one falls through the cracks. 'But none of the proposals from the leadership candidates or the opposition parties currently do this. 'An innovative social tariff could provide broader targeted support but involves huge delivery challenges, while freezing the price cap gives too much away to those least in need. 'This problem could be overcome with a solidary tax on high earners – an unthinkable policy in the context of the leadership debates, but a practical solution to the reality facing families this winter.' One Government minister has said he believes there will be a 'further package of support measures' to deal with the cost of living crisis and energy bills once a new Prime Minister is in place. No immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 after the Tory leadership contest. Will Quince told Tom Swarbrick on LBC radio: 'There is no question in my mind whatsoever, both listening to the two leadership candidates but also just looking at our economy, and also the challenges that people and businesses are facing up and down this country driven by Putin's barbaric invasion and occupation of Ukraine, that the Government is going to act and put in place a further package of support measures. 'Now, we will have to wait a couple of weeks for a new prime minister to set out their agenda alongside a new chancellor, but both leadership contenders have been clear there will be a fiscal event and more help will be coming.' Energy watchdog Ofgem, which has been criticised over its handling of the crisis, is set to announce another huge rise to its price cap tomorrow, which will come into effect on October 1. Analyst Cornwall Insight now predicting average costs will increase to £3,554 in October and £4,650 in January - a massive jump from today's £1,971, which is already a record, and much higher than £1,138 last winter. On Thursday, Which? warned the Government to raise its energy bills discount by at least 150% or risk pushing millions of households into financial distress. The consumer watchdog said the Government's financial support for all households must increase from the current £400 to £1,000 - or from £67 to £167 per month from October to March. The existing support package is inadequate to protect living standards for those on the lowest incomes, it said. When the Government first announced its financial support package in May, the energy price cap was predicted to reach around £2,800 in October. On Wednesday, Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi insisted 'nothing is off the table' when it comes to action on soaring energy bills, but added that a freeze in the price cap would not deliver 'targeted help' for those who need it most. In the meantime, the boss of British Gas has said it will give 10 per cent of energy profits to its poorest customers. Chris O'Shea, chief of executive of Centrica, which owns British Gas, has pledged to donate £12million this autumn, and said that grants of up to £750 would be available for customers. He added that a further 10 per cent of profits would be donated every six months until the energy crisis resolves itself. The promise could see as much as £60million made available for the company's poorest customers and is the first promise of its kind to be made by an energy firm. Mr O'Shea told the Sun that 'many people are facing really tough choices'. He said: 'We don't have a silver bullet and we know this fund can't reach everyone. But I believe it can help make a real difference for those who really need our support.' The grants of between £250 and £750 will be targeted to the tens of thousands of customers British Gas has identified will be in financial distress as a result of soaring energy costs. Mr O'Shea, who has headed Centrica since 2018 and earns £875,000 per year, revealed on July 28 that operating half-year profits at the firm had risen five fold to £1.34billion. Centrica's bumper profits for the six months to the end of June far outpaced the £262m recorded in the same period last year. The firm, which produces energy as well as selling it to households and businesses, announced it would restart its dividend at 1p per share after suspending it for three years - sparking a backlash from critics. The £12million offered to help customers is less than one per cent of Centrica's group profits, according to the Sun. Mr O'Shea blamed regulator Ofgem for not being able to lower customers' bills. He told the newspaper: 'Under the current system our regulator Ofgem sets the price you pay for energy to make sure everyone pays a fair price that reflects the actual cost of energy. 'If an energy supplier decided to charge below that cap, they will lose money quickly and will go out of business. 'We've already seen that if you don't have robust and resilient energy companies then consumers pay the price – each and every household in the UK is forking out £100 more this year on energy bills to pay for the collapse of multiple energy companies last year and this can't be allowed to happen again.' It comes as inflation hits double figures for the first time in 40 years, the highest it's been since 1982, at 10.1 per cent. Surging energy prices will be the key factor in driving inflation to 18.6 per cent - the highest level for nearly half a century - in January, according to financial services firm Citi. It says inflation of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation - which indicates the increase in the amount people pay for goods and services - will soar past the 13 per cent which the Bank of England previously said would be the peak in October, instead hitting the highest level since 1975 in the new year. Now, an estimated 45 million people will struggle to pay energy bills this winter with predicted rises in price cap. The new study, by the University of York, shows that 18 million families will be left trying to make ends meet after further predicted rises in the energy price cap in October and January. The energy price cap is forecast to rise above £3,600 for the average household from the start of October. It could then top £5,000 in January, and rise above £6,000 in April, according to the latest forecasts. Even with the support that has already been announced, the four million households in the UK with pre-payment meters will be spending around 44 per cent of their monthly disposable income on bills during the depths of winter. Thousands of people could see their power cut off if they are unable to pay for it up front, while millions of direct debit customers could fall behind on their bills and shred their credit ratings. The number of families falling behind on at least one utility bill increased from 9 per cent in October 2021 to 14 per cent in June."
2022-08-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11145025/Shell-Energy-pay-500-000-overcharging-thousands-customers.html,"Shell Energy will pay out more than £500,000 after overcharging thousands of customers for gas and electricity since the price cap was put in place three years ago","Shell Energy will pay more than £500,000 after overcharging thousands of customers for their gas and electricity. The business will be forced to return £106,000 to the 11,275 households it has been overcharging since the start of the price cap system in January 2019, regulator Ofgem today revealed. The energy firm will also pay out an extra £30,970 in goodwill payments to the affected customers and contribute £400,000 towards a support fund run by the regulator. It comes as Britons are bracing for an 80 per cent hike in energy bills to be announced tomorrow when the autumn price cap is revealed, with forecasts predicting average costs could increase to more than £3,500. Some people could pay almost double for their gas and electricity from October 1, it is feared, with energy regulator Ofgem set to reveal the amount suppliers can charge households on Friday. One think tank warned bills could be 'a serious threat to families' physical and financial health this winter'. An analysis by Cornwall Insight predicts average costs will increase to £3,554 in October and £4,650 in January - a massive jump from today's £1,971, which is already a record, and much higher than £1,138 last winter. Today Ofgem announced that thousands of Shell Energy customers had been overcharged between January 2019 and September 2022. The customers all have pre-payment meters - also known as 'pay-as-you-go' meters - where households top up their energy on smart cards or keys. Shell reported the problems to Ofgem itself after it discovered them in March 2022. It has since corrected the issue for most customers. Pre-payment Meters Shell Energy's overcharging issue is related to pre-payment meters. Also known as 'pay-as-you-go' meters - these are where households pay for energy before they use it. This is done by topping up their energy on smart cards or keys. When the card or key runs out of money, the energy cuts out and customers have to top up again. The energy price cap Shell Energy says the issue is related to the energy price cap, which was introduced in 2019 by energy regulator Ofgem. The price cap is intended to protect against overcharging by limiting the amount that suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity - measured in kWh (kilowatt hours). The company had apparently run into operational problems which meant that not all pre-payment meters were updated with the revised price cap levels when the cap changed twice a year. However those who have not topped up their gas meters since March 2022 will not have seen the fix come through yet. It will be implemented when they next top up. They are being refunded £9.40 on average. Ofgem director of retail Neil Lawrence said: 'Ofgem expects suppliers to adhere to the terms of contracts they have with customers, particularly ensuring they pay no more than the level of the price cap. 'Households across Britain are already struggling with rising energy bills and living costs. 'Overcharging by suppliers can cause additional and unnecessary stress and worry at what is already a very challenging time for consumers across the UK.' Shell Energy says the issue is related to the energy price cap, which was introduced in 2019 by energy regulator Ofgem. The price cap is intended to protect against overcharging by limiting the amount that suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity - measured in kWh (kilowatt hours). The company had apparently run into operational problems which meant that not all pre-payment meters were updated with the revised price cap levels when the cap changed twice a year. Pre-payment households are often considered by energy experts to be the most vulnerable on a supplier's books. It is not Shell Energy's first problem with the price cap. Between January and March 2019 the company overcharged 12,000 households by more than £100,000 in total. It agreed to pay £390,000 at the time to make up for the problems. Because Shell Energy reported the problem itself and has fixed the problem, Ofgem said it would not take 'formal enforcement action on this occasion'. Mr Lawrence said: 'Ofgem is always prepared to work with suppliers who have failed to comply with their obligations, but who have self-reported and are determined to put things right, as Shell has done here. 'The contributions Shell has made to the redress fund will help to support vulnerable consumers with their energy bills.' Shell Energy said: 'We're sincerely sorry that errors updating our prepayment meter rates resulted in some customers being overcharged for a period of time. 'As soon as we identified the issue we began taking steps to put it right, and self-reported it to Ofgem. 'The overcharge, which averages £9.40 per customer, will be refunded along with a gesture of goodwill. We will be writing to customers to let them know.' It comes as experts are today calling for a 1 per cent increase on income tax to help pay for energy bill reductions for the UK's poorest households amid warnings the country faces a 'catastrophe' this winter without intervention. An independent think tank has said millions of households are faced with 'totally unmanageable' increase in gas and electricity bills, with people expecting to pay around double for their energy this winter than at the same time last year. The Resolution Foundation is calling for a 30 per cent reduction in energy bills for people on benefits and households where no one earns more than £25,000, with smaller reductions for those where no one earns more than £40,000. Suppliers have attempted to step up their support of those hit hardest by the price increases, with British Gas pledging to use 10 per cent of its profits to help its worst-hit customers. Chris O'Shea, chief of executive of Centrica, which owns the company, has pledged to donate £12million this autumn, and said that grants of up to £750 would be available for customers. The Government has already pledged to £30billion to help households struggling with soaring energy bills, which have been driven up surging gas prices caused by the war in Ukraine and has contributed to levels of inflation not seen in decades. One minister has said there is 'no question' there will be a 'further package of support measures' to deal with the cost of living crisis, although what form this takes could depend on who becomes the next Prime Minister, with Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss offering different solutions. In a report published this week, the Resolution Foundation said none of the plans in place at the moment are enough to help those threatened with fuel poverty this winter. The foundation, which aims to improve the standard of living for people on low or middle incomes, said the country is facing a 'catastrophe' and the 'explosion that we are now on course for will be totally unmanageable for millions of households'. A letter to the Government from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has urged ministers to hand more power to Ofgem, cut VAT and introduce pandemic-style emergency grants to help enterprises facing rocketing costs. It comes as an analysis by Cornwall Insight shows that companies looking for new energy contracts this autumn will end up paying more than four times than they paid at the same time in 2020. There are concerns thousands of businesses could go bust as they struggle to keep up with the soaring energy bills. Paul Wilson, policy director of the Federation of Small Businesses, told the Financial Times: 'We don't have the luxury of waiting any longer . . . winter could spell the end for many businesses and they need help now. 'If we don't address the cost of doing business crisis we'll keep on seeing costs being passed on to hard-hit consumers, or even worse people will lose their jobs.' Shevaun Haviland, director-general of the BCC, added that its plans were 'about protecting jobs, securing livelihoods, and creating a vibrant and prosperous society for everyone'. It called on the new Prime Minister - whether that be Mr Sunak or Ms Truss - to 'introduce radical new policy support ' to prevent the energy crisis 'becoming a serious threat to families' physical and financial health this winter'. The think tank said energy bill freezes and solidarity taxes, or social tariffs costing billions would be needed to help families who 'simply don't have' the money to pay bills which are around £2,000 more than this time last year. It said the £30billion that has already been pledged is not enough, and has called for a 30 per cent bill reduction for people on benefits or with no one in the household earning more than £25,000. It also wants smaller reductions for homes with no one earning over £40,000, saying all three of these changes put in place would cost £15.4billion but would help 94 per cent of the poorest households. The foundation said this could be offset by a 'solidarity tax' rise of 1 per cent on all income tax rates, which would raise £9.5billion, 60 per cent of which would be paid by the fifth wealthiest households. It said this would be an improvement on policies suggest by Mr Sunak, Ms Truss and opposition parties. The report - titled 'A Chilling Crisis' - says Ms Truss' plans to reverse a rise National Insurance contributions and implement tax cuts 'are largely irrelevant to the problem facing the country this winter'. It said reversing the recent NI rise would see 'twice as much of the benefit go to the top twentieth as the entire bottom half', adding would raise incomes in London by twice as much as some other regions, despite energy bills rising across the country. The foundation said that Mr Sunak's plan to give targeted payments to people on benefits 'would make a major difference this winter', saying that 'there is a strong case' for his plans to give a second round of £650 Cost of Living payments to 7.3million households on means tested benefits. But it said this policy would create a 'very large cliff edge' where people not on benefits or earning just over the cut off amount end up missing out on £1,300 of support. It added this payment also wouldn't be enough to cover the expected increase in bills. The report said the price cap freeze suggested by Labour would 'have a large impact', but said it would be 'very expensive', costing £36billion this winter, and potentially a further £64billion if continued through next winter. It added the scheme would 'give marginally more help to richer than poorer households and blunt incentives that we would be more worried about for higher income households to reduce consumption'."

As Briton's brace for Ofgem to announce October's price cap tomorrow, households across the country could face even more misery on the horizon after a dire warning that energy bills could top mortgage repayments next year. Energy consultancy Auxilion says prices could spike at £6,823 a year from next April, which amounts to about £569 per month - higher than the average monthly repayment for a standard variable rate (SVR) mortgage, which is £516. This means some households could end up paying £53 more on their utility bills than their mortgage as runaway energy prices overtake the cost of owning a home. Britons are set to receive an 80 per cent hike in energy bills when the autumn price cap comes into effect from October 1, with forecasts predicting average costs could increase to more than £3,500, with one think tank saying bills could be 'says could be 'a serious threat to families' physical and financial health this winter'. An analysis by Cornwall Insight predicts average costs will increase to £3,554 in October and £4,650 in January - a massive jump from today's £1,971, which is already a record, and much higher than £1,138 last winter. Experts are calling for a 1 per cent increase on income tax to help pay for energy bill reductions for the UK's poorest households amid warnings the country faces a 'catastrophe' this winter without intervention. An independent think tank has said millions of households are faced with 'totally unmanageable' increase in gas and electricity bills, with people expecting to pay around double for their energy this winter than at the same time last year.

One minister has said there is 'no question' there will be a 'further package of support measures' to deal with the cost of living crisis, although what form this takes could depend on who becomes the next Prime Minister, with Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss offering different solutions. Charities have warned that many people could face hardship during the colder months of the year when they may be forced to choose between 'eating or heating'. Citizens Advice said that a quarter of people in the UK will not be able to afford to pay their energy bills in October based on current forecasts, jumping to a third of people in January when prices will soar higher. It said its analysis took into account the energy rebate and cost-of-living payments offered by the Government, showing that the support on offer does not go far enough to protect households from spiralling costs. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: 'Every single day at Citizens Advice we're already helping people in the most heart-breaking circumstances, trying to scrape together enough to feed their kids and keep the lights on. This will get far, far worse unless the Government acts. 'It's becoming increasingly clear that skyrocketing prices will swallow up all of the help that has been announced so far.' Furthermore, disability charity Scope said that disabled people are likely to be harder hit when October's energy price hikes come into force. 'Scope has been inundated with calls from disabled people who have been forced to make dire cutbacks on personal care, hygiene, food and energy because of rampaging inflation,' said Tom Marsland, policy manager at Scope. 'This is having a devastating impact on disabled people's lives, and the support from Government just won't touch the side.' Scope said it had heard from people who are forced to stop heating their homes to power lifesaving equipment and others who are skipping meals so their children can eat, the charity told the PA news agency. It also noted that referrals to its disability energy support service had increased five-fold between February and July, compared to the same period last year, partly because of rising costs. Energy prices could spike at as much as £6,823 per year for the average household from next April, according to the latest forecast by energy consultancy Auxilion, which amounts to about £569 a month. In comparison, the average bill in October 2021 was £1,400 a year. Homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages pay £741 a month on average, according to the latest data from trade body UK Finance, compiled in December. That means homeowners could see just a £172 difference in the cost of paying their mortgage and heating their home. For those with a standard variable rate (SVR) mortgage, the figures are even starker. The average SVR mortgage monthly repayment, which borrowers can be transferred to once their fixed or tracker mortgage deal comes to an end, amounts to £516, UK Finance said. That means that some households could end up paying £53 more on their utility bills than their mortgage as runaway energy prices overtake the cost of owning a home. Meanwhile, people tied to a tracker mortgage, which directly track the Bank of England's base rate, will see around £50 added to their typical costs, according to calculations by the trade body. And renters are set to face even more drastic mounting costs amid the cost-of-living crisis. Rents have spiralled over the past few years and the average monthly cost of a newly let property reached £1,166 in July, or £2,008 for Greater London, according to figures from estate agents Hamptons. Such rapid price growth means that the average two-bed home, at £1,068pcm, now costs what the average three-bed cost just 16 months ago. While the average one-bed, at £929pcm, is now worth what the average two-bed cost two years ago, Hamptons said. The combined effect of higher mortgage repayments or monthly rent and surging bills could put some people under serious financial pressure in the months ahead. In a report published this week, the Resolution Foundation said none of the plans in place at the moment are enough to help those threatened with fuel poverty this winter. The foundation, which aims to improve the standard of living for people on low or middle incomes, said the country is facing a 'catastrophe' and the 'explosion that we are now on course for will be totally unmanageable for millions of households'.

By Richard Pendlebury for the Daily Mail Boris Johnson has warned that UK households must endure soaring energy bills for the sake of Ukrainian civilians, who are 'paying with blood' for Vladimir Putin's aggression. The Prime Minister defied Russian missile attacks to visit Kyiv on a surprise trip to mark Ukraine's Independence Day, where he was mobbed by onlookers as he strode through the sunny capital with president Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr Johnson said he had come to underline Britain's unwavering, long-term commitment to Ukraine on what is also the six-month anniversary of Putin's invasion. He told Mr Zelensky that his country 'can and will win the war' in the face of Russian imperialism, while also unveiling a new transfer of cutting-edge drones. On his trip, Mr Johnson underscored the tough domestic ramifications for the UK. He said British households would 'have to endure the cost of living crisis' in order to counter Russia's 'inevitable manipulation of energy prices'. He added: 'While people are paying energy bills, people in Ukraine are paying with blood.' The dramatic intervention on the cost of living crisis came as new figures showed that Britain imported no fuel from Russia in the month of June – for the first time since records began 25 years ago – while other imports from Russia dived by 96.6 per cent. Jonny Marshall, Senior Economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: 'A catastrophe is coming this winter as soaring energy bills risk causing serious physical and financial damage to families across Britain. 'We are on course for thousands to see their energy cut off entirely, while millions will be unable to pay bills and build up unmanageable arrears. 'The new Prime Minister will need to think the unthinkable in terms of the policies needed to get sufficient support to where it's needed most. 'Significant additional support should be targeted at those most exposed to rising bills and least able to cope with them, and be watertight so that no-one falls through the cracks. 'But none of the proposals from the leadership candidates or the opposition parties currently do this. 'An innovative social tariff could provide broader targeted support but involves huge delivery challenges, while freezing the price cap gives too much away to those least in need. 'This problem could be overcome with a solidary tax on high earners – an unthinkable policy in the context of the leadership debates, but a practical solution to the reality facing families this winter.' One Government minister has said he believes there will be a 'further package of support measures' to deal with the cost of living crisis and energy bills once a new Prime Minister is in place. No immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 after the Tory leadership contest. Will Quince told Tom Swarbrick on LBC radio: 'There is no question in my mind whatsoever, both listening to the two leadership candidates but also just looking at our economy, and also the challenges that people and businesses are facing up and down this country driven by Putin's barbaric invasion and occupation of Ukraine, that the Government is going to act and put in place a further package of support measures. 'Now, we will have to wait a couple of weeks for a new prime minister to set out their agenda alongside a new chancellor, but both leadership contenders have been clear there will be a fiscal event and more help will be coming.' Energy watchdog Ofgem, which has been criticised over its handling of the crisis, is set to announce another huge rise to its price cap tomorrow, which will come into effect on October 1. Analyst Cornwall Insight now predicting average costs will increase to £3,554 in October and £4,650 in January - a massive jump from today's £1,971, which is already a record, and much higher than £1,138 last winter. On Thursday, Which? warned the Government to raise its energy bills discount by at least 150% or risk pushing millions of households into financial distress. The consumer watchdog said the Government's financial support for all households must increase from the current £400 to £1,000 - or from £67 to £167 per month from October to March. The existing support package is inadequate to protect living standards for those on the lowest incomes, it said. When the Government first announced its financial support package in May, the energy price cap was predicted to reach around £2,800 in October. On Wednesday, Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi insisted 'nothing is off the table' when it comes to action on soaring energy bills, but added that a freeze in the price cap would not deliver 'targeted help' for those who need it most. In the meantime, the boss of British Gas has said it will give 10 per cent of energy profits to its poorest customers. Chris O'Shea, chief of executive of Centrica, which owns British Gas, has pledged to donate £12million this autumn, and said that grants of up to £750 would be available for customers. He added that a further 10 per cent of profits would be donated every six months until the energy crisis resolves itself. The promise could see as much as £60million made available for the company's poorest customers and is the first promise of its kind to be made by an energy firm. Mr O'Shea told the Sun that 'many people are facing really tough choices'. He said: 'We don't have a silver bullet and we know this fund can't reach everyone. But I believe it can help make a real difference for those who really need our support.' The grants of between £250 and £750 will be targeted to the tens of thousands of customers British Gas has identified will be in financial distress as a result of soaring energy costs. Mr O'Shea, who has headed Centrica since 2018 and earns £875,000 per year, revealed on July 28 that operating half-year profits at the firm had risen five fold to £1.34billion. Centrica's bumper profits for the six months to the end of June far outpaced the £262m recorded in the same period last year. The firm, which produces energy as well as selling it to households and businesses, announced it would restart its dividend at 1p per share after suspending it for three years - sparking a backlash from critics. The £12million offered to help customers is less than one per cent of Centrica's group profits, according to the Sun. Mr O'Shea blamed regulator Ofgem for not being able to lower customers' bills. He told the newspaper: 'Under the current system our regulator Ofgem sets the price you pay for energy to make sure everyone pays a fair price that reflects the actual cost of energy. 'If an energy supplier decided to charge below that cap, they will lose money quickly and will go out of business. 'We've already seen that if you don't have robust and resilient energy companies then consumers pay the price – each and every household in the UK is forking out £100 more this year on energy bills to pay for the collapse of multiple energy companies last year and this can't be allowed to happen again.' It comes as inflation hits double figures for the first time in 40 years, the highest it's been since 1982, at 10.1 per cent. Surging energy prices will be the key factor in driving inflation to 18.6 per cent - the highest level for nearly half a century - in January, according to financial services firm Citi. It says inflation of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation - which indicates the increase in the amount people pay for goods and services - will soar past the 13 per cent which the Bank of England previously said would be the peak in October, instead hitting the highest level since 1975 in the new year. Now, an estimated 45 million people will struggle to pay energy bills this winter with predicted rises in price cap. The new study, by the University of York, shows that 18 million families will be left trying to make ends meet after further predicted rises in the energy price cap in October and January. The energy price cap is forecast to rise above £3,600 for the average household from the start of October. It could then top £5,000 in January, and rise above £6,000 in April, according to the latest forecasts. Even with the support that has already been announced, the four million households in the UK with pre-payment meters will be spending around 44 per cent of their monthly disposable income on bills during the depths of winter. Thousands of people could see their power cut off if they are unable to pay for it up front, while millions of direct debit customers could fall behind on their bills and shred their credit ratings. The number of families falling behind on at least one utility bill increased from 9 per cent in October 2021 to 14 per cent in June."
2022-08-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11144589/Nuclear-disaster-fears-Russia-plans-disconnect-Zaporizhzhia-plant-Ukraines-power-grid.html,Will Putin's troops cause another Chernobyl disaster? Russian-held nuclear plant is cut off from Ukraine's power grid due to nearby FIRE – risking cooling system failure,"The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the middle of the fighting in Ukraine was temporarily cut off from the electrical grid on Thursday because of fire damage. Ukraine's state operator Energoatom said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was severed from the national network for the first time in its history after one of its four power line was twice disconnected by ash pit fires in an adjacent thermal power plant. The three other power lines 'were earlier damaged during terrorist attacks' by Russian forces, the operator said. The incident caused a blackout in the region and heightened fears of a catastrophe in a country haunted by the Chernobyl disaster. The complex, Europe's largest nuclear plant, has been occupied by Russian forces and operated by Ukrainian workers since the early days of the invasion six months ago in order to divert power to the Crimean peninsula annexed by Putin's forces in 2014. Russian fire and artillery damage to Europe's biggest nuclear facility, in war-torn south-eastern Ukraine, reportedly forced its occupiers to unplug the site to protect energy flows to Moscow-held territories. Energoatom had warned this morning that such a move would jeopardise its cooling systems and risk a mass nuclear meltdown. Energoatom confirmed via Telegram this afternoon: 'The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of [Zaporizhzhia] from the power grid - the first in the history of the plant. External power is essential to cool the two reactors still in operation at the Zaporizhzhia site. Without electricity to power the pumps which keep the hot reactor core cool, nuclear fuel will start to melt. Last week, while the final power line was still connected, Ukraine's nuclear agency said losing the supply would lead to this happening, 'resulting in a release of radioactive substances to the environment'. A power supply is also vital to keep spent radioactive fuel stored in special onsite facilities cool. Speaking last week, Professor Paul Norman, Professor of Nuclear Physics & Nuclear Energy at the University of Birmingham told the Science Media Centre that nuclear reactors need constant cooling, even after they have been shut down. He added that: 'Damaging certain cooling systems could also prevent the reactor from properly cooling itself and lead to overheating – a 'meltdown'.' The plant has backup diesel generators to provide electricity if it is disconnected from the grid but Ukraine has warned these are unlikely to be reliable in the long-term. 'There are currently no comments on the operation of automation and safety systems. 'Start-up operations are underway to connect one of the power units to the grid.' The dire update came as Ukrainian staff at the nuclear power plant said they are being tortured by FSB agents to prevent them from telling UN safety inspectors about the risks at the site. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are expected to have access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in the coming days. But workers at the occupied plant said they fear Russia will set up false flag attacks for when the IAEA inspectors arrive that they will blame on Ukraine. Continued fighting near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has heightened fears of a Chernobyl-style catastrophe that could affect hundreds of thousands of people. Regional mayor Dmytro Orlov said nearby Russian-occupied town Enerhodar was in the midst of a blackout and residents had no access to running water as a result of the disconnection. Zaporizhzhia has been occupied by Moscow's troops since the first weeks of the war. It has remained on the frontlines ever since, with Moscow and Kyiv trading blame over shelling around the complex. Energoatom said the plant was disconnected from Ukraine's national supply system after a power line was twice disconnected by fires at ash pits in an adjacent thermal power plant. The three other power lines 'were earlier damaged during terrorist attacks' by Russian forces, the operator said. As a result, the two of the plant's six reactors still functioning 'were disconnected from the network'. Kyiv officials have said they believe Moscow has seized the station in order to divert power to the Crimean peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. Energoatom could not be immediately reached for comment on whether the supply had been diverted, AFP reported. Earlier today Energoatom chief Petro Kotin said he has seen Russian engineers' detailed plans to cut off the power plant from Ukraine's power grid and instead connect it to the Russian network in the event that fighting severs the remaining power lines. Kotin feared that Putin's men are now targeting the plant's power lines connecting it to Ukraine's grid to make that scenario a reality, The Guardian reported. If Russia's plan went ahead, he said, it would lead to a catastrophic failure of the cooling systems. External power is essential not just to cool the two reactors still in operation at the Zaporizhzhia site, but also the spent radioactive fuel stored in special facilities onsite. Ukraine claims Russia is essentially holding the Soviet-era nuclear plant hostage, storing weapons there and launching attacks from around it. Kotin feared Russian forces are targeting the plant's power lines that connect the site to Ukraine's grid so that Russia can connect the plant to their power network. He told the newspaper: 'You cannot just switch from one system to another immediately. You have to shutdown everything on one side, and then you start to switch on another side.' Kotin added: 'During this disconnection, the plant won't be connected to any power supply and that is the reason for the danger. If you fail to provide cooling... for one one hour and a half, then you will have melting already.' To add to the safety concerns, shocking video that appears to have been taken from inside the plant has revealed Russian military hardware being inside a turbine hall - just feet away from one of the reactors. Footage emerged last week showing the inside of what looks like a turbo-generator hall, with at least five Russian military trucks parked inside next to a stack of crates. While it is not clear from the footage exactly what the trucks are doing there, they have 'Z' war markings on the hoods and are painted camouflage green - almost certainly meaning they are being used by the Russian armed forces. The video is the clearest evidence that has yet emerged to back Ukrainian assertions that Russia is storing explosives and other military hardware in and around the nuclear reactors, risking a disaster which could blanket Europe in radioactive ash. If the video was indeed taken in a turbo-generator hall - as seems likely from machinery visible in the footage - then it would mean the trucks are just 100ft (30m) from a reactor, putting it at risk in the event of an explosion. Kotin said he is extremely concerned about the risk that these military vehicles could blow up and cause a fire at the site. 'In case there is a fire in the turbine hall you don't even have a possibility to put it out or mitigate the consequences of this fire, because your fire brigades cannot get in, because any entry is blocked by the trucks packed in there,' he said. Kotin added: 'This situation is very dangerous not only for the plant [and] for Ukraine, but also for the whole world because you never can say what the weather would be like and what the wind direction [would be].' One engineer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told The Telegraph that many of their colleagues have been arrested on their way to work. 'Now I understand that their army is weak, but their FSB service is working. 'One of their methods here is to take the control room workers to the basement,' said the engineer, using a Russian word for detention and torture by Russia's secret police. 'Our management keeps silent about it, not to create panic, but people who return after those basement 'conversations' don't say anything at all. 'It will be no surprise if during the mission they will suddenly start saying what they were told to say.' Workers who have left the plant told the newspaper that the workforce has been cut to dangerously low levels while landmines have been placed around the cooling pond. 'It feels like we're in a strict regime prison: constant psychological pressure, no way to contact families as they cut off all communications and banned cell phones,' one said. 'We can't monitor the active equipment of the station because they prohibit movement within the territory at night. They put their equipment in the turbine halls and prohibit passage, it constantly causes conflict between the workers and the Russian troops,' another said. The fear that the ongoing conflict near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant could lead to disaster is palpable just across the Dnieper River in Nikopol, where residents have been under nearly constant Russian shelling since July 12, with eight people killed, 850 buildings damaged and over the half the population of 100,000 fleeing the city. Liudmyla Shyshkina, a 74-year-old widow who lived within sight of the Zaporizhzhia plant before her apartment was bombarded and her husband killed, said she believes the Russians are capable of intentionally causing a nuclear disaster. Fighting in early March caused a brief fire at the plant's training complex, which officials said did not result in the release of any radiation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia's military actions there amount to 'nuclear blackmail'. No civilian nuclear plant is designed for a wartime situation, although the buildings housing Zaporizhzhia's six reactors are protected by reinforced concrete that could withstand an errant shell, experts say. The more immediate concern was that disruptions to the electricity supply of the plant would knock out cooling systems that are essential for the safe operation of the reactors, with emergency diesel generators sometimes unreliable. The pools where spent fuel rods are kept to be cooled also are vulnerable to shelling, which could cause the release of radioactive material. Kyiv told UN nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency that shelling earlier this week damaged transformers at a nearby conventional power plant, disrupting electricity supplies to the Zaporizhzhia plant for several hours. 'These incidents show why the IAEA must be able to send a mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant very soon,' said agency head Rafael Mariano Grossi, adding that he expected that to happen 'within the next few days, if ongoing negotiations succeed'. At a UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday, UN political chief Rosemary DiCarlo urged the withdrawal of all military personnel and equipment from the plant and an agreement on a demilitarised zone around it. Currently only one of the plant's four power lines connecting it to the grid is operational, the agency said. External power is essential not just to cool the two reactors still in operation but also the spent radioactive fuel stored in special facilities onsite. 'If we lose the last one, we are at the total mercy of emergency power generators,' said Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Southern California. If an incident at the Zaporizhzhia plant were to release significant amounts of radiation, the scale and location of the contamination would be determined largely by the weather, said Paul Dorfman, a nuclear safety expert at the University of Sussex who has advised the British and Irish governments. The massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Fukushima plant destroyed cooling systems which triggered meltdowns in three of its reactors. Much of the contaminated material was blown out to sea, limiting the damage. The April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at one of four reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear plant north of Kyiv sent a cloud of radioactive material across a wide swath of Europe and beyond. In addition to fuelling anti-nuclear sentiment in many countries, the disaster left deep psychological scars on Ukrainians."

His Aurus limousine and cavalcade was seen driving at high speed to the Russian seat of power. Putin is in the habit of pre-recording key announcements with a Kremlin backdrop. His night-time address - which launched his 'special military operation' in Ukraine - six months ago is widely believed to have been recorded sometime prior to its screening. There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin over the footage of the unusual late night dash through central Moscow by his cavalcade. It came hours after Putin's missiles rained down on a railway station, killing 22, in his latest savage attack which coincided with Ukraine's Independence Day celebrating 31 years free from the Soviet Union. The Telegram channel which first aired the footage - Operation Z: Military Commissars of the Russian Spring, with 900,000 followers - subsequently deleted it, possibly under official pressure, but other unofficial outlets showed it. One headline ran: 'Putin's cortege is rushing to the Kremlin - wonder what for?' Putin does not live at the Kremlin - the Russian seat of power - but at his Moscow region official residence Novo-Ogaryovo, some 20 miles away. In the summer, he is often based at another residence on the Black Sea. Political analyst and former MP Sergey Markov claimed Putin's dash to the Kremlin could be linked to a move to declare Ukraine a 'terrorist state'. Another theory was that he planned to announce a major escalation of the war amid a US announcement for massive new military support for Ukraine. 'Ukrainian [social media] must be trembling while reporting that right now Putin has arrived at the Kremlin - which means some important decisions will be made,' he said. On Wednesday, Putin had held a meeting evidently from Novo-Ogaryovo on wildfires threatening regions close to Moscow. A day earlier he was seen in a Kremlin meeting with ex-deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, now chairman of state development corporation VEB.RF. However, there was suspicion this was 'canned footage' that had been recorded earlier."
2022-08-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11144461/Zelensky-vows-revenge-Putins-missiles-kill-22-including-boy-11-rail-station-atrocity.html,"Zelensky vows to take revenge after Putin's missiles kill dozens - including boy, 11 - in rail station atrocity on Ukraine's Independence Day","Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed revenge on Russia after Putin's forces rained missiles down on a train station, killing 25 people including an 11-year-old boy, in a savage Independence Day attack The boy was killed when a missile struck his house in Chaplyne and 24 people died later when rockets hit the rural town's railway station and set fire to five train carriages yesterday. The small town of 3,500 people lies in the Dnipropetrovsk region - the scene of intense recent fighting between Ukrainian and Kremlin forces. Zelensky said in a late night address: 'Chaplyne is our pain today. As of this moment, there are 25 dead, five of them burned in the car, an 11-year-old boy died, a Russian missile destroyed his house. 'Search and rescue operations at the railway station will continue. We will definitely make the occupiers bear responsibility for everything they have done. And we will certainly drive the invaders out of our land.' The wartime President had previously warned that the 'erratic' Russian dictator would use the killing of the daughter of his ultra-nationalist aide Alexander Dugin - dubbed 'Putin's Rasputin' - in a car bombing in Moscow last week as a pretext to ratchet up his war on the embattled European country. Ukraine's Independence Day yesterday, marking 31 years since its rupture from the Soviet Union, was also predicted to see a surge in attacks. While most fighting is now taking place in the east and south, where the fighting has stalled, Russia regularly strikes Ukrainian cities with long-range missiles, according to Kyiv. In the Dnipropetrovsk region on the southern front earlier yesterday, the Russians again shelled the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, damaging several buildings and wounding two people, authorities said. Russian troops also shelled the city of Zaporizhzhia, but no casualties were reported. Kremlin rockets also struck unspecified targets in the Khmelnytskyi region, about 180 miles west of Kyiv, the regional governor said. Elsewhere on the battlefield, Russian forces struck several towns and villages in Donetsk province in the east over 24 hours, killing one person, authorities said. A building materials superstore in the city of Donetsk was hit by a shell and erupted in flames, the mayor said. There were no immediate reports of any injuries. Zelensky had earlier pledged that Ukraine would fight 'until the end', branding Russian forces 'terrorists' and vowing to retake all occupied territory - including Crimea, which was seized from Kyiv in 2014 after the Putin crony Viktor Yanukovych was ousted by pro-EU demonstrators. Outgoing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson marked Ukraine's Independence Day with a visit to Kyiv - his third since the war broke out - and other European leaders used the occasion to pledge unwavering support for Ukraine, locked in a battle that was widely expected to be a lightning conquest by Moscow but has turned into a grinding war of attrition. The US announced a major new military aid package totaling nearly $3billion to help Ukrainian forces fight for years to come. It comes amid Western fears that Putin could begin announcing sham referendums designed to formalise its control of occupied areas as soon as this week. Ukraine celebrates its independence day on August 24 in commemoration of the Declaration of Independence in 1991. The country had been a major power in the Soviet Union, becoming the center of its arms industry and a major political player. But its output was redirected to the Soviet military and little was left for the Ukrainian population, and the quality of goods remained low compared to their neighbors. The push for independence surged with the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986, and the subsequent demise of the Soviet Union. In early 1990, over 300,000 Ukrainians linked arms in a human chain from Kyiv and Lviv as a show of unity against the Soviet bloc. A student protest known as the Revolution of Granite took place in October 1990 to prevent a new union treaty with the USSR. The country declared its independence in August 1991 and in December, a referendum backed the move with 90 percent approval, with majorities in every region including Crimea. The Soviet Union then formally ceased to exist on December 26. Kyiv authorities banned large gatherings in the capital through Thursday, fearing the national holiday might bring particularly heavy Russian missile strikes. 'Russian provocations and brutal strikes are a possibility,' Zelensky said in a statement. 'Please strictly follow the safety rules. Please observe the curfew. Pay attention to the air sirens. Pay attention to official announcements.' Nevertheless, a festive atmosphere prevailed at Kyiv's Maidan square as thousands of residents posed for pictures next to burned-out Russian tanks put on display. Folk singers set up, and many revelers - ignoring the sirens - were out and about in traditionally embroidered dresses and shirts. Others were fearful. 'I can't sleep at night because of what I see and hear about what is being done in Ukraine,' said a retiree who gave only her first name, Tetyana, her voice shaking with emotion. 'This is not a war. It is the destruction of the Ukrainian people.' In a holiday message to the country, Zelensky exulted over Ukraine's success in fending off Moscow's forces since the invasion, saying: 'On February 24, we were told: You have no chance. On August 24, we say: Happy Independence Day, Ukraine!' Zelensky also addressed the UN Security Council via video over Russia's objections and said the 'security of the entire world' is at stake in Ukraine's battle against Moscow's 'insane aggression.' He told representatives of about 60 states and international organisations at a virtual summit on Crimea yesterday that Ukraine would drive Russian forces out of the peninsular by any means necessary, without consulting other countries beforehand. A small number of residents gathered in Kyiv's central square, where destroyed Russian tanks and mobile artillery were put on display over the weekend, and the national anthem is played every day at 7am local time. But back home, ordinary Russians are becoming more and more disillusioned with Putin's constant barbarism and the unrelenting Kremlin war machine. A survey by the Rosmir polling centre found only 65 per cent watch Kremlin-run stations, down from 86 per cent at the outbreak of the war, the Moscow Times reported. Channel-1, Rossiya-1 and NT TV all tow the party line, issuing dire threats to the West and Ukraine as part of Putin's propaganda to shore up support for his war. Opinion polls show only 55 per cent of Russians are in favour of the invasion, compared to 66 per cent a few months ago. Moscow restaurants numbers are at a five-month low and the cinema sector has warned it will collapse without government support as sanctions continue to bite. US President Joe Biden said the latest American aid package will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense and artillery systems and other weapons. Pope Francis has sparked outrage in Ukraine for referring to Darya Dugina, the slain daughter of a prominent Russian ultra-nationalist, as an innocent victim of war. Ukraine's ambassador to the Vatican slammed the pontiff in a highly unusual move, saying the comments were 'disappointing'. 'Innocents pay for war,' Francis said earlier at his Wednesday general audience in a sentence where he referred to 'that poor girl thrown in the air by a bomb under the seat of a car in Moscow'. 'I know this Independence Day is bittersweet for many Ukrainians as thousands have been killed or wounded, millions have been displaced from their homes, and so many others have fallen victim to Russian atrocities and attacks,' Biden said. 'But six months of relentless attacks have only strengthened Ukrainians' pride in themselves, in their country, and in their 31 years of independence.' Britain's Johnson urged Western allies to stand by Ukraine through the winter. 'This is not the time to put forward flimsy negotiating proposals,' he said. 'You can't negotiate with a bear when it's eating your leg or with a street robber when he has you pinned to the floor.' In Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz rebuked the Kremlin for its 'backward imperialism' and declared that Ukraine 'will drive away the dark shadow of war because it is strong and brave, because it has friends in Europe and all over the world.' A car bombing outside Moscow that killed the 29-year-old daughter of right-wing Russian political theorist Alexander Dugin on Saturday also heightened fears that Russia might intensify attacks on Ukraine this week. Russian officials have blamed Ukraine for the death of Darya Dugina, a pro-Kremlin TV commentator. Ukraine has denied any involvement. Putin's forces have encountered unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance in their invasion and abandoned their effort to storm the capital in the spring. The fighting has turned into a slog that has reduced neighborhoods to rubble and sent shock waves through the world economy. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, speaking Wednesday at a meeting of his counterparts from a security organization dominated by Russia and China, claimed the slow pace of Moscow's military action was due to what he said was an effort to spare civilians. Russian forces have repeatedly targeted civilian areas in cities, including hospitals and a Mariupol theater where hundreds of people were taking shelter. But Shoigu said Russia is carrying out strikes with precision weapons against Ukrainian military targets, and 'everything is done to avoid civilian casualties.' 'Undoubtedly, it slows down the pace of the offensive, but we do it deliberately,' he said. He also criticised the US and its allies for 'continuing to pump weapons into Ukraine,' saying the aid is dragging out the conflict and increasing casualties. One of Russia's last prominent politicians to oppose Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine was detained in a dawn raid accused of 'discrediting the Russian army'. Former mayor of Yekaterinburg, Yevgeny Roizman, 60, was naked with only a towel around his waist as armed police led by a woman law enforcement official stormed his flat. He has regularly denounced the war defying draconian laws forbidding such criticism. The politician is close to jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, now serving a nine year sentence after criticism of Putin. Searches were underway at Roizman's flat, a foundation he runs, and an icon museum he owns, as he was moved 1,100 miles to Moscow to face a criminal investigation. His arrest came exactly six months after the start of the conflict in Ukraine and follows his lambasting of Putin for his 'awful, monstrous, amateur war' in Ukraine. Roizman called it 'the most despicable, shameful and wrongful war in the history of Russia'. He said: 'Even at The Last Judgement I will not give these words up.' He warned in March: 'The country is changing really fast. The regime is becoming fascist. Many are leaving Russia.' He vowed to remain, even though arrest was likely as the country fell deeper into authoritarianism. 'I'm staying,' he said. 'This is my country, and I will not give up a millimetre of it. 'I cannot allow myself to be scared, and no-one will force me to say black is white.' Ukraine honours Boris: President Zelensky unveils flagstone celebrating Prime Minister's unwavering support during Russian invasion as Johnson is awarded Order of Liberty medal Boris Johnson was honoured with a Hollywood walk-of-fame style flagstone and received a medal for his wartime support of Ukraine on his final visit to Kyiv as Prime Minister today. Mr Johnson, who has been one of the most vocal supporters of Ukraine's plight in the face of Russian aggression, was awarded with the Ukrainian 'Order of Liberty' - the highest award that can be bestowed upon foreign nationals - in a ceremony personally led by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. After the intimate ceremony which saw Mr Johnson receive his medal and share a warm handshake with his Ukrainian counterpart, the pair toured the streets of Kyiv where the Prime Minister was shown a commemorative plaque bearing his name which was inset into the Ukrainian capital's pavement. The Prime Minister travelled to the Ukrainian capital on the country's independence day, which marks 31 years since Ukraine broke free from Soviet rule. Mr Johnson used the trip - his third to Kyiv since the start of Russia's barbaric invasion in late February - to announce a new £54million package of British military support. He also held a final round of face-to-face talks with Mr Zelensky, with whom he has grown close, as the country prepares to enter winter still in conflict with Russia. Mr Johnson has less than two weeks left in office and the Government has been keen to stress - whoever succeeds him as PM out of either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak - that British backing for Ukraine will continue. The PM today reiterated that unwavering support, which has come through the supply of humanitarian aid, help in the investigation of war crimes by Russian forces, and efforts to rebuild Ukraine's economy. The PM said: 'For the past six months, the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine, supporting this sovereign country to defend itself from this barbaric and illegal invader. 'Today's package of support will give the brave and resilient Ukrainian Armed Forces another boost in capability, allowing them to continue to push back Russian forces and fight for their freedom. 'What happens in Ukraine matters to us all, which is why I am here today to deliver the message that the UK is with you and will be with you for the days and months ahead, and you can and will win.' As part of the new package of British military support, Ukraine will be supplied with 2,000 state-of-the-art drones and anti-tank loitering munitions to help its forces better fight against Russian invaders. Downing Street hopes this will bolster Ukraine's long-range surveillance and defensive targeting ability. The package includes 850 hand-launched 'Black Hornet' micro-drones, which are specifically designed for use in towns and villages and are used to detect approaching enemy forces. Each drone is smaller than a mobile phone and feeds back live video and still images to allow forces on the ground to defend urban areas safely. Troops can be trained to fly the drones in under 20 minutes. Britain is also preparing to give mine-hunting vehicles to Ukraine to help detect Russian mines in the waters off its coastline. Ukrainian troops will be trained in how to use them in British waters in the coming weeks. Speaking in Kyiv, Mr Johnson said Russian President Vladimir Putin had been 'insane' to invade Ukraine. In a message to Britons as they face a cost-of-living crisis made worse by the war in Ukraine, the PM added: 'If we're paying in our energy bills for the evils of Vladimir Putin, the people of Ukraine are paying in their blood.' He also hailed how, 'like one of those indomitable Ukrainian boxers' the country 'came off the ropes' and hit the Russian President 'with an uppercut that sent Putin's armies reeling from Kyiv and a hook to drive him from Kharkiv'. 'Out of the ashes of your towns and cities, out of the monstrous scares that are being left by Putin's missiles, something beautiful is blooming and it is a flower that the whole world can see and admire, and that is the incomparable will of the Ukrainians to resist,' Mr Johnson continued. Britain has so far committed more than £2.3billion of military and financial aid to Ukraine since Russia's invasion began earlier this year. It comes as British defence secretary Ben Wallace claimed Russia has lost 80,000 troops since the invasion began on February 24. 'We pretty much accept, well, we do accept, the sort of observations of Russian losses to be – if you combine deaths, injuries, desertions – over 80,000 of their armed forces,' he said. 'That's 80,000 in six months compared to 15,000 they lost in a decade in Afghanistan.'"
2022-08-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11143931/Dennis-Rodman-warned-State-Department-not-travel-Russia-help-free-Brittney-Griner.html,Dennis Rodman will NOT go to Russia and try to free Brittney Griner after all following State Department warning he'd 'complicate and hinder' efforts to release the WNBA star,"NBA legend Dennis Rodman will no longer travel to Russia to seek the release of the WNBA star Brittney Griner, after being strongly discouraged to not involve himself by the US State Department. Ned Price, a spokesman for the State Department, said if Rodman went to Russia he 'would not be traveling on behalf of the US government.' Rodman then said he no longer has plans to travel to Russia to help free Griner, who has been imprisoned for nine years on drug charges after she was caught with a marijuana vape pen at Moscow Airport in February of this year. 'We believe that anything other than negotiating further through the established channel is likely to complicate and hinder those release efforts,' Price added. Rodman earlier said he got permission to travel to the war-fueled country, and hoped to book his trip soon to see Russian President Vladimir Putin who he says he knows 'too well.' 'I got permission to go to Russia to help that girl,' Rodman earlier told NBC News. 'I'm trying to go this week.' Rodman is notorious for befriending controversial world leaders, and even noted Russian President Vladimir Putin as being 'cool' after he returned from a 2014 venture to Moscow. Aside from Putin, the former NBA star considers North Korea leader Kim Jong Un to be a good friend, and is the only-known western celebrity to have visited the despot in Pyongyang. Rodman has taken several trips to the Communist country and even said he helped in the 2014 release of Christian missionary Kenneth Bae, who was charged in the country for attempting to overturn the government. Griner is currently locked in prison in Russia for bringing two vape cartridges containing cannabis oil into the country in February. Cannabis in Russia is illegal. The WNBA star was sentenced to nine years behind bars on August 4 as the White House scrambles to swap her out with Viktor Bout, who has been in prison in the US since 2010. Bout was a convicted Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year prison sentence on charges that he conspired to sell tens of millions of dollars in weapons to Colombia's former FARC guerrilla army. At the time of his conviction in 2008, the group was classified by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization, though that designation was lifted last year. Putin originally held off on the swap, citing the ongoing legal trial, but is now ready to negotiate the exchange for Bout. The US is also negotiating former U.S. marine Paul Whelan, who is also a UK citizen and is accused of spying. The deal would bring Griner home but would also let free one of the worst war criminals the US has ever locked up. It's unclear how Rodman plans to negotiate Griner's release, but will travel to the country despite the State Department travel advisory urging people to not travel to Russia as the war with Ukraine persists. It would have been Rodman's second time contributing to a prisoner swap. In 2014, Rodman claimed that he was behind the release of various US citizens detained in North Korea, including Bae. The former basketball star wrote to his 'friend for life' Kim Jong-Un and begged him for mercy in the case of Bae - who had been imprisoned in the hermit kingdom for six months. Bae was let go along with Matthew Miller who was serving a sex-year jail term on charges of espionage, after he allegedly ripped his tourist visa at Pyongyang's airport and demanded asylum. In a letter sent to the communist dictator earlier this year that was shown to TMZ, Rodman wrote: '[I] would be eternally grateful for his safe return and make a big step towards bridging the gap between our two nations.' He also compliments the leader's progress, such as the construction of new water parks and airport terminals, in his 'beautiful country' and thanked him for a special stay. The note continues: 'I understand the crimes he committed and ask you my dear friend, the highly respected Marshall Kim Jong Un for his release to show my country how loving and compassionate you and the DPRK can be.' Rodman told the site he sent the letter and January and believes his trips to the communist country influenced the developments. He visited the country three times in 2013, but previously said he had been threatened with sanctions by Washington if he continued his activities in the country."

Dominic Abelen, a Kiwi soldier based at Burnham Military Camp in Christchurch, is believed to have been shot and killed on the front line in Ukraine. He had taken pay without leave to help the nation fend off Russian invaders. A former NZ soldier fighting in Ukraine's International Legion paid tribute to his 'handsome' fallen comrade - but said he was more than just something to look at. 'The bro was anything but scenery. Strong, hardcore, handsome but extremely humble,' the soldier wrote online. 'Best believe he died doing what he loved and was extremely good at. 'We will miss you brother. So much. You have left a hole that we are feeling and we could never hope to ever fill.' The NZ Defence Force is still gathering information to understand the circumstances of Mr Abelen's death. Mr Abelen's family declined to comment but his former commanding officer Tenby Powell said they had contacted him to organise the return of the killed soldier's body. Mr Powell is in Ukraine for humanitarian work and said he felt honoured to have been asked by the family to return Mr Abelen to New Zealand. 'It's a very sad day here in Ukraine, not just for New Zealanders but for everyone,' he told the New Zealand Herald. 'I've talked to a family member, they have asked me and I have agreed to go and get him. We need to do this in a very respectful and expedient manner. 'I have given the family my assurances that he will be well looked after all the way back.' He said Mr Abelen's body will be transported in a coffin covered by the NZ flag. Ukraine is in the sixth month of defending itself from Russian invasion and was reportedly subject to a brutal attack that killed 22 people, including an 11-year-old girl, on its Independence Day on Wednesday. Most of the country has managed to ward off invasion with conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region."
2022-08-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11143643/Boris-Johnson-energy-bills-rising-Ukraine-paying-blood.html,Our energy bills are rising... but Ukraine is paying in blood: Boris Johnson warns that British families must put up with high costs for sake of people in war-torn country as he is handed grateful nation's highest honour to mark Independence Day,"Boris Johnson has warned that UK households must endure soaring energy bills for the sake of Ukrainian civilians, who are 'paying with blood' for Vladimir Putin's aggression. The Prime Minister defied Russian missile attacks to visit Kyiv on a surprise trip to mark Ukraine's Independence Day, where he was mobbed by onlookers as he strode through the sunny capital with president Volodymyr Zelensky. The Queen last night said she was hoping the world can look forward to better times in an address to mark the independence day. The British embassy in Kyiv published the message as the country celebrated the anniversary in the midst of the Russian onslaught. In a series of tweets, the account said: 'On their 31st anniversary of Independence, Her Majesty The Queen congratulates Ukrainians.' In her address to the president of Ukraine she said: 'It gives me great pleasure to send Your Excellency and the people of Ukraine my warmest greetings on the celebration of your Independence Day. 'In this most challenging year, I hope that today will be a time for the Ukrainian people, both in Ukraine and around the world, to celebrate their culture, history and identity. May we look to better times in the future. Elizabeth R.' Mr Johnson said he had come to underline Britain's unwavering, long-term commitment to Ukraine on what is also the six-month anniversary of Putin's invasion. He told Mr Zelensky that his country 'can and will win the war' in the face of Russian imperialism, while also unveiling a new transfer of cutting-edge drones. Writing in the Daily Mail today, Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, hailed this country's efforts, saying he is 'proud and humbled to see my nation's flag flying alongside your own, up and down this wonderful country'. On his trip, Mr Johnson underscored the tough domestic ramifications for the UK. He said British households would 'have to endure the cost of living crisis' in order to counter Russia's 'inevitable manipulation of energy prices'. He added: 'While people are paying energy bills, people in Ukraine are paying with blood.' The dramatic intervention on the cost of living crisis came as new figures showed that Britain imported no fuel from Russia in the month of June – for the first time since records began 25 years ago – while other imports from Russia dived by 96.6 per cent. The Prime Minister's trip to Ukraine was organised in complete secrecy, coming as it did amid multiple warnings from western intelligence agencies that the Kremlin would mark Ukraine's special day with a barrage of revenge strikes on its cities. Those expected attacks took place in several regions, but the capital itself was not struck as of last night, although air raid alarms in the city continued to shriek. The most devastating strike of the day came when a passenger train was hit, killing at least 15 and injuring 50. Pictures showed charred and flattened train carriages, as well as wrecked vehicles, apparently parked near the rural station in Chaplyne, a village near the city of Dnipro. During this visit – his third to the city since the invasion and his last as Prime Minister – Mr Johnson received Ukraine's highest award that can be bestowed on foreign nationals, The Order of Liberty. He was also honoured with a plaque on the city's Alley of Bravery. There, Mr Johnson announced a new £54million package of UK aid, including unmanned surveillance and missile systems for Ukraine's armed forces. These include 850 hand-launched Black Hornet micro-drones, which are designed for use in towns and villages, and are deployed to detect approaching enemy forces. Military personnel can be trained to fly the helicopter drones – smaller than a mobile phone – in less than 20 minutes. The UK has committed more than £2.3billion in military and financial aid to Ukraine since the invasion began in February. Mr Johnson said: 'For the past six months, the United Kingdom has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine, supporting this sovereign country to defend itself from this barbaric and illegal invader. 'Today's package of support will give the brave and resilient Ukrainian armed forces another boost in capability, allowing them to continue to push back Russian forces and fight for their freedom. 'What happens in Ukraine matters to us all, which is why I am here today to deliver the message that the United Kingdom is with you and will be with you for the days and months ahead, and you can and will win.' He called on the international community to stay the course. Meanwhile, the US announced nearly $3billion (£2.5billion) in military aid to Kyiv, its biggest package of help yet. Against all expectations, Ukraine managed to repulse the Russian assault on Kyiv at the start of the invasion and, in recent weeks, has launched its own attacks on enemy bases in occupied Crimea. But, talking to Ukrainian MPs, the Mail was told how they feared the West – particularly the EU – was wavering over continued financial, political and military support. Most crucially, they wonder which Western powers will take charge of 'a strategic plan' to support Ukraine from this point if, as expected, the war continues for months or years more. Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, was also in Kyiv as part of a delegation of international parliamentarians. He underlined these concerns to the Mail. He said: 'The challenge now is that someone has to come up with that long-term plan. It will require not just one government, but several, and it may take years to deliver.' In his speech to the nation yesterday Mr Zelensky promised that Ukraine will resist the Russian invasion 'until the end'."

Volodymyr Zelensky told the UN Security Council that a Russian missile strike hit a passenger train and nearby vehicles at the rural train station in Chaplyne, a town of about 3,500 people in the Dnipropetrovsk region - the scene of intense recent fighting between Ukrainian and Kremlin forces. The wartime President had previously warned that the 'erratic' Russian dictator would use the killing of the daughter of his ultra-nationalist aide Alexander Dugin - dubbed 'Putin's Rasputin' - in a car bombing in Moscow last week as a pretext to ratchet up his war on the embattled European country.

Zelensky had earlier pledged that Ukraine would fight 'until the end', branding Russian forces 'terrorists' and vowing to retake all occupied territory - including Crimea, which was seized from Kyiv in 2014 after the Putin crony Viktor Yanukovych was ousted by pro-EU demonstrators. Outgoing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson marked Ukraine's Independence Day with a visit to Kyiv - his third since the war broke out - and other European leaders used the occasion to pledge unwavering support for Ukraine, locked in a battle that was widely expected to be a lightning conquest by Moscow but has turned into a grinding war of attrition. The US announced a major new military aid package totaling nearly $3billion to help Ukrainian forces fight for years to come. It comes amid Western fears that Putin could begin announcing sham referendums designed to formalise its control of occupied areas as soon as this week. Ukraine celebrates its independence day on August 24 in commemoration of the Declaration of Independence in 1991. The country had been a major power in the Soviet Union, becoming the center of its arms industry and a major political player. But its output was redirected to the Soviet military and little was left for the Ukrainian population, and the quality of goods remained low compared to their neighbors. The push for independence surged with the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986, and the subsequent demise of the Soviet Union. In early 1990, over 300,000 Ukrainians linked arms in a human chain from Kyiv and Lviv as a show of unity against the Soviet bloc. A student protest known as the Revolution of Granite took place in October 1990 to prevent a new union treaty with the USSR. The country declared its independence in August 1991 and in December, a referendum backed the move with 90 percent approval, with majorities in every region including Crimea. The Soviet Union then formally ceased to exist on December 26. Kyiv authorities banned large gatherings in the capital through Thursday, fearing the national holiday might bring particularly heavy Russian missile strikes. 'Russian provocations and brutal strikes are a possibility,' Zelensky said in a statement. 'Please strictly follow the safety rules. Please observe the curfew. Pay attention to the air sirens. Pay attention to official announcements.' Nevertheless, a festive atmosphere prevailed at Kyiv's Maidan square as thousands of residents posed for pictures next to burned-out Russian tanks put on display. Folk singers set up, and many revelers - ignoring the sirens - were out and about in traditionally embroidered dresses and shirts. Others were fearful. 'I can't sleep at night because of what I see and hear about what is being done in Ukraine,' said a retiree who gave only her first name, Tetyana, her voice shaking with emotion. 'This is not a war. It is the destruction of the Ukrainian people.' In a holiday message to the country, Zelensky exulted over Ukraine's success in fending off Moscow's forces since the invasion, saying: 'On February 24, we were told: You have no chance. On August 24, we say: Happy Independence Day, Ukraine!' Zelensky also addressed the UN Security Council via video over Russia's objections and said the 'security of the entire world' is at stake in Ukraine's battle against Moscow's 'insane aggression.' He told representatives of about 60 states and international organisations at a virtual summit on Crimea yesterday that Ukraine would drive Russian forces out of the peninsular by any means necessary, without consulting other countries beforehand. A small number of residents gathered in Kyiv's central square, where destroyed Russian tanks and mobile artillery were put on display over the weekend, and the national anthem is played every day at 7am local time. But back home, ordinary Russians are becoming more and more disillusioned with Putin's constant barbarism and the unrelenting Kremlin war machine. A survey by the Rosmir polling centre found only 65 per cent watch Kremlin-run stations, down from 86 per cent at the outbreak of the war, the Moscow Times reported. Channel-1, Rossiya-1 and NT TV all tow the party line, issuing dire threats to the West and Ukraine as part of Putin's propaganda to shore up support for his war. Opinion polls show only 55 per cent of Russians are in favour of the invasion, compared to 66 per cent a few months ago. Moscow restaurants numbers are at a five-month low and the cinema sector has warned it will collapse without government support as sanctions continue to bite. US President Joe Biden said the latest American aid package will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense and artillery systems and other weapons. Pope Francis has sparked outrage in Ukraine for referring to Darya Dugina, the slain daughter of a prominent Russian ultra-nationalist, as an innocent victim of war. Ukraine's ambassador to the Vatican slammed the pontiff in a highly unusual move, saying the comments were 'disappointing'. 'Innocents pay for war,' Francis said earlier at his Wednesday general audience in a sentence where he referred to 'that poor girl thrown in the air by a bomb under the seat of a car in Moscow'. 'I know this Independence Day is bittersweet for many Ukrainians as thousands have been killed or wounded, millions have been displaced from their homes, and so many others have fallen victim to Russian atrocities and attacks,' Biden said. 'But six months of relentless attacks have only strengthened Ukrainians' pride in themselves, in their country, and in their 31 years of independence.' Britain's Johnson urged Western allies to stand by Ukraine through the winter. 'This is not the time to put forward flimsy negotiating proposals,' he said. 'You can't negotiate with a bear when it's eating your leg or with a street robber when he has you pinned to the floor.' In Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz rebuked the Kremlin for its 'backward imperialism' and declared that Ukraine 'will drive away the dark shadow of war because it is strong and brave, because it has friends in Europe and all over the world.' A car bombing outside Moscow that killed the 29-year-old daughter of right-wing Russian political theorist Alexander Dugin on Saturday also heightened fears that Russia might intensify attacks on Ukraine this week. Russian officials have blamed Ukraine for the death of Darya Dugina, a pro-Kremlin TV commentator. Ukraine has denied any involvement. Putin's forces have encountered unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance in their invasion and abandoned their effort to storm the capital in the spring. The fighting has turned into a slog that has reduced neighborhoods to rubble and sent shock waves through the world economy. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, speaking Wednesday at a meeting of his counterparts from a security organization dominated by Russia and China, claimed the slow pace of Moscow's military action was due to what he said was an effort to spare civilians. Russian forces have repeatedly targeted civilian areas in cities, including hospitals and a Mariupol theater where hundreds of people were taking shelter. But Shoigu said Russia is carrying out strikes with precision weapons against Ukrainian military targets, and 'everything is done to avoid civilian casualties.' 'Undoubtedly, it slows down the pace of the offensive, but we do it deliberately,' he said. He also criticised the US and its allies for 'continuing to pump weapons into Ukraine,' saying the aid is dragging out the conflict and increasing casualties. One of Russia's last prominent politicians to oppose Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine was detained in a dawn raid today accused of 'discrediting the Russian army'. Former mayor of Yekaterinburg, Yevgeny Roizman, 60, was naked with only a towel around his waist as armed police led by a woman law enforcement official stormed his flat. He has regularly denounced the war defying draconian laws forbidding such criticism. The politician is close to jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, now serving a nine year sentence after criticism of Putin. Searches were underway at Roizman's flat, a foundation he runs, and an icon museum he owns, as he was moved 1,100 miles to Moscow to face a criminal investigation. His arrest came exactly six months after the start of the conflict in Ukraine and follows his lambasting of Putin for his 'awful, monstrous, amateur war' in Ukraine. Roizman called it 'the most despicable, shameful and wrongful war in the history of Russia'. He said: 'Even at The Last Judgement I will not give these words up.' He warned in March: 'The country is changing really fast. The regime is becoming fascist. Many are leaving Russia.' He vowed to remain, even though arrest was likely as the country fell deeper into authoritarianism. 'I'm staying,' he said. 'This is my country, and I will not give up a millimetre of it. 'I cannot allow myself to be scared, and no-one will force me to say black is white.' Ukraine honours Boris: President Zelensky unveils flagstone celebrating Prime Minister's unwavering support during Russian invasion as Johnson is awarded Order of Liberty medal Boris Johnson was honoured with a Hollywood walk-of-fame style flagstone and received a medal for his wartime support of Ukraine on his final visit to Kyiv as Prime Minister today. Mr Johnson, who has been one of the most vocal supporters of Ukraine's plight in the face of Russian aggression, was awarded with the Ukrainian 'Order of Liberty' - the highest award that can be bestowed upon foreign nationals - in a ceremony personally led by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. After the intimate ceremony which saw Mr Johnson receive his medal and share a warm handshake with his Ukrainian counterpart, the pair toured the streets of Kyiv where the Prime Minister was shown a commemorative plaque bearing his name which was inset into the Ukrainian capital's pavement. The Prime Minister travelled to the Ukrainian capital on the country's independence day, which marks 31 years since Ukraine broke free from Soviet rule. Mr Johnson used the trip - his third to Kyiv since the start of Russia's barbaric invasion in late February - to announce a new £54million package of British military support. He also held a final round of face-to-face talks with Mr Zelensky, with whom he has grown close, as the country prepares to enter winter still in conflict with Russia. Mr Johnson has less than two weeks left in office and the Government has been keen to stress - whoever succeeds him as PM out of either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak - that British backing for Ukraine will continue. The PM today reiterated that unwavering support, which has come through the supply of humanitarian aid, help in the investigation of war crimes by Russian forces, and efforts to rebuild Ukraine's economy. The PM said: 'For the past six months, the UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine, supporting this sovereign country to defend itself from this barbaric and illegal invader. 'Today's package of support will give the brave and resilient Ukrainian Armed Forces another boost in capability, allowing them to continue to push back Russian forces and fight for their freedom. 'What happens in Ukraine matters to us all, which is why I am here today to deliver the message that the UK is with you and will be with you for the days and months ahead, and you can and will win.' As part of the new package of British military support, Ukraine will be supplied with 2,000 state-of-the-art drones and anti-tank loitering munitions to help its forces better fight against Russian invaders. Downing Street hopes this will bolster Ukraine's long-range surveillance and defensive targeting ability. The package includes 850 hand-launched 'Black Hornet' micro-drones, which are specifically designed for use in towns and villages and are used to detect approaching enemy forces. Each drone is smaller than a mobile phone and feeds back live video and still images to allow forces on the ground to defend urban areas safely. Troops can be trained to fly the drones in under 20 minutes. Britain is also preparing to give mine-hunting vehicles to Ukraine to help detect Russian mines in the waters off its coastline. Ukrainian troops will be trained in how to use them in British waters in the coming weeks. Speaking in Kyiv, Mr Johnson said Russian President Vladimir Putin had been 'insane' to invade Ukraine. In a message to Britons as they face a cost-of-living crisis made worse by the war in Ukraine, the PM added: 'If we're paying in our energy bills for the evils of Vladimir Putin, the people of Ukraine are paying in their blood.' He also hailed how, 'like one of those indomitable Ukrainian boxers' the country 'came off the ropes' and hit the Russian President 'with an uppercut that sent Putin's armies reeling from Kyiv and a hook to drive him from Kharkiv'. 'Out of the ashes of your towns and cities, out of the monstrous scares that are being left by Putin's missiles, something beautiful is blooming and it is a flower that the whole world can see and admire, and that is the incomparable will of the Ukrainians to resist,' Mr Johnson continued. Britain has so far committed more than £2.3billion of military and financial aid to Ukraine since Russia's invasion began earlier this year. It comes as British defence secretary Ben Wallace claimed Russia has lost 80,000 troops since the invasion began on February 24. 'We pretty much accept, well, we do accept, the sort of observations of Russian losses to be – if you combine deaths, injuries, desertions – over 80,000 of their armed forces,' he said. 'That's 80,000 in six months compared to 15,000 they lost in a decade in Afghanistan.'"
2022-08-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11142653/White-House-DEFENDS-Biden-not-going-Ukraine-six-month-anniversary-Putins-invasion.html,White House DEFENDS Biden not going to Ukraine on six-month anniversary of Putin's invasion and after Boris Johnson's third visit and insists when it 'makes sense' he will go,"President Joe Biden will speak to Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky on Thursday, a senior official announced on the country's independence day, but still has no plans to visit. Details of the call emerged after British Minister Boris Johnson made his third trip to wartime Ukraine. During his visit he saw his name engraved on a plaque marking the 'Walk of the Brave' celebrating politicians who have stood with Ukraine against Russia, forcing the White House to face questions about why Biden has yet to make the trip. John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, said Biden would speak to Zelensky by phone on Thursday. 'This is the latest in a string of the conversations he has had with President Zelensky,' he said. 'Secretary Blinken has travelled to Kyiv. Secretary Austin has travelled to Kyiv. 'As you know we have an ambassador there as well. 'We have good connectivity with our Ukrainian counterparts. 'And look, if and when a trip by the president makes the most sense then clearly we'll appropriately consider that.' Earlier Biden announced another $2.98 billion in arms for Ukraine, six months after Russia invaded and as it marked independence day. 'I am proud to announce our biggest tranche of security assistance to date: approximately $2.98 billion of weapons and equipment to be provided through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative,' he said. 'This will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, counter-unmanned aerial systems, and radars to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term.' His was one of a number of announcements by world leaders as they showed solidarity with Zelensky and his nation. But Johnson, who has only two weeks left in office, upstaged them all by announcing a $63.5 million package during a trip to Kyiv. 'The UK will continue to stand with our Ukrainian friends. I believe Ukraine can and will win this war,' he said. Johnson is not the only world leader to have made the trip. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi visited Kyiv together in June. They took an 11-hour overnight train from Poland to the Ukrainian capital, one of the only means to get there. Ukrainian airspace has been closed since the invasion began. Austin and Blinken used the same route in April. But in a sign of the risks, Russia attacked several railway lines soon after they had crossed back into Poland on their way home. Officials and former officials say it all makes a Biden trip far too risky. And that there is a danger that a visit would pull too many Ukrainian security personnel away from fighting Russia. In the meantime, as the war drags on with no end in sight, U.S. officials are shifting their strategy toward a longer-term campaign, offering funds to train and equip Ukrainian soldiers for years to come. Russia now occupies about one fifth of Ukrainian territory and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has made clear he is not willing to give up territory to end the conflict. Vladimir Putin, too, seems intent on pressing forward despite his own massive losses. The money will fund contracts for drones, weapons and other equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two, sources familiar said, which is sure to rile up Republicans who claim there has been little oversight over funds to Ukraine. Earlier shipments, most of them done under Presidential Drawdown Authority, have focused on Ukraine's more immediate needs for weapons and ammunition and involved materiel that the Pentagon already has in stock that can be shipped in short order. The package is intended to both provide longer-term assistance for Ukraine for potential future defense needs and reassure Ukrainian officials that U.S. support remains steadfast. With the added $3 billion, the Biden administration will have offered a total of near $14 billion over the course of 19 aid packages since February. That total is in addition to two separate aid packages, one worth $40 billion and one worth $13.6 billion, Congress has approved for Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed on Tuesday that the conflict had no end in sight and the two sides were no nearer to the negotiating table. 'Winter is coming, and it will be hard, and what we see now is a grinding war of attrition. This is a battle of wills, and a battle of logistics. Therefore we must sustain our support for Ukraine for the long term, so that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign, independent nation,' Stoltenberg said, speaking at a virtual conference about Crimea, organized by Ukraine. U.S. defense leaders are also eyeing plans that will expand training for Ukrainian troops outside their country, and for militaries on Europe’s eastern and southern flanks that feel most threatened by Russia’s aggression."

U.S. defense leaders are also eyeing plans that will expand training for Ukrainian troops outside their country, and for militaries on Europe’s eastern and southern flanks that feel most threatened by Russia’s aggression. As the nation marked Independence Day, Zelensky warned against mass gatherings, as officials worried Russia would use the holiday to target civilians. Instead of a parade, central Kyiv was decorated with burned-out Russian tanks. The latest package comes after the Biden administration announced last week a deal to send more drones, ammunition, and armored vehicles, as Ukraine continues to find ways to hit Russia with long-range rockets. Last week's package totaled $775 million, and contains 16 Howitzer systems, 1,000 Javelin systems that have been hammering Russian armor, as well as an undisclosed number of HARM missiles that go after radar systems. Also included are 15 ScanEagle drones, a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle made by Boeing, as well as 40 MRAPS, tactical vehicles meant to withstand improvised explosives. The drones can be used for surveillance, and are launched using a pneumatic launcher without need of an airfield. 'These capabilities are carefully calibrated to make the most difference on the battlefield and strengthen Ukraine's position at the negotiating table,' said Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement announcing the package. The package also includes 2,000 anti-armor rounds, as Ukraine seeks to continue to hit Russian tanks and prepares for a possible offensive to try to roll back Russian territorial gains. There were explosions Thursday night near bases in Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine and inside Russia, as Ukraine's forces improve their ability to carry out long-range strikes. That came after huge explosions in Crimea, in strategically important territory Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. A western official said the event disabled half of Russia's naval air fleet, after already suffering the stinging loss of its flag ship, the Moskva. Russia considers the attack an escalation. 'We want to make sure that Ukraine has a steady stream of ammunition to meet its needs, and that's what we're doing with this package,' said a senior Pentagon official, Yahoo News reported. Additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) 16 105mm Howitzers and 36,000 105mm artillery rounds 15 Scan Eagle Unmanned Aerial Systems 40 MaxxPro Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles with mine rollers Additional High-speed Anti-radiation missiles 50 Armored High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV) 1,500 Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided (TOW) missiles 1,000 Javelin anti-armor systems 2,000 anti-armor rounds; Mine clearing equipment and systems Demolition munitions; Tactical secure communications systems Night vision devices, thermal imagery systems, optics, and laser rangefinders Source: Department of Defense 'You are seeing a complete and total lack of progress by the Russians on the battlefield,' said the official, who added: 'You are seeing the Russians still paying a high price with Ukrainian attacks, especially using that HIMARS system' for rocket attacks. An official said the war was currently at a 'near operational standstill,' ABC News reported. There are also increasing concerns by Ukraine and western allies that Russia will seek to lock in territorial gains by holding referendums in captured areas they control, with the clock ticking on opportunities to advance before winter. There was more information out of Great Britain about the huge extent of Russia's losses. A daily intelligence report by the British defense ministry said Moscow had lost a large number of battle tanks because they were not equipped with explosive reactive armor technology – or ERA. 'Used correctly, ERA degrades the effectiveness of incoming projectiles before they hit the tank,' the report said. 'This suggests that Russian forces have not rectified a culture of poor ERA use, which dates back to the First Chechen War in 1994.' The report added: 'It is highly likely that many Russian tank crews lack the training to maintain ERA, leading to either poor fitting of the explosive elements, or it being left off entirely.' British officials said 'the war has seen numerous failures by Russian commanders to enforce low-level battle discipline', adding: 'The effect of these failures is likely a significant factor behind the poor performance of Russia's forces.' Data released by Ukraine's military said their troops have killed more than 44,000 Russian soldiers and destroyed some 1,800 tanks. Other estimates, such as from Oryx - a military blog that has tracked Russian losses since the start of the war - put Moscow's equipment losses even higher. Oryx, which tracks losses based on visual confirmation, says more than 5,000 Russian military vehicles have been either destroyed, damaged or seized by Ukraine's forces - including more than 3,000 tanks."

2022-08-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11141673/Pope-sparks-fury-Ukraine-declaring-Russian-nationalists-daughter-innocent-victim-war.html,Pope sparks fury in Ukraine by declaring Russian ultra-nationalist's daughter an 'innocent victim of war' after she was killed by car bomb - as he warns of nuclear disaster,"Pope Francis has sparked outrage in Ukraine for referring to Darya Dugina, the slain daughter of a prominent Russian ultra-nationalist, as an innocent victim of war. Ukraine's ambassador to the Vatican slammed the pontiff in a highly unusual move, saying the comments were 'disappointing'. 'Innocents pay for war,' Francis said earlier at his Wednesday general audience in a sentence where he referred to 'that poor girl thrown in the air by a bomb under the seat of a car in Moscow'. Russia blamed the killing on Ukrainian agents which Kyiv has denied. Alexander Dugin, Darya's father, has long advocated the unification of Russian-speaking and other territories in a new Russian empire that would include Ukraine. Darya Dugina broadly supported her father's ideas and appeared on state TV in her own right to offer support for Russia's actions in Ukraine. In a Tweet, Andrii Yurash, Ukraine's ambassador to the Holy See, said the pope's words were 'disappointing'. 'How (is it) possible to mention one of ideologists of (Russian) imperialism as innocent victim? She was killed by Russians,' he said. Francis called the war 'madness'. He said Ukrainian and Russian children had been killed and that 'being an orphan knows no nationality'. In his Tweet, Yurash said: 'Can't speak in same categories about aggressor and victim, rapist and raped'. The Vatican did not immediately respond to Yurash's comments. In another part of his address, Pope Francis, called for 'concrete steps' to end the war in Ukraine and avert the risk of a nuclear disaster at the Zaporizhzhia power plant. Dugina died in an explosion on a motorway near the village of Bolshiye Vyazyomy just outside the capital on Saturday night. The Kremlin quickly announced the culprit behind the bombing as 43-year-old Ukrainian mother and alleged spy Natalia Shaban-Vovk. But Ukrainian and Western officials, as well as a number of prominent Russian commentators, believe the car bomb was likely executed by agents loyal to Putin after Dugin criticised the Russian president in a public Telegram post. Hundreds of people yesterday attended Dugina's funeral service in a large television studio in Moscow, where she worked as a prominent pro-Kremlin broadcaster. A huge portrait of Dugina, 29, hung above her coffin which was heavily guarded and surrounded by flower wreaths and streamers bearing the colours of the Russian Federation. The message from Putin read: 'Accept my sincere condolences and words of support due to the hardest, irreplaceable loss you suffered. 'A vile, cruel crime ended the life of Darya Dugina, a bright, talented person with a true Russian heart - kind, loving, open and sympathetic. 'A journalist, a scientist, a philosopher, a military correspondent, she honestly served the people, the Fatherland, and proved with her life what it means to be a patriot of Russia. 'The memory of Darya Dugina will be forever kept by her close people and friends, her comrades. 'Wishing you strength and fortitude in this mournful hour,' the message concluded. Dugin was later pictured sobbing into his hands on stage as Dugina's mother stood by her coffin to pay her final respects. Dugin, a bearded Rasputin-esque figure who some believe may have been the intended target of the bombing, sat forlornly alongside Dugina's mother at the funeral. When the moment came for him to deliver a speech, he told funeral-goers: 'I wanted to raise my daughter the way I see an ideal human, so first of all it was about belief. She spent her entire childhood in Orthodox camps. But I also wanted her to be a smart Orthodox person, so with her mother we advised her to become a philosopher, and she became one. 'She died for Russia, on the front line... She lived for victory, and died in the name of victory.' He said her last words to him before getting into her Toyota Land Cruiser were: 'Papa, I feel like a warrior, I feel like a hero.' Russian ultra-right ideologue Alexander Dugin is responsible for shaping the world view of Putin's inner circle. He has called for Ukrainians to be killed and strongly pushed Russia to invade for decades. In his youth, Dugin emerged as a leader of the notorious anti-Semitic Russian nationalist organisation, Pamyat. He founded his own publishing house after the fall of the USSR, going on to win university positions for his writings. Dugin believes that the Russian Orthodox Church was destined to rule as an empire over all of Europe and Asia — uniting all the Russian-speaking peoples into a single state. He laid out his plan for achieving this aim in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics, a text which still has significant influence within Russian elites and has even been used as a textbook by the Russian military. The Russian professor formed the 'Eurasia Party' in 2001, named after the hypothetical state, which also appears in George Orwell's novel 1984. His novel calls for a Russian empire stretching from Dublin to Vladivostok, even calling for parts of China to be conquered. Dugin was dismissed from his position as head of the Department of Sociology of International Relations at Moscow University after arguing for 'people's republics' on the territory of Ukraine. Seven years later, his position would become a reality after the Kremlin annexed the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic out of Ukraine's occupied eastern territories. Dugin called for the annexation of Crimea as far back as 2008, during Russia's war with Georgia. He travelled to the disputed region of South Ossetia, where he was photographed with a rocket launcher. He was also involved with coordinating separatist movements in Ukraine during the 2014 occupation, for which the US sanctioned him. The political scientist claims he also played a key role in reconciling the relationship between Russia and Turkey in 2015 after a Russian warplane was shot down on the Syrian border. Dugin also developed links with far-right and far-left political parties in the European Union, attempting to influence EU policy on Ukraine and Russia. Russian authorities pinned the assassination on alleged Ukrainian spy Shaban-Vovk, who they say sneaked into Russia – bringing her 12-year-old daughter with her – and tracked Dugina for weeks before activating the deadly car bomb and fleeing into Estonia, all without being caught. The chain of events leading up to Dugina's death as presented by Russia's security service included Shaban-Vovk changing her appearance and vehicle number plates to hoodwink guards before fleeing from Russia across the Estonian border. The FSB also released what it claimed was the Ukrainian mother's military documents, including a passport-style photo of her. But commentators questioned why Shaban-Vovk, if she is indeed a Ukrainian spy responsible for the killing, would leave her military identification behind and accused Russian authorities of producing a fake to pin the assassination on Ukraine. Estonian foreign minister Urmas Reinsalu today dismissed the wild claims as a 'Russian information operation'. 'We regard this as one instance of provocation in a very long line of provocations by the Russian Federation, and we have nothing more to say about it at the moment,' said the minister, adding Russia had made no request to extradite the alleged killer. The head of the International Centre for Defence and Security (ICDS) in the Estonian capital Tallinn, Indrek Kannik, claimed that Dugina had far more likely been killed by an internal Russian operation. 'It is possible that this was the FSB's own operation, since these people had become a threat. 'At the same time, it is convenient to blame it on the Ukrainians. Now we are seeing that Estonia can also be dragged in to this.' Ukraine has strongly denied any role in the killing in Moscow, accusing the Kremlin of a 'false flag' operation to blame Kyiv. Meanwhile, respected Russian expert Andrei Piontkovsky said the murder of Dugina was professional, indicating that the Russian secret services are likely involved, while Russian-American historian Dr. Yuri Felshtinsky claimed the attack would have been authorised by the Kremlin. 'The blowing up of the car of the famous Russian fascist and ideologist of the Putin regime, Alexander Dugin, was organised, it seems, by the Russian security services,' said Felshtinsky, author of 'Blowing up Ukraine'. 'On the latest Russian reports, the bomb was attached to Dugin's car inside his guarded compound. Ukraine focuses on military targets, unlike Russia, and there is no discernible gain in attacking one of Putin's media puppets or allocating scarce operatives inside the Russian Federation to such a goal that is meaningless to the liberation of Ukraine. 'The Kremlin will, however, likely exploit it to make it seem as if Ukraine is stooping to its own tactics of bombing harmless civilians in Ukraine.' Seven hours before the assassination on Saturday night, Dugin had issued a vitriolic online post on Telegram saying that the war in Ukraine was now more important than Putin's presidency. Dugin had claimed the war and 'desperate resistance of the Atlanto-Nazi regime in Kyiv' demands from Russia 'internal transformations'. The tone was strongly critical of Putin. 'The Supreme Commander-in-Chief [Putin] said that we haven't really started anything yet. Now we have to start. Whether you want it or not, we'll have to,' the post read. 'Now the question is not whether the government wants or does not want change. Such changes are simply inevitable... The mighty forces of history have come into play, the tectonic plates have shifted. Let the old regime bury its dead. 'A new Russian time is coming. And it's coming irreversibly.' Most international observers remain convinced the assassination was actually carried out by Russian agents who wanted to silence the victim's father. Analyst Yekaterina Shulman says the outpouring of anger among pro-Kremlin commentators in response to the car bomb attack appears suspicious: 'The reaction… was immediate. It looks as if they were waiting for something like this to happen.' Shulman added the killing 'could possibly be used to ramp up some public outrage in the country to justify even more active repressive actions by the state'."
2022-08-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11141629/Ukraines-hero-sniffing-dog-Patron-sends-message-Putin-mark-Independence-Day.html,Blowing a raspberry at Putin! Ukraine's hero mine-sniffing dog Patron sends a message to Vladimir as he poses in favourite outfit to mark Independence Day,"Ukraine's hero mine-sniffing dog Patron has sent a message to Vladimir Putin that Russia will 'not succeed in occupying us' as he posed in his favourite outfit to mark the country's Independence Day. Patron, a two-year-old Jack Russell who has been awarded a medal for valour by Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky, was pictured wearing a customised traditional Vyshyvanka shirt as he posed in front of Ukraine's national flag. The dog's Twitter account warned that Russia will 'never' occupy Ukraine again in a post to mark the 31st anniversary of the country leaving the Soviet Union and gaining independence. 'My country has been independent for 31 years. Again. The whole world has recognised this, and even those who now want to enslave us,' the post read. 'In the photo, I show them that they will not succeed in occupying us. Never again. Happy independence Day, my Ukraine. Love you.' Patron, who has more than 44,000 followers on Twitter and 341,000 on Instagram, found fame when Ukraine's State Emergency Service posted a video online of their mascot working in the war-torn northern city of Chernihiv to clear explosives. Patron was originally bought to appear in pedigree dog shows, but has detected more than 200 deadly Russian landmines and unexploded bombs. In his latest Twitter post, the dog is seen sitting on a table wearing customised embroidered Ukrainian clothes known as Vyshyvanka while trying to lick the photographer. A Vyshyvanka is a casual name for an embroidered shirt that is part of the country's national costume. Ukraine's Independence Day falls exactly six months after Russia launched its brutal invasion that Zelensky said today has made his country feel 'reborn'. Celebrations will be muted, with public gatherings banned in Kyiv where a sea of destroyed Kremlin tanks have been displayed to the public, and a curfew is in force in the front-line eastern city of Kharkiv. Meanwhile, Patron received a medal for valour at the presidential palace in Kyiv in May with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was visiting, looking on. His owner Mykhailo Iliev is a bomb disposal expert and soon after buying Patron he realised how helpful the dog could be in his work. Mykhailo said: 'This is his life, it is all he has known. It is just a matter of chance that we have such a capable dog. He is not a service dog, he is my pet, but he has an amazing nose and is an avid learner. He was meant to be a show dog but his destiny was to save people's lives, not to win prizes.' From six months, Patron was trained to detect TNT and gunpowder. When he does, he stops rigid and stands with his nose down until Mykhailo and his team approach. But he can sometimes find his job exhausting. 'Some days he is so tired that he does not eat his evening meal. He comes home, has a drink of water and just crashes out,' says Mykhailo. 'But he always wakes up excited to go again the next day.' Meanwhile, Zelensky warned yesterday that Russia will use Independence Day to increase their savage attacks, with the President warning of the possibility of 'repugnant Russian provocations'. And violence predictably broke out this morning as a shopping centre in Donetsk was struck by missiles, as a huge team of firefighters battled to tackle the huge blaze. Huge plumes of black smoke billowed from the Galaktika mall, as Russia accused Ukraine of bombarding the site in the separatist region, although it is not yet clear who carried out the attack or how many casualties there were. In an emotional speech today, Zelensky said Ukrainians now believe the war will end when they secure victory rather than negotiate peace. He said: 'A new nation appeared in the world on February 24 at 4 in the morning. It was not born, but reborn. A nation that did not cry, scream or take fright. One that did not flee. Did not give up. And did not forget,' he said. Ukraine celebrates its independence day on August 24 in commemoration of the Declaration of Independence in 1991. The country had been a major power in the Soviet Union, becoming the center of its arms industry and a major political player. But its output was redirected to the Soviet military and little was left for the Ukrainian population, and the quality of goods remained low compared to their neighbors. The push for independence surged with the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986, and the subsequent demise of the Soviet Union. In early 1990, over 300,000 Ukrainians linked arms in a human chain from Kyiv and Lviv as a show of unity against the Soviet bloc. A student protest known as the Revolution of Granite took place in October 1990 to prevent a new union treaty with the USSR. The country declared its independence in August 1991 and in December, a referendum backed the move with 90 percent approval, with majorities in every region including Crimea. The Soviet Union then formally ceased to exist on December 26. The 44-year-old wartime leader delivered the speech in his trademark combat fatigues in front of Kyiv's central monument to independence from the Russia-controlled Soviet Union. 'What for us is the end of the war? We used to say: peace. Now we say: victory,' he said. He continued: 'We will not sit down at the negotiating table out of fear, with a gun pointed at our heads. For us, the most terrible iron is not missiles, aircraft and tanks, but shackles. Not trenches, but fetters,' he said. He and his wife later attended a service in Kyiv's St. Sophia cathedral along with religious leaders from all of Ukraine's major faiths. Polish president Andrzej Duda echoed Zelensky's sentiments, saying the entire territory of Ukraine including Crimea needs to be liberated. He said at the summit yesterday: 'Crimea is Ukraine. Just as Gdansk or Lublin are part of Poland, Crimea is and will be part of Ukraine.' This morning, residents of Kyiv woke up to air raid sirens after the general staff had warned to take them seriously, saying: 'Russian occupiers continue to carry out air and missile attacks on civilian objects on the territory of Ukraine. Do not ignore air raid signals.' Zelensky told representatives of about 60 states and international organisations at a virtual summit on Crimea yesterday that Ukraine would drive Russian forces out of the peninsular by any means necessary, without consulting other countries beforehand. A small number of residents gathered in Kyiv's central square, where destroyed Russian tanks and mobile artillery were put on display over the weekend, and the national anthem is played every day at 7am local time. 'I can't sleep at night because of what I see and hear about what is being done in Ukraine,' a retiree who identified herself only by her first name, Tetyana, said, her voice shaking with emotion. 'This is not a war. It is the destruction of the Ukrainian people.'"
2022-08-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11140869/Putin-official-killed-car-bomb-blast-occupied-Ukraine-region.html,Putin official is killed in car bomb blast in occupied Ukraine region – as Zelensky says 'assassin' accused of killing 'Putin's Rasputin' daughter is NOT Ukrainian and denies Kyiv's involvement,"A Ukrainian national who acted as a pro-Putin official in occupied Zaporizhzhia region has been killed in a car bombing today, days after the daughter of a prominent Russian ultranationalist died in similar fashion at the weekend. Ivan Sushko, a 40-year-old father-of-one, died this morning when a car bomb detonated under his seat, harrowing CCTV footage showed. Images of the car taken after the blast showed the driver's side door crumpled with all the windows blown out and debris strewn across the road. It was reported that Sushko was taking his daughter to nursery at the time of the explosion. The child is not thought to have sustained life threatening injuries, but this has not been verified. Sushko was installed as head of the Mykhailivka 'military-civilian administration' by occupying Russian forces in May, in the region where Europe's largest nuclear plant is under siege. Putin loyalist Rogov said the attack was carried out by 'saboteurs' in the region, and vowed to track them down, claiming Ukraine was attacking Russian-backed officials who 'help improve the lives of ordinary people'. Ukrainian officials have not yet commented on the bombing, but President Volodymyr Zelensky has strongly denied his agents carried out the assassination of Darya Dugina, 29, the daughter of 'Putin's Rasputin', at the weekend. He rejected any link to Natalia Shaban-Vovk, a 43-year-old mother who Russia says acted for Kyiv's SBU secret service, going so far as to claim she is not even a Ukrainian citizen. 'This is definitely not our responsibility,' he said. 'She is not a citizen of our country. 'She is of no interest to us. She is not on the territory of Ukraine or the occupied territory of Ukraine.' Russia says Dugina, daughter of ultranationalist philosopher Alexander Dugin - a man described as the brains behind Putin's invasion of Ukraine - died a 'martyr' when she was killed in a car bombing in Moscow. The FSB secret service in Moscow immediately pinned the killing on Ukraine, pointing to Shaban-Vovk as the alleged assassin. But Putin foes in Ukraine and the West dispute as implausible the Kremlin's account that Shaban-Vovk crossed the border from Ukraine into Russia with her 12-year-old daughter, carried out the murder and then fled into Estonia before being caught. The FSB says Natalia was born in the city of Mariupol, in Ukraine's Donetsk region, in 1976 - when it was still part of the Soviet Union. Pro-Kremlin Telegram accounts have also shared what they believe to be a new surname she later adopted: Shaban. And it appears there is at least some truth to that information. A now-deleted profile on VKontakte - Russia's equivalent of Facebook - shows a profile belonging to a Natalia Shaban (Vovk) who lived in Mariupol. Her account was last active in 2016 and had a few dozen followers. The FSB also claims Natalia brought her daughter - Sofia - with her into Russia as she spied on Dugin before the killing. And pro-Russia social media accounts have been sharing a name that they believe belongs to Natalia's son: Danil Shaban. Vkontakte data from the same deleted profile uncovered by investigative site Proekt does appear to confirm that information as well. Natalia does indeed appear to have two children - a boy and a girl - and separate Facebook, VKontakte and TikTok profiles appear under the name Danil Shaban saying he was born in Mariupol in the year 2000. But, after this, the accounts given by Russian and Ukrainian sources diverge. Russia's account The FSB says Natalia crossed its border from Ukraine on July 23 driving a Mini Cooper with number plates issued by the so-called Donetsk People's Republic - the occupied region of Ukraine which now controls Mariupol. Spies have published CCTV footage that they say shows her at the border crossing point, as guards inspect the vehicle. They say she then changed the plates for ones issued by Kazakhstan and made her way to Moscow, where she rented an apartment in the same building as Dugina. She is also alleged to have changed her hair colour from blonde to brunette to avoid detection, seen in more CCTV released by the FSB which they say was taken in the stairwell of her apartment block. Natalia is accused of spending weeks tracking Dugina, before planting a bomb under her car as she attended a traditional poetry festival at the Zakharovo estate near Moscow on Saturday with father Alexander. After the bomb was planted, the FSB says Natalia swapped car plate again - this time for Ukrainian ones - and drove to Estonia, where she crossed into the EU. Pro-Kremlin Telegram channels say she has moved westward since then, and was last spotted checking into a hotel in Austria with two women and a child. They also claim to have uncovered an advert on Ukrainian social media trying to sell the Mini Cooper she was driving. RIA Novosti, Russia's main newswire, claims to have interviewed Natalia's father who told them that she served with the Ukrainian armed forces. He said she had retired for 'health reasons' and did not participate in anti-terrorism operations in the Donbas - the name Ukraine gave for the conflict smouldering in its eastern regions in the wake of Russia's first invasion in 2014. Natalia left Ukraine as a refugee 'some time ago', he said, adding that he had no idea she had gone to Russia. She called home a few days ago, he added, and told him that she was in Lithuania. The FSB have also published a photo of what they say is Natalia's ID issued by Ukraine's armed forces which they say proves she was part of Azov - though this has been widely disputed as a fake. The Russian embassy in the US expressed 'deep outrage' at a US claim that the murder could have been a Moscow 'false flag' killing. 'The administration gives the public the impression that the Russian authorities are responsible for the death of their own citizen and the true patriot of Russia,' said a statement. 'We are deeply outraged that the US authorities took advantage of this terrible tragedy to once again spread a set of irresponsible Russophobic statements.' Ukraine's account Ukraine's president Zelensky has now declared that Natalia Shaban-Vovk is 'not a Ukrainian citizen' and is 'not in Ukrainian territory'. But even prior to his announcement, Kyiv had strongly denied having anything to do with Dugina's death. And information put out by Kyiv and uncovered by various pro-Ukraine sources disputes key parts of Russia's narrative. A spokesman for the Azov battalion told Ukrainian media that Natalia had never served with them - because there are no women soldiers in their ranks. The source added that the ID card shown off by the FSB is actually for the National Guard, and would not be carried by an Azov soldier. He said pencil marks on the ID show it was invalidated because the woman had married and changed her last name. The soldier speculated that the invalid ID had been placed in archives of Ukraine's national guard in Mariupol - a building Russia now occupies - and had been uncovered by their troops and manipulated for propaganda purposes. Internet sleuths also claimed to have uncovered evidence that the picture on the ID had been manipulated. Pro-Ukraine Telegram accounts also uncovered what appears to a profile revealing that Natalia's first husband - identified as Andrey Vovk - had links to pro-Russian rebels in Donbas. Andrey, whose identity appears on a database tracking Ukrainian 'traitors', is accused of helping to organise a sham referendum on breaking away from Ukraine. All of which suggests, though does not prove, that Natalia may have harboured sympathies with Russia more than with Ukraine. Proekt also uncovered inconsistencies in social media accounts. According to Danil Shaban's Vkontakte page he was born in the year 2000, which would make him 22 years old. And according to the FSB, Sofia Shaban was 12 years old when she came with her mother into Russia two months ago. Pictures of Natalia on social media show her with two children - a boy and a girl - who both bear a striking resemblance to her and to each-other, but who appear to be a similar age rather than 10 years apart. Further, the site claims the advert for the Mini Cooper was posted the day before the blast and that a video on Danil's TikTok shows him driving a similar vehicle in Kyiv on August 16 - when Natalia was supposed to be with the car in Moscow. The conflicting accounts of Natalia's true identity further muddy the waters of an already murky case, with sources suggesting the bomb was the work of disgruntled Russian elites targeting Putin's inner circle or an FSB 'false flag' operation. Kyiv maintains the FSB is behind the whole operation, designed to cook up a pretext to escalate indiscriminate violence against Ukrainian civilians and the government to coincide with the country's independence day. Further adding fuel to the fire, a here-to unknown rebel group within Russia has emerged to take responsibility for the attack - calling themselves the National Republican Army. Announcing themselves via Ilya Ponomarev, a former Russian member of parliament turned-rebel, the group claim to be responsible for a number of partisan attacks across Russia opposing Putin's rule and his war. 'Our goal is to stop the destruction of Russia and its neighbours, to stop the activities of a handful of Kremlin businessmen who have sucked on the wealth of our people and are committing crimes inside and outside the country', their manifesto says. Ukraine's ambassador to the Vatican on Wednesday criticised Pope Francis for referring to Darya Dugina, daughter of a prominent Russian ultra-nationalist, who was killed by a car bomb near Moscow, as an innocent victim of war. It is highly unusual for ambassadors to the Vatican to criticise the pope publicly. 'Innocents pay for war,' Francis said earlier at his Wednesday general audience in a sentence where he referred to 'that poor girl thrown in the air by a bomb under the seat of a car in Moscow'. Russia blamed the killing on Ukrainian agents, a charge Kyiv denies. Alexander Dugin, Darya's father, has long advocated the unification of Russian-speaking and other territories in a new Russian empire that would include Ukraine. Darya Dugina broadly supported her father's ideas and appeared on state TV in her own right to offer support for Russia's actions in Ukraine. In a Tweet, Andrii Yurash, Ukraine's ambassador to the Holy See, said the pope's words were 'disappointing'. 'How (is it) possible to mention one of ideologists of (Russian) imperialism as innocent victim? She was killed by Russians,' he said. Francis called the war 'madness'. He said Ukrainian and Russian children had been killed and that 'being an orphan knows no nationality'. In his Tweet, Yurash said: 'canâ€™t speak in same categories about aggressor and victim, rapist and raped'. The Vatican did not immediately respond to Yurash's comments. In another part of his address, Pope Francis, called for 'concrete steps' to end the war in Ukraine and avert the risk of a nuclear disaster at the Zaporizhzhia power plant. Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of firing at the facility, the largest of its kind in Europe and which pro-Moscow forces took over soon after the Feb. 24 invasion. The United Nations has called for the area to be demilitarised. Francis spoke on the day Ukraine marked its independence from Soviet rule in 1991 and six months after Russian forces invaded. In an interview with Reuters last month, Francis said he wanted to visit Kyiv but also wanted to go to Moscow, preferably first, to promote peace."

The Foreign Secretary, who is widely expected to win the ongoing Tory leadership contest, offered her assurance that Ukraine would have 'no greater ally' than Britain if she enters Number 10. It has now been six months since Russia launched its latest brutal invasion on Ukraine, with Ms Truss insisting that 'Putin cannot prevail' with his military assault. Today is also Ukraine's independence day, which marks 31 years since the country's independence from Soviet rule. The Foreign Secretary noted how Britain 'was one of the first countries to recognise Ukraine’s independence' in 1991. She added the UK was 'now at the forefront in supporting our friends in their battle to stop Putin from turning the clock back through force of arms'. Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace - who is supporting Ms Truss in the Tory leadership race - claimed that Russia was in a 'very fragile position' and had now lost around 80,000 of its armed forces in the six months of conflict. Throughout Russia's full-scale attack on Ukraine this year, which began on 24th February, the Ministry of Defence has been widely sharing intelligence on the build-up of Russian troops and the success or failure of their advances. This has been done to counter Russian disinformation over its motives for the invasion, which the Kremlin has repeatedly only referred to as a 'special military operation'. In an article for the Daily Telegraph, Ms Truss vowed to go further to 'expose Putin’s playbook to the world' if she becomes PM on 6th September. 'We will continue to step up our work to counter the efforts of Russia and other authoritarian regimes to use disinformation to sow confusion and undermine global stability, drawing on the skills and tools at our disposal alongside our international partners. 'I will go further as prime minister by doing everything possible – including declassifying more intelligence – to expose Putin’s playbook to the world. 'My government will use intelligence strategically to reveal the Kremlin’s attempts to undermine and destabilise freedom-loving democracies. 'Where there are lies, they will be exposed, where there is barbarism, we will call it out. 'I will take the same tough approach to counter malign activity from potentially hostile states and others who threaten global security.' Ms Truss described Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a 'sharp shock of reality for the free world' as she reiterated her pledge to boost UK defence spending to three per cent of GDP by 2030. She also recommitted British support for Ukraine should she replace Boris Johnson in Downing Street. 'If I become prime minister, I will do everything I can to ensure the flame of freedom in Ukraine continues to burn bright,' the Foreign Secretary added. 'Putin cannot prevail. Under my leadership, President (Volodomyr) Zelensky will have no greater ally at this dark hour than the UK.' It has been reported that Ms Truss is considering making a trip to Ukraine one of her first acts in office in a public show of support for Kyiv. Mr Wallace, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, revealed that Russia's stalling advance in Ukraine could now be measured in 'metres per week, not miles'. 'It is grinding in small parts of the country in an attempt to advance – completely opposite of the three-days special operation that it touted at the beginning of this, six months ago,' the Defence Secretary said. 'We pretty much accept, well, we do accept, the sort of observations of Russian losses to be – if you combine deaths, injuries, desertions – over 80,000 of their armed forces. 'That’s 80,000 in six months compared to 15,000 they lost in a decade in Afghanistan. 'I think we are in a position where Russia is in a very fragile position.' Mr Wallace suggested that 'Ukraine is getting itself into that position' to try and retake territory that Russia still holds. He claimed the morale of Ukrainian troops was 'leagues ahead' of their 'poorly-trained' Russian adversaries. The Defence Secretary rejected the idea of a blanket ban on UK visas for Russians, but insisted 'we can toughen up the conditions'. 'I don’t like watching oligarchs’ wives or indeed Russian senior officials’ wives enjoying themselves in Greece or south of France, or super yachts around the world while their army is committing war crimes in Ukraine,' he added. 'I think that is very wrong.' Ms Truss's rival for the Tory leadership, ex-chancellor Rishi Sunak, today penned an open letter in the Kyiv Post newspaper to also offer his reassurance to Ukrainians of continued UK support. He wrote: 'Whatever the changes here in our country, we Brits will always remain your strongest ally. 'We will keep supporting your brave fighters to protect your citizens, we will keep providing humanitarian aid to ensure you have access to medication and food, and we will keep sheltering your loved ones until they can return home safely and sleep soundly. 'And when they do, I promise that the UK will be a lifelong friend and help Ukraine rebuild into the prosperous, ambitious and forward-looking country you are.' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer today met with Ukrainian troops being trained by the British military as he made a visit to Salisbury Plain. He said: 'My mission, my message to the Ukrainian people, to our troops, our Nato allies, is that on the issue of defending Ukraine against Russian aggression, we stand united. 'We will not be divided politically in the United Kingdom on this and I’ve been able to deliver that message first-hand amongst this very, very impressive training.'"
2022-08-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11140879/A-quarter-Russians-stopped-watching-state-TV-BORED-Putins-propaganda.html,A quarter of Russians have stopped watching state TV because they are BORED of Putin’s war propaganda,"A quarter of Russians have stopped watching state-run TV channels because they are bored of Vladimir Putin's relentless pro-war propaganda, a new survey has revealed. A survey by the independent Rosmir polling centre found that only 65 per cent of Russians watch Kremlin-run stations, down from 86 per cent at the start of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the Moscow Times reported. Russian state media TV channels - like Russia 1 and NT TV - have spent months pumping out pro-war propaganda and threatening to wipe out any nation supporting Ukraine with nuclear weapons - including the UK, US, France and Germany. Among the most prominent state TV propogandists is Vladimir Solovyov, known as 'Putin's voice', who has shamelessly accused Ukraine of staging atrocities to secure more military help from the West and threatened to nuke European capitals. But the relentless pro-war propaganda is boring ordinary Russians who are becoming more and more disillusioned with Putin's war, with a quarter of viewers now switching to different channels. Opinion polls also show only 55 per cent of Russians are in favour of the invasion, compared to 66 per cent a few months ago. Moscow restaurants numbers are now at a five-month low and the cinema sector has warned it will collapse without government support as sanctions continue to bite. The Kremlin has relied on state-run Russian TV channels to spread disinformation to bolster Russia's war in Ukraine. On Saturday, state-run TV station Russia Today claimed Russian troops were 'poisoned in a chemical attack in Ukraine', prompting fears Moscow will seek to justify the use of chemical weapons in the country. Kyiv hit back, suggesting the soldiers simply could have eaten contaminated meat. In June, propogandist Solovyov shamelessly accused Ukraine of staging a bombing on a shopping mall to secure more military help from the West. Solovyov unashamedly said Ukrainians 'do the same trick' when they need additional military help - 'they start screaming'. But in reality, it was a Russian missile strike on the crowded mall in central Ukraine that killed at least 18 people in what G7 leaders branded 'a war crime' at a meeting in Germany. The Amstor shopping mall was blown up in June - during the mall's busiest hours - while an estimated 1,000 people were inside by what Kyiv says was two Russian AS-4 guided missiles, Soviet-era weapons originally designed to take out US aircraft carriers. But Solovyov shamelessly claimed that it was all a lie and Ukraine had staged the bombing and killed their own citizens. In March, Putin signed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally 'fake' news about the Russian military or Putin's invasion. In a rare sign of dissent, Russian state TV journalist Marina Ovsyannikova stormed the set of Channel One - Russia's most watched news show - in March with a poster saying: 'They're lying to you here' and 'Stop the War!' She was arrested and charged under the law that Putin signed that penalises any statements against the Russian military - an offence that could land her in prison for 15 years. Through this law, Putin has strong-armed independent media outlets into peddling Russian propaganda - referring to a 'special military operation' instead of a 'war' or 'invasion' while denying mass Russian casualties and war atrocities."

And did not forget,' he said. The 44-year-old wartime leader delivered the speech in his trademark combat fatigues in front of Kyiv's central monument to independence from the Russia-controlled Soviet Union. 'What for us is the end of the war? We used to say: peace. Now we say: victory,' he said. Ukraine celebrates its independence day on August 24 in commemoration of the Declaration of Independence in 1991. The country had been a major power in the Soviet Union, becoming the center of its arms industry and a major political player. But its output was redirected to the Soviet military and little was left for the Ukrainian population, and the quality of goods remained low compared to their neighbors. The push for independence surged with the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986, and the subsequent demise of the Soviet Union. In early 1990, over 300,000 Ukrainians linked arms in a human chain from Kyiv and Lviv as a show of unity against the Soviet bloc. A student protest known as the Revolution of Granite took place in October 1990 to prevent a new union treaty with the USSR. The country declared its independence in August 1991 and in December, a referendum backed the move with 90 percent approval, with majorities in every region including Crimea. The Soviet Union then formally ceased to exist on December 26. He continued: 'We will not sit down at the negotiating table out of fear, with a gun pointed at our heads. For us, the most terrible iron is not missiles, aircraft and tanks, but shackles. Not trenches, but fetters,' he said. He and his wife later attended a service in Kyiv's St. Sophia cathedral along with religious leaders from all of Ukraine's major faiths. Polish president Andrzej Duda echoed Zelensky's sentiments, saying the entire territory of Ukraine including Crimea needs to be liberated. He said at the summit yesterday: 'Crimea is Ukraine. Just as Gdansk or Lublin are part of Poland, Crimea is and will be part of Ukraine.' This morning, residents of Kyiv woke up to air raid sirens after the general staff had warned to take them seriously, saying: 'Russian occupiers continue to carry out air and missile attacks on civilian objects on the territory of Ukraine. Do not ignore air raid signals.' Zelensky told representatives of about 60 states and international organisations at a virtual summit on Crimea yesterday that Ukraine would drive Russian forces out of the peninsular by any means necessary, without consulting other countries beforehand. A small number of residents gathered in Kyiv's central square, where destroyed Russian tanks and mobile artillery were put on display over the weekend, and the national anthem is played every day at 7am local time. 'I can't sleep at night because of what I see and hear about what is being done in Ukraine,' a retiree who identified herself only by her first name, Tetyana, said, her voice shaking with emotion. 'This is not a war. It is the destruction of the Ukrainian people.' But back home, ordinary Russians are becoming more and more disillusioned with Putin's constant barbarism and the unrelenting Kremlin war machine. A survey by the Rosmir polling centre found only 65 per cent watch Kremlin-run stations, down from 86 per cent at the outbreak of the war, the Moscow Times reported. Channel-1, Rossiya-1 and NT TV all tow the party line, issuing dire threats to the West and Ukraine as part of Putin's propaganda to shore up support for his war. Opinion polls show only 55 per cent of Russians are in favour of the invasion, compared to 66 per cent a few months ago. Moscow restaurants numbers are at a five-month low and the cinema sector has warned it will collapse without government support as sanctions continue to bite. It is not only Russians who are tiring of the war, with EU support for Ukraine now waning because of the cost of living crisis. UK diplomats have been pleading with European leaders to not cut aid to Kyiv, travelling across the continent to make their case for the besieged nation, The Telegraph reported. Governments are said to be wary of spending on arms and humanitarian supplies while energy bills surge at home, a source briefed on the talks said. Josep Borrell, the EU's top foreign diplomat, said yesterday that Vladimir Putin sees 'the weariness of the Europeans and the reluctance of their citizens to bear the consequences of support for Ukraine', he told AFP, adding: 'We will have to endure, and spread the costs within the EU.' The war has killed thousands of civilians, forced over a third of Ukraine's 41 million people from their homes, left cities in ruins, shaken global markets, and is largely at a standstill with no immediate prospect of peace talks. In addition to Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, Russian forces have expanded control to areas of the south including the Black Sea and Sea of Azov coasts, and chunks of the eastern Donbas region comprising the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk. Ukraine's armed forces have said almost 9,000 military personnel have been killed in the war. Ukraine broke free of the Soviet Union in August 1991 after a failed putsch in Moscow and an overwhelming majority of Ukrainians voted in a referendum to declare independence. International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi said the U.N. nuclear watchdog hoped to gain access to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine within days. Both sides have accused the other of firing missiles and artillery dangerously close to the plant, Europe's biggest, raising fears of a nuclear catastrophe. 'I'm continuing to consult very actively and intensively with all parties,' Grossi said in a statement on Tuesday. 'The mission is expected to take place within the next few days if ongoing negotiations succeed.' Pro-Moscow forces took over the plant soon after the invasion began but it is still operated by Ukrainian technicians. The United Nations has called for the area to be demilitarised. Russia on Tuesday accused Ukraine of attacking the plant with artillery, guided munitions and a drone, drawing a denial from Ukraine's U.N. ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya. 'Nobody who is at least conscious can imagine that Ukraine would target a nuclear power plant at tremendous risk of nuclear catastrophe and on its own territory,' Kyslytsya said at an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting in New York called by Russia. The United States, which has sent $10.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, will announce a new package of about $3 billion as early as Wednesday, a U.S. official said. Advanced U.S. missile systems appear to have helped Ukraine strike deep behind the front lines in recent months, taking out ammunition dumps and command posts. In the latest mysterious fire at a Russian military facility, Russian officials said ammunition stored in southern Russia near the border with Ukraine spontaneously combusted on Tuesday. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Belgorod region, blamed hot weather for the fire, drawing ridicule from Ukraine. 'In a few months we will find out whether Russian ammunition can explode because of the cold,' Ukraine's defence ministry said on Twitter. 'The five main causes of sudden explosions in Russia are: winter, spring, summer, autumn and smoking.' A car bombing outside Moscow on Saturday that killed the 29-year-old daughter of right-wing Russian political theorist Alexander Dugin heightened fears that Russia might intensify attacks on Ukraine this week. Russian officials have blamed Ukraine for the death of Darya Dugina, a nationalist Russian TV commentator. The car bomb exploded after she had attended a patriotic festival with her father, who was widely believed to have been the intended target. The Ukrainian government has denied any involvement. One of Russia's last prominent politicians to oppose Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine was detained in a dawn raid today accused of 'discrediting the Russian army'. Former mayor of Yekaterinburg, Yevgeny Roizman, 60, was naked with only a towel around his waist as armed police led by a woman law enforcement official stormed his flat. He has regularly denounced the war defying draconian laws forbidding such criticism. The politician is close to jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, now serving a nine year sentence after criticism of Putin. Searches were underway at Roizman's flat, a foundation he runs, and an icon museum he owns, as he was moved 1,100 miles to Moscow to face a criminal investigation. His arrest came exactly six months after the start of the conflict in Ukraine and follows his lambasting of Putin for his 'awful, monstrous, amateur war' in Ukraine. Roizman called it 'the most despicable, shameful and wrongful war in the history of Russia'. He said: 'Even at The Last Judgement I will not give these words up.' He warned in March: 'The country is changing really fast. The regime is becoming fascist. Many are leaving Russia.' He vowed to remain, even though arrest was likely as the country fell deeper into authoritarianism. 'I'm staying,' he said. 'This is my country, and I will not give up a millimetre of it. 'I cannot allow myself to be scared, and no-one will force me to say black is white.'"
2022-08-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11140053/Seven-ten-pubs-say-bust-winter-without-Government-intervention-fuel-bills.html,Last orders: Seven-in-ten pubs say they will go bust this winter without Government intervention on fuel bills,"Pubs are being driven towards 'extinction' by soaring energy bills – with as many as seven in ten saying they will not survive the winter. Two-thirds of pubs said their bills have more than doubled this year, while almost one in ten (8 per cent) have seen them rise by more than 500 per cent. And around 70 per cent of pubs surveyed by industry magazine The Morning Advertiser said they would go bust this winter without Government support – which the magazine warned amounts to 'extinction'. Businesses are not protected by the energy regulator's price cap, meaning pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK will be forced to pay market rates for gas and electricity. While Ofgem's household price cap is expected to rise from £2,700 to £3,700 in October – and by much more after that – businesses will be left at the mercy of volatile markets. It comes after industry leaders pointed out that if the price of beer had risen at the same rate as wholesale gas, a pint would cost £25. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said the sector was facing 'unsustainable' energy hikes, and called for business rates relief and the removal of VAT from energy bills until prices become affordable. She said: 'Without this support there is no doubt that many of the UK's most loved pubs and bars will not survive to see the New Year, robbing many of their livelihoods and ripping the heart out of communities across the UK.' Heath Ball, from the Frisco Group of three pubs in south-east England, warned the soaring bills posed an even bigger threat to the sector than the pandemic. Mr Ball said: 'Brits face the prospect of losing thousands of pubs if something isn't done soon to help.' Sacha Lord, Greater Manchester's night-time economy adviser, said staying in business was becoming 'near impossible' for many. 'I think we will see pubs closing at a record rate over the next 12 months,' he added. Factories and shops could also be forced to close due to mounting energy bills. It was also revealed yesterday that ministers were warned in November 2021, before the invasion of Ukraine, that the UK's high-street shops, restaurants, energy intensive factories and offices could all face work slow downs or stop completely due to soaring energy costs. The Project Shine forecast that the UK was particularly vulnerable to energy shocks was prepared by officials at the Treasury and industry specialists at PwC, according to Bloomberg. Those industries particular hit with higher bills include chemical and fertilizer manufacturers, which consumes 12% of its energy costs, cold food storage operators, glass manufacturing, relying on high-energy blast furnaces, and makers of cement, concrete, plaster and lime. These increased building and food costs will also be transferred to consumers, the report added. However No10 has told the BBC amid warnings of a gas supply shortage - which generates 40% of the UK's energy - that there is no reason to panic and households do not have to cut back on their energy use this winter. It is believed the Government document also drew up plans to help through a subsidy program as it warned chemical and fertilizer manufacturers were at particular risk, putting pressure on the cost of food. There was another proposal to add a levy to household energy bills and another funded by taxation. No immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 following the Tory leadership contest. Though it has launched on consultation on how to reduce bills for businesses. Mr Sunak has pledged to remove VAT from energy bills, while Ms Truss has promised to cut green levies. A spokesperson defended the government's response, pointing to the £145 million ($171 million) of extra support for energy-intensive industries in April 2022 which happened after Vladimir Putin's invasion. 'Ministers and officials continue to engage constructively and regularly with industry and our priority is to ensure costs are managed and supplies of energy are maintained,' the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, more than 65% of operators of pubs in a recent survey said they'd seen their utility costs increase by over 100% – within that, 30% reported a jump of 200% and 8% reported increases of more than 500%. Ed Bedington, editor of The Morning Advertiser, said: 'This situation is untenable and we're likely to see the closure of huge swathes of pubs and bars across the UK unless something is done to tackle these spiralling costs. 'The lack of support for businesses from the Government is shocking, and while effort is focused on helping consumers, the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs due to a lack of business support, is a crisis the Government seems to be either missing or ignoring. 'Pubs are an important part of our heritage and our communities and the loss of that will be huge, both in terms of employment, tax revenues, but also the social impact. 'We need to see action delivered to businesses now on energy, not when the next leader is rolled into place in September. Pubs took a hammering during the pandemic and this situation is rapidly pushing them over the edge.' Responding to the survey, one operator said: 'Proper support and intervention is needed by Government. Even a 20% increase will be unaffordable, never mind 200%.' Another added: 'Action needs to be taken now to protect businesses. It was hard enough making it through Covid times, this is now absolutely ridiculous.' 'We need lower prices,' said another desperate operator. 'We were in a fixed contract at 14p a unit and I've just been quoted 83p a unit. I'm a small wet-led pub, I have no chance of surviving.' One other simply said: 'Help.' The Russian invasion has also fueled the price of electricity and gas further with Consultancy Auxilione saying yesterday a new price cap for households will be three times the current limit of £1,971-a-year. Auxilion said that it believes the price cap, which will be announced for October on Friday, will be £3,576 from October, hitting £5,066 in January and then £6,552 in April. On Monday, energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight said gas and electricity bills are expected to hit £5,300 when next April's price cap is announced, piling further misery onto Britons as inflation keeps climbing. Yesterday, EDF's boss warned that familes face a 'dramatic and catastrophic' winter if the government does not provide help now as he said half of UK households could be in fuel poverty in January as a result of rocketing energy prices. His comments came as the National Grid prepared to hold an exercise to test the resilience of the UK's systems in the event of a gas supply emergency. Experts have also warned of a 'security of supply issue' in the energy sector as almost 40% of the UK's electricity was generated last year by gas. Heath Ball, MD of The Frisco Group, which operates three pubs across the South East of England, commented: 'This energy bill crisis comes on the back of the most testing of times as businesses try and recover from the Covid crisis and I think it poses an even greater threat to the survival of pubs. Brits face the prospect of losing thousands of pubs if something isn't done soon to help.' Heath, who is an award-winning operator, sent a stark warning to the Government: 'Find a solution to this now or face mass pub and restaurant closures. Once again the hospitality sector seems to be underrepresented in the corridors of power, maybe because they think we're a robust industry, and they are right, but this is now a doomsday scenario. 'Talking to other operators, they aren't even being offered new energy contracts at any price due to the sector being deemed 'high risk'. They can't get power even if they can afford it. What a shambles.' Britain's 'energy crisis hotspots' shown on Friends of the Earth interactive module above allows users to find out how badly different areas in England and Wales will be affected by the October price cap rise. Use your mouse or finger to scroll around the map, and click to focus on different areas Auxilione said the price cap will then fall back a little, but still remain at what would have been record prices previously, hitting £5,897 in July 2023 and £5,548 three months later. 'The nervousness of the market appears to increase day by day as we edge closer to winter delivery, now just five weeks away, and no big positive news on the horizon,' Auxilione said. 'The planned outages in a week's time have captured the attention of the market and are driving concerns further - as yesterday's market activity demonstrated.' Ofgem is set to announce its price cap decision for October at the end of this week. Analysts widely expect the cap to top £3,500, from £1,971 yesterday. Even a modest rise will put enormous pressure on households over the winter months when heating is turned on in homes. Households who primarily cook with an oven could save up to £604 a year by using more energy-efficient cooking methods, a study has found. Researchers calculated the energy consumption of 83 appliances and compared the running costs with the cheapest alternative. They found that that most energy-intensive cooking appliance is an electric oven, which typically costs 87p per day to run or £316 a year. However a microwave costs just 8p per day - representing a potential saving of £287 per year. An air fryer would cost just £52 a year, a saving of £264. The research by energy supplier Utilita also looked at how cooking methods can slash power consumption by up to 90 per cent and save an additional £317 a year. Batch cooking can bank £158 a year, using the correct sized pan with a lid saves £72, simmering rather than boiling £68 and not overfilling the kettle £19. As part of the in-depth report Utilita polled 2,000 households and found they spend approximately 43 minutes cooking each day. Of these, 42 per cent use the oven by default for most of their cooking needs but 52 per cent don't know which of their cooking appliances cost more to run. The researchers then looked at typical energy consumption for a range of cooking appliances and calculated how much energy they would consume in a typical day's usage. They then looked at previous academic studies into the impact of different cooking methods on energy consumption. For example, a study published in the Journal of Consumer Studies and Home Economics found that simmering at 90 degrees rather boiling at over 100 can reduce consumption by between 69 and 95 per cent. Based on typical modern-day usage, this could save households £68 a year. In total, the research studied 83 appliances and 24 sources including academic research, legislation, and data collected from popular shopping websites. Archie Lasseter, Utilita's sustainability lead, said: 'Although cooking is said to account for four per cent of the average energy bill, the savings speak for themselves. 'It's vital that consumers are given the facts they need in order to use less energy in the interest of the pocket and the planet.' The UK National Grid has also doubled its emergency planning exercise from two to four days amid fears of a spiraling energy crisis, it was revealed this week. Experts will wargame for four days in September what will happen if gas supplies are reduced which could trigger a need to ration electricity. The Exercise Degree is made up of government agencies, regulators, lobby groups and major energy firms. The exercise will take place in two stages on September 13 to 14 and October 4 to 5 - last year's version of the event took place over two days. It comes as experts like Keith Bell, professor of electronic and electrical engineering at Strathclyde University, told the BBC that one 'credible scenario that we need to be ready for' is cutting supplies to large industrial companies. 'Codes defining what should happen in the event of gas or electricity shortages and who is responsible for what - including the role of the secretary of state - have existed for many years but haven't had to be used' he added. 'A lesson from the pandemic is the need for preparedness and to test emergency arrangements to be sure that they're fit for purpose.' This is as the UK imported 38% of its overall energy supply from aboard and, Mr Bell, claimed Britain lacks the storage capacity for gas. Charles McAllister, director of policy for lobby group UK Onshore Oil and Gas, said Britain was 'at the highest risk of loss of energy supply in decades'. Under the Electricity Supply Emergency Code, Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng could take rationing steps if there were issues with supply, such as 'rota disconnections' which would mean cutting or limiting power at periods of high demand. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the UK has 'one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world'. And added: 'We are not dependent on Russian energy imports meaning households, businesses and industry can be confident they will get the electricity and gas they need'. Ed Miliband, shadow net zero and climate secretary, said the government's 'short-sightedness has been staggering - from closing our gas storage facilities, to failing to insulate houses and cut bills, and blocking the quickest, cheapest and cleanest renewables in their energy strategy'. No 10 also insisted to the Independent: 'Households, businesses and industry can be confident they will get the electricity and gas that they need over the winter. 'That's because we have one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world. 'We have access to our own North Sea gas reserves alongside steady imports from reliable partners like Norway.' But experts still maintain that there is a 10% chance 'for a short number of hours some domestic consumers [will] lose power' in winter. Adam Bell, head of energy strategy for the government until 2021, said: 'By not educating the public about how they can best lower their demand, they're increasing the likelihood of a security of supply issue.' The massive sales surge comes as experts forecast that annual household energy bills will rise past £4,000 by next January. After assessing current consumer habits, retail experts are now reporting that growing numbers of UK households are purchasing insulation to warm their homes and save money on bills. Latest data, provided by online marketplace OnBuy.com, shows week-on-week sales of household insulation is up 1238per cent. According to Northern Energy, poor wall insulation accounts for 35-45%* of heat lost in the home - resulting in lost energy and wasted money. Elsewhere, experts believe around 25per cent of a home's heat is lost through lofts and attics, a loss that can be mitigated against with good insulation. Liam Tickner, Home and Garden Category Manager at OnBuy, said: 'The cost of living crisis is affecting people right across the nation. 'With energy bills set to hit over £4,000 a year in January, and with the price of everyday expenses increasing, we are seeing people looking to save money. 'A poorly insulated house or flat can lead to lots of wasted money. Ahead of autumn and winter, we are seeing households purchasing insulation in an effort to save on bills'. Meanwhile, Philippe Commaret, EDF's managing director for customers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We face, despite the support that the Government has already announced, a dramatic and catastrophic winter for our customers,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today. 'In fact, in January half of the UK households might be in fuel poverty. That's the reason why we want to take actions in order to do everything we can do in order to help our customers. 'So, we are announcing yesterday that we are going to launch a campaign in order to reach hundreds of thousands of our customers to provide them further support to help them cut their costs, but also make sure that they are accessing all the available support that is available for them.' Mr Commaret also called on the Government to do more to support families after Octopus Energy's boss called for the price cap to be frozen as latest dire forecast suggests charges will nearly double in six months. Some areas of the UK will also be worse hit as Friends of the Earth research found the worst areas for bills' impact. Birmingham (1st), Bradford (2nd), Cornwall (3rd), Sandwell (4th), County Durham and Enfield (joint 5th) rank highest among 30 local authority areas with the most energy crisis hotspots. Mike Childs, head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said: 'There's no downplaying how catastrophic this and following winters will be for millions of people if energy bills rise as high as they're predicted to, unless the government meaningfully intervenes. 'Instead of woeful and poorly targeted cash handouts, or the promise of tax cuts that won't help those who need it the most, the government must beef up its package of emergency financial support by channelling money to those least able to pay their energy bills. 'And while vital, this is only a short-term solution. The highest priority of all is fixing the UK's leaky, inefficient housing stock, otherwise cash handouts will be required year on year. 'By rolling out a free programme of street-by-street energy efficiency measures, prioritising the most in-need neighbourhoods, we can help to bring bills down quickly, make homes warmer and slash Earth-warming emissions at the same time.' The first Australian gas shipment to Europe in more than half a decade is set to dock in the south of England on Monday, as gas shortages bite across the continent. The Attalos gas tanker is set to pull into the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent, by the mouth of the Thames during the day. It brings a rare cargo of liquified natural gas (LNG) from Australia to Europe, the first in six years, according to data from Bloomberg. Some of the gas is likely to be used in the UK straight away, but much of it will probably flow to Europe through the pipelines that connect Britain to the continent. There it might be channelled into European gas storage sites and some of it could return to Britain during winter. The UK has some of the highest LNG import capacity in Europe, but it has very little gas storage. Therefore, much of the LNG that comes to Europe this summer will arrive in British ports, but be shipped over to European storage sites. The Attalos departed Malaysia on July 20, according to data from Vessel Finder. Here it had picked up a shipment of gas that had come from Australia. Because of the long distances involved, it is rare for Australian gas to find its way to Europe. Most instead goes to countries in Asia. But the deep gas crisis that Europe is currently facing has catapulted the need for new sources of the fossil fuel. Gas prices have soared manifold in the last year, and the UK price for delivery next month was up another 17% on Monday morning, hitting £5.40p per therm. At the weekend experts predicted that the average household energy bill is likely to soar to more than £6,000 per year from next April. It is a dire warning for struggling households, and Monday's gas price hike will only add to these woes. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Octopus Energy chief executive Greg Jackson said that if the price of beer had risen as much as gas prices, getting a pint would cost £25. 'People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around £5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something,' he said. He added: 'There are systemic issues. 'There are loads of questions of how we pay for this. 'One thing we can't do is be expected to pass those costs on to consumers.' Soaring gas prices are also adding to the bill that will be hitting households to prop up failed energy supplier Bulb. According to new research by Auxilione, an energy consultancy, and shared with the Financial Times this weekend, the cost of bailing out Bulb might cost £4 billion by this spring. Ministers stepped in to rescue Bulb as it was considered too big to fail. Many of its rivals had gone out of business. Mr Commaret said: 'I think that all ideas in order to keep the bills for customers flat are really important and have all to be considered. 'There is not only one lever to be pulled but all levers have to be pulled right now because we face a catastrophic winter.' The war in Ukraine and the economic isolation of gas-producing Russia, combined with surging energy demand following the easing of coronavirus restrictions around the world, has driven up prices and caused uncertainty in international supply. The forecast by energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight has said bills could be capped at £5,341.08 four months into next year, while the figure for January's cap is expected to be £4,649.72. However, the price cap forecast for October this year is £3,583 for the average household, an 80 per cent rise on the current cap of £1,971. The firm has said it is 'difficult to see how many will cope' this winter, with the final figure for the October price cap to be announced by energy regulator Ofgem on Friday. Experts at financial firm Citi have said the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation - which indicates the increase in the amount people pay for goods and services - will hit 18.6 per cent in January. Meanwhile, it emerged that homeowners could get paid to turn off power-hungry appliances such as washing machines, tumble dryers and games consoles during peak times under a new scheme. The National Grid is reportedly considering giving money to people who cut back on their energy between 5pm and 8pm in the form of rebates. There are concerns how millions of households in the UK will be able to afford their energy bills this winter - between October and April the average household will pay an equivalent £4,102 per year for their gas and electricity. The price cap, which is now being raised quarterly instead of every six months previously, would see a massive jump from today's £1,971, which is already a record, and much higher than the £1,138 seen last winter. Cornwall Insight said yesterday: 'While the energy price cap rise in April was already an unprecedent increase in domestic consumer energy bills, our final predictions for October are truly concerning,' Cornwall Insight said. 'With the cost of living spiralling and households looking at an energy bill rise of over £1,500 equivalent per year, it is difficult to see how many will cope with the coming winter.' The new warnings will concern ministers as they meet energy bosses later this week. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi is holding a series of meetings this week to follow up on earlier discussions with energy generation companies. Denmark's Orsted, nuclear company Newcleo, and German giant RWE are all meeting the Chancellor this week, and will be asked what they can do to help consumers with rising energy prices. October's price cap forecast breaks down as predicting a ceiling for electricity bills of £1,679.35, whilst the limit for gas will be £1,874.40. In January, the breakdown could be £2,212.32 for electricity and £2,437.39 for gas. In April, the bills could climb further to £2,365.38 for electricity and £2,975.70 for gas. In July next year, the cap is predicted to fall to £4,767.97, with a £2,052.70 limit for electricity and a £2,715.27 ceiling for gas. By October next year, the figure could climb again to £4,807.11, with £2,110.70 for electricity and £2,696.41. Octopus Energy's Greg Jackson says the wholesale price of gas is to blame for the soaring bills. He has laid the blame at the door of Russia, which has throttled supplies to Europe in retaliation for sanctions imposed on it after its invasion of Ukraine. Wholesale gas prices, which have a huge impact on the price of electricity, are nearly 10 times higher than usual - with the current price at £540 per therm. Mr Jackson said if the price of a pint had gone up at the same rate people would be paying double figures for beer. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: 'I think the spate of failures within the 29 companies that went bust last year, that was driven by gas prices roughly doubling. They're currently nine to 11 times higher than usual. 'Look, to put that in perspective, if this was beer, we're talking about the wholesale price being £25 a pint. 'People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around £5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something.' These surging energy prices will be the key factor in driving inflation to 18.6 per cent in January, according to financial services firm Citi. It says inflation will soar past the 13 per cent which the Bank of England previously said would be the peak in October, instead hitting the highest level since 1975 in the new year. Last month, CPI inflation struck a new 40-year-high of 10.1 per cent. Citi analyst Ben Nabarro has forecast that inflation will jump to 14.8 per cent in October as energy bills spike for UK households. He projected that inflation will accelerate following last week's 25 per cent rise in UK gas prices and 7 per cent rise in UK electricity prices. Citi said it expects the October energy price cap to reach £3,717, slightly higher than previous estimates. A further increase in energy bills in January - with projections the cap will hit £4,567 - will push inflation towards the new peak, it said. It predicted that the price cap will surge to £5,816 in April. The new forecasts predict that inflation will stay in double figures for the next 12 months and will finally dip back below the Bank of England target rate of 2 per cent by April 2024. Mr Nabarro said: 'Even with the economy softening, last week's data re-affirmed the continued risk of pass through from headline inflation into wage and domestic price setting could accelerate. 'With inflation now set to peak substantially higher than the 13 per cent forecast in August, we expect the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will conclude the risks surrounding more persistent inflation have intensified.' Interest rates increased to 1.75 per cent earlier this month but the economist warned that it could need to rise as high as 7% if 'signs of embedded inflation emerge'."

Leading think-tank Policy Exchange said the new Government will only cope with the cost of living crisis, a possible resurgence in Covid rates and the war in Ukraine if it is armed with a more strategic and dynamic civil service. In its report, Reform of Government – What do we want from our new prime minister?, the organisation highlights concerns about the current government ‘machine’. They include the huge number of people working for the civil service, which now totals around 480,000, and the urgent need for more specialists to help with policy. Amid a manifesto for change it has also said contracts should be awarded based on performance rather than on a fixed-term basis. The report’s author Benjamin Barnard said that in order to re-energise the civil service, the next premier ‘must embrace the principle of a smaller and more strategic civil service that delivers services in a more efficient way’. This will be delivered by going ahead with plans to relocate 22,000 workers outside of London and streamline the workforce, the report says. Both Tory leadership hopefuls have vowed to reform the civil service during their campaigns."

It has a blast hole in its armoured turret, possibly caused by a British donated anti-tank rocket. And, while it will play no further role in Putin’s ‘special military operation’, it will take part in an ‘ironical parade’ of captured Russian equipment to mark today’s Ukraine Independence Day. The shattered hulks of dozens of Putin’s tanks, armoured fighting vehicles and other heavy equipment stretch from block to block along Khreshchatyk, Kyiv’s main boulevard; a vivid demonstration of Ukraine’s surprise success in resisting the Russian invasion. We’re exactly six months into Europe’s most dangerous conflict since the Second World War. Winter has become spring and now high summer and tomato vines laden with fruit are growing through a fissure that runs across a collapsed highway where it traverses the Irpin River. I can guess why they are there. In early March, I had stood on that very spot, in a snowstorm, as refugees filed across the river via a makeshift wooden pontoon. Boxes of bread, fruit and vegetables had been left there for the fugitives to pick at as they passed. Some of those donated tomatoes must have fallen through gaps in the ruptured road and, as the weather warmed, their seeds germinated. It is an example of how nature can adapt to survive. But what of Ukraine itself? Beyond all expectations, most of this country remains independent. More than five million of its women and children fled the country as refugees in the first weeks of the war, when it seemed that Ukraine had to succumb. Instead, it was the Russians who suffered defeat after embarrassing defeat. Ukraine claims to have killed some 45,000 ‘occupiers’ on the battlefield and is poised to launch a major counter-offensive to recapture the southern city of Kherson. President Volodymyr Zelensky has promised his forces will eventually take back Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. The Russians gave up their bid to capture Kyiv in late March and have concentrated their efforts on the Donbas region in the east. The nearest active front lines are now hundreds of miles away from the capital. Yet Kyiv is on a new knife edge. Many people I spoke to here, including high-level diplomatic sources, fear Putin will choose Independence Day to take revenge on Ukraine – and Kyiv in particular – with a retributive barrage of ballistic missiles. The successful strikes against Russian bases in Crimea in the past week have heightened such trepidation. ‘It has been like poking Putin with a stick. He is humiliated,’ one diplomat told me. Russia has also blamed Ukraine for the recent car bomb assassination in Moscow of the daughter of ultra-nationalist philosopher Alexander Dugin, who is known by some as ‘Putin’s Brain’. Dugin has called for revenge. President Zelensky has warned citizens of the possibility of ‘nasty’ and ‘cruel’ attacks. Civil servants at government ministries here have been told to work from home today. Yesterday the US embassy here issued a warning that the ‘department of state has information that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days’. I returned to Ukraine for the first time since April on the night sleeper to Kyiv. The civilian airspace remains closed so there is still no other way to get to the city apart from road. The last time I passed this way – on the first day of war – no one was heading east, only west. Now I’m sharing my four-berth compartment with a couple from Kyiv who have decided to return from exile. The rest of the train is similarly full; mostly with mothers and children or young women who have spent the last six months as refugees and are now going back. There is no air conditioning or even refreshments during the 15-hour journey. But people want to go home. At Kyiv’s main station, the ornate entrance hall is quiet. The Red Cross emergency first aid post has gone. Outside, most of the anti-tank obstacles and military checkpoints that were on every street in early wartime have also disappeared. The traffic is, once again, nose to tail. I was anxious to return to Bucha, the Kyiv satellite town that became synonymous with the murder of civilians by Russia’s military. Superficially, it too has come back to life. The glaziers and construction teams have been busy. Railway Station Street, which in April had presented a spectacular vista of devastation, now resembles any other quiet suburban thoroughfare. The field behind the Church of St Andrew the First-Called, where I stood in the rain and watched corpse after murdered corpse being recovered from a mass grave, is covered in summer grass and flowers. But beneath the tranquil surface deep trauma remains. In the crypt several old ladies are in conversation. Neonila, 82, tells me: ‘We still live in fear here. I get frightened when I hear the air-raid siren and I have a gut feeling that the Russians will come back. ‘Recovery is much harder for those who lived through what happened here in Bucha rather than those who became refugees. I saw a woman who was pushing a trolley of water shot dead in front of me. You don’t forget such things.’ Of the possibility of missile attacks today, she said: ‘Independence Day is a holiday for us but I don’t think many will be celebrating. It is not the time for that. Ukraine is stuck in someone’s [she means Putin’s] throat right now and they will not leave us alone.’ The parish priest, Father Andrii Halavin, says that life remains hard for many. ‘Some still do not have a roof over their heads,’ he says. ‘The state cannot provide sufficient help to all of those people, as everything must go to help the boys on the front line. Everyone understands, but it doesn’t make the lives of those who lost their homes less miserable.’ Irina’s plight is particularly tragic. She must remain in the war-damaged house on the edge of Bucha where the Russians murdered her husband, brother and two of her cousins. She has nowhere else to go. I went looking for her this week because on another terrible day in April, Mail photographer Jamie Wiseman and I bore witness to the recovery of half a dozen murdered civilians who had been shot, then piled on top of each other and burned with petrol by Russian troops. At the time the victims were unidentified. Now I know that two of the bodies were those of Irina’s cousins. Clearly she is still in shock. Her house is scarred by shrapnel and machine gun fire. Her front door was removed by the Russians to make a barricade and has yet to be properly replaced. Her fence was knocked down by a tank. We talk in the overgrown garden where her brother was tortured and executed – she shows me a picture of his shattered body that she keeps on her phone. ‘Why did they kill my family?’ she asks repeatedly. ‘I have no idea why they committed such cruelty. Wednesday is a big anniversary for our country but a lot of people are expecting new attacks as a result. Putin likes to turn our cities into rubble.’ The Russians may have retreated but the forests and fields around Bucha continue to throw up fresh horrors. In the town’s main cemetery there are 21 fresh graves. The burials took place earlier this week. Each plot has a cross with a generic name plate. But there are no names, only numbers – these are the graves of the unidentifiable dead. The first simply says: ‘Here lies Number 252. May they rest in peace.’ Nearby, three siblings are tending the grave of their mother who was murdered during the occupation. They are reticent and downbeat. ‘Months have passed since our mother was killed but nothing has really changed,’ says one of the young men. ‘This war has stolen our youth.’ Today should be one of celebration for Ukraine. The country has much to be proud of in the way it has resisted its giant neighbour. But with Putin as your enemy, death is never very far away."
2022-08-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11139811/Violent-Russian-opposition-faction-group-claims-responsibility-Darya-Duginas-death.html,Did anti-Putin Russian group plant car bomb blamed on Kyiv? Violent opposition faction claims it was responsible for attack that killed activist's daughter,"A violent Russian opposition group has claimed it killed the daughter of a political activist who influenced Vladimir Putin. The so-called National Republican Army used its account on the Telegram social media platform to take responsibility for the death of Darya Dugina, 29, who died in a car bomb in Moscow. Russian FSB intelligence officials blamed the explosion on Saturday night on a Ukrainian woman spy, who they named as Natalia Vovk. Miss Dugina’s father Alexander Dugin, 60, had previously been credited with shaping Putin’s vision of an empire encompassing former Soviet states such as Ukraine, earning him the name ‘Putin’s brain’. But the bearded, Rasputin-esque figure had become more critical of Putin and is considered to have been the target of the bombing. At a ceremony yesterday to celebrate Miss Dugina’s life, her father promised a new Russian state would fully annex Ukraine and other territories. He told mourners his daughter ‘died for the people, died for Russia’. He added: ‘The huge price we have to pay can only be justified by the highest achievement, our victory.’ However the National Republican Army mocked the Kremlin’s far-fetched version of events, which included the mysterious Miss Vovk repeatedly changing her appearance and her car’s registration plates to hoodwink Russian guards. It said: ‘The speed of the investigation! All this became known a day after the murder. The authorities are so afraid of the partisans that they are ready for any fables.’ Last night Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov described Miss Dugina’s murder as a ‘barbaric crime’. Her death has prompted calls among Moscow’s political elite for revenge. The US embassy in Kyiv has warned of an increased possibility of Russian military strikes."

The threat emerged last night in an intelligence report declassified by the US State Department. In another sickening move Russia may also use today's anniversary to start trials of Ukrainian prisoners of war – with the defendants forced to watch proceedings from cages. Pictures have emerged of huge steel cages being constructed inside Mariupol's philharmonic hall where the trials are due to be held. Last night the prospect of soldiers who were legally defending their homeland being caged was condemned by the United Nations. Today is the 31st anniversary of the vote in the Ukrainian parliament to unshackle the country from the Soviet Union. Downing Street is adorned with a floral arch in the colours of the Ukrainian flag to mark the nation’s independence from Soviet rule today. From Cardiff City Hall to the British Library, Blackpool Tower to Wembley Arch, landmarks across the UK will light up in blue and yellow in solidarity with Ukrainians. Celebrations in Kyiv for the 31st anniversary are banned amid fears of Russian attacks on Ukraine’s capital. It is also exactly six months since Russia launched its invasion which has failed to achieve any of its strategic objectives. The threat of further Russian attacks on civilian targets saw the British and US governments reissue warnings to its citizens to leave Ukraine. And there are fears Moscow could use the death of Darya Dugina – whose father Alexander was a close Putin adviser – – to justify further attacks. The warnings came as Boris Johnson told the Ukrainian parliament the UK would continue to support the country against Russian aggression. He also insisted Britain would never recognise Russia's annexation of Crimea 'or any other Ukrainian territory'. Mr Johnson said: 'It has never been more important for all of us to stand together in defence of the foundational principle of international law, which is that no territory, no country, can acquire territory or change borders by force of arms, and it so follows that we will never recognise Russia's annexation of Crimea or any other Ukrainian territory. 'In the face of Putin's assault, we must continue to give our Ukrainian friends all the military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support that they need.' President Volodymyr Zelensky promised a 'powerful response' to any attacks on Ukrainian soil today. As a precaution, pubic celebrations of Independence Day have been banned in Kyiv and other major cities. A curfew was announced in Kharkiv and, across the country, Ukrainians have been advised to work from home. Trials of captured soldiers from Ukraine's Azov brigade could begin as soon as today, according to intelligence sources. The men have been in Russian captivity since the end of the siege of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol in May. They are being put on trial by pro-Russian separatists in occupied areas of southern Ukraine. They may also appear before judges while caged inside huge steel enclosures. Last night UN human rights official Ravina Shamdasani said: 'We are very concerned about the way this is being done.' Of the cages, she added: 'This is not acceptable, this is humiliating.' Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Mr Zelensky, added: 'The trial of the captured defenders represents yet another Russian war crime. They are combatants who legally defended their country.'"
2022-08-23,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11138661/Scottish-Power-boss-met-Kwasi-Kwarteng-propose-100bn-plan-freeze-energy-bills-2024.html,"Scottish Power boss met with Kwasi Kwarteng to propose £100bn plan to freeze energy bills until 2024 - as latest forecast suggests families face paying £6,500-a-year from April","Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has met with the boss of Scottish Power over the energy giant's £100bn plan to freeze energy bills until 2024. Scottish Power chief Keith Anderson said that the minister and Liz Truss ally is 'seriously considering' plans to loan energy companies the money to fund a price cap freeze. Households could face average energy bills of £6,500 a year by this April, new forecasts of the energy price cap reveal. This comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to squeeze gas supplies to Europe worsening Britain's cost-of-living crisis. Mr Anderson warned that Ofgem further raising the price cap - with the new limit set to be announced on Friday - would be 'horrific' and that 'bold' action is needed, the BBC reports. If the 'deficit-fund' plan from Scottish Power were implemented, the government would guarantee energy suppliers loans of around a tenth of a trillion pounds - their best estimate between the difference between the cost of buying energy and the current cap. This would allow bills to remain frozen for next two years but also not bankrupt energy suppliers due to the rising cost of gas - with the loans being repaid over two decades. Kwasi Kwarteng - who is tipped to become chancellor if Liz Truss wins the Tory leadership - is reportedly receptive to the plan. According BBC business editor Simon Jack, sources close to Mr Kwarteng have said: 'We had a meeting about it - that's all.' This comes after Labour leader Keir Starmer last week unveiled his £29bn plan to freeze energy bills for six months. This would be paid by widening windfall taxes on oil and gas producers by backdating it from May to January. However this plan was branded unworkable by senior Tories - as energy firms could go bust if they are unable to pass on increasing wholesale costs to consumers. The Institute for Fiscal Studies also said the policy would need to be in place for at least a year and could cost as much as the furlough scheme. The Scottish Power chief executive has called for 'national action', saying that the energy crisis is a 'national crisis... on the scale of the pandemic'. Mr Anderson said he had discussed his proposals with Mr Kwarteng and chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, saying: 'I think this is being seriously considered.' Scottish Power, OVO Energy and E.On are also due to take part in special summit with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Tuesday, after she said a price cap rise 'can't be allowed to go ahead'. Consultancy Auxilione said the price cap will be three times the current limit of £1,971-a-year – and £1,000 more than what was warned of just yesterday by another energy expert - because it bases its forecast on Monday's gas price. The price of natural gas in Europe has rocketed again this week after Russia closed the Nordstream 1 gas pipeline from St Petersburg to Germany for 'maintenance'. Though the UK does not depend on Putin's gas exports, and gets most of its supply from Norway, the squeeze on supplies to continental Europe sent the global price of gas soaring to £250 per megawatt hour on Monday. British households are already reeling from the surge in gas prices that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This made inflation fueled by Covid financial packages even worse, and has left one bank warning that the UK could face inflation of up to 18% by the start of next year. Auxilion said that it believes the price cap, which will be announced for October on Friday, will be £3,576 from October, hitting £5,066 in January and then £6,552 in April. On Monday, energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight said gas and electricity bills said they expect bills to hit £5,300 in April price. Today, EDF's boss warned that families face a 'dramatic and catastrophic' winter if the government does not provide help now as he said half of UK households could be in fuel poverty in January as a result of rocketing energy prices. His comments came as the National Grid prepared to hold an exercise to test the resilience of the UK's systems in the event of a gas supply emergency. Experts have also warned of a 'security of supply issue' in the energy sector as almost 40% of the UK's electricity was generated last year by gas. However No10 told the BBC there is no reason to panic and households do not have to cut back on their energy use. But factories, shops and pubs could be forced to close as their bills are not protected by a cap to prices like households. Pub landlords are demanding a reduction in VAT and business rates, and a cap on energy prices for businesses so they can be pushed back from the edge this winter. In a recent survey by The Morning Advertiser, nearly three-quarters of landlords said they had seen their utility costs increase by over 100% as they claimed their pubs could go 'extinct' by Christmas. Britain's 'energy crisis hotspots' shown on Friends of the Earth interactive module above allows users to find out how badly different areas in England and Wales will be affected by the October price cap rise. Use your mouse or finger to scroll around the map, and click to focus on different areas. Auxilione said the price cap will then fall back a little, but still remain at what would have been record prices previously, hitting £5,897 in July 2023 and £5,548 three months later. 'The nervousness of the market appears to increase day by day as we edge closer to winter delivery, now just five weeks away, and no big positive news on the horizon,' Auxilione said. 'The planned outages in a week's time have captured the attention of the market and are driving concerns further - as yesterday's market activity demonstrated.' Ofgem is set to announce its price cap decision for October at the end of this week. Analysts widely expect the cap to top £3,500, from £1,971 today. Even a modest rise will put enormous pressure on households over the winter months when heating is turned on in homes. The UK National Grid has also doubled its emergency planning exercise from two to four days amid fears of a spiraling energy crisis, it was revealed this week. Experts will wargame for four days in September what will happen if gas supplies are reduced which could trigger a need to ration electricity. The Exercise Degree is made up of government agencies, regulators, lobby groups and major energy firms. The exercise will take place in two stages on September 13 to 14 and October 4 to 5 - last year's version of the event took place over two days. It comes as experts like Keith Bell, professor of electronic and electrical engineering at Strathclyde University, told the BBC that one 'credible scenario that we need to be ready for' is cutting supplies to large industrial companies. 'Codes defining what should happen in the event of gas or electricity shortages and who is responsible for what - including the role of the secretary of state - have existed for many years but haven't had to be used' he added. 'A lesson from the pandemic is the need for preparedness and to test emergency arrangements to be sure that they're fit for purpose.' The neighbourhoods that are being worst impacted by soaring energy prices have been identified for the first time as part of new research by Friends of the Earth. The environmental group has found that there are almost 9,000 energy crisis hotspots across England and Wales where communities are at greatest risk of serious financial hardship as a result of unaffordable energy costs. It identified neighbourhoods with below average income using the government's Index of Multiple Deprivation data and then used smart meter data to determine energy use. It then found that Birmingham, Bradford, Cornwall, Sandwell, County Durham and Enfield top the list of 30 areas with the highest number of 'energy crisis hotspots' Local authority name Birmingham Bradford Cornwall Sandwell County Durham Enfield Croydon Leicester Walsall Brent Average bill before October £2,226 £2,224 £2,362 £2,154 £2,121 £2,186 £2,235 £2,217 £2,150 £2,332 Average bill after October £3,262 £3,259 £3,289 £3,142 £3,064 £3,196 £3,276 £3,248 £3,136 £3,434 This is as the UK imported 38% of its overall energy supply from aboard and, Mr Bell, claimed Britain lacks the storage capacity for gas. Charles McAllister, director of policy for lobby group UK Onshore Oil and Gas, said Britain was 'at the highest risk of loss of energy supply in decades'. Under the Electricity Supply Emergency Code, Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng could take rationing steps if there were issues with supply, such as 'rota disconnections' which would mean cutting or limiting power at periods of high demand. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the UK has 'one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world'. And added: 'We are not dependent on Russian energy imports meaning households, businesses and industry can be confident they will get the electricity and gas they need'. Ed Miliband, shadow net zero and climate secretary, said the government's 'short-sightedness has been staggering - from closing our gas storage facilities, to failing to insulate houses and cut bills, and blocking the quickest, cheapest and cleanest renewables in their energy strategy'. No 10 also insisted to the Independent: 'Households, businesses and industry can be confident they will get the electricity and gas that they need over the winter. 'That's because we have one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world. 'We have access to our own North Sea gas reserves alongside steady imports from reliable partners like Norway.' But experts still maintain that there is a 10% chance 'for a short number of hours some domestic consumers [will] lose power' in winter. Adam Bell, head of energy strategy for the government until 2021, said: 'By not educating the public about how they can best lower their demand, they're increasing the likelihood of a security of supply issue.' Meanwhile, Philippe Commaret, EDF's managing director for customers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We face, despite the support that the Government has already announced, a dramatic and catastrophic winter for our customers,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today. 'In fact, in January half of the UK households might be in fuel poverty. That's the reason why we want to take actions in order to do everything we can do in order to help our customers. 'So, we are announcing today that we are going to launch a campaign in order to reach hundreds of thousands of our customers to provide them further support to help them cut their costs, but also make sure that they are accessing all the available support that is available for them.' Mr Commaret also called on the Government to do more to support families after Octopus Energy's boss called for the price cap to be frozen as latest dire forecast suggests charges will nearly double in six months. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Octopus Energy chief executive Greg Jackson said that if the price of beer had risen as much as gas prices, getting a pint would cost £25. 'People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around £5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something,' he said. He added: 'There are systemic issues. 'There are loads of questions of how we pay for this. 'One thing we can't do is be expected to pass those costs on to consumers.' Some areas of the UK will also be worse hit as Friends of the Earth research found the worst areas for bills' impact. Birmingham (1st), Bradford (2nd), Cornwall (3rd), Sandwell (4th), County Durham and Enfield (joint 5th) rank highest among 30 local authority areas with the most energy crisis hotspots. Mike Childs, head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said: 'There's no downplaying how catastrophic this and following winters will be for millions of people if energy bills rise as high as they're predicted to, unless the government meaningfully intervenes. 'Instead of woeful and poorly targeted cash handouts, or the promise of tax cuts that won't help those who need it the most, the government must beef up its package of emergency financial support by channelling money to those least able to pay their energy bills. 'And while vital, this is only a short-term solution. The highest priority of all is fixing the UK's leaky, inefficient housing stock, otherwise cash handouts will be required year on year. 'By rolling out a free programme of street-by-street energy efficiency measures, prioritising the most in-need neighbourhoods, we can help to bring bills down quickly, make homes warmer and slash Earth-warming emissions at the same time.' No immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 following the Tory leadership contest. Mr Sunak has pledged to remove VAT from energy bills, while Ms Truss has promised to cut green levies. Mr Commaret said: 'I think that all ideas in order to keep the bills for customers flat are really important and have all to be considered. 'There is not only one lever to be pulled but all levers have to be pulled right now because we face a catastrophic winter.' The war in Ukraine and the economic isolation of gas-producing Russia, combined with surging energy demand following the easing of coronavirus restrictions around the world, has driven up prices and caused uncertainty in international supply. The forecast by energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight has said bills could be capped at £5,341.08 four months into next year, while the figure for January's cap is expected to be £4,649.72. However, the price cap forecast for October this year is £3,583 for the average household, an 80 per cent rise on the current cap of £1,971. The firm has said it is 'difficult to see how many will cope' this winter, with the final figure for the October price cap to be announced by energy regulator Ofgem on Friday. There are concerns how millions of households in the UK will be able to afford their energy bills this winter - between October and April the average household will pay an equivalent £4,102 per year for their gas and electricity. The price cap, which is now being raised quarterly instead of every six months previously, would see a massive jump from today's £1,971, which is already a record, and much higher than the £1,138 seen last winter. Cornwall Insight said yesterday: 'While the energy price cap rise in April was already an unprecedent increase in domestic consumer energy bills, our final predictions for October are truly concerning,' Cornwall Insight said. 'With the cost of living spiralling and households looking at an energy bill rise of over £1,500 equivalent per year, it is difficult to see how many will cope with the coming winter.' The new warnings will concern ministers as they meet energy bosses later this week. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi is holding a series of meetings this week to follow up on earlier discussions with energy generation companies. Denmark's Orsted, nuclear company Newcleo, and German giant RWE are all meeting the Chancellor this week, and will be asked what they can do to help consumers with rising energy prices. October's price cap forecast breaks down as predicting a ceiling for electricity bills of £1,679.35, whilst the limit for gas will be £1,874.40. In January, the breakdown could be £2,212.32 for electricity and £2,437.39 for gas. In April, the bills could climb further to £2,365.38 for electricity and £2,975.70 for gas. In July next year, the cap is predicted to fall to £4,767.97, with a £2,052.70 limit for electricity and a £2,715.27 ceiling for gas. By October next year, the figure could climb again to £4,807.11, with £2,110.70 for electricity and £2,696.41. Octopus Energy's Greg Jackson says the wholesale price of gas is to blame for the soaring bills. He has laid the blame at the door of Russia, which has throttled supplies to Europe in retaliation for sanctions imposed on it after its invasion of Ukraine. Wholesale gas prices, which have a huge impact on the price of electricity, are nearly 10 times higher than usual - with the current price at £540 per therm. Mr Jackson said if the price of a pint had gone up at the same rate people would be paying double figures for beer. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: 'I think the spate of failures within the 29 companies that went bust last year, that was driven by gas prices roughly doubling. They're currently nine to 11 times higher than usual. 'Look, to put that in perspective, if this was beer, we're talking about the wholesale price being £25 a pint. 'People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around £5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something.' Citi analyst Ben Nabarro has forecast that inflation will jump to 14.8 per cent in October as energy bills spike for UK households. He projected that inflation will accelerate following last week's 25 per cent rise in UK gas prices and 7 per cent rise in UK electricity prices. Citi said it expects the October energy price cap to reach £3,717, slightly higher than previous estimates. A further increase in energy bills in January - with projections the cap will hit £4,567 - will push inflation towards the new peak, it said. It predicted that the price cap will surge to £5,816 in April."

As the war drags on with no end in sight, U.S. officials are reportedly shifting their strategy toward a longer-term campaign, offering the funds to train and equip Ukrainian soldiers for years to come. The Biden administration is expected to announce the package on Wednesday - exactly six months after the invasion on Feb. 24. The money will fund contracts for drones, weapons and other equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two, sources familiar said, which is sure to rile up Republicans who claim there has been little oversight over funds to Ukraine. Earlier shipments, most of them done under Presidential Drawdown Authority, have focused on Ukraine's more immediate needs for weapons and ammunition and involved materiel that the Pentagon already has in stock that can be shipped in short order. The package is intended to both provide longer-term assistance for Ukraine for potential future defense needs and reassure Ukrainian officials that U.S. support remains steadfast. With the added $3 billion, the Biden administration will have offered a total of near $14 billion over the course of 19 aid packages since February. That total is in addition to two separate aid packages, one worth $40 billion and one worth $13.6 billion, Congress has approved for Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed on Tuesday that the conflict had no end in sight and the two sides were no nearer to the negotiating table. 'Winter is coming, and it will be hard, and what we see now is a grinding war of attrition. This is a battle of wills, and a battle of logistics. Therefore we must sustain our support for Ukraine for the long term, so that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign, independent nation,' Stoltenberg said, speaking at a virtual conference about Crimea, organized by Ukraine. U.S. defense leaders are also eyeing plans that will expand training for Ukrainian troops outside their country, and for militaries on Europe’s eastern and southern flanks that feel most threatened by Russia’s aggression. There are fears that Russia will intensify attacks on civilian infrastructure and government facilities in Ukraine in the coming days because of the independence holiday and the six-month anniversary of the invasion. The latest package comes after the Biden administration announced last week a deal to send more drones, ammunition, and armored vehicles, as Ukraine continues to find ways to hit Russia with long-range rockets Last week's package totaled $775 million, and contains 16 Howitzer systems, 1,000 Javelin systems that have been hammering Russian armor, as well as an undisclosed number of HARM missiles that go after radar systems. Also included are 15 ScanEagle drones, a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle made by Boeing, as well as 40 MRAPS, tactical vehicles meant to withstand improvised explosives. The drones can be used for surveillance, and are launched using a pneumatic launcher without need of an airfield. 'These capabilities are carefully calibrated to make the most difference on the battlefield and strengthen Ukraine's position at the negotiating table,' said Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement announcing the package. The package also includes 2,000 anti-armor rounds, as Ukraine seeks to continue to hit Russian tanks and prepares for a possible offensive to try to roll back Russian territorial gains. There were explosions Thursday night near bases in Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine and inside Russia, as Ukraine's forces improve their ability to carry out long-range strikes. That came after huge explosions in Crimea, in strategically important territory Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. A western official said the event disabled half of Russia's naval air fleet, after already suffering the stinging loss of its flag ship, the Moskva. Russia considers the attack an escalation. 'We want to make sure that Ukraine has a steady stream of ammunition to meet its needs, and that's what we're doing with this package,' said a senior Pentagon official, Yahoo News reported. The 19 packages since Russia's unprovoked invasion February 24 have now totaled $10 billion. Additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) 16 105mm Howitzers and 36,000 105mm artillery rounds 15 Scan Eagle Unmanned Aerial Systems 40 MaxxPro Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles with mine rollers Additional High-speed Anti-radiation missiles 50 Armored High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV) 1,500 Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided (TOW) missiles 1,000 Javelin anti-armor systems 2,000 anti-armor rounds; Mine clearing equipment and systems Demolition munitions; Tactical secure communications systems Night vision devices, thermal imagery systems, optics, and laser rangefinders Source: Department of Defense 'You are seeing a complete and total lack of progress by the Russians on the battlefield,' said the official, who added: 'You are seeing the Russians still paying a high price with Ukrainian attacks, especially using that HIMARS system' for rocket attacks. An official said the war was currently at a 'near operational standstill,' ABC News reported. There are also increasing concerns by Ukraine and western allies that Russia will seek to lock in territorial gains by holding referendums in captured areas they control, with the clock ticking on opportunities to advance before winter. There was more information out of Great Britain about the huge extent of Russia's losses. A daily intelligence report by the British defense ministry said Moscow had lost a large number of battle tanks because they were not equipped with explosive reactive armor technology – or ERA. 'Used correctly, ERA degrades the effectiveness of incoming projectiles before they hit the tank,' the report said. 'This suggests that Russian forces have not rectified a culture of poor ERA use, which dates back to the First Chechen War in 1994.' The report added: 'It is highly likely that many Russian tank crews lack the training to maintain ERA, leading to either poor fitting of the explosive elements, or it being left off entirely.' British officials said 'the war has seen numerous failures by Russian commanders to enforce low-level battle discipline', adding: 'The effect of these failures is likely a significant factor behind the poor performance of Russia's forces.' Data released by Ukraine's military said their troops have killed more than 44,000 Russian soldiers and destroyed some 1,800 tanks. Other estimates, such as from Oryx - a military blog that has tracked Russian losses since the start of the war - put Moscow's equipment losses even higher. Oryx, which tracks losses based on visual confirmation, says more than 5,000 Russian military vehicles have been either destroyed, damaged or seized by Ukraine's forces - including more than 3,000 tanks."
2022-08-23,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11137623/Spiralling-energy-bills-nearly-THREE-QUARTERS-UK-pubs-extinct-Christmas.html,"Energy crisis could SHUT DOWN Britain: Factories, shops and pubs could close due to spiralling cost of uncapped gas and electricity while domestic bills could hit £6,500-a-year by April... but No10 insists there won't be blackouts","Factories, shops and pubs could be forced to close as mounting energy bills which are not protected by a cap to prices like households plunge them into the red. Desperate landlords are demanding a reduction in VAT and business rates, and a cap on energy prices for businesses so they can be pushed back from the edge this winter. In a recent survey by The Morning Advertiser, nearly three-quarters of landlords said they had seen their utility costs increase by over 100% as they claimed their pubs could go 'extinct' by Christmas. It was also revealed today that ministers were warned in November 2021, before the invasion of Ukraine, that the UK's high-street shops, restaurants, energy intensive factories and offices could all face work slow downs or stop completely due to soaring energy costs. The Project Shine forecast that the UK was particularly vulnerable to energy shocks was prepared by officials at the Treasury and industry specialists at PwC, according to Bloomberg. Those industries particular hit with higher bills include chemical and fertilizer manufacturers, which consumes 12% of its energy costs, cold food storage operators, glass manufacturing, relying on high-energy blast furnaces, and makers of cement, concrete, plaster and lime. These increased building and food costs will also be transferred to consumers, the report added. However No10 has told the BBC amid warnings of a gas supply shortage - which generates 40% of the UK's energy - that there is no reason to panic and households do not have to cut back on their energy use this winter. It is believed the Government document also drew up plans to help through a subsidy program as it warned chemical and fertilizer manufacturers were at particular risk, putting pressure on the cost of food. There was another proposal to add a levy to household energy bills and another funded by taxation. No immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 following the Tory leadership contest. Though it has launched on consultation on how to reduce bills for businesses. Mr Sunak has pledged to remove VAT from energy bills, while Ms Truss has promised to cut green levies. A spokesperson defended the government's response, pointing to the £145 million ($171 million) of extra support for energy-intensive industries in April 2022 which happened after Vladimir Putin's invasion. 'Ministers and officials continue to engage constructively and regularly with industry and our priority is to ensure costs are managed and supplies of energy are maintained,' the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, more than 65% of operators of pubs in a recent survey said they’d seen their utility costs increase by over 100% – within that, 30% reported a jump of 200% and 8% reported increases of more than 500%. Ed Bedington, editor of The Morning Advertiser, said: 'This situation is untenable and we're likely to see the closure of huge swathes of pubs and bars across the UK unless something is done to tackle these spiralling costs. 'The lack of support for businesses from the Government is shocking, and while effort is focused on helping consumers, the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs due to a lack of business support, is a crisis the Government seems to be either missing or ignoring. 'Pubs are an important part of our heritage and our communities and the loss of that will be huge, both in terms of employment, tax revenues, but also the social impact. 'We need to see action delivered to businesses now on energy, not when the next leader is rolled into place in September. Pubs took a hammering during the pandemic and this situation is rapidly pushing them over the edge.' Responding to the survey, one operator said: 'Proper support and intervention is needed by Government. Even a 20% increase will be unaffordable, never mind 200%.' Another added: 'Action needs to be taken now to protect businesses. It was hard enough making it through Covid times, this is now absolutely ridiculous.' 'We need lower prices,' said another desperate operator. 'We were in a fixed contract at 14p a unit and I've just been quoted 83p a unit. I'm a small wet-led pub, I have no chance of surviving.' One other simply said: 'Help.' The Russian invasion has also fueled the price of electricity and gas further with Consultancy Auxilione saying today a new price cap for households will be three times the current limit of £1,971-a-year. Auxilion said that it believes the price cap, which will be announced for October on Friday, will be £3,576 from October, hitting £5,066 in January and then £6,552 in April. On Monday, energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight said gas and electricity bills are expected to hit £5,300 when next April's price cap is announced, piling further misery onto Britons as inflation keeps climbing. Today, EDF's boss warned that familes face a 'dramatic and catastrophic' winter if the government does not provide help now as he said half of UK households could be in fuel poverty in January as a result of rocketing energy prices. His comments came as the National Grid prepared to hold an exercise to test the resilience of the UK's systems in the event of a gas supply emergency. Experts have also warned of a 'security of supply issue' in the energy sector as almost 40% of the UK's electricity was generated last year by gas. Heath Ball, MD of The Frisco Group, which operates three pubs across the South East of England, commented: 'This energy bill crisis comes on the back of the most testing of times as businesses try and recover from the Covid crisis and I think it poses an even greater threat to the survival of pubs. Brits face the prospect of losing thousands of pubs if something isn't done soon to help.' Heath, who is an award-winning operator, sent a stark warning to the Government: 'Find a solution to this now or face mass pub and restaurant closures. Once again the hospitality sector seems to be underrepresented in the corridors of power, maybe because they think we're a robust industry, and they are right, but this is now a doomsday scenario. 'Talking to other operators, they aren't even being offered new energy contracts at any price due to the sector being deemed 'high risk'. They can't get power even if they can afford it. What a shambles.' Britain's 'energy crisis hotspots' shown on Friends of the Earth interactive module above allows users to find out how badly different areas in England and Wales will be affected by the October price cap rise. Use your mouse or finger to scroll around the map, and click to focus on different areas Auxilione said the price cap will then fall back a little, but still remain at what would have been record prices previously, hitting £5,897 in July 2023 and £5,548 three months later. 'The nervousness of the market appears to increase day by day as we edge closer to winter delivery, now just five weeks away, and no big positive news on the horizon,' Auxilione said. 'The planned outages in a week's time have captured the attention of the market and are driving concerns further - as yesterday's market activity demonstrated.' Ofgem is set to announce its price cap decision for October at the end of this week. Analysts widely expect the cap to top £3,500, from £1,971 today. Even a modest rise will put enormous pressure on households over the winter months when heating is turned on in homes. Households who primarily cook with an oven could save up to £604 a year by using more energy-efficient cooking methods, a study has found. Researchers calculated the energy consumption of 83 appliances and compared the running costs with the cheapest alternative. They found that that most energy-intensive cooking appliance is an electric oven, which typically costs 87p per day to run or £316 a year. However a microwave costs just 8p per day - representing a potential saving of £287 per year. An air fryer would cost just £52 a year, a saving of £264. The research by energy supplier Utilita also looked at how cooking methods can slash power consumption by up to 90 per cent and save an additional £317 a year. Batch cooking can bank £158 a year, using the correct sized pan with a lid saves £72, simmering rather than boiling £68 and not overfilling the kettle £19. As part of the in-depth report Utilita polled 2,000 households and found they spend approximately 43 minutes cooking each day. Of these, 42 per cent use the oven by default for most of their cooking needs but 52 per cent don't know which of their cooking appliances cost more to run. The researchers then looked at typical energy consumption for a range of cooking appliances and calculated how much energy they would consume in a typical day's usage. They then looked at previous academic studies into the impact of different cooking methods on energy consumption. For example, a study published in the Journal of Consumer Studies and Home Economics found that simmering at 90 degrees rather boiling at over 100 can reduce consumption by between 69 and 95 per cent. Based on typical modern-day usage, this could save households £68 a year. In total, the research studied 83 appliances and 24 sources including academic research, legislation, and data collected from popular shopping websites. Archie Lasseter, Utilita's sustainability lead, said: 'Although cooking is said to account for four per cent of the average energy bill, the savings speak for themselves. 'It's vital that consumers are given the facts they need in order to use less energy in the interest of the pocket and the planet.' The UK National Grid has also doubled its emergency planning exercise from two to four days amid fears of a spiraling energy crisis, it was revealed this week. Experts will wargame for four days in September what will happen if gas supplies are reduced which could trigger a need to ration electricity. The Exercise Degree is made up of government agencies, regulators, lobby groups and major energy firms. The exercise will take place in two stages on September 13 to 14 and October 4 to 5 - last year's version of the event took place over two days. It comes as experts like Keith Bell, professor of electronic and electrical engineering at Strathclyde University, told the BBC that one 'credible scenario that we need to be ready for' is cutting supplies to large industrial companies. 'Codes defining what should happen in the event of gas or electricity shortages and who is responsible for what - including the role of the secretary of state - have existed for many years but haven't had to be used' he added. 'A lesson from the pandemic is the need for preparedness and to test emergency arrangements to be sure that they're fit for purpose.' This is as the UK imported 38% of its overall energy supply from aboard and, Mr Bell, claimed Britain lacks the storage capacity for gas. Charles McAllister, director of policy for lobby group UK Onshore Oil and Gas, said Britain was 'at the highest risk of loss of energy supply in decades'. Under the Electricity Supply Emergency Code, Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng could take rationing steps if there were issues with supply, such as 'rota disconnections' which would mean cutting or limiting power at periods of high demand. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the UK has 'one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world'. And added: 'We are not dependent on Russian energy imports meaning households, businesses and industry can be confident they will get the electricity and gas they need'. Ed Miliband, shadow net zero and climate secretary, said the government's 'short-sightedness has been staggering - from closing our gas storage facilities, to failing to insulate houses and cut bills, and blocking the quickest, cheapest and cleanest renewables in their energy strategy'. No 10 also insisted to the Independent: 'Households, businesses and industry can be confident they will get the electricity and gas that they need over the winter. 'That's because we have one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world. 'We have access to our own North Sea gas reserves alongside steady imports from reliable partners like Norway.' But experts still maintain that there is a 10% chance 'for a short number of hours some domestic consumers [will] lose power' in winter. Adam Bell, head of energy strategy for the government until 2021, said: 'By not educating the public about how they can best lower their demand, they're increasing the likelihood of a security of supply issue.' The massive sales surge comes as experts forecast that annual household energy bills will rise past £4,000 by next January. After assessing current consumer habits, retail experts are now reporting that growing numbers of UK households are purchasing insulation to warm their homes and save money on bills. Latest data, provided by online marketplace OnBuy.com, shows week-on-week sales of household insulation is up 1238per cent. According to Northern Energy, poor wall insulation accounts for 35-45%* of heat lost in the home - resulting in lost energy and wasted money. Elsewhere, experts believe around 25per cent of a home's heat is lost through lofts and attics, a loss that can be mitigated against with good insulation. Liam Tickner, Home and Garden Category Manager at OnBuy, said: 'The cost of living crisis is affecting people right across the nation. 'With energy bills set to hit over £4,000 a year in January, and with the price of everyday expenses increasing, we are seeing people looking to save money. 'A poorly insulated house or flat can lead to lots of wasted money. Ahead of autumn and winter, we are seeing households purchasing insulation in an effort to save on bills'. Meanwhile, Philippe Commaret, EDF's managing director for customers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We face, despite the support that the Government has already announced, a dramatic and catastrophic winter for our customers,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today. 'In fact, in January half of the UK households might be in fuel poverty. That's the reason why we want to take actions in order to do everything we can do in order to help our customers. 'So, we are announcing today that we are going to launch a campaign in order to reach hundreds of thousands of our customers to provide them further support to help them cut their costs, but also make sure that they are accessing all the available support that is available for them.' Mr Commaret also called on the Government to do more to support families after Octopus Energy's boss called for the price cap to be frozen as latest dire forecast suggests charges will nearly double in six months. Some areas of the UK will also be worse hit as Friends of the Earth research found the worst areas for bills' impact. Birmingham (1st), Bradford (2nd), Cornwall (3rd), Sandwell (4th), County Durham and Enfield (joint 5th) rank highest among 30 local authority areas with the most energy crisis hotspots. Mike Childs, head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said: 'There's no downplaying how catastrophic this and following winters will be for millions of people if energy bills rise as high as they're predicted to, unless the government meaningfully intervenes. 'Instead of woeful and poorly targeted cash handouts, or the promise of tax cuts that won't help those who need it the most, the government must beef up its package of emergency financial support by channelling money to those least able to pay their energy bills. 'And while vital, this is only a short-term solution. The highest priority of all is fixing the UK's leaky, inefficient housing stock, otherwise cash handouts will be required year on year. 'By rolling out a free programme of street-by-street energy efficiency measures, prioritising the most in-need neighbourhoods, we can help to bring bills down quickly, make homes warmer and slash Earth-warming emissions at the same time.' The first Australian gas shipment to Europe in more than half a decade is set to dock in the south of England on Monday, as gas shortages bite across the continent. The Attalos gas tanker is set to pull into the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent, by the mouth of the Thames during the day. It brings a rare cargo of liquified natural gas (LNG) from Australia to Europe, the first in six years, according to data from Bloomberg. Some of the gas is likely to be used in the UK straight away, but much of it will probably flow to Europe through the pipelines that connect Britain to the continent. There it might be channelled into European gas storage sites and some of it could return to Britain during winter. The UK has some of the highest LNG import capacity in Europe, but it has very little gas storage. Therefore, much of the LNG that comes to Europe this summer will arrive in British ports, but be shipped over to European storage sites. The Attalos departed Malaysia on July 20, according to data from Vessel Finder. Here it had picked up a shipment of gas that had come from Australia. Because of the long distances involved, it is rare for Australian gas to find its way to Europe. Most instead goes to countries in Asia. But the deep gas crisis that Europe is currently facing has catapulted the need for new sources of the fossil fuel. Gas prices have soared manifold in the last year, and the UK price for delivery next month was up another 17% on Monday morning, hitting £5.40p per therm. At the weekend experts predicted that the average household energy bill is likely to soar to more than £6,000 per year from next April. It is a dire warning for struggling households, and Monday's gas price hike will only add to these woes. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Octopus Energy chief executive Greg Jackson said that if the price of beer had risen as much as gas prices, getting a pint would cost £25. 'People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around £5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something,' he said. He added: 'There are systemic issues. 'There are loads of questions of how we pay for this. 'One thing we can't do is be expected to pass those costs on to consumers.' Soaring gas prices are also adding to the bill that will be hitting households to prop up failed energy supplier Bulb. According to new research by Auxilione, an energy consultancy, and shared with the Financial Times this weekend, the cost of bailing out Bulb might cost £4 billion by this spring. Ministers stepped in to rescue Bulb as it was considered too big to fail. Many of its rivals had gone out of business. Mr Commaret said: 'I think that all ideas in order to keep the bills for customers flat are really important and have all to be considered. 'There is not only one lever to be pulled but all levers have to be pulled right now because we face a catastrophic winter.' The war in Ukraine and the economic isolation of gas-producing Russia, combined with surging energy demand following the easing of coronavirus restrictions around the world, has driven up prices and caused uncertainty in international supply. The forecast by energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight has said bills could be capped at £5,341.08 four months into next year, while the figure for January's cap is expected to be £4,649.72. However, the price cap forecast for October this year is £3,583 for the average household, an 80 per cent rise on the current cap of £1,971. The firm has said it is 'difficult to see how many will cope' this winter, with the final figure for the October price cap to be announced by energy regulator Ofgem on Friday. Experts at financial firm Citi have said the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation - which indicates the increase in the amount people pay for goods and services - will hit 18.6 per cent in January. Meanwhile, it emerged that homeowners could get paid to turn off power-hungry appliances such as washing machines, tumble dryers and games consoles during peak times under a new scheme. The National Grid is reportedly considering giving money to people who cut back on their energy between 5pm and 8pm in the form of rebates. There are concerns how millions of households in the UK will be able to afford their energy bills this winter - between October and April the average household will pay an equivalent £4,102 per year for their gas and electricity. The price cap, which is now being raised quarterly instead of every six months previously, would see a massive jump from today's £1,971, which is already a record, and much higher than the £1,138 seen last winter. Cornwall Insight said yesterday: 'While the energy price cap rise in April was already an unprecedent increase in domestic consumer energy bills, our final predictions for October are truly concerning,' Cornwall Insight said. 'With the cost of living spiralling and households looking at an energy bill rise of over £1,500 equivalent per year, it is difficult to see how many will cope with the coming winter.' The new warnings will concern ministers as they meet energy bosses later this week. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi is holding a series of meetings this week to follow up on earlier discussions with energy generation companies. Denmark's Orsted, nuclear company Newcleo, and German giant RWE are all meeting the Chancellor this week, and will be asked what they can do to help consumers with rising energy prices. October's price cap forecast breaks down as predicting a ceiling for electricity bills of £1,679.35, whilst the limit for gas will be £1,874.40. In January, the breakdown could be £2,212.32 for electricity and £2,437.39 for gas. In April, the bills could climb further to £2,365.38 for electricity and £2,975.70 for gas. In July next year, the cap is predicted to fall to £4,767.97, with a £2,052.70 limit for electricity and a £2,715.27 ceiling for gas. By October next year, the figure could climb again to £4,807.11, with £2,110.70 for electricity and £2,696.41. Octopus Energy's Greg Jackson says the wholesale price of gas is to blame for the soaring bills. He has laid the blame at the door of Russia, which has throttled supplies to Europe in retaliation for sanctions imposed on it after its invasion of Ukraine. Wholesale gas prices, which have a huge impact on the price of electricity, are nearly 10 times higher than usual - with the current price at £540 per therm. Mr Jackson said if the price of a pint had gone up at the same rate people would be paying double figures for beer. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: 'I think the spate of failures within the 29 companies that went bust last year, that was driven by gas prices roughly doubling. They're currently nine to 11 times higher than usual. 'Look, to put that in perspective, if this was beer, we're talking about the wholesale price being £25 a pint. 'People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around £5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something.' These surging energy prices will be the key factor in driving inflation to 18.6 per cent in January, according to financial services firm Citi. It says inflation will soar past the 13 per cent which the Bank of England previously said would be the peak in October, instead hitting the highest level since 1975 in the new year. Last month, CPI inflation struck a new 40-year-high of 10.1 per cent. Citi analyst Ben Nabarro has forecast that inflation will jump to 14.8 per cent in October as energy bills spike for UK households. He projected that inflation will accelerate following last week's 25 per cent rise in UK gas prices and 7 per cent rise in UK electricity prices. Citi said it expects the October energy price cap to reach £3,717, slightly higher than previous estimates. A further increase in energy bills in January - with projections the cap will hit £4,567 - will push inflation towards the new peak, it said. It predicted that the price cap will surge to £5,816 in April. The new forecasts predict that inflation will stay in double figures for the next 12 months and will finally dip back below the Bank of England target rate of 2 per cent by April 2024. Mr Nabarro said: 'Even with the economy softening, last week's data re-affirmed the continued risk of pass through from headline inflation into wage and domestic price setting could accelerate. 'With inflation now set to peak substantially higher than the 13 per cent forecast in August, we expect the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will conclude the risks surrounding more persistent inflation have intensified.' Interest rates increased to 1.75 per cent earlier this month but the economist warned that it could need to rise as high as 7% if 'signs of embedded inflation emerge'."
2022-08-23,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11137853/Who-Natalia-Vovk-Ukrainian-spy-accused-killing-Darya-Dugina.html,Who IS the 'Ukrainian assassin mum' accused of blowing up Russian nationalist's daughter? FSB say she is a veteran spy and trained killer – but Kyiv has a very different story,"It is a name plucked from obscurity and plastered on front pages around the world: Natalia Vovk, the woman Russia says blew up the daughter of 'Putin's Rasputin'. The FSB claims she is a veteran of Mariupol's Azov battalion turned spy, who spent weeks tracking Darya Dugina before planting 800g of explosives under the driver's seat of her car on August 20 and rigging it to blow as she left a festival near Moscow. But Kyiv has denied any link to the slaying, the Azov Battalion says it has no record of Vovk having served with them, and evidence that has emerged from social media accounts paints a picture that is at odds with Moscow's account. So, just who is Natalia Vovk really? Here's what we know about her... The FSB says Natalia was born in the city of Mariupol, in Ukraine's Donetsk region, in 1976 - when it was still part of the Soviet Union. Pro-Kremlin Telegram accounts have also shared what they believe to be a new surname she later adopted: Shaban. And it appears there is at least some truth to that information. A now-deleted profile on VKontakte - Russia's equivalent of Facebook - shows a profile belonging to a Natalia Shaban (Vovk) who lived in Mariupol. Her account was last active in 2016 and had a few dozen followers. The FSB also claims Natalia brought her daughter - Sofia - with her into Russia as she spied on Dugin before the killing. And pro-Russia social media accounts have been sharing a name that they believe belongs to Natalia's son: Danil Shaban. Vkontakte data from the same deleted profile uncovered by investigative site Proekt does appear to confirm that information as well. Natalia does indeed appear to have two children - a boy and a girl - and separate Facebook, VKontakte and TikTok profiles appear under the name Danil Shaban saying he was born in Mariupol in the year 2000. But, after this, the accounts given by Russian and Ukrainian sources diverge. Russia's account The FSB says Natalia crossed its border from Ukraine on July 23 driving a Mini Cooper with number plates issued by the so-called Donetsk People's Republic - the occupied region of Ukraine which now controls Mariupol. Spies have published CCTV footage that they say shows her at the border crossing point, as guards inspect the vehicle. They say she then changed the plates for ones issued by Kazakhstan and made her way to Moscow, where she rented an apartment in the same building as Dugina. She is also alleged to have changed her hair colour from blonde to brunette to avoid detection, seen in more CCTV released by the FSB which they say was taken in the stairwell of her apartment block. Natalia is accused of spending weeks tracking Dugina, before planting a bomb under her car as she attended a traditional poetry festival at the Zakharovo estate near Moscow on Saturday with father Alexander. After the bomb was planted, the FSB says Natalia swapped car plate again - this time for Ukrainian ones - and drove to Estonia, where she crossed into the EU. Pro-Kremlin Telegram channels say she has moved westward since then, and was last spotted checking into a hotel in Austria with two women and a child. They also claim to have uncovered an advert on Ukrainian social media trying to sell the Mini Cooper she was driving. RIA Novosti, Russia's main newswire, claims to have interviewed Natalia's father who told them that she served with the Ukrainian armed forces. He said she had retired for 'health reasons' and did not participate in anti-terrorism operations in the Donbas - the name Ukraine gave for the conflict smouldering in its eastern regions in the wake of Russia's first invasion in 2014. Natalia left Ukraine as a refugee 'some time ago', he said, adding that he had no idea she had gone to Russia. She called home a few days ago, he added, and told him that she was in Lithuania. The FSB have also published a photo of what they say is Natalia's ID issued by Ukraine's armed forces which they say proves she was part of Azov. Ukraine's account Kyiv has not denied Natalia's existence, but has strongly denied having anything to do with Dugina's death. And information put out by Kyiv and uncovered by various pro-Ukraine sources disputes key parts of Russia's narrative. A spokesman for the Azov battalion told Ukrainian media that Natalia had never served with them - because there are no women soldiers in their ranks. The source added that the ID card shown off by the FSB is actually for the National Guard, and would not be carried by an Azov soldier. He said pencil marks on the ID show it was invalidated because the woman had married and changed her last name. The soldier speculated that the invalid ID had been placed in archives of Ukraine's national guard in Mariupol - a building Russia now occupies - and had been uncovered by their troops and manipulated for propaganda purposes. Internet sleuths also claimed to have uncovered evidence that the picture on the ID had been manipulated. Pro-Ukraine Telegram accounts also uncovered what appears to a profile revealing that Natalia's first husband - identified as Andrey Vovk - had links to pro-Russian rebels in Donbas. Andrey, whose identity appears on a database tracking Ukrainian 'traitors', is accused of helping to organise a sham referendum on breaking away from Ukraine. All of which suggests, though does not prove, that Natalia may have harboured sympathies with Russia more than with Ukraine. Proekt also uncovered inconsistencies in social media accounts. According to Danil Shaban's Vkontakte page he was born in the year 2000, which would make him 22 years old. And according to the FSB, Sofia Shaban was 12 years old when she came with her mother into Russia two months ago. Pictures of Natalia on social media show her with two children - a boy and a girl - who both bear a striking resemblance to her and to each-other, but who appear to be a similar age rather than 10 years apart. Further, the site claims the advert for the Mini Cooper was posted the day before the blast and that a video on Danil's TikTok shows him driving a similar vehicle in Kyiv on August 16 - when Natalia was supposed to be with the car in Moscow. The conflicting accounts of Natalia's true identity further muddy the waters of an already murky case, with sources suggesting the bomb was the work of disgruntled Russian elites targeting Putin's inner circle or an FSB 'false flag' operation. Kyiv maintains the FSB is behind the whole operation, designed to cook up a pretext to escalate indiscriminate violence against Ukrainian civilians and the government to coincide with the country's independence day. Further adding fuel to the fire, a here-to unknown rebel group within Russia has emerged to take responsibility for the attack - calling themselves the National Republican Army. Announcing themselves via Ilya Ponomarev, a former Russian member of parliament turned-rebel, the group claim to be responsible for a number of partisan attacks across Russia opposing Putin's rule and his war. 'Our goal is to stop the destruction of Russia and its neighbours, to stop the activities of a handful of Kremlin businessmen who have sucked on the wealth of our people and are committing crimes inside and outside the country', their manifesto says."

The Prime Minister reiterated the UK's support for Ukraine, in the face of Vladimir Putin's barbaric invasion, at an international conference. The summit - hosted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - comes ahead of the six-month anniversary of the latest phase of Russia's assault on its neighbour, which began on 24th February this year. Tomorrow is also Ukraine's independence day, which will mark 31 years since the country's independence from Soviet rule. Downing Street was today adorned with flowers of Ukraine's national colours in preparation for the country's celebration. But celebrations in Kyiv itself tomorrow have been banned amid fears of fresh Russian attacks on the Ukrainian capital. Mr Johnson joined other world leaders - such as Canada's Justin Trudeau, Germany's Olaf Scholz, France's Emmanuel Macron, Italy's Mario Draghi, and Japan's Fumio Kishida - in speaking via video-link at this afternoon's conference. Today's event followed last year's inaugral summit, which was held to coordinate international efforts over Crimea - the Ukrainian peninsula that was annexed by Russia in 2014. In his address, the PM condemned Mr Putin's 'land grab' of Crimea, which he described as the 'direct precursor' to the full-scale conflict that rages between Russia and Ukraine. Mr Johnson urged world leaders to 'have the humility to acknowledge that not everyone realised the sheer enormity of what was happening at the time' in 2014. He added this was the 'first act' of the current 'tragedy' taking place in eastern Europe. 'Ever since the annexation, the people of Crimea have endured a brutal and systematic campaign of human rights abuses by the Russian authorities,' the PM said. 'I’m afraid that all this has even greater salience today because Putin is planning to do to parts of Ukraine - in fact all of Ukraine - what he has done to Crimea. 'He is preparing more annexations and more sham referendums. 'So it has never been more important for all of us to stand together in defence of the foundational principle of international law. 'No territory, no country, can acquire territory or change borders by force of arms. 'And it so follows that we will never recognise Russia’s annexation of Crimea or any other Ukrainian territory. 'In the face of Putin’s assault, we must continue give our Ukrainian friends all the military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support that they need until Russia ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine.' Mr Johnson now has less than two weeks left in Downing Street, with the PM due to hand over to his successor - whether Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak - on 6th September. Yesterday, Downing Street said Mr Johnson would spend his final days in power restating British support for Ukraine. A large focus this week is on reiterating our support for Ukraine, and that is an unwavering commitment that we have to supporting Ukraine in the face of an illegal war,' a Number 10 spokeswoman said. It has been reported that Ms Truss - who is widely expected to win the Tory leadership contest to replace Mr Johnson - is considering making a trip to Ukraine one of her first acts in office in a public show of support for Kyiv."
2022-08-23,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11137451/5-000-DOLPHINS-died-result-Russias-invasion-Ukraine-scientists-say.html,"'5,000 DOLPHINS have died as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine': Scientists blame sonar devices on Putin's ships and submarines in the Black Sea","More than 5,000 dolphins have died as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, scientists have said, blaming sonar devices used by Vladimir Putin's naval forces. The true figure could be even higher, according to biologist Ivan Rusev, who said ships and submarines stationed in the Black Sea are causing the deaths. Rusev, who works at Tuzly Lagoons National Nature Park in Ukraine's southern Odessa region, said just five percent of the dead dolphins are washing ashore. The remaining 95 percent sink to the bottom of the Black Sea, he said. 'They are not available for detection and counting from the shore, so we believe that during the Russian barbarians' war against Ukraine, tens of thousands of Dolphins have already died,' Rusev told the animal rights group Open Cages Ukraine. He suggested in an earlier Facebook post that sonar used by Moscow's Black Sea naval vessels, such as ships and submarines, was affecting the health of the animals. 'Dolphins fall into the radiation zone of ships' navigation devices, which disables their organs of navigation and echolocation,' Rusev wrote. Using sound waves - or echolocation - dolphins are able to locate objects in the water. This helps them with navigation, orientation, finding food, social interactions and avoiding potentially dangerous objects or predators. However, sonar - along with the the constant sound of ship engines and weapons fire - is causing the dolphins distress and paralysing their ability to navigate. The biologist said dolphins that washed up at the mouth of Bulgaria's Ropotamo river in late May had suffered from burn marks, likely from mines in the water. This suggests that not only are mines also killing the sea creatures, but sonar is blocking their ability to avoid them when swimming through the Black Sea. Rusev said another danger facing dolphins in the region is that of explosions from bombardments, which can cause dolphins to go 'blind'. 'Having lost their orientation, animals lose acoustic control over the environment. 'Blind' dolphins are in stress and panic, unable to navigate in space. 'As a result, they hit all kinds of obstacles, including mines, crash against rocks. And the main thing - such 'paralyzed' dolphins cannot catch fish and quickly get exhausted,' he wrote. He added that even 'pingers' - devices used by fisherman to deter dolphins from swimming into their nets - have stopped working. 'Exhausted dolphins are weak dolphins, they fall into the nets of Turkish fishermen without even reacting to pingers (a special dolphin-repelling device that Turkish fishermen install on nets),' he said. Rusev told the Kyiv Independent that before the war, conservationists would find dolphins washed ashore with injuries caused by nets, or their fins but off by fishermen. Now, however, many are found untouched. 'I have never seen this before. This is something absolutely new and terrifying for scientists,' he told the newspaper. In order to recover the Black Sea's dolphin population, Rusev called on a national park to be established in its northwestern waters once the war has ended. Russia has long had a huge naval presence in the Black Sea, and since Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, this has only increased. Moscow has used its strong naval forces to blockade Ukrainian ports, stopping vital grain exports to the rest of the world. At the end of July, three Ukrainian Black Sea ports were unblocked under a deal between Moscow and Kyiv. While Moscow's navy has been pushed back after Ukraine demonstrated its ability to strike targets far away from the coast - such as Putin's Black Sea flagship Moskva, which was sunk in April by Neptune missiles - a strong naval presence remains. Over the last 100 years, the Black Sea dolphin population has been rapidly declining. Last century, there were roughly 6 million dolphins in the Black Sea. Now, that figure is believed to be 253,000 - a drop on more than 20 times - according to Ukraine's Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. Ecologists from countries that have Black sea coastlines - including Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey - have all reported an 'extraordinary increase' in the number of dead dolphins being washed ashore."
2022-08-23,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11137475/British-energy-bills-hit-6-552-April-Latest-eye-watering-forecast-lifts-price-cap.html,"Energy bills 'could hit £6,552 in April': Latest eye-watering forecast lifts price cap to more than THREE times current £1,971-a-year limit - as EDF boss warns of 'catastrophic' crisis... but No10 insists UK does NOT face blackouts","Households could face average energy bills of £6,500 a year by April, the latest forecasts reveal as Vladimir Putin continues to squeeze gas supplies to Europe worsening Britain's cost-of-living crisis. Consultancy Auxilione said the price cap will be three times the current limit of £1,971-a-year – and £1,000 more than what was warned of just yesterday by another energy expert - because it bases its forecast on Monday's gas price. The price of natural gas in Europe has rocketed again this week after Russia closed the Nordstream 1 gas pipeline from St Petersburg to Germany for 'maintenance'. Though the UK does not depend on Putin's gas exports, and gets most of its supply form Norway, the squeeze on supplies to continental Europe sent the global price of gas soaring to £250 per megawatt hour on Monday. British households are already reeling from the surge in gas prices that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This made inflation fueled by Covid financial packages even worse, and has left one bank warning that the UK could face inflation of up to 18% by the start of next year. Auxilion said that it believes the price cap, which will be announced for October on Friday, will be £3,576 from October, hitting £5,066 in January and then £6,552 in April. On Monday, energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight said gas and electricity bills said they expect bills to hit £5,300 in April price. Today, EDF's boss warned that families face a 'dramatic and catastrophic' winter if the government does not provide help now as he said half of UK households could be in fuel poverty in January as a result of rocketing energy prices. His comments came as the National Grid prepared to hold an exercise to test the resilience of the UK's systems in the event of a gas supply emergency. Experts have also warned of a 'security of supply issue' in the energy sector as almost 40% of the UK's electricity was generated last year by gas. However No10 told the BBC there is no reason to panic and households do not have to cut back on their energy use. It also comes as research by Friends of the Earth, mapped the areas in the UK that will face the worst financial hardship as a result of unaffordable energy costs. Britain's 'energy crisis hotspots' shown on Friends of the Earth interactive module above allows users to find out how badly different areas in England and Wales will be affected by the October price cap rise. Use your mouse or finger to scroll around the map, and click to focus on different areas. Auxilione said the price cap will then fall back a little, but still remain at what would have been record prices previously, hitting £5,897 in July 2023 and £5,548 three months later. 'The nervousness of the market appears to increase day by day as we edge closer to winter delivery, now just five weeks away, and no big positive news on the horizon,' Auxilione said. The neighbourhoods that are being worst impacted by soaring energy prices have been identified for the first time as part of new research by Friends of the Earth. The environmental group has found that there are almost 9,000 energy crisis hotspots across England and Wales where communities are at greatest risk of serious financial hardship as a result of unaffordable energy costs. It identified neighbourhoods with below average income using the government's Index of Multiple Deprivation data and then used smart meter data to determine energy use. It then found that Birmingham, Bradford, Cornwall, Sandwell, County Durham and Enfield top the list of 30 areas with the highest number of 'energy crisis hotspots' Local authority name Birmingham Bradford Cornwall Sandwell County Durham Enfield Croydon Leicester Walsall Brent Average bill before October £2,226 £2,224 £2,362 £2,154 £2,121 £2,186 £2,235 £2,217 £2,150 £2,332 Average bill after October £3,262 £3,259 £3,289 £3,142 £3,064 £3,196 £3,276 £3,248 £3,136 £3,434 'The planned outages in a week's time have captured the attention of the market and are driving concerns further - as yesterday's market activity demonstrated.' Ofgem is set to announce its price cap decision for October at the end of this week. Analysts widely expect the cap to top £3,500, from £1,971 today. Even a modest rise will put enormous pressure on households over the winter months when heating is turned on in homes. The UK National Grid has also doubled its emergency planning exercise from two to four days amid fears of a spiraling energy crisis, it was revealed this week. Experts will wargame for four days in September what will happen if gas supplies are reduced which could trigger a need to ration electricity. The Exercise Degree is made up of government agencies, regulators, lobby groups and major energy firms. The exercise will take place in two stages on September 13 to 14 and October 4 to 5 - last year's version of the event took place over two days. It comes as experts like Keith Bell, professor of electronic and electrical engineering at Strathclyde University, told the BBC that one 'credible scenario that we need to be ready for' is cutting supplies to large industrial companies. 'Codes defining what should happen in the event of gas or electricity shortages and who is responsible for what - including the role of the secretary of state - have existed for many years but haven't had to be used' he added. 'A lesson from the pandemic is the need for preparedness and to test emergency arrangements to be sure that they're fit for purpose.' This is as the UK imported 38% of its overall energy supply from aboard and, Mr Bell, claimed Britain lacks the storage capacity for gas. Charles McAllister, director of policy for lobby group UK Onshore Oil and Gas, said Britain was 'at the highest risk of loss of energy supply in decades'. Under the Electricity Supply Emergency Code, Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng could take rationing steps if there were issues with supply, such as 'rota disconnections' which would mean cutting or limiting power at periods of high demand. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the UK has 'one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world'. And added: 'We are not dependent on Russian energy imports meaning households, businesses and industry can be confident they will get the electricity and gas they need'. Ed Miliband, shadow net zero and climate secretary, said the government's 'short-sightedness has been staggering - from closing our gas storage facilities, to failing to insulate houses and cut bills, and blocking the quickest, cheapest and cleanest renewables in their energy strategy'. The massive sales surge comes as experts forecast that annual household energy bills will rise past £4,000 by next January. After assessing current consumer habits, retail experts are now reporting that growing numbers of UK households are purchasing insulation to warm their homes and save money on bills. Latest data, provided by online marketplace OnBuy.com, shows week-on-week sales of household insulation is up 1238per cent. According to Northern Energy, poor wall insulation accounts for 35-45%* of heat lost in the home - resulting in lost energy and wasted money. Elsewhere, experts believe around 25per cent of a home's heat is lost through lofts and attics, a loss that can be mitigated against with good insulation. Liam Tickner, Home and Garden Category Manager at OnBuy, said: 'The cost of living crisis is affecting people right across the nation. 'With energy bills set to hit over £4,000 a year in January, and with the price of everyday expenses increasing, we are seeing people looking to save money. 'A poorly insulated house or flat can lead to lots of wasted money. Ahead of autumn and winter, we are seeing households purchasing insulation in an effort to save on bills'. No 10 also insisted to the Independent: 'Households, businesses and industry can be confident they will get the electricity and gas that they need over the winter. 'That's because we have one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world. 'We have access to our own North Sea gas reserves alongside steady imports from reliable partners like Norway.' But experts still maintain that there is a 10% chance 'for a short number of hours some domestic consumers [will] lose power' in winter. Adam Bell, head of energy strategy for the government until 2021, said: 'By not educating the public about how they can best lower their demand, they're increasing the likelihood of a security of supply issue.' Meanwhile, Philippe Commaret, EDF's managing director for customers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We face, despite the support that the Government has already announced, a dramatic and catastrophic winter for our customers,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today. 'In fact, in January half of the UK households might be in fuel poverty. That's the reason why we want to take actions in order to do everything we can do in order to help our customers. 'So, we are announcing today that we are going to launch a campaign in order to reach hundreds of thousands of our customers to provide them further support to help them cut their costs, but also make sure that they are accessing all the available support that is available for them.' Mr Commaret also called on the Government to do more to support families after Octopus Energy's boss called for the price cap to be frozen as latest dire forecast suggests charges will nearly double in six months. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Octopus Energy chief executive Greg Jackson said that if the price of beer had risen as much as gas prices, getting a pint would cost £25. 'People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around £5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something,' he said. He added: 'There are systemic issues. 'There are loads of questions of how we pay for this. 'One thing we can't do is be expected to pass those costs on to consumers.' Some areas of the UK will also be worse hit as Friends of the Earth research found the worst areas for bills' impact. Birmingham (1st), Bradford (2nd), Cornwall (3rd), Sandwell (4th), County Durham and Enfield (joint 5th) rank highest among 30 local authority areas with the most energy crisis hotspots. Mike Childs, head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said: 'There's no downplaying how catastrophic this and following winters will be for millions of people if energy bills rise as high as they're predicted to, unless the government meaningfully intervenes. 'Instead of woeful and poorly targeted cash handouts, or the promise of tax cuts that won't help those who need it the most, the government must beef up its package of emergency financial support by channelling money to those least able to pay their energy bills. 'And while vital, this is only a short-term solution. The highest priority of all is fixing the UK's leaky, inefficient housing stock, otherwise cash handouts will be required year on year. 'By rolling out a free programme of street-by-street energy efficiency measures, prioritising the most in-need neighbourhoods, we can help to bring bills down quickly, make homes warmer and slash Earth-warming emissions at the same time.' No immediate extra help will be announced by Boris Johnson's Government, with major financial decisions being postponed until either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10 following the Tory leadership contest. Mr Sunak has pledged to remove VAT from energy bills, while Ms Truss has promised to cut green levies. The first Australian gas shipment to Europe in more than half a decade is set to dock in the south of England on Monday, as gas shortages bite across the continent. The Attalos gas tanker is set to pull into the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent, by the mouth of the Thames during the day. It brings a rare cargo of liquified natural gas (LNG) from Australia to Europe, the first in six years, according to data from Bloomberg. Some of the gas is likely to be used in the UK straight away, but much of it will probably flow to Europe through the pipelines that connect Britain to the continent. There it might be channelled into European gas storage sites and some of it could return to Britain during winter. The UK has some of the highest LNG import capacity in Europe, but it has very little gas storage. Therefore, much of the LNG that comes to Europe this summer will arrive in British ports, but be shipped over to European storage sites. The Attalos departed Malaysia on July 20, according to data from Vessel Finder. Here it had picked up a shipment of gas that had come from Australia. Because of the long distances involved, it is rare for Australian gas to find its way to Europe. Most instead goes to countries in Asia. But the deep gas crisis that Europe is currently facing has catapulted the need for new sources of the fossil fuel. Gas prices have soared manifold in the last year, and the UK price for delivery next month was up another 17% on Monday morning, hitting £5.40p per therm. At the weekend experts predicted that the average household energy bill is likely to soar to more than £6,000 per year from next April. It is a dire warning for struggling households, and Monday's gas price hike will only add to these woes. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Octopus Energy chief executive Greg Jackson said that if the price of beer had risen as much as gas prices, getting a pint would cost £25. 'People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around £5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something,' he said. He added: 'There are systemic issues. 'There are loads of questions of how we pay for this. 'One thing we can't do is be expected to pass those costs on to consumers.' Soaring gas prices are also adding to the bill that will be hitting households to prop up failed energy supplier Bulb. According to new research by Auxilione, an energy consultancy, and shared with the Financial Times this weekend, the cost of bailing out Bulb might cost £4 billion by this spring. Ministers stepped in to rescue Bulb as it was considered too big to fail. Many of its rivals had gone out of business. Mr Commaret said: 'I think that all ideas in order to keep the bills for customers flat are really important and have all to be considered. 'There is not only one lever to be pulled but all levers have to be pulled right now because we face a catastrophic winter.' The war in Ukraine and the economic isolation of gas-producing Russia, combined with surging energy demand following the easing of coronavirus restrictions around the world, has driven up prices and caused uncertainty in international supply. The forecast by energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight has said bills could be capped at £5,341.08 four months into next year, while the figure for January's cap is expected to be £4,649.72. However, the price cap forecast for October this year is £3,583 for the average household, an 80 per cent rise on the current cap of £1,971. The firm has said it is 'difficult to see how many will cope' this winter, with the final figure for the October price cap to be announced by energy regulator Ofgem on Friday. Experts at financial firm Citi have said the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation - which indicates the increase in the amount people pay for goods and services - will hit 18.6 per cent in January. Meanwhile, it emerged that homeowners could get paid to turn off power-hungry appliances such as washing machines, tumble dryers and games consoles during peak times under a new scheme. The National Grid is reportedly considering giving money to people who cut back on their energy between 5pm and 8pm in the form of rebates. There are concerns how millions of households in the UK will be able to afford their energy bills this winter - between October and April the average household will pay an equivalent £4,102 per year for their gas and electricity. The price cap, which is now being raised quarterly instead of every six months previously, would see a massive jump from today's £1,971, which is already a record, and much higher than the £1,138 seen last winter. Cornwall Insight said yesterday: 'While the energy price cap rise in April was already an unprecedent increase in domestic consumer energy bills, our final predictions for October are truly concerning,' Cornwall Insight said. 'With the cost of living spiralling and households looking at an energy bill rise of over £1,500 equivalent per year, it is difficult to see how many will cope with the coming winter.' The new warnings will concern ministers as they meet energy bosses later this week. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi is holding a series of meetings this week to follow up on earlier discussions with energy generation companies. Denmark's Orsted, nuclear company Newcleo, and German giant RWE are all meeting the Chancellor this week, and will be asked what they can do to help consumers with rising energy prices. October's price cap forecast breaks down as predicting a ceiling for electricity bills of £1,679.35, whilst the limit for gas will be £1,874.40. In January, the breakdown could be £2,212.32 for electricity and £2,437.39 for gas. In April, the bills could climb further to £2,365.38 for electricity and £2,975.70 for gas. In July next year, the cap is predicted to fall to £4,767.97, with a £2,052.70 limit for electricity and a £2,715.27 ceiling for gas. By October next year, the figure could climb again to £4,807.11, with £2,110.70 for electricity and £2,696.41. Octopus Energy's Greg Jackson says the wholesale price of gas is to blame for the soaring bills. He has laid the blame at the door of Russia, which has throttled supplies to Europe in retaliation for sanctions imposed on it after its invasion of Ukraine. Wholesale gas prices, which have a huge impact on the price of electricity, are nearly 10 times higher than usual - with the current price at £540 per therm. Mr Jackson said if the price of a pint had gone up at the same rate people would be paying double figures for beer. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: 'I think the spate of failures within the 29 companies that went bust last year, that was driven by gas prices roughly doubling. They're currently nine to 11 times higher than usual. 'Look, to put that in perspective, if this was beer, we're talking about the wholesale price being £25 a pint. 'People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around £5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something.' He added Ofgem should 'freeze the price cap roughly where it is' at £1,971 per year. He said: 'There are systemic issues. There are loads of questions of how we pay for this. One thing we can't do is be expected to pass those costs on to consumers.' 'The big thing here is we need more help for customers from the government. 'The reality is customers are being asked to pay the price of gas which is weaponised by Putin, and they shouldn't expect to do that alone.' These surging energy prices will be the key factor in driving inflation to 18.6 per cent in January, according to financial services firm Citi. It says inflation will soar past the 13 per cent which the Bank of England previously said would be the peak in October, instead hitting the highest level since 1975 in the new year. Last month, CPI inflation struck a new 40-year-high of 10.1 per cent. Citi analyst Ben Nabarro has forecast that inflation will jump to 14.8 per cent in October as energy bills spike for UK households. He projected that inflation will accelerate following last week's 25 per cent rise in UK gas prices and 7 per cent rise in UK electricity prices. Citi said it expects the October energy price cap to reach £3,717, slightly higher than previous estimates. A further increase in energy bills in January - with projections the cap will hit £4,567 - will push inflation towards the new peak, it said. It predicted that the price cap will surge to £5,816 in April. The new forecasts predict that inflation will stay in double figures for the next 12 months and will finally dip back below the Bank of England target rate of 2 per cent by April 2024. Mr Nabarro said: 'Even with the economy softening, last week's data re-affirmed the continued risk of pass through from headline inflation into wage and domestic price setting could accelerate. 'With inflation now set to peak substantially higher than the 13 per cent forecast in August, we expect the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will conclude the risks surrounding more persistent inflation have intensified.' Interest rates increased to 1.75 per cent earlier this month but the economist warned that it could need to rise as high as 7% if 'signs of embedded inflation emerge'. It comes after the National Grid, which manages the infrastructure of Britain's gas and electricity networks, is believed to have applied to energy regulator Ofgem for permission to roll out a scheme that would see homeowners paid for turning off appliances."

Dugina, whose father Alexander Dugin is a notorious ultranationalist, died in an explosion on a motorway near the village of Bolshiye Vyazyomy just outside the capital on Saturday night. The Kremlin quickly announced the culprit behind the bombing as 43-year-old Ukrainian mother and alleged spy Natalia Shaban-Vovk. But Ukrainian and Western officials, as well as a number of prominent Russian commentators, believe the car bomb was likely executed by agents loyal to Putin after Dugin criticised the Russian president in a public Telegram post. Hundreds of people this morning attended Dugina's funeral service in a large television studio in Moscow, where she worked as a prominent pro-Kremlin broadcaster. A huge portrait of Dugina, 29, hung above her coffin which was heavily guarded and surrounded by flower wreaths and streamers bearing the colours of the Russian Federation. The message from Putin read: 'Accept my sincere condolences and words of support due to the hardest, irreplaceable loss you suffered. 'A vile, cruel crime ended the life of Darya Dugina, a bright, talented person with a true Russian heart - kind, loving, open and sympathetic. 'A journalist, a scientist, a philosopher, a military correspondent, she honestly served the people, the Fatherland, and proved with her life what it means to be a patriot of Russia. 'The memory of Darya Dugina will be forever kept by her close people and friends, her comrades. 'Wishing you strength and fortitude in this mournful hour,' the message concluded. Dugin was later pictured sobbing into his hands on stage as Dugina's mother stood by her coffin to pay her final respects. Dugin, a bearded Rasputin-esque figure who some believe may have been the intended target of the bombing, sat forlornly alongside Dugina's mother at the funeral this morning. When the moment came for him to deliver a speech, he told funeral-goers: 'I wanted to raise my daughter the way I see an ideal human, so first of all it was about belief. She spent her entire childhood in Orthodox camps. But I also wanted her to be a smart Orthodox person, so with her mother we advised her to become a philosopher, and she became one. 'She died for Russia, on the front line... She lived for victory, and died in the name of victory.' He said her last words to him before getting into her Toyota Land Cruiser were: 'Papa, I feel like a warrior, I feel like a hero.' Russian ultra-right ideologue Alexander Dugin is responsible for shaping the world view of Putin's inner circle. He has called for Ukrainians to be killed and strongly pushed Russia to invade for decades. In his youth, Dugin emerged as a leader of the notorious anti-Semitic Russian nationalist organisation, Pamyat. He founded his own publishing house after the fall of the USSR, going on to win university positions for his writings. Dugin believes that the Russian Orthodox Church was destined to rule as an empire over all of Europe and Asia — uniting all the Russian-speaking peoples into a single state. He laid out his plan for achieving this aim in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics, a text which still has significant influence within Russian elites and has even been used as a textbook by the Russian military. The Russian professor formed the 'Eurasia Party' in 2001, named after the hypothetical state, which also appears in George Orwell's novel 1984. His novel calls for a Russian empire stretching from Dublin to Vladivostok, even calling for parts of China to be conquered. Dugin was dismissed from his position as head of the Department of Sociology of International Relations at Moscow University after arguing for 'people's republics' on the territory of Ukraine. Seven years later, his position would become a reality after the Kremlin annexed the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic out of Ukraine's occupied eastern territories. Dugin called for the annexation of Crimea as far back as 2008, during Russia's war with Georgia. He travelled to the disputed region of South Ossetia, where he was photographed with a rocket launcher. He was also involved with coordinating separatist movements in Ukraine during the 2014 occupation, for which the US sanctioned him. The political scientist claims he also played a key role in reconciling the relationship between Russia and Turkey in 2015 after a Russian warplane was shot down on the Syrian border. Dugin also developed links with far-right and far-left political parties in the European Union, attempting to influence EU policy on Ukraine and Russia. Russian authorities pinned the assassination on alleged Ukrainian spy Shaban-Vovk, who they say sneaked into Russia – bringing her 12-year-old daughter with her – and tracked Dugina for weeks before activating the deadly car bomb and fleeing into Estonia, all without being caught. The chain of events leading up to Dugina's death as presented by Russia's security service included Shaban-Vovk changing her appearance and vehicle number plates to hoodwink guards before fleeing from Russia across the Estonian border. The FSB also released what it claimed was the Ukrainian mother's military documents, including a passport-style photo of her. But commentators questioned why Shaban-Vovk, if she is indeed a Ukrainian spy responsible for the killing, would leave her military identification behind and accused Russian authorities of producing a fake to pin the assassination on Ukraine. Estonian foreign minister Urmas Reinsalu today dismissed the wild claims as a 'Russian information operation'. 'We regard this as one instance of provocation in a very long line of provocations by the Russian Federation, and we have nothing more to say about it at the moment,' said the minister, adding Russia had made no request to extradite the alleged killer. The head of the International Centre for Defence and Security (ICDS) in the Estonian capital Tallinn, Indrek Kannik, claimed that Dugina had far more likely been killed by an internal Russian operation. 'It is possible that this was the FSB's own operation, since these people had become a threat. 'At the same time, it is convenient to blame it on the Ukrainians. Now we are seeing that Estonia can also be dragged in to this.' Ukraine has strongly denied any role in the killing in Moscow, accusing the Kremlin of a 'false flag' operation to blame Kyiv. Meanwhile, respected Russian expert Andrei Piontkovsky said the murder of Dugina was professional, indicating that the Russian secret services are likely involved, while Russian-American historian Dr. Yuri Felshtinsky claimed the attack would have been authorised by the Kremlin. 'The blowing up of the car of the famous Russian fascist and ideologist of the Putin regime, Alexander Dugin, was organised, it seems, by the Russian security services,' said Felshtinsky, author of 'Blowing up Ukraine'. 'On the latest Russian reports, the bomb was attached to Dugin's car inside his guarded compound. Ukraine focuses on military targets, unlike Russia, and there is no discernible gain in attacking one of Putin's media puppets or allocating scarce operatives inside the Russian Federation to such a goal that is meaningless to the liberation of Ukraine. 'The Kremlin will, however, likely exploit it to make it seem as if Ukraine is stooping to its own tactics of bombing harmless civilians in Ukraine.' Seven hours before the assassination on Saturday night, Dugin had issued a vitriolic online post on Telegram saying that the war in Ukraine was now more important than Putin's presidency. Dugin had claimed the war and 'desperate resistance of the Atlanto-Nazi regime in Kyiv' demands from Russia 'internal transformations'. The tone was strongly critical of Putin. 'The Supreme Commander-in-Chief [Putin] said that we haven't really started anything yet. Now we have to start. Whether you want it or not, we'll have to,' the post read. 'Now the question is not whether the government wants or does not want change. Such changes are simply inevitable... The mighty forces of history have come into play, the tectonic plates have shifted. Let the old regime bury its dead. 'A new Russian time is coming. And it's coming irreversibly.' Most international observers remain convinced the assassination was actually carried out by Russian agents who wanted to silence the victim's father. Analyst Yekaterina Shulman says the outpouring of anger among pro-Kremlin commentators in response to the car bomb attack appears suspicious: 'The reaction… was immediate. It looks as if they were waiting for something like this to happen.' Shulman added the killing 'could possibly be used to ramp up some public outrage in the country to justify even more active repressive actions by the state'."
2022-08-23,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11137251/Russia-step-strikes-Ukrainian-civilians-week-warns.html,Russia's independence day strike plot for Ukraine: US warns Putin will step up strikes on civilian targets as Kyiv celebrates breaking away from Soviet Union,"Russia is preparing to step up its attacks on civilian and government targets in Ukraine, the US has warned. Americans still living in Ukraine have been warned to leave while the US embassy in Kyiv issued information on how to survive a missile strike. The warning was issued just hours before Ukraine celebrates its Independence Day on August 24, marking 31 years since it split from the Soviet Union. President Zelensky has previously warned that Russia is plotting 'something particularly ugly' to coincide with the national holiday, without specifying what. It comes off the back of days of heavy bombardment in Kharkiv, which experienced one of its deadliest nights of the war so far last week. A large warehouse in the city was on fire Tuesday morning, amid conflicting information about whether a Russian missile strike was to blame. Meanwhile, independent analysts have warned Russia is massing missiles in Belarus for what could be a 'massive attack' on Ukraine. The Belarusian Hajun group said last week that missiles are being gathered at Zyabrovka airfield in the south of the country, putting the city of Chernihiv within easy range. Kyiv could also be within range, depending on the missile type. And concerns are also mounting around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, with multiple explosions reported in the region in recent weeks with Kyiv accusing Russia of planning a 'provocation' there. President Joe Biden spoke Sunday with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz about concerns around the plant. However, the US stressed Monday that its warning about Russian strikes did not specifically cover the power station. As part of the alert, the US embassy in Kyiv told citizens: 'If you hear a loud explosion or if sirens are activated, immediately seek cover. 'If in a home or a building, go to the lowest level of the structure with the fewest exterior walls, windows, and openings; close any doors and sit near an interior wall, away from any windows or openings.' Ukraine's independence day marks the anniversary of the newly-formed country issuing its Declaration of Independence from the Soviet Union on August 24, 1991. Vladimir Putin is seeking to undo that history with his war, calling Ukrainian statehood a 'mistake' that he is determined to correct. Independence day also happens to mark six months since Putin ordered his armed forces into Ukraine to conduct what he called a 'special military operation'. The aim, according to American intelligence and leaked information from inside Russia, was to quickly topple the Zelensky government and install a puppet regime that would have been loyal to Moscow. Putin would then have declared the end of American liberal world order and the dawn of a 'multi-polar' society in which Moscow and Washington held equal sway. But events played out differently. The Russian military was forced to abandon its offensive on Kyiv after huge 'death convoys' of tanks and trucks got bogged down and then picked off by Ukrainian defenders. Putin's generals then pivoted to the Donbas - a region of Ukraine's east with a sizable minority of ethnic Russians - and announced their new mission was to seize it. The attack on Kyiv, they cynically suggested, had only been a distraction to draw Ukrainian troops away while they focused on their true goal. But even that offensive has fallen short. Russia has managed to capture most of Luhansk province - one half of the Donbas - but is struggling to make progress in neighbouring Donetsk. Putin's men have also captured the city of Mariupol, one of the largest in the region, but suffered heavy casualties and were forced to reduce it to rubble in the process. Perhaps the biggest Russian successes on the battlefield have come in the south, where troops pouring out of Crimea have captured swathes of territory and established a so-called land bridge between Donbas and Crimea. But with Russian casualties mounting and Putin's forces spread thin, Kyiv's commanders are now trying to reverse some of those gains. Long-range artillery and sabotage attacks have destroyed bridges, taken out train lines, blow up ammo dumps and flattened airfields around the city of Kherson and Crimea - with Ukraine stating loudly that it intends to re-take both. Talk of a large counter-attack involving troops and tanks has proven largely unfounded, but commanders have started briefing that their true aim is to wear the Russians down to the point they are forced to retreat. Similar tactics led to the withdrawal from Kyiv early in the war, and the decision to quit Snake Island - which Russia tried to play off as a 'goodwill gesture'."
2022-08-23,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11137157/UK-National-Grid-doubles-emergency-planning-exercise-two-four-days-amid-energy-crisis.html,UK National Grid doubles emergency planning exercise from two to four days amid energy crisis: Experts will discuss rationing electricity during crisis talks... as No10 insists Britain does NOT face blackouts this winter,"The UK National Grid has doubled its emergency planning exercise from two to four days amid fears of a spiraling energy crisis. Experts will wargame for four days in September what will happen if gas supplies are reduced which could trigger a need to ration electricity. The Exercise Degree, made up of government agencies, regulators, lobby groups and major energy firms, comes as a global fall in the supply of gas in the market last year sent energy bills skyrocketing, sparking a cost-of-living crisis. However No10 told the BBC there is no reason to panic and households do not have to cut back on their energy use. But experts have warned of a 'security of supply issue' in the energy sector as almost 40% of the UK's electricity was generated last year by gas. The news comes as gas and electricity bills are expected to hit £5,300 when next April's price cap is announced, piling further misery onto Britons as inflation keeps climbing. Both EDF and Octopus Energy are calling for more support for families as its customers face a 'dramatic and catastrophic' winter. Under the Electricity Supply Emergency Code, Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng could take rationing steps if there were issues with supply, such as 'rota disconnections' which would mean cutting or limiting power at periods of high demand. Keith Bell, professor of electronic and electrical engineering at Strathclyde University, also told the BBC one 'credible scenario that we need to be ready for' is cutting supplies to large industrial companies. 'Codes defining what should happen in the event of gas or electricity shortages and who is responsible for what - including the role of the secretary of state - have existed for many years but haven't had to be used' he added. 'A lesson from the pandemic is the need for preparedness and to test emergency arrangements to be sure that they're fit for purpose.' This is as the UK imported 38% of its overall energy supply from aboard and, Mr Bell, claimed Britain lacks the storage capacity for gas. Charles McAllister, director of policy for lobby group UK Onshore Oil and Gas, said Britain was 'at the highest risk of loss of energy supply in decades'. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the UK has 'one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world'. And added: 'We are not dependent on Russian energy imports meaning households, businesses and industry can be confident they will get the electricity and gas they need'. Ed Miliband, shadow net zero and climate secretary, said the government's 'short-sightedness has been staggering - from closing our gas storage facilities, to failing to insulate houses and cut bills, and blocking the quickest, cheapest and cleanest renewables in their energy strategy'. No 10 also insisted to the Independent: 'Households, businesses and industry can be confident they will get the electricity and gas that they need over the winter. 'That's because we have one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world. 'We have access to our own North Sea gas reserves alongside steady imports from reliable partners like Norway.' But experts still maintain that there is a 10% chance 'for a short number of hours some domestic consumers [will] lose power' in winter. Adam Bell, head of energy strategy for the government until 2021, said: 'By not educating the public about how they can best lower their demand, they're increasing the likelihood of a security of supply issue.' Meanwhile, Philippe Commaret, EDF's managing director for customers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We face, despite the support the Government has already announced, a dramatic and catastrophic winter for our customers. 'In January, half of the UK households might be in fuel poverty.' Mr Commaret also called on the Government to do more to support families after Octopus Energy's boss called for the price cap to be frozen as latest dire forecast suggests charges will nearly double in six months. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Octopus Energy chief executive Greg Jackson said that if the price of beer had risen as much as gas prices, getting a pint would cost £25. 'People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around £5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something,' he said. He added: 'There are systemic issues. 'There are loads of questions of how we pay for this. 'One thing we can't do is be expected to pass those costs on to consumers.' Some areas of the UK will also be worse hit as Friends of the Earth research found the worst areas for bills' impact. Birmingham (1st), Bradford (2nd), Cornwall (3rd), Sandwell (4th), County Durham and Enfield (joint 5th) rank highest among 30 local authority areas with the most energy crisis hotspots. Mike Childs, head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said: 'There's no downplaying how catastrophic this and following winters will be for millions of people if energy bills rise as high as they're predicted to, unless the government meaningfully intervenes. 'Instead of woeful and poorly targeted cash handouts, or the promise of tax cuts that won't help those who need it the most, the government must beef up its package of emergency financial support by channelling money to those least able to pay their energy bills. 'And while vital, this is only a short-term solution. The highest priority of all is fixing the UK's leaky, inefficient housing stock, otherwise cash handouts will be required year on year. 'By rolling out a free programme of street-by-street energy efficiency measures, prioritising the most in-need neighbourhoods, we can help to bring bills down quickly, make homes warmer and slash Earth-warming emissions at the same time.' The forecast by energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight has said bills could be capped at £5,341.08 four months into next year, while the figure for January's cap is expected to be £4,649.72. However, the price cap forecast for October this year is £3,583 for the average household, an 80 per cent rise on the current cap of £1,971. The firm has said it is 'difficult to see how many will cope' this winter, with the final figure for the October price cap to be announced by energy regulator Ofgem on Friday. Experts at financial firm Citi have said the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation - which indicates the increase in the amount people pay for goods and services - will hit 18.6 per cent in January. Meanwhile, it emerged that homeowners could get paid to turn off power-hungry appliances such as washing machines, tumble dryers and games consoles during peak times under a new scheme. The National Grid is reportedly considering giving money to people who cut back on their energy between 5pm and 8pm in the form of rebates. There are concerns how millions of households in the UK will be able to afford their energy bills this winter - between October and April the average household will pay an equivalent £4,102 per year for their gas and electricity. The first Australian gas shipment to Europe in more than half a decade is set to dock in the south of England on Monday, as gas shortages bite across the continent. The Attalos gas tanker is set to pull into the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent, by the mouth of the Thames during the day. It brings a rare cargo of liquified natural gas (LNG) from Australia to Europe, the first in six years, according to data from Bloomberg. Some of the gas is likely to be used in the UK straight away, but much of it will probably flow to Europe through the pipelines that connect Britain to the continent. There it might be channelled into European gas storage sites and some of it could return to Britain during winter. The UK has some of the highest LNG import capacity in Europe, but it has very little gas storage. Therefore, much of the LNG that comes to Europe this summer will arrive in British ports, but be shipped over to European storage sites. The Attalos departed Malaysia on July 20, according to data from Vessel Finder. Here it had picked up a shipment of gas that had come from Australia. Because of the long distances involved, it is rare for Australian gas to find its way to Europe. Most instead goes to countries in Asia. But the deep gas crisis that Europe is currently facing has catapulted the need for new sources of the fossil fuel. Gas prices have soared manifold in the last year, and the UK price for delivery next month was up another 17% on Monday morning, hitting £5.40p per therm. At the weekend experts predicted that the average household energy bill is likely to soar to more than £6,000 per year from next April. It is a dire warning for struggling households, and Monday's gas price hike will only add to these woes. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Octopus Energy chief executive Greg Jackson said that if the price of beer had risen as much as gas prices, getting a pint would cost £25. 'People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around £5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something,' he said. He added: 'There are systemic issues. 'There are loads of questions of how we pay for this. 'One thing we can't do is be expected to pass those costs on to consumers.' Soaring gas prices are also adding to the bill that will be hitting households to prop up failed energy supplier Bulb. According to new research by Auxilione, an energy consultancy, and shared with the Financial Times this weekend, the cost of bailing out Bulb might cost £4 billion by this spring. Ministers stepped in to rescue Bulb as it was considered too big to fail. Many of its rivals had gone out of business. The price cap, which is now being raised quarterly instead of every six months previously, would see a massive jump from today's £1,971, which is already a record, and much higher than the £1,138 seen last winter. Cornwall Insight said yesterday: 'While the energy price cap rise in April was already an unprecedent increase in domestic consumer energy bills, our final predictions for October are truly concerning,' Cornwall Insight said. 'With the cost of living spiralling and households looking at an energy bill rise of over £1,500 equivalent per year, it is difficult to see how many will cope with the coming winter.' The new warnings will concern ministers as they meet energy bosses later this week. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi is holding a series of meetings this week to follow up on earlier discussions with energy generation companies. Denmark's Orsted, nuclear company Newcleo, and German giant RWE are all meeting the Chancellor this week, and will be asked what they can do to help consumers with rising energy prices. October's price cap forecast breaks down as predicting a ceiling for electricity bills of £1,679.35, whilst the limit for gas will be £1,874.40. In January, the breakdown could be £2,212.32 for electricity and £2,437.39 for gas. In April, the bills could climb further to £2,365.38 for electricity and £2,975.70 for gas. In July next year, the cap is predicted to fall to £4,767.97, with a £2,052.70 limit for electricity and a £2,715.27 ceiling for gas. By October next year, the figure could climb again to £4,807.11, with £2,110.70 for electricity and £2,696.41. Octopus Energy's Greg Jackson says the wholesale price of gas is to blame for the soaring bills. He has laid the blame at the door of Russia, which has throttled supplies to Europe in retaliation for sanctions imposed on it after its invasion of Ukraine. Wholesale gas prices, which have a huge impact on the price of electricity, are nearly 10 times higher than usual - with the current price at £540 per therm. Mr Jackson said if the price of a pint had gone up at the same rate people would be paying double figures for beer. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: 'I think the spate of failures within the 29 companies that went bust last year, that was driven by gas prices roughly doubling. They're currently nine to 11 times higher than usual. 'Look, to put that in perspective, if this was beer, we're talking about the wholesale price being £25 a pint. 'People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around £5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something.' He added Ofgem should 'freeze the price cap roughly where it is' at £1,971 per year. He said: 'There are systemic issues. There are loads of questions of how we pay for this. One thing we can't do is be expected to pass those costs on to consumers.' 'The big thing here is we need more help for customers from the government. 'The reality is customers are being asked to pay the price of gas which is weaponised by Putin, and they shouldn't expect to do that alone.' These surging energy prices will be the key factor in driving inflation to 18.6 per cent in January, according to financial services firm Citi. It says inflation will soar past the 13 per cent which the Bank of England previously said would be the peak in October, instead hitting the highest level since 1975 in the new year. Last month, CPI inflation struck a new 40-year-high of 10.1 per cent. Citi analyst Ben Nabarro has forecast that inflation will jump to 14.8 per cent in October as energy bills spike for UK households. He projected that inflation will accelerate following last week's 25 per cent rise in UK gas prices and 7 per cent rise in UK electricity prices. Citi said it expects the October energy price cap to reach £3,717, slightly higher than previous estimates. A further increase in energy bills in January - with projections the cap will hit £4,567 - will push inflation towards the new peak, it said. It predicted that the price cap will surge to £5,816 in April. The new forecasts predict that inflation will stay in double figures for the next 12 months and will finally dip back below the Bank of England target rate of 2 per cent by April 2024. Mr Nabarro said: 'Even with the economy softening, last week's data re-affirmed the continued risk of pass through from headline inflation into wage and domestic price setting could accelerate. 'With inflation now set to peak substantially higher than the 13 per cent forecast in August, we expect the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will conclude the risks surrounding more persistent inflation have intensified.' Interest rates increased to 1.75 per cent earlier this month but the economist warned that it could need to rise as high as 7% if 'signs of embedded inflation emerge'. It comes after the National Grid, which manages the infrastructure of Britain's gas and electricity networks, is believed to have applied to energy regulator Ofgem for permission to roll out a scheme that would see homeowners paid for turning off appliances."
2022-08-23,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11137163/U-S-embassy-issues-new-security-alert-Ukraine-urges-U-S-citizens-leave.html,Americans are urged to leave Ukraine IMMEDIATELY as fears mount Russia will step up its attacks on government and civilian targets as country prepares to celebrate its 31 years of independence tomorrow,"The US has warned Russia could step up its military strikes in the coming days to coincide with Ukraine's independence day. The US embassy in Kyiv again urged its citizens to flee if they can before the feared onslaught by Putin's forces. The embassy issued a security alert, saying it 'has information that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine's civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days.' The alert added: 'The US Embassy urges US citizens to depart Ukraine now using privately available ground transportation options if it is safe to do so. 'If you hear a loud explosion or if sirens are activated, immediately seek cover. Ukraine celebrates its independence day on August 24 in commemoration of the Declaration of Independence in 1991. The country had been a major power in the Soviet Union, becoming the center of its arms industry and a major political player. But its output was redirected to the Soviet military and little was left for the Ukrainian population, and the quality of goods remained low compared to their neighbors. The push for independence surged with the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986, and the subsequent demise of the Soviet Union. In early 1990, over 300,000 Ukrainians linked arms in a human chain from Kyiv and Lviv as a show of unity against the Soviet bloc. A student protest known as the Revolution of Granite took place in October 1990 to prevent a new union treaty with the USSR. The country declared its independence in August 1991 and in December, a referendum backed the move with 90 percent approval, with majorities in every region including Crimea. The Soviet Union then formally ceased to exist on December 26. 'If in a home or a building, go to the lowest level of the structure with the fewest exterior walls, windows, and openings; close any doors and sit near an interior wall, away from any windows or openings.' Although it was not the first time the United States has issued such a warning, this one was made as Ukraine was due on Wednesday to mark 31 years of independence from Soviet rule. Kyiv has banned public celebrations in the capital on the anniversary of independence from Soviet rule on Wednesday, citing a heightened threat of attack. The capital is far from the front lines and has only rarely been hit by Russian missiles since Ukraine repelled a ground offensive to seize the capital in March. In Kharkiv, a northeastern city that has come under frequent and deadly longer-range artillery and rocket fire, Mayor Ihor Terekhov announced an extension to an overnight curfew to run from 4pm to 7am effective from Tuesday to Thursday. Fears of attacks have mounted after Russia's Federal Security Service on Monday accused Ukrainian agents of killing Darya Dugina, daughter of a Russian ultra-nationalist ideologue, in a car bomb attack near Moscow that President Vladimir Putin called 'evil.' Ukraine denies involvement. Over the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned in his daily address that 'we should be aware that this week Russia may try to do something particularly nasty, something particularly cruel.' The state department issued the alert after the US intelligence community on Monday declassified a finding that determined that Russia would increasingly target Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, according to an American official. The new intelligence comes as Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine hits the six-month mark on Wednesday, which also coincides with Ukraine's independence day from Soviet Union rule. US President Joe Biden spoke on Sunday with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz about shelling near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in south-eastern Ukraine, and called for the United Nations nuclear watchdog to visit the power plant. The US official said, however, that the intelligence finding is not specifically tied to concerns about Zaporizhzhia. The Biden administration is battling to keep western allies - and Washington - focused on maintaining pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin. US Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday the 'single most important thing going on in the world right now is to beat the Russians in Ukraine'. Speaking at a luncheon event in Scott County, Kentucky, McConnell said the one fear he has is that the US and others will 'all kind of lose interest' as the war drags on. 'We need to stick with them,' McConnell said. 'It's important to us, and to the rest of the world, that they succeed.' Ukraine said today that Russia had carried out artillery and air strikes in the Zaporizhzhia region. Artillery and rocket fire near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear reactor complex, on the south bank of the Dnipro River, has led to calls for the area to be demilitarized. The two sides have traded blame over frequent shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, where Kyiv accuses Moscow of basing troops and storing military hardware. Russia denies this and accuses Ukraine of targeting Zaporizhzhia with drones. Moscow requested a U.N. Security Council meeting be held on Tuesday to discuss the Zaporizhzhia plant, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported, citing Deputy Ambassador to the U.N. Dmitry Polyanskiy."

Moscow claims Ukrainian spy assassinated daughter of leading Russian nationalist - amid fears Putin planned the attack to justify more bloodshed,"A Ukrainian woman spy assassinated the daughter of a leading Russian nationalist and former Putin ally, Moscow security officials claimed last night. Kremlin sources published a remarkable dossier of video footage, photographs and an identity card supposedly belonging to the murderer of Darya Dugina. They named her killer as Natalia Vovk, who apparently sneaked into Russia from Ukraine – bringing her 12-year-old daughter with her – and tracked her victim before activating the deadly device on Saturday night. The chain of events, as presented by Russia's security service, read like a Hollywood spy thriller with Miss Vovk, 43, changing her appearance and vehicle number plates to hoodwink guards. Most international observers remain convinced the assassination was actually carried out by Russian agents who wanted to silence the victim's father, political scientist Alexander Dugin, 60. Analyst Yekaterina Shulman says the outpouring of anger among pro-Kremlin commentators in response to the car bomb attack appears suspicious: 'The reaction… was immediate.

Whoever was responsible, adds Miss Shulman, the killing 'could possibly be used to ramp up some public outrage in the country to justify even more active repressive actions by the state'. Mr Dugin has previously been credited with shaping Putin's vision of a empire encompassing former Soviet-states such as Ukraine, earning him the moniker 'Putin's brain'. But he had been more critical of the president in recent speeches. Mr Dugin, a bearded Rasputin-esque figure, is said to have been the target for the bombing. He had decided to drive home in a different car at the last minute. According to the FSB's case file, Miss Vovk entered Russia driving a Mini Cooper, accompanied by her daughter, after apparently convincing officials they were refugees from the Donetsk People's Republic, an occupied area of eastern Ukraine. Video footage appeared to show her opening its bonnet under the eye of immigration officials who then waved her through a checkpoint. In these images, supposedly recorded on July 23, Miss Vovk was seen with blonde hair. Footage gathered after that date showed her with chestnut brown hair – suggesting she used dye or wigs to avoid detection. The FSB claimed Miss Vovk rented an apartment in Miss Dugina's block and secretly followed her around Moscow for several weeks. In a bid to back this up with evidence, Russian officials shared footage supposedly recorded by a security camera inside a plush Moscow residential building showing Miss Vovk. The service also released what it claimed was her Ukrainian military documents, including a passport-style photo of her. On Saturday Miss Vovk apparently attended the same poetry festival as Miss Dugina and her father. A journalist and vocal supporter of the invasion of Ukraine, Miss Dugina left the event in a Toyota Land Cruiser. The car bomb went off an hour later. According to Russian officials the 800g device had been attached directly beneath the driver's seat. Minutes later Mr Dugin was seen at the blast scene, holding his head in his hands. Just hours before the fatal explosion he had published a characteristically vitriolic post on social media justifying the war in Ukraine as a defence of Russia against Nazism. However, he had also suggested recently the success of the campaign was more important than Putin's political destiny, saying: 'The mighty forces of history have come into play, let the old regime bury its head, a new Russian time is coming.' According to the FSB, Miss Vovk drove hundreds of miles from Moscow to the city of Pskov on the Estonian border. Having entered Russia the previous month with Donetsk number plates – and after using Kazakh plates as she followed Miss Dugina around Moscow – she supposedly changed plates again. This time she was said to have attached Ukrainian identification to her vehicle to enter Estonia, a Nato member state and a key ally of the UK against the occupation of Ukraine. Last night, Russian officials insisted she should return to face justice saying: 'Ukrainian citizen Natalia Vovk, who escaped after committing the murder of Darya Dugina, will be put on the wanted list and her extradition demanded.' The FSB claimed Miss Dugina's murder had been 'solved' and that Miss Volk was acting on the orders of the Ukrainian secret services. Sources close to President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed this as 'fiction'. Aide Mykhailo Podolyak rejected the idea of any Ukrainian involvement, and suggested rogue members of the FSB may have been involved. Yesterday, a Kyiv-based former Russian MP, Ilya Ponomarev, said 'internal groups' seeking to destabilise the Kremlin regime were responsible. By Prof Mark Galeotti The fantastical narrative now being promoted by the Kremlin following the death of Darya Dugina, daughter of the controversial Russian nationalist ideologue Alexander Dugin, is entirely to be predicted. But the identity of the true perpetrator(s) is likely to stay as shrouded in mystery as the man they intended to kill. And I believe Alexander Dugin was the target of the car bomb, despite Russia's claims that his daughter had been stalked for weeks by a 'Ukrainian agent'. Yes, as a journalist and cheerleader for Russia's war in Ukraine, Darya was a public figure in her own right. Alexander, however, is renowned in Russia for his brand of pseudo-mythological ultra-nationalism. He would, apparently, have been in the car had it not been for a last-minute change of plans. A tempting target for Ukraine? Perhaps. But also for other factions. Dugin had gained a significant following but, in the days since Saturday night's bombing, many Western commentators have vastly overstated his influence with the Kremlin – and his relationship with Vladimir Putin. He has been painted as a sort of ideological right-hand man to the president. Some even claim his belief that it is Russia's historic destiny to rule an empire that stretches from Vladivostok to Dublin inspired Putin to invade Ukraine. Yet, despite his beard and well-curated air of mystery, Dugin is far from being 'Putin's Rasputin' as some have claimed. He has scarcely had any contact with Putin and Russia's illegal war of aggression in Ukraine is certainly not his brainchild. In truth, Dugin is a self-publicist, part of an eco-system of ideological and political entrepreneurs in Russia who parrot state propaganda and try to tailor their doctrines to Putin's prevailing mood. His imperialistic philosophies brought him favour in 2014 when Moscow was looking for an ideological rationale to justify its potential annexation of the Donbas. For a short time, Dugin was a regular on Russian TV. He was offered a plum role at MGU, Russia's most prestigious university, and his book – Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia – was required reading at the country's top military college. Yet he was dropped as quickly as he rose to fame, after the Kremlin decided against a full-scale annexation of Donbas. Within hours of the car bomb attack on Saturday, reports speculated that this was a so-called 'false flag' – a political or military action carried out with the intention of blaming an opponent – to justify further aggression against Ukraine and even Estonia. Such clandestine provocation has certainly been a favoured tactic in the past. In 1999, four apartment blocks in three Russian cities were bombed, killing more than 300 and spreading a wave of fear across the country. These are now widely believed to have been staged by the FSB (a successor to the KGB) to generate public support for the second Chechen war. Certainly, the official line from Moscow lends support to the false flag claim. It is not beyond the realms of plausibility that, ahead of Ukrainian independence day tomorrow and the six-month anniversary of the war, Putin is preparing the ground for a dramatic escalation in Ukraine. But I would urge caution. It is difficult to see why Putin would kill Dugin to justify yet more violence and bloodshed than is already being committed on a daily basis. Darya Dugin's assassination could well be the result of bitter rivalries within the ultra-nationalist community, or in-fighting amongst Russia's factionalised and insecure elite. Many political killings in the past – initially blamed on the Russian government – have turned out to be the result of dodgy business dealings. (Incidentally, car bombs were the hallmark of gangland feuds in Russia in the 1990s.) Last night an anti-Putin group, the National Republican Army, was claiming that it carried out the attack. The statement was largely ignored by Russian state TV. What is clear is that blaming Ukraine may yet backfire on Putin rather than bolster support. There is a growing sense that the war in Ukraine is not going to plan. Operations in the Donbas are stuttering, with troops increasingly engaged in a brutal war of attrition with as many as 60,000 Russian casualties so far. Ukraine has been mounting bold attacks behind the front-lines. The claim that a Ukrainian agent was able to infiltrate the country, carry out an attack on a high-profile nationalist, and then flee to Estonia, a neighbouring Nato state, is an admittance of a shocking level of incompetence. It will hardly assuage the 'liberals' who fear that Putin has gone too far in Ukraine – or nationalists who believe the invasion has been mishandled. Indeed, it is these nationalist factions within the Russian elite, often former military, intelligence or security forces, that I believe now present the greatest danger to Vladimir Putin. The death of a nationalist cheerleader, whoever the perpetrator, will only fuel that.

2022-08-22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11135813/On-streets-Taiwan-IAN-BIRRELL-finds-defiance-determination.html,"Facing down the Dragon in 'the most dangerous place on Earth': It's the new global flashpoint experts fear could trigger a war between China and the West. But on the streets of Taiwan, IAN BIRRELL finds defiance and determination","Kneeling on the floor, Kate Wang pressed a bandage to stem the flow of blood from a nasty-looking wound, while others beside her treated bullet holes and brutal lacerations. Fortunately, the casualties were not real. The 40-year-old cosmetics marketing executive was among a group of 60 people learning emergency first aid last week in a peaceful Presbyterian church beside Taiwan’s parliament building. Yet Kate admitted she was preparing for war — and having learned how to tourniquet a bleeding limb, now wants to take shooting lessons in case she has to defend her country from invasion by the ‘barbarians’ ruling China. ‘We have to get prepared while we still have time,’ she said. ‘I fear that they might launch an attack, although the cost of a war would be horrendous destruction. It is better to be psychologically prepared than to be frightened.’ It is strange to hear such talk in a thriving modern city filled with skyscrapers, packed restaurants, flash cars and lush green spaces — but this middle-class woman was inspired to act after seeing Vladimir Putin’s savage attack on Ukraine. Like most citizens in Taiwan, Kate has spent her entire life under the shadow of a Communist dictatorship in China that publicly proclaims its intention to ‘use all necessary means’ to seize the wealthy democracy that lies 110 miles off its coast. As a result her island nation, home to 24 million people, has been labelled ‘the most dangerous place on earth’, given its potential to spark a global conflagration that drags in nearby Japan along with its long-term ally Uncle Sam. Its citizens have watched nervously as China’s president Xi Jinping crushed Hong Kong’s freedoms in defiance of the handover deal with Britain — then saw another hardline nationalist leader in Russia launch an attack on a neighbouring democracy. Now China has ratcheted up tensions with an unprecedented show of military force in the skies and seas around Taiwan — which included firing ballistic missiles into Japanese waters — in furious response to visits by six senior U.S. politicians. This demonstration of military muscle, with multiple incursions into Taiwan’s airspace and waters, was a warning to the world that Beijing sees the island as a recalcitrant breakaway province not a sovereign state. ‘War feels closer than before,’ said Bruce Chen, 53, another marketing official who was learning how to assist trauma victims in the Taipei church, where colourful brochures offer participants guidance on recognising their own tanks and troops. Beijing’s belligerence shows how Taiwan sits at the centre of the intensifying tussle for world domination between two nuclear-armed superpowers, driven by competing ideologies of democracy and dictatorship. This was underscored yesterday a thousand miles to the north where the U.S. and South Korea kicked off their biggest joint military drills for five years, in a show of strength against the Beijing-backed North Korean regime. Washington and Seoul insist the exercises are defensive but Pyongyang claims they are invasion rehearsals that justify its nuclear weapons and hypersonic missile programmes. ‘China wants to make it clear to the United States that any support for Taiwan will have a military cost,’ said Lin Fei-fan, a former student protest leader who is now deputy secretary general of Taiwan’s governing Democratic Progressive Party. ‘My belief is that they are preparing to annex Taiwan. The moment they are ready, when they think the international community will not give us sufficient support or they can bear the cost of the backlash, then Beijing will try to take over Taiwan.’ Others see the drills as sabre-rattling by a leadership beset by growing internal problems, which include slowing growth, falling population, collapsing property markets and mounting unrest over its ‘Zero Covid’ obsession with strict lockdowns. ‘Beijing’s military exercises are propaganda for domestic audiences,’ said Su Tzu-yun, senior analyst at the Institute for National Defence and Security Research. ‘I can’t see an attack for the next five years because they don’t have the capability for such an offensive.’ Taiwan insists it is ready to resist the People’s Liberation Army in what Su terms a ‘David and Goliath’ struggle, based on the worst-case scenario it will find itself fighting alone against the world’s biggest military. Yet any attempted invasion over the Taiwan Strait would be a bloodbath. Both sides have been building up their forces and Beijing would be trying to seize a 245-mile long stretch of land with sprawling major cities, strong fortifications, early warning systems on outlying islands and a heavily forested mountain ridge along its spine. The global repercussions could dwarf the devastating impact of Russia’s assault on Ukraine — not least since Taiwan is home to a semiconductor company that manufactures most of the sophisticated computer chips used by the world’s top tech firms. The immediate cause of this crisis was a 19-hour visit earlier this month by Nancy Pelosi, the U.S. House of Representatives Speaker, who became the most senior Washington figure to go to Taiwan for 25 years. Her trip was branded ‘extremely dangerous’ by Beijing. She was followed last week by five more politicians representing both main parties as the U.S. boosts support for Taiwan to counter China’s influence and increasing assertion in the Indo-Pacific region. Yet the roots go back almost eight decades to the end of World War II. China regained Taiwan from defeated Japan but then saw bloody civil war between a government led by the leader of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek, and the communists of Mao Zedong. When the Communists triumphed in 1949, Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan with the remnants of his Kuomintang nationalist party, where they ruled for many years and were originally recognised by the United Nations as China’s legitimate government. The U.S. insisted it would not intervene to help the defeated nationalist forces — and Mao might have invaded had China not become embroiled in the Korean War. But now Taiwan is seen as the key test of Washington’s resolve to back democracy. Among those who witnessed those historic events is 97-year-old Wei Chung-kang, who was born in Chengdu, China. Press-ganged into the army aged 17, he fought against both the ‘ferocious’ Japanese troops and Mao’s militia. Although he loathes the Chinese Communist Party leadership, who briefly held him captive before he joined more than one million people fleeing to Taiwan, he does not believe that his new homeland is going to be attacked by his former foes. ‘What would be the point when they would only get a destroyed Taiwan?’ he asked. ‘I’m not really concerned since we are not their real enemy. They want to provoke America.’ Wei, who lives in a home for veterans in central Taiwan, told me how the island had been transformed in recent decades. ‘When I arrived it was quite backward and everyone was poor. The progress has been astonishing.’ Taiwan’s citizens are more than twice as rich today as those trapped under Beijing’s despotic regime — a point brought home to me when I emerged after three days of quarantine for Covid to find two Lamborghini sports cars parked outside my hotel in central Taipei, amid the designer shops. It is a fascinating place: recognisably Chinese in heritage, throbbing with the entrepreneurial energy of many Asian cities, yet clearly absorbing political and cultural influences from outside places such as the U.S., Japan and South Korea. This can be seen in everything from its embrace of same-sex marriage — as the first nation in Asia to back the policy — through to the high number of people speaking English, the K-pop haircuts seen in the streets and rap music heard in coffee bars. Such is the fusion that I pushed through the door of a restaurant to find myself in a place with just four tables serving food from the Japanese island of Okinawa while Anarchy In The UK by the Sex Pistols blared out from speakers. Wei believes Taiwan will one day be united with China, however. Although it might seem counter-intuitive given their history of conflict and exile, older generations are more likely to support union than younger citizens raised under their own flag. The first person I stopped on the street to discuss these issues politely rebuffed my approach, saying she was not interested in politics. ‘But from the time I was born I’ve seen myself as Taiwanese, not Chinese,’ declared Erica, 32, a saleswoman. A poll released last week found that only nine per cent of people now back Beijing’s notion that they are all members of ‘One Nation’ — while indicating firm support for Pelosi’s visit despite the intimidating military drills it unleashed. Although a majority do not anticipate immediate attack, the daughter of one exiled Kuomintang general — a former journalist — told me she fears President Xi aims to surpass Mao’s place in history by capturing Taiwan to complete the Communists’ civil war victory. ‘He will attack us to achieve his personal goals,’ she said. ‘Reading into his rhetoric, a military reunification makes him more glorious in history than a peaceful reunification.’ The evolution of Taiwan’s national identity marks the failure of China’s efforts to seduce it back into the fold with investments, scholarships, trade and an offer of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ — especially after a similar pledge for Hong Kong was ditched in a horrifying crackdown in 2019. One 21-year-old student told me most of her friends feared they face a similar future. ‘The majority of people find China’s political system and culture to be unattractive, if not repulsive,’ said Paul Huang, a research fellow at the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation. ‘It is pride — people here see themselves as different from the Chinese.’ ‘It is clear what Taiwan wants now. If you look at the polls, they consistently show support for independence running at more than 50 per cent and it is increasing year by year.’ Here is Xi’s deepest fear: that Taiwan, slipping away from Beijing’s influence just as Ukraine slid away from Russia towards the West, might seek independence rather than remain trapped in diplomatic purgatory under its old title as the Republic of China. This status keeps a fragile peace but sees Taiwan excluded from global institutions, barred from flying its own flag at the Olympics and treated as an adjunct of China by kowtowing firms who put profits before morality by calling it a ‘province of China’. ‘When you’re buying an airline ticket online or booking a holiday you don’t find your country on the menu — just an asterisk,’ said Enoch Wu, founder of Forward Alliance, which runs the first aid training to prepare people for potential emergencies. Taiwan tipped off the world about Covid after it was covered up by China and has its own army, passport and parliament — yet it does not enjoy full recognition as a country at the United Nations or the World Health Organisation. Beijing’s bullying leaders have used their cash and power to systematically diminish diplomatic support for the island, leaving only 14 small nations still recognising it. ‘At least we have the Pope on our side with the Vatican,’ joked one official. Britain was the first Western nation to recognise the Communist regime in 1950. So while Belize, Haiti and Honduras resist China’s pressure, there is a ‘British Office’ rather than an embassy in Taiwan and a ‘Taipei Representative Office’ in the UK. At the time, the Kuomintang were imposing the longest martial law in history on Taiwan — before it was lifted in 1987, the security apparatus dismantled and democracy unleashed with the first multi-party presidential election in 1996. Few people understand the issues at stake better than Wu’er Kaixi, one of the activists who met Pelosi during her visit, since he was one of the leaders of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 yet escaped the subsequent slaughter. We talked over beers in a craft bar as Wu’er, a member of China’s Muslim Uyghur minority, recalled his famous rebuke of Chinese premier Li Peng before the television cameras, followed by the fateful days when their rulers ditched reform and turned back to blood-stained autocracy. He moved to Taiwan 26 years ago after spending time in France and the U.S. — and argues that it has become the flagship for global democracy as dissatisfaction and public unrest corrodes more developed countries. ‘This country has developed a vibrant democracy but it was a lonely path with many people treating the nation so unfairly,’ Wu’er said. ‘Each and every Taiwanese person takes fierce pride in our freedoms because we earned it — and we will defend it.’ Wu’er does not believe Beijing will attack his new homeland since he believes the Communist Party chiefs are ‘a calculating bunch of mafia-like criminals without principles’ who do not want to jeopardise their ‘looting’ of their own country. But he would like to see the West follow their stance against Russia by imposing sanctions on the top 200 Chinese families to stop travel and strip them of wealth. ‘Treat them as criminals — the regime there is not ideological, just a mafia,’ he said. Perhaps Taiwan offers a glimpse of the China that might have emerged had the leadership not panicked in the face of those protests — and this is why it terrifies the ruling Communist regime that cracks down so harshly on the slightest sign of freedom. For this thriving and prosperous island nation that sits just off their shore is the ultimate riposte to the brutes ruling over one-sixth of the world’s population after it successfully navigated the difficult path from dictatorship to democracy. ‘We’re doing everything that is the opposite to China,’ said the governing party’s Lin Fei-fan. ‘So in the Mandarin-speaking world we represent the possibilities and the achievements of democracy — and this poses a serious threat to their legitimacy.’"
2022-08-22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11135505/Putins-Rasputin-Car-bomb-attack-hallmarks-GRU-execution-expert-claims.html,"Car bomb attack on 'Putin's Rasputin' - who Vladimir deemed 'uncontrollable' - has 'all the hallmarks of a Russian GRU execution' because military spy group 'often include a target's family', expert claims","The car bomb attack on 'Putin's Rasputin' - who Vladimir deemed 'uncontrollable' - has 'all the hallmarks of a Russian GRU execution' because the military spy group 'often include a target's family', an expert has claimed. Yuri Felshtinsky, author of Blowing up Ukraine: The Return of Russian Terror and the Threat of World War III, has claimed the attack on Putin loyalist Alexander Dugin's daughter would have been authorised by the Kremlin. He claimed that Dugin, 60, had a reputation for being 'unruly' and that the Kremlin is 'using Dugin in its own global propaganda war' counting on the fact that international media does not realise he was considered 'uncontrollable and a persona non-grata'. Felshtinsky said: 'In the UK, the GRU attacked former GRU officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter in 2018. 'In 2004, two GRU officers assassinated former Chechen President Zelimkhan Yardarbiyev by blowing up his car with Yardarbiyev and his 15-year old son inside. 'The two officers were later released at Putin's request. Several Gazprom executives and relatives were similarly targeted as Gazprom has strong GRU connections. 'Apart from being very smart and to the far right even of the Kremlin, Dugin had a gift for being unruly, difficult and making enemies in Russia to the point that he was ejected from the organisations he joined.' The historian, whose book will sell for £20 in hardback upon release, continued: 'Dugin's father was a GRU officer and this connection protected Dugin probably when he was one of the first who joined the Russian post-fascist organisation Black Order of the SS in 1980, the embryonic New Right in the USSR. 'Ever since, the Kremlin has uneasily used Dugin in its intelligence work but never trusted him close to the centre. He himself was careful never to make the potentially life-threatening claim that Putin was one of his followers, but merely to point out to foreign media that he advocated Russia's actions such us taking Crimea, Georgia, Ukraine, before the Kremlin made them national policies.' Dugin accused Ukraine of carrying out the attack on his daughter, Darya Dugina, 29, on Saturday night in a bombing believed to be intended for him. He said in revenge for the attack, Putin's men must secure a victory against Ukraine in the war. Dugin's comments came after it emerged he had strongly criticized Putin shortly before Dugina was ripped to pieces in the attack. In response to his comments, there had been an online campaign to disparage Dugin in the days before the bombing. The revelations add to the theory that Dugina was killed by Russian special services or other forces loyal to Putin. But Russia's feared FSB spy agency claimed the SBU - Kyiv's special forces - were behind the murder and alleged a spy called Natalia Vovk, born in 1979, carried out the hit. Vovk is said to have arrived in Russia on July 23 with her daughter Sophia Shaban, 12, before driving a Mini Cooper to spy on Dugina. Ukraine has strongly denied any role in the killing in Moscow, accusing the Kremlin of a 'false flag' operation to blame Kyiv. Putin today expressed his 'sincere condolences' to Dugina's family, writing in a message: 'A vile, cruel crime ended the life of Daria Dugina, a bright, talented person with a real Russian heart - kind, loving, sympathetic and open.' Dugin, a Russian ultranationalist and fascist who has fantasies of rebuilding a vast new empire across Europe and Asia, was taken to hospital after his daughter was killed in the alleged assassination attempt on his life. The directorate is the foreign military intelligence agency of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. It controls the military intelligence service and maintains its own special forces unit. He was travelling on a highway near the village of Bolshiye Vyazyomy just outside the capital on Saturday but decided to travel in a different car to his daughter, avoiding death only by chance Moscow investigators yesterday confirmed an explosive device was planted under the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado Dugina was driving. Reports say the bomb may have been detonated by remote control. It contained 400 to 800g of TNT, with some experts saying it was the equivalent to 'a simultaneous explosion of six grenades'. Russia's FSB claimed Vovk, believed to be a member of Kyiv's SBU, carried out the attack on Dugina. 'A Mini Cooper was used to spy on the girl [Dugina]. Numbers were changed on it three times - the license plates of the DPR, Kazakhstan and Ukraine were used,' reported SHOT media. The report stated: 'On the day of the crime, Vovk and her daughter arrived at the Tradition festival, and after a controlled explosion on August 21, they left through Pskov to Estonia.' The Russian Investigative Committee is said to be examining this version of events. But others have claimed Dugin and Dugina were targeted by agents loyal to Putin after it emerged that the ultranationalist had strongly criticised the Russian leader shortly before the car bombing. Seven hours before the attack, Dugin had issued a vitriolic online post on Telegram saying that the war in Ukraine was now more important than Putin's presidency. Dugin had claimed the war and 'desperate resistance of the Atlanto-Nazi regime in Kyiv' demands from Russia 'internal transformations'. The tone was strongly critical of Putin. 'Increasing attacks on Crimea, attempts to arrange a nuclear explosion in Zaporizhzhya, declarations of a counter-offensive on Kherson, Zelensky's firm refusal to compromise, the West's persistence in cutting off all ties with Russia – all these are signs that they have decided to stand until the end,' he wrote. 'They can be understood: Russia actually (and this is not propaganda) challenged the West as a civilisation. So we have to go all the way to the end, too. 'The Supreme Commander-in-Chief [Putin] said that we haven't really started anything yet. Now we have to start. Whether you want it or not, we'll have to.' He warned: 'Now the question is not whether the government wants or does not want change. Such changes are simply inevitable - even if you stand to death against their beginning, it will be possible to delay it for no more than six months. And then they will come anyway.' Crucially he warned Putin that the military operation, crushing Ukraine and defeating the West 'is now more important than the power [itself].' 'The mighty forces of history have come into play, the tectonic plates have shifted. Let the old regime bury its dead. A new Russian time is coming. And it's coming irreversibly.' Respected Russian expert Andrei Piontkovsky said the murder of Dugina was professional, indicating that the Russian secret services are behind it. 'It is clear these were Russian special services. Dugin is well-known as an informal spiritual leader of the ultra-fascist party, which has recently been increasingly criticising Putin as 'not being fascist enough',' he said. According to Piontkovsky, Dugin and his accomplices had begun to worry Putin's entourage, just as Putin is trying in every possible way to freeze the conflict. But there are growing fears that the attack was conducted by Putin's own loyal agents amid rumours they want to oust the Russian leader from power. Frustration and anger is mounting over Russia's war in Ukraine, with one of Putin's former commanders even branding the president a 'clown' who has been outplayed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia has furiously claimed that Dugin had received death threats from 'Ukrainian nationalists' before Dugina was ripped to pieces in an attack believed to be intended for her ultranationalist father. But some experts have suggested that it was Putin's FSB spy agency that was behind the attack. Former Russian lawmaker Ilya Ponomarev also claimed that the explosion was the work of an unknown Russian group, the National Republican Party. The existence of the group could not be verified. He said on Russian TV: 'A momentous event took place near Moscow last night. This attack opens a new page in Russian resistance to Putinism. New – but not the last.' The mounting suspicions that Putin's inner circle may have turned against him and carried out the bombing attack comes as Igor Girkin, an intelligence and army veteran who was central to the seizure of Crimea and parts of the Donbas region in 2014, has mocked the Russian ruler's performance in Ukraine. Girkin said that Zelensky was often labelled a 'clown' because he was a TV comedian before being elected president 'But then came the war,' said Girkin. Unlike Putin, Zelensky 'didn't run away' or 'hide in a bunker' during the war, he said. The Ukrainian leader had 'announced, launched and conducted a general mobilisation' of his country's military-age men and 'achieved massive deliveries of weapons from NATO', adding that he had 'fooled the Kremlin'. Russian ultra-right ideologue Alexander Dugin is responsible for shaping the world view of Putin's inner circle. He has called for Ukrainians to be killed and strongly pushed Russia to invade for decades. In his youth, Dugin emerged as a leader of the notorious anti-Semitic Russian nationalist organisation, Pamyat. He founded his own publishing house after the fall of the USSR, going on to win university positions for his writings. Dugin believes that the Russian Orthodox Church was destined to rule as an empire over all of Europe and Asia — uniting all the Russian-speaking peoples into a single state. He laid out his plan for achieving this aim in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics, a text which still has significant influence within Russian elites and has even been used as a textbook by the Russian military. The Russian professor formed the 'Eurasia Party' in 2001, named after the hypothetical state, which also appears in George Orwell's novel 1984. His novel calls for a Russian empire stretching from Dublin to Vladivostok, even calling for parts of China to be conquered. Dugin was dismissed from his position as head of the Department of Sociology of International Relations at Moscow University after arguing for 'people's republics' on the territory of Ukraine. Seven years later, his position would become a reality after the Kremlin annexed the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic out of Ukraine's occupied eastern territories. Dugin called for the annexation of Crimea as far back as 2008, during Russia's war with Georgia. He travelled to the disputed region of South Ossetia, where he was photographed with a rocket launcher. He was also involved with coordinating separatist movements in Ukraine during the 2014 occupation, for which the US sanctioned him. The political scientist claims he also played a key role in reconciling the relationship between Russia and Turkey in 2015 after a Russian warplane was shot down on the Syrian border. Dugin also developed links with far-right and far-left political parties in the European Union, attempting to influence EU policy on Ukraine and Russia. Dugin, a Russian ultranationalist and fascist who has fantasies of rebuilding a vast new empire across Europe and Asia, was taken to hospital after his daughter was killed. He was travelling on a highway near the village of Bolshiye Vyazyomy just outside the capital on Saturday but decided to travel in a different car to his daughter, avoiding death only by chance. Dugin said today of his daughter: 'She was a beautiful Orthodox girl, a patriot, a military correspondent, an expert on the central channels, and a philosopher. 'Her speeches and reporting have always been profound, grounded and restrained. She never called for violence and war. 'She was a rising star at the beginning of her journey.' He went on to blame Kyiv for the attack, which Ukraine has denied, and said Russia must seek more than revenge and win the war. Dugin said: 'The enemies of Russia meanly, surreptitiously killed her... 'But we, and our people cannot be broken even by such unbearable blows. 'They wanted to suppress will with bloody terror against the best and most vulnerable of us. But they will not succeed. Our hearts yearn for more than just revenge or retribution. 'It's too petty, it's not Russian style. We need only our Victory. My daughter laid her life on its altar - so please win! We wanted to raise her to be smart, and to be a hero. Let this (her tragic death) inspire the sons of our Fatherland to the feat even now.' A distressing video from Baza media shows the bereft father - known as Putin's 'Rasputin' - at the scene of the explosion. The car is seen as a fireball as emergency services sirens wail. Reports said she died on the spot. But her father - seen as the brains behind Putin's interference in Ukraine from 2014 - was intended to be in the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado which was hit, but the former professor apparently switched cars at the last minute. The explosion took place as Ms Dugina was returning from a cultural festival she had attended with her father. Dugina was a political analyst and editor of pro-Putin journal United World International and a joint author of a book on Putin's war in Ukraine. Her father is the author of an extreme rightwing view of Russia's role in the world which held an appeal to Putin. The pair were pictured together at a pro-Putin public event shortly before she was slain. Andrey Krasnov, the head of the Russian Horizon social movement and a close friend of the dead woman, said: 'I knew Darya personally. 'This was the father's vehicle. Darya… took his car today, while Alexander went in a different way. He returned, and he was at the site of the tragedy. 'As far as I understand, Alexander or probably both of them were the target.' There is no direct evidence Ukraine or its agents were involved in the Moscow attack, but senior pro-Putin war supporters were quick to demand an all out attack on Kyiv over the alleged assassination. Margarita Simonyan, head of RT 'propaganda' network, posted on Telegram that Ukraine's key 'decision-making centres need to be bombed. She wrote: 'Decision-making centres! Decision-making centres!! Decision-making centres!!!' Her call echoes a demand from hardliners loyal to Putin for him to wreak havoc with massive missile strikes on central Kyiv. Propaganda journalist Maxim Kononenko messaged: 'The address of the main building of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services]: Volodymyrska 33, Kyiv. I'm going to try to sleep now, and when I wake up, I hope to read on the news that it was f****** bombed along with its basements.' There were also warnings that other pro-Putin propagandists could be in danger. Denis Pushilin, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic [DPR], a pro-Moscow puppet state in eastern Ukraine, posted: 'The terrorists of the Ukrainian regime, trying to eliminate Alexander Dugin blew up his daughter...in a car. Blessed memory of Daria, she is a real Russian girl.' He directly blamed 'terrorists of the Ukrainian regime'. Dugina was described as 'a young, smart, beautiful and incredibly talented and sympathetic woman'. While he has no formal role in government, Dugin, a far-Right occult writer who used to edit the staunchly pro-Putin Tsargrad TV network, is regarded as the Russian warmonger's 'guru advisor' and reportedly exerts heavy influence over him. He is credited with giving new life to the term Novorossiya (New Russia), which was adopted by Putin to justify his annexation of Crimea in 2014. Dugin has long dreamed of an expansionist Russia, advocating for Russian rule 'from Dublin to Vladisvostok' in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics. He once said not taking back control of Ukraine would be 'an enormous danger for all of Eurasia' - before he was sanctioned by the US in 2015 after allegedly recruiting fighters for Russia-backed forces in the country. His daughter Darya was also sanctioned by the US Treasury after she became chief editor of the United World International (UWI) website - which was owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is suspected of interfering in the 2016 election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The car bombing attacks comes as Russian forces pressed on with their offensive across several Ukrainian regions on Monday. Zelensky has called for vigilance, saying Moscow could try 'something particularly ugly' ahead of Wednesday, which marks Ukraine's Independence Day and also half a year since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. The Kremlin's propaganda arm has claimed Russian troops were 'poisoned in a chemical attack in Ukraine', prompting fears Moscow will seek to justify the use of chemical weapons in the country. Putin mouthpiece Russia Today reported traces of Botulinum toxin Type B, which is an 'organic poison of artificial origin,' were found in samples taken from soldiers, according to a statement from Russia's defence ministry. But Kyiv hit back, suggesting the soldiers simply could have eaten contaminated meat. Kyiv was accused of 'domestic terrorism' and Russian troops were 'hospitalised with signs of severe poisoning' after being stationed near the village of Vasilyevka in the Zaporozhzhia region on July 31. The statement added: 'The Zelensky regime has authorized terrorist attacks with the use of toxic substances against Russian personnel and civilians.' The Russian Ministry's report did not say how many servicemen had suffered or what their condition was now. It did not say what the 'supporting evidence' was. Botulinum toxin type B is a neurotoxin that can cause botulism when ingested in previously contaminated food products, but it can also have medical uses. Ukraine's interior ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said: 'The department (Russian defence ministry) does not clarify whether the poisoning could have been caused by expired canned meat, in which botulinum toxin is often found. 'Overdue rations have been massively complained about by the occupying forces since the first days of the invasion of Ukraine.' The Russian defence ministry said it was conducting an additional investigation into an incident in which Volodymyr Saldo, the Russian-installed administration in Ukraine's occupied Kherson region, was taken ill. Saldo, a former mayor of the city of Kherson who was appointed to head the region of the same name when Russian troops overran it in early March, fell ill in early August. Russia says its 'special military operation' launched on Feb. 24 is aimed at demilitarizing Ukraine and protecting Russian speakers on what President Vladimir Putin called historical Russian land. Ukraine and Western countries view it as an unprovoked war of conquest aimed at wiping out Ukraine's national identity. Yesterday, it was reported Ukrainian emergency workers were carrying out drills in the event of a meltdown at the Zaporizhizhia plant. The nuclear plant is not located in the Ukrainian-controlled city that shares its name, but is actually 30 miles down the Dnipro River on Russian-occupied territory. Kyiv says Moscow has turned the nuclear plant - Europe's largest - into a military base, stored explosives in and around the reactors, and is preparing a 'false flag' attack. Ukraine's nuclear regulator says the Russian commander in charge of the plant has told his troops they must be ready to blow it up rather than let Ukraine re-take it. Russia has occupied the power plant since the early weeks of Putin's war in Ukraine, after its forces swept out of occupied Crimea and took control of large areas of southern Ukraine. However, warnings about the stability of the plant have stepped up in recent weeks as Russia attempts to disconnect it from Ukraine's main power grid and divert its energy to Crimea - and as a major Ukrainian counter-offensive to re-take the south ratchets up. Guterres was due in Lviv Saturday alongside Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss the situation around the power plant and the possibility of sending in a team of international inspectors to ensure its safety. Erdogan, making his first visit to Ukraine since the war began, was also due to discuss a deal to allow Ukrainian ships carrying vital loads of grain out of the country to avoid a global famine. Zelensky said he had discussed 'all the threats' with French President Emmanuel Macron and word had also been sent to other leaders including Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. 'All of Ukraine's partners have been informed about what the terrorist state can prepare for this week,' Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address, referring to Russia. He also said if Russia went ahead with plans to try captured Ukrainian defenders in Mariupol, then it would have violated international rules and cut itself off from negotiations. 'If this despicable show trial were to go ahead... this would be the line beyond which negotiations are no longer possible,' he said. 'There will be no more conversations. Our state has said everything.' Gennady Gatilov, Moscow's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told the Financial Times that Erdogan had tried to facilitate dialogue between Russia and Ukraine. But Gatilov dismissed speculation about direct talks between Zelensky and Putin, saying there 'was not any practical platform for having this meeting'. In the eastern Bakhmut region, Russian forces inflicted damage from artillery and multiple rocket launcher systems in the areas of Soledar, Zaytseve and Bilogorivka settlements, Ukraine's General Staff said in its daily update on Monday. They continued to focus their efforts on establishing full control over the territories of Luhansk and Donetsk regions, maintaining the captured areas of Kherson and parts of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Mykolaiv regions, the General Staff added. Of particular concern is the shelling of Nikopol. As a result of overnight rocket attacks on Nikopol, Krivyi Rih and Synelnykovsky districts of the Dnipropetrovsk region, four people were injured, regional Governor Valentyn Reznichenko wrote on Telegram on Monday. Over the past 24 hours, two civilians were killed in the Donetsk region in Ukraine's east, the regional administration said. Meanwhile, a kamikaze drone strike hit Russia's Navy headquarters in Crimea and sparked a huge explosion on Saturday, in another suspected Ukrainian raid. Smoke was seen billowing through the air following the attack, which came despite frantic attempts from Putin's forces to shoot down the UAV, as seen in a video where repetitive gunfire is heard. The naval HQ suffered a direct hit, said reports while terrified Russian tourists fled the popular summer peninsula. Governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhaev confirmed the attack, writing on Telegram: 'Unfortunately, [the drone] was not shot down, although they worked on the bay with small arms. [It] went low. There were no victims.' He warned: 'The tenacity of these Ukro-Reich morons is amazing. Everyone, if possible, needs to be home in the next hour.' Russia also suffered incoming attacks on resort Yevpatoriya, north of Sevastopol, where one man was heard saying: 'This is not funny. Let's pack up and get out of here. These are no fireworks.' The air defence system was activated in the Western Crimea, the head of Putin's regime in annexed Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said. 'The target is hit. There is no damage, nor any wounded. Our military clearly, professionally and effectively carry out their tasks. I ask everyone to remain calm and trust only official information.' Initially as the wave of attacks came in, Razvozzhaev said: 'I am at my workplace in the government. As well as many of the townspeople, I heard the clapping in the [city] centre. 'Similar sounds were heard in the Strelka area a little earlier. The air defence was operating in the bay. Naval artillery [operated] in the centre. The same as yesterday. According to preliminary data [they were shooting down drones. Targets were hit. We remain calm. The military is doing their job perfectly. Let's support them.' However, the fear of attacks on Crimea - a new development in the war this month - is palpable among tourists who are fleeing the peninsula. It is the latest in a string of mystery blasts, widely believed to be inflicted by Ukrainian forces, deep in the occupied peninsula. Intelligence officials revealed last night how the strikes have crippled the invaders' military capabilities, while also displaying Kyiv's ability to wreak havoc on Russian logistics. It follows a huge blast at a Russian air base in Crimea last week. Western officials have now revealed the incident knocked out half of Russia's Black Sea naval aviation force. A source said: 'They've lost their flagship Moskva, they lost Snake Island, they lost half of their naval aviation package and their military headquarters was struck. I think we can assume attacks by Ukrainians behind enemy lines.' The explosions were reported at an air base near the village of Belbek, on the south-west coast near Sevastopol, HQ of Vladimir Putin's Black Sea fleet. On the opposite end of the peninsula, the sky has been lit up at Kerch near a huge bridge to Russia, with what Moscow has claimed was fire from its air defences. Inside Russia, two villages have been evacuated after explosions at an ammunition dump in Belgorod province, more than 60 miles from territory controlled by Ukrainian forces. Kyiv also announced a strike on a bridge at the Kakhovska Dam, near Kherson – one of the last routes for Russia to supply its troops on the west bank of the Dnipro River. Such attacks were having a 'significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership', said the official. Russia has denied any aircraft were damaged in what it called an accident at the base, although satellite pictures showed at least eight warplanes completely burned out. The recent explosions have had a major psychological effect on Moscow's leadership, with its invasion of Ukraine at 'near operational standstill', Western officials have said. Three alleged Kremlin spies caught breaking into an arms factory in Albania are accused of spraying chemicals into the faces of the soldiers who stopped them. Two men with Russian passports and one Ukrainian national, most likely from one of the country's Moscow-ruled breakaway republics, tried to enter the weapons factory tonight, the NATO country's ministry of defence explosively claimed. It added: 'The officers who were guarding the plant reacted immediately, but during their efforts to stop the three foreign nationals, two of our soldiers were injured.' Factory director Lorenc Zani confirmed there was a 'physical clash', at which point the defending soldiers were sprayed with the unknown material, Albanian Daily News reported. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said the three individuals are 'suspected of espionage.' Officers arrested the three men, with the Albanian soldiers now hospitalised with illnesses arising from the apparent chemical poisoning. They are said to be in a stable condition. The defense ministry said one of the arrested, identified only as a Russian national MZ, 24 years old, entered the plant's territory and was trying to take photos. Two others, a Russian woman identified as ST, 33, and Ukrainian man FA, 25, were also arrested nearby. Gramsh military base in central Albania is an unusual location for foreign 'tourists' to visit. More than half of the Russian navy's Black Sea Fleet combat jets were put out of action in blasts last week at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea, an area Moscow previously considered secure, according to Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD). The Kremlin is busy seeking to allocate blame for the debacle and President Putin is struggling to hide Ukraine's success from the Russian population. This comes as thousands of Russians fleeing Crimea have streamed into the country, officials said on Friday, and as a fire at a munitions depot near the Russian village of Timonovo has led to the evacuation of two villages in Russia's Belgorod region. Roughly 1,100 people reside in the villages of Timonovo and Soloti, around 15 miles from the Ukrainian border. There were no casualties in the blaze late Thursday, Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. In the attack on the Crimean airbase last week, nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed. The strike demonstrated both the Russians' vulnerability and the Ukrainians' capacity to strike deep behind enemy lines, previously not thought possible. Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility, but President Volodymyr Zelensky alluded to Ukrainian attacks behind enemy lines after the blasts in Crimea, which Russia has blamed on 'sabotage.' On Ukraine's capabilities, one Western official said: 'Ukraine is now consistently achieving kinetic effects deep behind Russia's lines. 'The incidents have been having a material effect on Russia's logistics support, but as importantly, there's a significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership.' They added that the attacks had forced the Black Sea Fleet into a defensive posture and stymied Russia's ability to launch a successful amphibious assault on Odesa on Ukraine's coast, which would cut off much of Ukraine's access to the sea. It comes as the war has entered a phase of 'near operational standstill', with neither side's ground forces having enough concentrated combat power to launch effective offensive actions, the Western official said. Russia is facing an increasingly acute shortage of stocks, even of basic munition, as well as manpower issues as it struggles to reconstitute its forces. 'There was a point when there was constant shelling, there was a real high point, particularly around the battle for the Donbas,' they said. 'We aren't at that high point anymore. 'The whole tempo of the campaign has slowed down, partly because both sides have become more conscious that this is a marathon not a sprint and that expenditure rates and conserving their munitions is important'. At least a dozen civilians were killed by Russian strikes in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv this week, according to the MoD. 'This civilian suffering provides an unusually stark example of Russian cynicism,' the official said, adding that Moscow was not planning to launch an offensive in the area or gain any major operational advantage from the bombardment. Meanwhile, the head of the GCHQ intelligence service said Moscow had failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine. 'So far, President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the West,' Sir Jeremy Fleming wrote in an op-ed in The Economist. 'Just as with its land invasion, Russia's initial online plans appear to have fallen short.' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in televised remarks Friday that statements from Ukrainian officials about striking facilities in Crimea mark 'an escalation of the conflict openly encouraged by the US and its NATO allies.' Ryabkov said Russian officials had warned the US against such actions in phone calls with high-level members of the Biden administration. He added that 'deep and open US involvement' in the war in Ukraine 'effectively puts the US on the brink of becoming a party to the conflict.' 'We don't want an escalation,' Ryabkov said. 'We would like to avoid a situation where the US becomes a party to the conflict, but so far we haven't seen their readiness to deeply and seriously consider those warnings.' In response to the attacks, Putin sacked his Black Sea naval commander earlier this week. The removal of Igor Osipov marked the most prominent sacking of a military official in the nearly six months since Russia launched its war on Ukraine. State-owned RIA said the new chief, Viktor Sokolov, was introduced to members of the fleet's military council in the port of Sevastopol. One source said it was 'normal' that the appointment was not publicly announced at a time when Russia is conducting what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Speculation has followed that Osipov was sacked following the sinking of the Moskva flagship on April 14, but the naval commander appears to have kept his job until recently. Osipov was absent from the Red Square 'victory parade', with Moscow claiming he was 'not in the mood' to appear following the loss of the flagship."
2022-08-22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11134987/Russian-tourist-posts-location-Crimea-anti-air-battery-social-media.html,Russian tourist gives away position of Putin's air defences in Crimea by posting holiday snap which allowed Ukraine military experts to locate them - much to Kyiv's amusement,"Just a week ago Ukraine was telling them to go home, but now they're thanking one Russian tourist in Crimea after he helped give away the location of vital air defences. 'Maybe we're being too hard on Russian tourists - this man has been really helpful,' the Ministry of Defence wrote in a tongue-in-cheek Twitter post today. The message was accompanied by a picture of a chubby elderly man in Speedo shorts standing on a beach with a Russian S-400 anti-air system in the background. It was uploaded to social media site VKontakte - Russia's equivalent of Facebook - over the weekend, complete with geolocation data. That allowed internet sleuths to locate the anti-air battery - which is supposed to be Russia's most-sophisticated - to a salt flat near the city of Yevpatoriya. The location tallies with reports of activity by anti-air systems in the area at the weekend by the Russian governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev. It also tallies with other distant images of the same battery taken in late July and also uploaded to Russian social media. Ukraine's Ministry of Defence seems to have taken not of the location, sarcastically telling the Russian man: 'Thank you and keep up the good work!' The fate of the anti-aircraft battery is currently unknown. But it comes after a series of explosions across Crimea targeting Russian airbases and ammo dumps that Ukraine has taken credit for. Oleksii Reznikov, the defence minister, said at the weekend that a 'resistance force' working in tandem with Ukrainian special forces was responsible for the blasts. One all-but wiped out Saki airfield, which was being used by the airborne arm of Russia's Black Sea fleet, taking out half of their combat jets. Another destroyed an ammo dump near the city of Dzhankoi, a third damaged an airfield at Gvardeyskoye, and a fourth hit the headquarters of the beleaguered Black Sea Fleet on Sunday. Russia attempted to play down the airfield blast as the result of an 'accident' but did admit the Dzhankoi explosion was 'sabotage', though it didn't name a culprit. Volodymyr Zelesnky said amidst the explosions that Crimea is Ukrainian soil, and vowed that Russian forces occupying it since 2014 would be driven out. 'This Russian war...began with Crimea and must end with Crimea - with its liberation,' Zelensky said in a speech on August 10. Ukraine says it aims to drive Russian forces off all its territory, and not just the land it has taken since the current war began on February 24. Zelensky's aides say the true war aim is to take back all territory within Ukraine's internationally recognised border, including land taken in the 2014 war. So far, the military has shown only a limited ability to re-take land from Russia - though have succeeded in behind-the-frontlines strikes on rail and road networks. Ukraine has also been striking Russian command posts and ammo dumps in the hopes of forcing a retreat by cutting Putin's men off from supplies. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's Southern Command, suggested to the Wall Street Journal at the weekend that Russia's vulnerable logistics are its best shot at victory. Ukraine will not be able to out-match Russia in terms of raw troops numbers, vehicles or firepower - despite mobilising its population and getting supplies from the West, she conceded. But, by using the weapons and troops it does have to maximum effect, she believes it is possible to defeat the superior enemy. 'There are more of them. They have more weapons. They're more powerful in the air,' Ms. Humeniuk conceded. 'So we have to find a way to beat them under these conditions. It's not easy, but it's doable.'"
2022-08-22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11134593/Model-wife-Putins-spokesman-sparks-anger-filmed-smashing-plates-Greek-holiday.html,Model wife of Putin's spokesman sparks anger as she is filmed smashing plates during Greek holiday as Russia carries out bloody invasion of Ukraine,"A top Kremlin wife has caused outrage after she was seen on video frantically smashing plates while on vacation during Vladimir Putin's bloody war with Ukraine. Former Olympic skater Tatiana Navka, 47, born in Soviet Ukraine, is married to Dmitry Peskov, 54, Putin's spokesman and also deputy chief of his Kremlin administration. Amid huge criticisms for her plate-smashing antics, the one time Russian Maxim model removed the video from Instagram - banned as extremist in a media crackdown overseen by her husband - after she moved in recent days from ancient city Ephesus in Turkey to a resort in Greece. She has been slated by Russian and Ukrainian critics for her ostentatious displays as civilians including children are being killed in Putin's war. While the Greek tradition of plate smashing can be an act of mourning, it is also seen as a devil-may-care attitude in a celebration. But many commenters can not believe behaving in such a way in a country openly supporting Ukraine and branded 'unfriendly' by Putin. One said: 'The wife of a top civil servant of a fighting country should behave more modestly. 'Doesn't her position imply that? She is almost the country's first lady.' Other furious comments asked how she received a visa for an EU country, with one demanding: 'How was she allowed into Greece?' Another asked: 'Is it your husband [Dmitry Peskov, Putin's longtime spokesman] filming? Another questioned 'Why are you not in Crimea?' The holiday peninsula - annexed by Putin from Ukraine - has been under fierce bombardment by Kyiv forces in recent days. She was asked: 'Have you lost all sense?' And she was told: 'This embarrasses Putin and Russia.' One more angry comment said: 'I believe it is absolutely inappropriate for the president's press secretary and his wife to be partying in these difficult times. 'They completely lost their shame, and mostly show exactly how they 'love' their motherland and their people.' User Karina Margary, one of her 1.2 million followers, furiously condemned her. 'Not only Ukrainian lads are dying in Ukraine, but Russian men die too and get captured. 'Just for a minute, imagine what the mum of a deceased guy would feel like when seeing your video. 'Her son is doing God knows what in a sovereign country [Ukraine], and here we see the [Russian] Establishment crashing plates, because they want to and they're having fun. 'Ask this mother, what does she think? 'Have fun, but remove this post. It is inappropriate while the war is still going and it is not clear when this all will be over.' Another angry follower demanded: 'Remove this and don't disgrace yourself.' Some comments suggested she was intoxicated in the late night plate smashing performance. One more said: 'Your country is fighting with Ukraine, children, women and elderly are dying, and you post from Greece. Aren't you ashamed? ' Earlier she had posted from Turkey - also a NATO country, which is supplying killer drones to Ukraine. She was also in a see-through beach dress but Russian users lambasted her. And the Kremlin wife posed in a vanity display for her followers asking: 'Athena? Artemis? Aphrodite? What do you think, which appearance suits me more?' One commenter complained: 'At the moment of the special operation you are travelling to the country that provides military support to its enemy. What's wrong with you?!' Another demanded: 'Can you stop showing off in foreign resorts wearing your couture dresses. 'It's not the right time for this!!! 'The country is fighting, men are dying for values you've publicly voiced. 'Have some shame! And even for a little time remember you have modesty.' A critic highlighted Russia's latest attack: 'Kharkiv is on fire again, with 17 wounded, seven dead in the latest dormitory attack. 'Yet you are here showing yourself off, loving yourself. 'No shame at all, you are all murderers. 'How can you be posting these pictures…. 'The deaths and sufferings of dozens of people are on your hands, and you are pretending not to know it!' One more comment said simply: 'Meanwhile our poor innocent children are dying.' It is unclear if Peskov - one of Russia's most powerful men - is with her in Turkey, where he was once a diplomat. If so, he was not seen on the camera . He is sanctioned in Greece, which is part of the EU, as he is in the UK and US. Most Russians are unable to fly abroad due to sanctions, visa curbs, and flight restrictions on Russian airlines. Another hostile comment told Navka: 'So where is your patriotism? 'Don't you want to deliver humanitarian aid to Luhansk? 'Or perform before the wounded servicemen? 'Can you not be more modest and more humane? So disappointed in your family.'"
2022-08-22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11134585/Household-energy-bills-hit-5-300-year-April.html,"Gas and electricity bills 'to hit £5,300 by April': Octopus Energy boss calls for price cap to be frozen as latest dire forecast suggests charges will nearly DOUBLE in six months - amid warnings inflation will hit 18% in new year","Gas and electricity bills are expected to hit £5,300 when next April's price cap is announced, piling further misery onto Britons as inflation keeps climbing. A forecast by energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight has said bills could be capped at £5,341.08 four months into next year, while the figure for January's cap is expected to be £4,649.72. However, the price cap forecast for October this year is £3,583 for the average household, an 80 per cent rise on the current cap of £1,971. The firm has said it is 'difficult to see how many will cope' this winter, with the final figure for the October price cap to be announced by energy regulator Ofgem on Friday. It comes as the boss of Octopus Energy has called on the price cap to be frozen as its current level and asked for government intervention as there are 'systematic issues' in the energy network. Greg Jackson, who founded the firm which supplies energy to 3.2million customers in the UK, said if the price of beer had risen at the same rate as energy, a pint would cost £25. He made the statement the same day one forecast predicted inflation will breach 18 per cent in the new year - the highest level in nearly half a century - caused by skyrocketing energy bills. Experts at financial firm Citi have said the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation - which indicates the increase in the amount people pay for goods and services - will hit 18.6 per cent in January. Meanwhile, it emerged that homeowners could get paid to turn off power-hungry appliances such as washing machines, tumble dryers and games consoles during peak times under a new scheme. The National Grid is reportedly considering giving money to people who cut back on their energy between 5pm and 8pm in the form of rebates. There are concerns how millions of households in the UK will be able to afford their energy bills this winter - between October and April the average household will pay an equivalent £4,102 per year for their gas and electricity. The first Australian gas shipment to Europe in more than half a decade is set to dock in the south of England on Monday, as gas shortages bite across the continent. The Attalos gas tanker is set to pull into the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent, by the mouth of the Thames during the day. It brings a rare cargo of liquified natural gas (LNG) from Australia to Europe, the first in six years, according to data from Bloomberg. Some of the gas is likely to be used in the UK straight away, but much of it will probably flow to Europe through the pipelines that connect Britain to the continent. There it might be channelled into European gas storage sites and some of it could return to Britain during winter. The UK has some of the highest LNG import capacity in Europe, but it has very little gas storage. Therefore, much of the LNG that comes to Europe this summer will arrive in British ports, but be shipped over to European storage sites. The Attalos departed Malaysia on July 20, according to data from Vessel Finder. Here it had picked up a shipment of gas that had come from Australia. Because of the long distances involved, it is rare for Australian gas to find its way to Europe. Most instead goes to countries in Asia. But the deep gas crisis that Europe is currently facing has catapulted the need for new sources of the fossil fuel. Gas prices have soared manifold in the last year, and the UK price for delivery next month was up another 17% on Monday morning, hitting £5.40p per therm. At the weekend experts predicted that the average household energy bill is likely to soar to more than £6,000 per year from next April. It is a dire warning for struggling households, and Monday's gas price hike will only add to these woes. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Octopus Energy chief executive Greg Jackson said that if the price of beer had risen as much as gas prices, getting a pint would cost £25. 'People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around £5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something,' he said. He added: 'There are systemic issues. 'There are loads of questions of how we pay for this. 'One thing we can't do is be expected to pass those costs on to consumers.' Soaring gas prices are also adding to the bill that will be hitting households to prop up failed energy supplier Bulb. According to new research by Auxilione, an energy consultancy, and shared with the Financial Times this weekend, the cost of bailing out Bulb might cost £4 billion by this spring. Ministers stepped in to rescue Bulb as it was considered too big to fail. Many of its rivals had gone out of business. The price cap, which is now being raised quarterly instead of every six months previously, would see a massive jump from today's £1,971, which is already a record, and much higher than the £1,138 seen last winter. Cornwall Insight said today: 'While the energy price cap rise in April was already an unprecedent increase in domestic consumer energy bills, our final predictions for October are truly concerning,' Cornwall Insight said. 'With the cost of living spiralling and households looking at an energy bill rise of over £1,500 equivalent per year, it is difficult to see how many will cope with the coming winter.' The new warnings will concern ministers as they meet energy bosses later this week. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi is holding a series of meetings this week to follow up on earlier discussions with energy generation companies. Denmark's Orsted, nuclear company Newcleo, and German giant RWE are all meeting the Chancellor this week, and will be asked what they can do to help consumers with rising energy prices. October's price cap forecast breaks down as predicting a ceiling for electricity bills of £1,679.35, whilst the limit for gas will be £1,874.40. In January, the breakdown could be £2,212.32 for electricity and £2,437.39 for gas. In April, the bills could climb further to £2,365.38 for electricity and £2,975.70 for gas. In July next year, the cap is predicted to fall to £4,767.97, with a £2,052.70 limit for electricity and a £2,715.27 ceiling for gas. By October next year, the figure could climb again to £4,807.11, with £2,110.70 for electricity and £2,696.41. Octopus Energy's Greg Jackson says the wholesale price of gas is to blame for the soaring bills. He has laid the blame at the door of Russia, which has throttled supplies to Europe in retaliation for sanctions imposed on it after its invasion of Ukraine. Wholesale gas prices, which have a huge impact on the price of electricity, are nearly 10 times higher than usual - with the current price at £540 per therm. Mr Jackson said if the price of a pint had gone up at the same rate people would be paying double figures for beer. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: 'I think the spate of failures within the 29 companies that went bust last year, that was driven by gas prices roughly doubling. They're currently nine to 11 times higher than usual. 'Look, to put that in perspective, if this was beer, we're talking about the wholesale price being £25 a pint. 'People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around £5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something.' He added Ofgem should 'freeze the price cap roughly where it is' at £1,971 per year. He said: 'There are systemic issues. There are loads of questions of how we pay for this. One thing we can't do is be expected to pass those costs on to consumers.' 'The big thing here is we need more help for customers from the government. 'The reality is customers are being asked to pay the price of gas which is weaponised by Putin, and they shouldn't expect to do that alone.' These surging energy prices will be the key factor in driving inflation to 18.6 per cent in January, according to financial services firm Citi. It says inflation will soar past the 13 per cent which the Bank of England previously said would be the peak in October, instead hitting the highest level since 1975 in the new year. Last month, CPI inflation struck a new 40-year-high of 10.1 per cent. Citi analyst Ben Nabarro has forecast that inflation will jump to 14.8 per cent in October as energy bills spike for UK households. He projected that inflation will accelerate following last week's 25 per cent rise in UK gas prices and 7 per cent rise in UK electricity prices. Citi said it expects the October energy price cap to reach £3,717, slightly higher than previous estimates. A further increase in energy bills in January - with projections the cap will hit £4,567 - will push inflation towards the new peak, it said. It predicted that the price cap will surge to £5,816 in April. The new forecasts predict that inflation will stay in double figures for the next 12 months and will finally dip back below the Bank of England target rate of 2 per cent by April 2024. Mr Nabarro said: 'Even with the economy softening, last week's data re-affirmed the continued risk of pass through from headline inflation into wage and domestic price setting could accelerate. 'With inflation now set to peak substantially higher than the 13 per cent forecast in August, we expect the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will conclude the risks surrounding more persistent inflation have intensified.' Interest rates increased to 1.75 per cent earlier this month but the economist warned that it could need to rise as high as 7% if 'signs of embedded inflation emerge'. It comes after the National Grid, which manages the infrastructure of Britain's gas and electricity networks, is believed to have applied to energy regulator Ofgem for permission to roll out a scheme that would see homeowners paid for turning off appliances. If approved it could see people given a rebate of as much as £6 per kWh to households that cut their usage - with this coming into effect by late October. There are fears the country's energy network could become overstretched in the autumn and winter, with reports earlier this month the government is preparing for blackouts in a worst-case scenario in January. There are fears the further increase in household bills will drive millions of households into fuel poverty as the cost-of-living crisis squeezes people's finances. The Express reports that a source with knowledge of the new scheme had said it was 'not about people sitting in the dark' or deliberately going cold this winter. They added: 'It is about doing the washing at a different time of day that sort of stuff.' A similar scheme was tested by Octopus Energy earlier this year, where it asked customers to turn down their appliances for a period of two hours on eight separate occasions in February and March. The supplier gave those who complied were given 22.7p for every kWh of energy saved. A National Grid ESO spokesman said: 'We are developing a new service that will be available for consumers to benefit from across this winter and will be announcing further information soon.' It comes as people find their wallets increasingly squeezed by price increases in most areas of their lives, with energy bills, food prices and the cost of fuel all rising in recent months. The UK is currently seeing the highest inflation for 40 years, driven by a surge in the wholesale price of gas and oil, something which has seen oil companies return record profits. This has in part been driven by the war in Ukraine, which has seen supplies from Russia and eastern Europe slow to a trickle. This has led energy suppliers having to pay more and they have passed cost this onto consumers after Ofgem, the energy regulator, chose to raise the price cap which limits how much they are allowed to charge. There was outcry when it was announced the price cap would rise by around £700 in April this year and since then the anger has only continued to rise, with predictions it could reach £4,200 in January 2023. Increased energy bills have contributed to rampant inflation, as companies selling goods and providing services try to make up for increased utility bills by increasing their own prices. Retailers have also been hit by the record fuel prices, which has driven up the price of transporting and importing goods, another cost that is being passed onto customers. Earlier this year it was revealed that consumers are wasting nearly £150 a year on average by keeping 'vampire devices' on standby. Research by British Gas found that the country spends £2.2billion a year by keeping microwaves, televisions and games consoles on when they're not being used. These appliances use energy even while on standby - with televisions and set-top boxes from providers such as Sky or Virgin Media the worst offenders, costing £24.61 and £23.10 a year. Other devices with high annual standby costs include microwaves (£16.37), games consoles (£12.17) and computers (£11.22). Other appliances that drain energy in the background include showers (£9.80), washing machines (£4.73) and printers (£3.81). In the coming months the cost of these 'vampire devices' could increase in line with gas and electricity bills, as the price cap gets set to rise to £4,200 in January - more than three times as much as at the beginning of this year. Experts have recommended that homeowners invest in smart plugs to ensure everything is turned off via their mobile phone, or connecting devices to an extension lead that can be switched off overnight. British Gas energy expert Marc Robson said today: 'With household costs on the rise, there are some actions we can take to reduce our energy usage at home which will really help the bank balance and the environment. 'Almost a third of total heating costs in the home are wasted through the roof and the walls and with vampire appliances, this figure is almost half of our electricity bills on wasted energy. 'Just switching some of these off can really help save straight away and those with a smart meter will be able to see the impact of this in real time. Turn it down or turn it off is a great motto for fighting the vampires.' What is the energy price cap? Introduced in 2019, it's a way of limiting what consumers pay to energy firms. Until last April it stood at £1,277, and then it was hiked 54 per cent to £1,971 for the average user. Crucially, the cap does not cover businesses, which face the full brunt of increases. What's happening this week? The next rise will be announced on Friday, and the cap is expected to go up to £3,576. New rules mean it will be updated every three months from October and it is predicted to go up again in January, to £4,799. What's it looking like for April? Industry experts predict it will be more than £6,000 – that means in the space of a year, the average bill is up around five-fold. What is the Government doing about it? The Government has promised £400 discount for every household over the winter, plus an extra £650 for hard-up families and cash for pensioners. But that won't be enough? No. That package was announced when the cap was predicted to be lower – at £2,800, some £700 lower than it will be from October. So what will the new PM do? Liz Truss has so far said little other than suggesting she will axe the green levy, saving bill payers around £150, but Kwasi Kwarteng, likely to be Chancellor in a Truss government, tells the MoS that 'help is on its way'. Rishi Sunak has said he will find up to £10 billion to soften the impact for up to 16 million vulnerable people. Critics say more will be needed, with more targeted help required for those on low incomes. What do they do elsewhere? France has forced state-owned EDF to limit price rises to four per cent. Holland is offering some households €800 (£680) off, plus cutting VAT. Germany is giving €300 (£250) off, plus a further €100 (£85) per child. Italy will give families €200 (£170)."
2022-08-22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11134441/Fears-grow-new-Chernobyl-area-Ukrainian-nuclear-power-plant-hit.html,Fears grow of a new Chernobyl as area surrounding Ukrainian nuclear power plant is hit by Russian shelling despite international disaster warnings,"Russia has shelled cities around Europe's largest nuclear power plant overnight despite international calls for all fighting around the reactors to stop. Nikopol, a city that sits six miles downstream from Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and on the opposite side of the Dnipro River, was hit three times overnight. Four people were injured in the strikes, regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said, including two who had to be taken to hospital. It comes despite calls from the UN to halt fighting around the plant, with President Joe Biden calling European leaders to express his concern at the weekend. Fears about the plant are growing as Volodymyr Zelensky warns Russia could be plotting 'something particularly ugly' to coincide with Ukraine's Independence Day celebrations this week. The date - August 24 - marks the day Ukraine issued its Declaration of Independence from the Soviet Union back in 1991. It also happens to mark six months since Putin began his war on February 24, 2022. Speaking overnight, President Zelensky said: 'We must all be aware that this week Russia could try to do something particularly ugly, something particularly vicious. 'All of Ukraine’s partners have been informed about what the terrorist state can prepare for this week.' Aside from a possible nuclear disaster at the Zaporizhzhia plant, Ukraine has also been warning of missiles massing in Belarus for apparent strikes on the capital Kyiv, and of show trials that could take place in occupied Donbas. Zelensky warned that Russian-backed proxy groups could be preparing to put Ukrainian prisoners of war - including those who surrendered in the city of Mariupol - on trial, and facing the death penalty. If that happens, he said, then it will forever close the door to a diplomatic solution to the fighting. 'This will be the line beyond which no negotiations are possible. There will be no more conversations. Our state has said everything,' he added. Ukraine views the soldiers defending Mariupol as heroes, while Russia has denigrated them as far-right sympathizers, war criminals and Nazis. They are thought to have surrendered following a months-long siege on the understanding they would be traded back to Ukraine as part of a prisoner-swap. But since then, several dozen have burned to death at a prison camp in what Russia says was a Ukrainian strike - but which Kyiv and independent analysts say was a fire started by Russian troops inside a dormitory to cover up torture. It comes as Putin's invasion of Ukraine reaches a near-stalemate, with both sides digging in and attempting to hold their territory while being seemingly unable to carry out further large-scale attacks. British intelligence believes that Russian commanders are increasingly reliant on offering 'direct financial incentives' to get their men to fight while 'some combat units are deemed unreliable for offensive operations'. The UK Ministry of Defence delivered its analysis after a video taken from Luhansk showed men who were likely conscripted into the armed forces there refusing to fight in neighbouring Donetsk. Luhansk has been largely liberated by Russian forces while heavy fighting is still underway in Donetsk, and the men said they were refusing to go to war there despite 'threats and intimidation by senior commanders'. Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been under Russia's control since early in the war, after forces in Crimea broke out and seized swathes of southern Ukraine. The situation around the plant has been calm since then, but tensions have ramped up in recent weeks as Ukraine attempts to push Putin's men back. Blasts have been reported around the plant's six nuclear reactors, which Ukraine says are false flag attacks by Russia while Moscow blames Kyiv for carrying them out. Ukraine further says Russia has stationed military equipment including explosives in and around the plant's reactors to shield them from attacks, and says troops are trying to disconnect the plant from the country's electrical grid. This is dangerous, Kyiv says, because it will leave some of the plant's emergency systems reliant on diesel generators for power. Zelensky has called for international inspectors to be sent to the plant - a cause that is also being championed by the UN, though Russia has so far rebuffed it."
2022-08-22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11134305/Putins-Rasputin-criticised-Vladimir-shortly-daughter-blown-up.html,Ukrainian mother-of-one is identified by Russia as the 'spy' who carried out Dugin car bomb attack as Putin's Rasputin' demands 'more than just revenge' for his daughter's death,"Russia has alleged a Ukrainian 'spy' was behind a car bomb attack on the daughter of Vladimir Putin's Rasputin-esque 'guru' advisor. Putin loyalist Alexander Dugin, 60, accused Ukraine of carrying out the attack on his daughter, Darya Dugina, 29, on Saturday night in a bombing believed to be intended for him. Dugin today demanded 'more than just revenge or retribution' for his daughter's death, with Russia's feared FSB spy agency claiming the SBU - Kyiv's special forces - were behind the murder. The FSB has alleged that a Ukrainian spy called Natalia Vovk, born in 1979, carried out the hit. Vovk is said to have arrived in Russia on July 23 with her daughter Sophia Shaban, 12, before driving a Mini Cooper to spy on Dugina. Ukraine has strongly denied any role in the killing in Moscow, accusing the Kremlin of a 'false flag' operation to blame Kyiv. Dugin said in revenge for the attack, Putin's men must secure a victory against Ukraine in the war. Dugin's comments came after it emerged he had strongly criticized Putin shortly before Dugina was ripped to pieces in the attack. In response to his comments, there had been an online campaign to disparage Dugin in the days before the bombing. The revelations add to the theory that Dugina was killed by Russian special services or other forces loyal to Putin. Putin today expressed his 'sincere condolences' to Dugina's family, writing in a message: 'A vile, cruel crime ended the life of Daria Dugina, a bright, talented person with a real Russian heart - kind, loving, sympathetic and open.' Dugin, a Russian ultranationalist and fascist who has fantasies of rebuilding a vast new empire across Europe and Asia, was taken to hospital after his daughter was killed in the alleged assassination attempt on his life. He was travelling on a highway near the village of Bolshiye Vyazyomy just outside the capital on Saturday but decided to travel in a different car to his daughter, avoiding death only by chance Moscow investigators yesterday confirmed an explosive device was planted under the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado Dugina was driving. Reports say the bomb may have been detonated by remote control. It contained 400 to 800g of TNT, with some experts saying it was the equivalent to 'a simultaneous explosion of six grenades'. Russia's FSB claimed Vovk, believed to be a member of Kyiv's SBU, carried out the attack on Dugina. 'A Mini Cooper was used to spy on the girl [Dugina]. Numbers were changed on it three times - the license plates of the DPR, Kazakhstan and Ukraine were used,' reported SHOT media. The report stated: 'On the day of the crime, Vovk and her daughter arrived at the Tradition festival, and after a controlled explosion on August 21, they left through Pskov to Estonia.' The Russian Investigative Committee is said to be examining this version of events. But others have claimed Dugin and Dugina were targeted by agents loyal to Putin after it emerged that the ultranationalist had strongly criticised the Russian leader shortly before the car bombing. Seven hours before the attack, Dugin had issued a vitriolic online post on Telegram saying that the war in Ukraine was now more important than Putin's presidency. Dugin had claimed the war and 'desperate resistance of the Atlanto-Nazi regime in Kyiv' demands from Russia 'internal transformations'. The tone was strongly critical of Putin. 'Increasing attacks on Crimea, attempts to arrange a nuclear explosion in Zaporizhzhya, declarations of a counter-offensive on Kherson, Zelensky's firm refusal to compromise, the West's persistence in cutting off all ties with Russia – all these are signs that they have decided to stand until the end,' he wrote. 'They can be understood: Russia actually (and this is not propaganda) challenged the West as a civilisation. So we have to go all the way to the end, too. 'The Supreme Commander-in-Chief [Putin] said that we haven't really started anything yet. Now we have to start. Whether you want it or not, we'll have to.' He warned: 'Now the question is not whether the government wants or does not want change. Such changes are simply inevitable - even if you stand to death against their beginning, it will be possible to delay it for no more than six months. And then they will come anyway.' Crucially he warned Putin that the military operation, crushing Ukraine and defeating the West 'is now more important than the power [itself].' 'The mighty forces of history have come into play, the tectonic plates have shifted. Let the old regime bury its dead. A new Russian time is coming. And it's coming irreversibly.' Respected Russian expert Andrei Piontkovsky said the murder of Dugina was professional, indicating that the Russian secret services are behind it. 'It is clear these were Russian special services. Dugin is well-known as an informal spiritual leader of the ultra-fascist party, which has recently been increasingly criticising Putin as 'not being fascist enough',' he said. According to Piontkovsky, Dugin and his accomplices had begun to worry Putin's entourage, just as Putin is trying in every possible way to freeze the conflict. But there are growing fears that the attack was conducted by Putin's own loyal agents amid rumours they want to oust the Russian leader from power. Frustration and anger is mounting over Russia's war in Ukraine, with one of Putin's former commanders even branding the president a 'clown' who has been outplayed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia has furiously claimed that Dugin had received death threats from 'Ukrainian nationalists' before Dugina was ripped to pieces in an attack believed to be intended for her ultranationalist father. But some experts have suggested that it was Putin's FSB spy agency that was behind the attack. Historian Yuri Felshtinsky, author of Blowing up Ukraine, said: 'The blowing up of the car of the famous Russian fascist and ideologist of the Putin regime, Alexander Dugin, was organized, it seems, by the Russian security services.' He added: 'On the latest Russian reports, the bomb was attached to Dugin's car inside his guarded compound. Ukraine focuses on military targets, unlike Russia, and there is no discernable gain in attacking one of Putin's media puppets or allocating scarce operatives inside the Russian Federation to such a goal that is meaningless to the liberation of Ukraine. 'The Kremlin will, however, likely exploit it to make it seem as if Ukraine is stooping to its own tactics of bombing harmless civilians in Ukraine.' Former Russian lawmaker Ilya Ponomarev also claimed that the explosion was the work of an unknown Russian group, the National Republican Party. The existence of the group could not be verified. He said on Russian TV: 'A momentous event took place near Moscow last night. This attack opens a new page in Russian resistance to Putinism. New – but not the last.' The mounting suspicions that Putin's inner circle may have turned against him and carried out the bombing attack comes as Igor Girkin, an intelligence and army veteran who was central to the seizure of Crimea and parts of the Donbas region in 2014, has mocked the Russian ruler's performance in Ukraine. Girkin said that Zelensky was often labelled a 'clown' because he was a TV comedian before being elected president 'But then came the war,' said Girkin. Unlike Putin, Zelensky 'didn't run away' or 'hide in a bunker' during the war, he said. The Ukrainian leader had 'announced, launched and conducted a general mobilisation' of his country's military-age men and 'achieved massive deliveries of weapons from NATO', adding that he had 'fooled the Kremlin'. Russian ultra-right ideologue Alexander Dugin is responsible for shaping the world view of Putin's inner circle. He has called for Ukrainians to be killed and strongly pushed Russia to invade for decades. In his youth, Dugin emerged as a leader of the notorious anti-Semitic Russian nationalist organisation, Pamyat. He founded his own publishing house after the fall of the USSR, going on to win university positions for his writings. Dugin believes that the Russian Orthodox Church was destined to rule as an empire over all of Europe and Asia — uniting all the Russian-speaking peoples into a single state. He laid out his plan for achieving this aim in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics, a text which still has significant influence within Russian elites and has even been used as a textbook by the Russian military. The Russian professor formed the 'Eurasia Party' in 2001, named after the hypothetical state, which also appears in George Orwell's novel 1984. His novel calls for a Russian empire stretching from Dublin to Vladivostok, even calling for parts of China to be conquered. Dugin was dismissed from his position as head of the Department of Sociology of International Relations at Moscow University after arguing for 'people's republics' on the territory of Ukraine. Seven years later, his position would become a reality after the Kremlin annexed the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic out of Ukraine's occupied eastern territories. Dugin called for the annexation of Crimea as far back as 2008, during Russia's war with Georgia. He travelled to the disputed region of South Ossetia, where he was photographed with a rocket launcher. He was also involved with coordinating separatist movements in Ukraine during the 2014 occupation, for which the US sanctioned him. The political scientist claims he also played a key role in reconciling the relationship between Russia and Turkey in 2015 after a Russian warplane was shot down on the Syrian border. Dugin also developed links with far-right and far-left political parties in the European Union, attempting to influence EU policy on Ukraine and Russia. Dugin, a Russian ultranationalist and fascist who has fantasies of rebuilding a vast new empire across Europe and Asia, was taken to hospital after his daughter was killed. He was travelling on a highway near the village of Bolshiye Vyazyomy just outside the capital on Saturday but decided to travel in a different car to his daughter, avoiding death only by chance. Dugin said today of his daughter: 'She was a beautiful Orthodox girl, a patriot, a military correspondent, an expert on the central channels, and a philosopher. 'Her speeches and reporting have always been profound, grounded and restrained. She never called for violence and war. 'She was a rising star at the beginning of her journey.' He went on to blame Kyiv for the attack, which Ukraine has denied, and said Russia must seek more than revenge and win the war. Dugin said: 'The enemies of Russia meanly, surreptitiously killed her... 'But we, and our people cannot be broken even by such unbearable blows. 'They wanted to suppress will with bloody terror against the best and most vulnerable of us. But they will not succeed. Our hearts yearn for more than just revenge or retribution. 'It's too petty, it's not Russian style. We need only our Victory. My daughter laid her life on its altar - so please win! We wanted to raise her to be smart, and to be a hero. Let this (her tragic death) inspire the sons of our Fatherland to the feat even now.' A distressing video from Baza media shows the bereft father - known as Putin's 'Rasputin' - at the scene of the explosion. The car is seen as a fireball as emergency services sirens wail. Reports said she died on the spot. But her father - seen as the brains behind Putin's interference in Ukraine from 2014 - was intended to be in the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado which was hit, but the former professor apparently switched cars at the last minute. The explosion took place as Ms Dugina was returning from a cultural festival she had attended with her father. Dugina was a political analyst and editor of pro-Putin journal United World International and a joint author of a book on Putin's war in Ukraine. Her father is the author of an extreme rightwing view of Russia's role in the world which held an appeal to Putin. The pair were pictured together at a pro-Putin public event shortly before she was slain. Andrey Krasnov, the head of the Russian Horizon social movement and a close friend of the dead woman, said: 'I knew Darya personally. 'This was the father's vehicle. Darya… took his car today, while Alexander went in a different way. He returned, and he was at the site of the tragedy. 'As far as I understand, Alexander or probably both of them were the target.' There is no direct evidence Ukraine or its agents were involved in the Moscow attack, but senior pro-Putin war supporters were quick to demand an all out attack on Kyiv over the alleged assassination. Margarita Simonyan, head of RT 'propaganda' network, posted on Telegram that Ukraine's key 'decision-making centres need to be bombed. She wrote: 'Decision-making centres! Decision-making centres!! Decision-making centres!!!' Her call echoes a demand from hardliners loyal to Putin for him to wreak havoc with massive missile strikes on central Kyiv. Propaganda journalist Maxim Kononenko messaged: 'The address of the main building of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services]: Volodymyrska 33, Kyiv. I'm going to try to sleep now, and when I wake up, I hope to read on the news that it was f****** bombed along with its basements.' There were also warnings that other pro-Putin propagandists could be in danger. Denis Pushilin, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic [DPR], a pro-Moscow puppet state in eastern Ukraine, posted: 'The terrorists of the Ukrainian regime, trying to eliminate Alexander Dugin blew up his daughter...in a car. Blessed memory of Daria, she is a real Russian girl.' He directly blamed 'terrorists of the Ukrainian regime'. Dugina was described as 'a young, smart, beautiful and incredibly talented and sympathetic woman'. While he has no formal role in government, Dugin, a far-Right occult writer who used to edit the staunchly pro-Putin Tsargrad TV network, is regarded as the Russian warmonger's 'guru advisor' and reportedly exerts heavy influence over him. He is credited with giving new life to the term Novorossiya (New Russia), which was adopted by Putin to justify his annexation of Crimea in 2014. Dugin has long dreamed of an expansionist Russia, advocating for Russian rule 'from Dublin to Vladisvostok' in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics. He once said not taking back control of Ukraine would be 'an enormous danger for all of Eurasia' - before he was sanctioned by the US in 2015 after allegedly recruiting fighters for Russia-backed forces in the country. His daughter Darya was also sanctioned by the US Treasury after she became chief editor of the United World International (UWI) website - which was owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is suspected of interfering in the 2016 election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The car bombing attacks comes as Russian forces pressed on with their offensive across several Ukrainian regions on Monday. Zelensky has called for vigilance, saying Moscow could try 'something particularly ugly' ahead of Wednesday, which marks Ukraine's Independence Day and also half a year since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. The Kremlin's propaganda arm has claimed Russian troops were 'poisoned in a chemical attack in Ukraine', prompting fears Moscow will seek to justify the use of chemical weapons in the country. Putin mouthpiece Russia Today reported traces of Botulinum toxin Type B, which is an 'organic poison of artificial origin,' were found in samples taken from soldiers, according to a statement from Russia's defence ministry. But Kyiv hit back, suggesting the soldiers simply could have eaten contaminated meat. Kyiv was accused of 'domestic terrorism' and Russian troops were 'hospitalised with signs of severe poisoning' after being stationed near the village of Vasilyevka in the Zaporozhzhia region on July 31. The statement added: 'The Zelensky regime has authorized terrorist attacks with the use of toxic substances against Russian personnel and civilians.' The Russian Ministry's report did not say how many servicemen had suffered or what their condition was now. It did not say what the 'supporting evidence' was. Botulinum toxin type B is a neurotoxin that can cause botulism when ingested in previously contaminated food products, but it can also have medical uses. Ukraine's interior ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said: 'The department (Russian defence ministry) does not clarify whether the poisoning could have been caused by expired canned meat, in which botulinum toxin is often found. 'Overdue rations have been massively complained about by the occupying forces since the first days of the invasion of Ukraine.' The Russian defence ministry said it was conducting an additional investigation into an incident in which Volodymyr Saldo, the Russian-installed administration in Ukraine's occupied Kherson region, was taken ill. Saldo, a former mayor of the city of Kherson who was appointed to head the region of the same name when Russian troops overran it in early March, fell ill in early August. Russia says its 'special military operation' launched on Feb. 24 is aimed at demilitarizing Ukraine and protecting Russian speakers on what President Vladimir Putin called historical Russian land. Ukraine and Western countries view it as an unprovoked war of conquest aimed at wiping out Ukraine's national identity. Yesterday, it was reported Ukrainian emergency workers were carrying out drills in the event of a meltdown at the Zaporizhizhia plant. The nuclear plant is not located in the Ukrainian-controlled city that shares its name, but is actually 30 miles down the Dnipro River on Russian-occupied territory. Kyiv says Moscow has turned the nuclear plant - Europe's largest - into a military base, stored explosives in and around the reactors, and is preparing a 'false flag' attack. Ukraine's nuclear regulator says the Russian commander in charge of the plant has told his troops they must be ready to blow it up rather than let Ukraine re-take it. Russia has occupied the power plant since the early weeks of Putin's war in Ukraine, after its forces swept out of occupied Crimea and took control of large areas of southern Ukraine. However, warnings about the stability of the plant have stepped up in recent weeks as Russia attempts to disconnect it from Ukraine's main power grid and divert its energy to Crimea - and as a major Ukrainian counter-offensive to re-take the south ratchets up. Guterres was due in Lviv Saturday alongside Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss the situation around the power plant and the possibility of sending in a team of international inspectors to ensure its safety. Erdogan, making his first visit to Ukraine since the war began, was also due to discuss a deal to allow Ukrainian ships carrying vital loads of grain out of the country to avoid a global famine. Zelensky said he had discussed 'all the threats' with French President Emmanuel Macron and word had also been sent to other leaders including Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. 'All of Ukraine's partners have been informed about what the terrorist state can prepare for this week,' Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address, referring to Russia. He also said if Russia went ahead with plans to try captured Ukrainian defenders in Mariupol, then it would have violated international rules and cut itself off from negotiations. 'If this despicable show trial were to go ahead... this would be the line beyond which negotiations are no longer possible,' he said. 'There will be no more conversations. Our state has said everything.' Gennady Gatilov, Moscow's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told the Financial Times that Erdogan had tried to facilitate dialogue between Russia and Ukraine. But Gatilov dismissed speculation about direct talks between Zelensky and Putin, saying there 'was not any practical platform for having this meeting'. In the eastern Bakhmut region, Russian forces inflicted damage from artillery and multiple rocket launcher systems in the areas of Soledar, Zaytseve and Bilogorivka settlements, Ukraine's General Staff said in its daily update on Monday. They continued to focus their efforts on establishing full control over the territories of Luhansk and Donetsk regions, maintaining the captured areas of Kherson and parts of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Mykolaiv regions, the General Staff added. Of particular concern is the shelling of Nikopol. As a result of overnight rocket attacks on Nikopol, Krivyi Rih and Synelnykovsky districts of the Dnipropetrovsk region, four people were injured, regional Governor Valentyn Reznichenko wrote on Telegram on Monday. Over the past 24 hours, two civilians were killed in the Donetsk region in Ukraine's east, the regional administration said. Meanwhile, a kamikaze drone strike hit Russia's Navy headquarters in Crimea and sparked a huge explosion on Saturday, in another suspected Ukrainian raid. Smoke was seen billowing through the air following the attack, which came despite frantic attempts from Putin's forces to shoot down the UAV, as seen in a video where repetitive gunfire is heard. The naval HQ suffered a direct hit, said reports while terrified Russian tourists fled the popular summer peninsula. Governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhaev confirmed the attack, writing on Telegram: 'Unfortunately, [the drone] was not shot down, although they worked on the bay with small arms. [It] went low. There were no victims.' He warned: 'The tenacity of these Ukro-Reich morons is amazing. Everyone, if possible, needs to be home in the next hour.' Russia also suffered incoming attacks on resort Yevpatoriya, north of Sevastopol, where one man was heard saying: 'This is not funny. Let's pack up and get out of here. These are no fireworks.' The air defence system was activated in the Western Crimea, the head of Putin's regime in annexed Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said. 'The target is hit. There is no damage, nor any wounded. Our military clearly, professionally and effectively carry out their tasks. I ask everyone to remain calm and trust only official information.' Initially as the wave of attacks came in, Razvozzhaev said: 'I am at my workplace in the government. As well as many of the townspeople, I heard the clapping in the [city] centre. 'Similar sounds were heard in the Strelka area a little earlier. The air defence was operating in the bay. Naval artillery [operated] in the centre. The same as yesterday. According to preliminary data [they were shooting down drones. Targets were hit. We remain calm. The military is doing their job perfectly. Let's support them.' However, the fear of attacks on Crimea - a new development in the war this month - is palpable among tourists who are fleeing the peninsula. It is the latest in a string of mystery blasts, widely believed to be inflicted by Ukrainian forces, deep in the occupied peninsula. Intelligence officials revealed last night how the strikes have crippled the invaders' military capabilities, while also displaying Kyiv's ability to wreak havoc on Russian logistics. It follows a huge blast at a Russian air base in Crimea last week. Western officials have now revealed the incident knocked out half of Russia's Black Sea naval aviation force. A source said: 'They've lost their flagship Moskva, they lost Snake Island, they lost half of their naval aviation package and their military headquarters was struck. I think we can assume attacks by Ukrainians behind enemy lines.' The explosions were reported at an air base near the village of Belbek, on the south-west coast near Sevastopol, HQ of Vladimir Putin's Black Sea fleet. On the opposite end of the peninsula, the sky has been lit up at Kerch near a huge bridge to Russia, with what Moscow has claimed was fire from its air defences. Inside Russia, two villages have been evacuated after explosions at an ammunition dump in Belgorod province, more than 60 miles from territory controlled by Ukrainian forces. Kyiv also announced a strike on a bridge at the Kakhovska Dam, near Kherson – one of the last routes for Russia to supply its troops on the west bank of the Dnipro River. Such attacks were having a 'significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership', said the official. Russia has denied any aircraft were damaged in what it called an accident at the base, although satellite pictures showed at least eight warplanes completely burned out. The recent explosions have had a major psychological effect on Moscow's leadership, with its invasion of Ukraine at 'near operational standstill', Western officials have said. Three alleged Kremlin spies caught breaking into an arms factory in Albania are accused of spraying chemicals into the faces of the soldiers who stopped them. Two men with Russian passports and one Ukrainian national, most likely from one of the country's Moscow-ruled breakaway republics, tried to enter the weapons factory tonight, the NATO country's ministry of defence explosively claimed. It added: 'The officers who were guarding the plant reacted immediately, but during their efforts to stop the three foreign nationals, two of our soldiers were injured.' Factory director Lorenc Zani confirmed there was a 'physical clash', at which point the defending soldiers were sprayed with the unknown material, Albanian Daily News reported. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said the three individuals are 'suspected of espionage.' Officers arrested the three men, with the Albanian soldiers now hospitalised with illnesses arising from the apparent chemical poisoning. They are said to be in a stable condition. The defense ministry said one of the arrested, identified only as a Russian national MZ, 24 years old, entered the plant's territory and was trying to take photos. Two others, a Russian woman identified as ST, 33, and Ukrainian man FA, 25, were also arrested nearby. Gramsh military base in central Albania is an unusual location for foreign 'tourists' to visit. More than half of the Russian navy's Black Sea Fleet combat jets were put out of action in blasts last week at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea, an area Moscow previously considered secure, according to Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD). The Kremlin is busy seeking to allocate blame for the debacle and President Putin is struggling to hide Ukraine's success from the Russian population. This comes as thousands of Russians fleeing Crimea have streamed into the country, officials said on Friday, and as a fire at a munitions depot near the Russian village of Timonovo has led to the evacuation of two villages in Russia's Belgorod region. Roughly 1,100 people reside in the villages of Timonovo and Soloti, around 15 miles from the Ukrainian border. There were no casualties in the blaze late Thursday, Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. In the attack on the Crimean airbase last week, nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed. The strike demonstrated both the Russians' vulnerability and the Ukrainians' capacity to strike deep behind enemy lines, previously not thought possible. Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility, but President Volodymyr Zelensky alluded to Ukrainian attacks behind enemy lines after the blasts in Crimea, which Russia has blamed on 'sabotage.' On Ukraine's capabilities, one Western official said: 'Ukraine is now consistently achieving kinetic effects deep behind Russia's lines. 'The incidents have been having a material effect on Russia's logistics support, but as importantly, there's a significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership.' They added that the attacks had forced the Black Sea Fleet into a defensive posture and stymied Russia's ability to launch a successful amphibious assault on Odesa on Ukraine's coast, which would cut off much of Ukraine's access to the sea. It comes as the war has entered a phase of 'near operational standstill', with neither side's ground forces having enough concentrated combat power to launch effective offensive actions, the Western official said. Russia is facing an increasingly acute shortage of stocks, even of basic munition, as well as manpower issues as it struggles to reconstitute its forces. 'There was a point when there was constant shelling, there was a real high point, particularly around the battle for the Donbas,' they said. 'We aren't at that high point anymore. 'The whole tempo of the campaign has slowed down, partly because both sides have become more conscious that this is a marathon not a sprint and that expenditure rates and conserving their munitions is important'. At least a dozen civilians were killed by Russian strikes in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv this week, according to the MoD. 'This civilian suffering provides an unusually stark example of Russian cynicism,' the official said, adding that Moscow was not planning to launch an offensive in the area or gain any major operational advantage from the bombardment. Meanwhile, the head of the GCHQ intelligence service said Moscow had failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine. 'So far, President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the West,' Sir Jeremy Fleming wrote in an op-ed in The Economist. 'Just as with its land invasion, Russia's initial online plans appear to have fallen short.' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in televised remarks Friday that statements from Ukrainian officials about striking facilities in Crimea mark 'an escalation of the conflict openly encouraged by the US and its NATO allies.' Ryabkov said Russian officials had warned the US against such actions in phone calls with high-level members of the Biden administration. He added that 'deep and open US involvement' in the war in Ukraine 'effectively puts the US on the brink of becoming a party to the conflict.' 'We don't want an escalation,' Ryabkov said. 'We would like to avoid a situation where the US becomes a party to the conflict, but so far we haven't seen their readiness to deeply and seriously consider those warnings.' In response to the attacks, Putin sacked his Black Sea naval commander earlier this week. The removal of Igor Osipov marked the most prominent sacking of a military official in the nearly six months since Russia launched its war on Ukraine. State-owned RIA said the new chief, Viktor Sokolov, was introduced to members of the fleet's military council in the port of Sevastopol. One source said it was 'normal' that the appointment was not publicly announced at a time when Russia is conducting what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Speculation has followed that Osipov was sacked following the sinking of the Moskva flagship on April 14, but the naval commander appears to have kept his job until recently. Osipov was absent from the Red Square 'victory parade', with Moscow claiming he was 'not in the mood' to appear following the loss of the flagship."
2022-08-22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11134025/Militant-union-makes-supply-chain-chaos-threat-eight-day-strike-causes-mayhem-Felixstowe.html,No time for a party! Dockworkers do the CONGA on the picket line on second day of Felixstowe walkout - amid warning chaos could wreck Christmas plans,"Striking dockworkers were pictured doing the conga on the picket line on the second day of their walkout at the port of Felixstowe today, amid warnings that the chaos could wreck the Christmases of millions. The workers, all of whom are members of the Unite union, were seen laughing as they danced in a line whilst others watched on with gleeful looks on their faces. It came as Unite official Robert Morton said 'the supply chain will be severely disrupted' by an eight-day the eight-day strike at what is the UK's biggest container port. He also warned there 'will be more strikes' if his members' pay demands are not met, as some 1,900 members of Unite at Felixstowe, Suffolk, are expected to walk out in a dispute over pay in the first strike to hit the port since 1989. On Monday, the second day of industrial action at the port, Mr Morton said Unite wants an improved pay offer in line with at 'least the rate of inflation', suggesting a figure between '7 per cent and 12.3 per cent' would be acceptable. Around 1,900 members of Unite have begun eight days of industrial action at the port in Suffolk as hardline union bosses play chicken with the UK economy and potentially the living standards of millions of households in a dispute over pay. Paul Davey, head of corporate affairs at the Port of Felixstowe, stressed there is a '7 per cent plus £500' offer on the table, and has urged Unite to let its members vote on it. Mr Morton told Sky News that he accepts the supply chain will be 'severely disrupted', but added the dispute 'could be over' today if the Port of Felixstowe meets them for 'real-time negotiations'. There are fears that the strikes could trigger widespread disruption to the UK supply chain, interrupt £700million worth of trade and lead to shortages until Christmas. The unprecedented strike at Felixstowe, which handles nearly half of the containerised freight entering the country, is estimated to disrupt hundreds of millions of pounds in trade and trigger goods shortages, including at supermarkets such as Asda, Tesco and Marks & Spencer. Experts have warned that shortages could put pressure on the price of goods and fuel already-rampant inflation - perhaps even sending it through the roof by Christmas - as Britons face the most severe cost of living crisis in 60 years. The strike began yesterday and will end on Monday, August 29. Manufacturers such as Rolls Royce, Jaguar Land Rover and JCB are also likely to be affected due to delays bringing in parts and exporting goods. As a result of the industrial action, Maersk, one of the world's largest container shipping groups, has already diverted three ships to alternative ports in Europe - and fears are growing that Britain could miss out on even more shipping to the Continent. The firm is monitoring a further 11 vessels that could be affected by the strikes. But a port source said the strikes will be an 'inconvenience not a catastrophe', claiming that the supply chain was used to disruption following the pandemic. It is the latest outbreak of industrial action to hit a growing number of sectors of the economy, as rail workers go on strike and teachers and NHS staff threaten mass walkouts unless they can secure higher pay amid the cost of living crisis - a demand which Boris Johnson's Government fears could trigger a wage-inflation spiral that would hurt households even more. Mr Morton told Sky News: 'The supply chain will be severely disrupted, I accept that. 'That's one of the unfortunate parts of things like this. A series of strikes or ballots for industrial action are being announced as workers across the country seek pay rises in the face of the cost-of-living crisis. Criminal barristers in England and Wales voted in favour of indefinite and uninterrupted strike in a row with the Government over jobs and pay, which is due to start on September 5. Friday is set to be the last working day for barristers before they walk out on August 30. It comes as an eight-day strike at the UK's biggest container port by members of Unite at Felixstowe, Suffolk, in a dispute over pay entered its second day. Here are some of the upcoming strikes and potential disputes stretching into the autumn in what the unions have described it as a ""summer of solidarity"" amid worsening industrial relations: - The National Education Union says it will ballot members this autumn over ""the attacks on teacher pay"", adding that ""teachers won't accept the biggest real-terms pay cut in living memory"". - August 18 to 30 August: Strike by Unite and GMB members over pay affecting waste, recycling and street cleaning services in Edinburgh. - August 21: Unite members at the Port of Felixstowe start an eight-day strike over pay. - August 26 and 31: Royal Mail workers in the Communication Workers Union strike over pay. - September 5: Barristers in England and Wales set to start an indefinite strike after voting to step up their current bi-weekly walkouts over Government-set fees for legal aid work. - September 8 and 9: Royal Mail workers in the Communication Workers Union to strike again over pay. - September 11: A strike ballot of Unite's NHS members in England closes. - September 15: A strike ballot of Royal College of Nursing members opens. - September 16: A strike ballot of Unite's NHS members in Wales closes. - September 26: A national strike ballot opens for Public and Commercial Services union members over pay, pensions, jobs and redundancy terms. 'It could be over this afternoon if the employer agreed to meet us for real-time negotiations. 'The last message they [the Port of Felixstowe] gave to us is that ""yes, we will meet you, but no, we will not move our position one inch"". 'That's the wrong approach.' He acknowledged that the union has not put the employer's offer to its members, but added: 'At the beginning of the negotiations we asked them what they wanted and they said, ""we want you to go and negotiate and come back with at least the rate of inflation. If it's anything less than that, then don't bring it back"". 'So when we get further up the negotiations, perhaps we will put an offer to them, but it certainly won't be at 7 per cent.' Workers including crane drivers, machine operators and stevedores are taking action after voting by more than 9-1 in favour of strikes. The union said the strike will have a significant impact on the port, which handles around four million containers a year from 2,000 ships. But a port source previously suggested the strikes will be an 'inconvenience not a catastrophe', claiming the supply chain is now used to disruption following the pandemic. Mr Morton added: 'We've been asking for a minimum of the rate of inflation. The RPI at the moment is at (12.3 per cent). 'However, if we can sit down and thrash this out, there will be a figure between 7 per cent and 12.3 per cent that's acceptable to my membership.' But Mr Davey told Sky News: 'These negotiations have been going on for a long time now. 'The offer that was on the table at the time they voted to strike was 5 per cent plus £500. It's now 7 per cent plus £500. 'We have moved considerably during the course of the negotiations. 'Unite started the negotiations asking for 10 per cent and they ended them asking for 10 per cent. 'There's only one party here that's tried to find a deal. 'What I suggest (Unite) should do is ask their members about this. 'The members this part of Unite represent have not had a chance to vote on the deal.' The port source who downplayed the impact of the strikes claimed the supply chain is now used to disruption following the coronavirus pandemic. 'Disruption is the new normal. The supply chain has moved from ""just in time to just in case"",' they said. Clothing and electronics are understood to be most at risk with warnings of a 'ripple effect across the economy'. Union members voted to strike despite the Port of Felixstowe saying it offered workers an eight per cent pay rise on average with those on lower salaries getting almost 10 per cent. Management claimed Unite did not consult the 1,900 employees on the offer of a pay deal and instead balloted them on the first industrial action to hit the port since 1989. Felixstowe handles nearly half of the containerised freight entering the country and the eight-day strike action could cause vessels to be diverted to ports elsewhere in the UK or Europe. The port is the UK's largest and is favoured due to its close proximity to the main European shipping lanes. It handles more than four million containers every year and operates 17 shipping lanes. But strike action is likely to disrupt £700m worth of trade and will have a direct impact on brands such as Asda, John Lewis, Tesco and Marks & Spencer, The Times reports. Manufacturers such as Rolls Royce, Jaguar Land Rover and JCB are also likely to be affected due to delays bringing in parts and exporting goods. As a result of the industrial action, Maersk, one of the world's largest container shipping groups, has already diverted three ships to alternative ports in Europe. Unite says the owner of the port, which made £61m in profit in 2020, can afford to pay more than the seven per cent pay increase it is currently offering and claims the strike will have a big impact on day-to-day operations. Unite's Mr Morton earlier told the BBC: 'Strike action will cause huge disruption... throughout the UK's supply chain, but this dispute is entirely of the company's own making.' 'Blame [operator] Hutchison Ports for the actions they've taken in putting [this pay rise] on the table.' But the Port of Felixstowe hit back at the union saying it was 'disappointed' that it 'has not taken up our offer' to come back to the table. A spokesman said: 'We recognise these are difficult times but, in a slowing economy, we believe that the company's offer, worth over 8 per cent on average in the current year and closer to 10 per cent for lower paid workers, is fair. 'Unite has failed our employees by not consulting them on the offer and, as a result, they have been put in a position where they will lose pay by going on strike. 'The port regrets the impact this action will have on UK supply chains.' Unite, which represents mainly dock workers, says the proposal is significantly below the current inflation rate, and followed a below inflation increase last year. Felixstowe handles nearly half of the containerised freight entering the country and the action could mean vessels have to be diverted. The Suffolk port's operator, Hutchison Ports, claimed its workers' union, which represents about 500 staff, had accepted their deal. It has put in place a contingency plan for this week but there are fears this action could be just the start. Yesterday Unite general secretary Sharon Graham vowed: 'I will be with our members every step of the way, for as long as it takes.' The militant leader who has held over 450 strikes at a cost of £150m to employers in just one year fired off a series of bellicose tweets. She said the docks 'can well afford to give a decent pay rise and Unite will back workers'. It comes after Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union, called for a general strike if Liz Truss becomes Prime Minister and brings in legislation to halt strikes affecting the country. The Foreign Secretary has pledged to ensure 'militant action' from trade unions can no longer 'paralyse' the economy if she wins the Tory leadership contest. But Mr Lynch told the i newspaper that 'coordinated and synchronised industrial action' would be needed if legislation is brought in. He went on to say the 'very dangerous situation' risks taking the country back to 'Victorian times'. A general strike, which can only be called by the Trades Union Congress (TUC), is when a 'substantial proportion' of workers in multiple sectors refuse to work until their demands, usually around pay and working conditions, are met. Daniel Jones, Consumer Affairs Editor for The Mail On Sunday and Elizabeth Haigh for MailOnline Energy bills for the typical family could reach £6,000 a year by next April, it emerged last night. New figures show the energy price cap, to be updated this week, will hit even higher levels next year. The £6,089 figure, released by energy consultants Auxilione yesterday, represents a five-fold increase on where bills were until April this year, before wholesale prices took off and the price cap began to spiral. Since then, gas prices have spiked to levels never seen before, as Vladimir Putin's regime slashed supplies.Hard-pressed families are struggling with bills and face the prospect of more rises over the winter. On Friday, regulator Ofgem will announce the level of the price cap to run from October – as winter hits and energy use rises. It is expected to increase from £1,971 to a crippling £3,576 a year for typical users. It is feared millions will be unable to pay bills over the next year, unless Ministers increase the current £400 they've promised households as a discount. Those who get into debt could be moved to prepayment meters (PPMs) – where they have to pay in advance for gas and electricity, plus pay extra each time they top up to pay off the money owed. The price cap hike comes with Britain in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis, with inflation hitting ten per cent and interest rates rising. The looming economic crisis has dominated the Tory leadership campaign, with the rival camps under pressure to set out fully their plans to tackle it. Kwasi Kwarteng – who looks set to be the next Chancellor – writes in The Mail on Sunday today that 'help is coming'. And consumer groups and MPs say it will be desperately needed. What is the energy price cap? Introduced in 2019, it's a way of limiting what consumers pay to energy firms. Until last April it stood at £1,277, and then it was hiked 54 per cent to £1,971 for the average user. Crucially, the cap does not cover businesses, which face the full brunt of increases. What's happening this week? The next rise will be announced on Friday, and the cap is expected to go up to £3,576. New rules mean it will be updated every three months from October and it is predicted to go up again in January, to £4,799. What's it looking like for April? Industry experts predict it will be more than £6,000 – that means in the space of a year, the average bill is up around five-fold. What is the Government doing about it? The Government has promised £400 discount for every household over the winter, plus an extra £650 for hard-up families and cash for pensioners. But that won't be enough? No. That package was announced when the cap was predicted to be lower – at £2,800, some £700 lower than it will be from October. So what will the new PM do? Liz Truss has so far said little other than suggesting she will axe the green levy, saving bill payers around £150, but Kwasi Kwarteng, likely to be Chancellor in a Truss government, tells the MoS that 'help is on its way'. Rishi Sunak has said he will find up to £10 billion to soften the impact for up to 16 million vulnerable people. Critics say more will be needed, with more targeted help required for those on low incomes. What do they do elsewhere? France has forced state-owned EDF to limit price rises to four per cent. Holland is offering some households €800 (£680) off, plus cutting VAT. Germany is giving €300 (£250) off, plus a further €100 (£85) per child. Italy will give families €200 (£170). Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at consumer advocates Which? said: 'These projected hikes are eye-watering and millions of households will simply not be able to afford their energy bills without further financial support. 'The Government must take urgent further action. Businesses should also make sure customers are getting a good deal and those facing hardship are protected.' Labour MP Thangam Debbonaire said: 'People are having to make unthinkable choices.' PPMs are controversial because homes are cut off if they run out of money. If a customer has no credit, after an 'emergency' cushion – typically £10 – they receive no energy. In the past, energy firms had to obtain a court order to physically install a PPM – with a slot for a key or card to add top-ups, typically bought at a local newsagent. But it has emerged this week that families with smart meters will be automatically switched to pre-payment plans if they can't pay bills. Critics say smart meters, which are connected via the web to energy company computers, were sold to households as a way to help them cut usage – with no mention of this 'secret functionality'. For those still on old-style analogue meters, energy companies must still apply for warrants to swap them over. Suppliers say in such cases they will aim to put in smart meters – turning the pre-payment functionality on and off – since it is cheaper in the long run. But families can still refuse, under law, a smart meter, in which case an older PPM would be installed. A source at one firm said: 'It's going to be a tough winter for families, and also suppliers trying to deal with households who cannot pay bills. It may surprise people but we don't like high bills – there's a bigger chance customers cannot pay. We want to help them avoid getting in debt, which is why you will see most companies asking for the Government to give more help – and up the £400 discount. 'But we know hundreds of thousands or even millions won't be able to pay, and we have to work out how to get that money back from them. That is where prepayment meters come in.' Ofgem said: 'Protecting consumers is our top priority and installing a prepayment meter should only be a last resort for suppliers.' Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said more elderly people will die as their homes turn cold and some will go hungry in an effort to afford energy. Not only will this cause a 'public health emergency', but it will also pile pressure on the NHS, which is already in the middle of a crisis, the group claims. The letter states: 'We are urging you to take urgent and direct additional action to support those who need it most as we approach winter. 'We have been asked to convene this letter on an issue where NHS leaders, would not usually intervene – but they feel they can no longer stay silent. 'Their starting point is that they are already seeing huge suffering in our local communities because of the cost of living crisis. 'With energy prices set to rise, they fear that many people will face the awful choice of skipping meals to heat their homes or having to put up with living in cold, damp, conditions. 'From a health perspective, this will inevitably lead to more illness up and down the country. 'It will lead to worse health outcomes, including damaging children's life chances, as well as exacerbating health inequalities that have already been widened as a result of the pandemic.' The NHS bosses explained that those who cannot afford to heat their home, buy nutritious food or cook a hot meal will see their health 'quickly deteriorate'. This will cause a rise in the number of annual deaths linked to cold homes – which already stands at 10,000 a year. Millions of homes are likely to be kept very cold as people try to save what little they can on their energy bills. Spiraling gas prices are a result of several factors, and first rose sharply after the end of lockdowns around the world amid the coronavirus pandemic. The sharp rise in demand for gas was followed by a huge rise in costs too. Around the world, but especially within Europe, this was made drastically worse by war in Ukraine. Since then Russian gas supplies into Europe have been severely slashed. It has caused the gas price to spike to levels never seen before. In a sign of how serious the crisis is becoming, new figures released this week showed the UK inflation rate is now at least 10.1 per cent, the first time it has hit double figures since 1982. Families across the UK are struggling to have enough money for food and basic bills, as well as rent - with things only set to get worse. The average food bill is set to increase by £533 this year, a serious concern for many families who are already grappling with the choice between eating and heating this winter. There are fears the winter will not only lead to increased pressure on NHS services which are already reaching crisis-point, but higher levels of homelessness and child poverty too. PM Boris Johnson is coming under increasing pressure as critics blast him for refusing to introduce any more measures to support the public before the winner of the Conservative leadership election is crowned. He has been pictured on two separate holidays in recent weeks, with senior members of the government including the Chancellor also taking breaks away. This has led to backlash, especially online, after research has shown a 10.1 per cent inflation rate, new Ofgem price cap predictions and a risk that 45million people will fall into fuel poverty this winter. Earlier this month, a Downing Street spokesperson said it was 'not for this PM to make fiscal interventions during this period' as he returned to work after his honeymoon. During the last month of his premiership, Mr Johnson is expected to pick up around £13,600 in salary. 'It will be for a future prime minister to decide what physical interventions or whether fiscal interventions are necessary but I would simply note that both candidates have have talked about making further support available,' his spokesman said. Asked if it was fair to say the PM had been 'missing in action, the spokesman said 'no', adding: 'There is a significant amount already being done. On cost of living the prime minister will be speaking to the chancellor to make sure that the support that is coming in later in the year is on track.' Gordon Brown has been amongst leading figures criticising the 'vacuum' at the heart of government over the summer period. Small businesses are struggling too. Pubs and restaurants are particularly badly hit as people stay away in order to save money. One of these venues is a 280-year-old pub in Bath which is under threat of closure. The Faulkland Inn located in Radstock, 10 miles from Bath, first opened its doors when George II was on the throne and Britain was at war with Spain. Now, despite weathering over a dozen recessions, two world wars and the Covid pandemic, the soaring energy bills appear to be a battle too far. The village pub is facing closure with the loss of eight jobs because it can no longer afford to keep the lights on, the Guardian have reported. 'Our gas and energy bills have doubled since April and we're facing annual fuel costs of at least £20,000, which will wipe out our profits,' says the landlord, Andy Machen. 'Until April we needed to make £2,500 over the four days a week we are open in order to break even; now we'd need to make £4,000 and are paying staff out of our personal savings.' The pub is one of hundreds of hospitality venues facing the risk of extinction across the UK because of the soaring cost of fuel. Martin McTague, the national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, has warned that the 'toxic cocktail' of rising taxes, energy costs, inflation and shrinking economic growth means 'action is needed right now'. 'The cost of living crisis can't be solved without addressing the cost of doing business crisis,' he said. Tory MP Sir Robert Goodwill received backlash yesterday after suggesting that people must learn how to cook if they want to keep up with rising bills. The energy price cap, which is set by Ofgem, only limits the profits that energy suppliers can take. It does not protect customers from runaway wholesale energy prices. The consultants forecast that bills will slowly drop in the second half of next year, to £5,486 in July and £5,160 in October 2023. But this will be of little comfort to families who are already struggling."
2022-08-22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11133797/Ukraine-war-Explosions-rock-Donbas-Russian-ammo-dump-goes-flames.html,Explosions rock Donbas as Russian ammo dump goes up in flames in fresh blow to Putin's 'exhausted' forces almost six months after war began,"Explosions lit up the early morning sky over Russian-occupied Donbas this morning as yet another of Putin's ammo dumps went up in flames. Videos captured on the eastern outskirts of the city of Donetsk showed smoke and flames engulfing a set of badly-damaged buildings as the sun came up Monday, with multiple blasts caught on camera. It is just the latest arms depot to go up in flames after blasts at bases across occupied Crimea that Ukraine says has badly-damaged Russia's ability to fight. Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War say Putin's 'exhausted' forces are now struggling to make any ground and believe his invasion will soon ground to a halt. Meanwhile Ukrainian commanders say they are confident in their ability to wear down Russia's army and force it to retreat, as what was supposed to be a days-long 'special military operation' has dragged out into a nearly six-month war. Russian state media has acknowledged the blast in Donetsk and blames Ukraine for carrying it out, but said Kyiv's forces struck 'warehouses' with no mention of a link to the armed forces. Ukraine has not acknowledged being behind the attack, but it follows a pattern of Russian arms dumps, command posts and key transport links being destroyed in order to halt Russia's advance - and perhaps send it into reverse. Those strikes have mainly focused on the south, in areas around the city of Kherson and across occupied Crimea. Three bridges linking Kherson to Russian-occupied territories in the east of Ukraine have been all-but destroyed in recent weeks in what are thought to have been strikes by Kyiv's men using HIMARS. Blasts have also destroyed or damaged three bases in Crimea - two airfields and an ammo dump - and have also severed bridges across the wider Kherson region. These have been blamed on Ukrainian saboteurs working behind Russian lines, because they are out of range of Kyiv's missile forces. Monday's blasts took place hundreds of miles to the east, in Donetsk, where heavy fighting was reported along the frontline at the weekend. Putin's forces made some gains - capturing the town of Dacha to the west of Donetsk and attacking near Avdiivka - but Ukraine's armed forces said other assaults near Izyum, Siversk and Bakhmut were turned back. Analysts for respected US think-tank Institute for the Study of War wrote: 'Russian forces' momentum from territorial gains around Bakhmut and Avdiivka in late July is likely exhausted. 'Russian attacks in eastern Ukraine are likely culminating although very small Russian advances will likely continue. 'The Russian military has shown a continual inability to translate small tactical gains into operational successes, a failing that will likely prevent Russia from making significant territorial advances in the coming months barring major changes.' Putin had been hoping for a quick and largely bloodless invasion when he ordered troops across Ukraine's border on February 24, with the main goal being a precision strike on Kyiv to topple the government and install a puppet regime. But his plans ran into immediate problems when Ukraine put up tougher-than-expected resistance, and convoys heading to Kyiv from Belarus got bogged down. Faced with the prospect of being surrounded and forced to surrender, Russia beat a retreat from Kyiv and instead concentrated its efforts on seizing Donetsk and Luhansk regions - which together make up the Donbas. Their efforts in the east have met with marginally more success, including the capture of Mariupol and most of Luhansk - but have still fallen far short of Putin's aim. Russia is also aiming to hold territory it has captured in southern Ukraine, after a break-out from Crimea early in the war captured swathes of land - including the cities of Kherson, Melitopol, and Berdyansk. Ukraine is now attempting to wear down Russian forces to the point where holding territory becomes impossible, which Kyiv hopes will force a wholesale retreat. That is what lies behind the attacks on bridges, railroads, ammo dumps and command posts, analysts and Ukrainian commanders told the Wall Street Journal at the weekend. Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, a former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, told the paper that Russia's logistics system is 'exhausted' because it was not designed 'to sustain a long conflict outside of Russia'. Unlike most other modern militaries, Russia is heavily reliant on trains to supply the large amounts of ammunition its forces use to bulldoze through enemy lines so its troops can capture the ruins left behind. Cutting rail lines and destroying ammo dumps near the front forces Putin's commanders to rely on long-distance truck convoys to move ammo around, hampering its ability to fight. Maj. Gen. Edward Dorman, the former director of logistics and engineering for U.S. Central Command, added: 'If you can't keep the required inflow of supplies, at some point you have to give ground. 'Wars have been lost because of logistics.' Natalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian military's Southern Command, suggested that vulnerability is at the heart of Kyiv's plans to recapture territory seized since the start of the invasion - and as far back as the last war in 2014. Ukraine will not be able to out-match Russia in terms of raw troops numbers, vehicles or firepower - despite mobilising its population and getting supplies from the West, she conceded. But, by using the weapons and troops it does have to maximum effect, she believes it is possible to defeat the superior enemy. 'There are more of them. They have more weapons. They're more powerful in the air,' Ms. Humeniuk told WSJ. 'So we have to find a way to beat them under these conditions. It's not easy, but it's doable.' President Vladimir Putin on Monday vowed to 'pursue the interests of the motherland' in a speech marking Russia's Flag Day, but avoided any mention of his on-going war in Ukraine. In his video address, he lauded Russia's flag as a symbol of a country that is determined to defend its interests and remain loyal to traditional values. And while the Russian tyrant did not mention his country's six-month-old military operation in Ukraine, he did echo some of the justifications cited for sending in troops. 'The desire to live according to one's will, to choose one's own path and follow it, has become part of the genetic code of our people,' he said. 'We are firm in pursuing in the international arena only those policies that meet the fundamental interests of the motherland.' Putin and other officials have said Russia sent troops into Ukraine as effectively a protective measure against the encroaching West. Putin also said that Russian schools beginning in September will open their school weeks with flag-raising ceremonies and singing of the national anthem."
2022-08-22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11133671/Energy-firms-offer-rebates-homes-cut-use-power-hungry-appliances-peak-times.html,Get paid to turn off your washing machine: Energy firms offer £6-an-hour rebates to homes that cut use of power-hungry appliances during peak times from 5-8pm,"Homeowners could get paid to turn off power-hungry appliances such as washing machines, tumble dryers and games consoles during peak times under a new scheme. The National Grid is reportedly considering giving money to people who cut back on their energy between 5pm and 8pm in the form of rebates. It is understood that the body, which manages the infrastructure of Britain's gas and electricity networks, has applied to energy regulator Ofgem for permission to put the scheme in place. If approved it could see people given a rebate of as much as £6 per kWh to households that cut their usage - with this coming into effect by late October. There are fears the country's energy network could become overstretched in the autumn and winter, with reports earlier this month the government is preparing for blackouts in a worst-case scenario in January. And this comes as energy bills are set to skyrocket further, with predictions that in the winter the price cap will be raised to more than £4,000 a year. The next energy price cap rise will take place on October 1, with the announcement of what it will be moved to set to be made this Friday. There are fears the increase in household bills will drive millions of households into fuel poverty as the cost-of-living crisis squeezes people's finances. The Express reports that a source with knowledge of the new scheme had said it was 'not about people sitting in the dark' or deliberately going cold this winter. They added: 'It is about doing the washing at a different time of day that sort of stuff.' A similar scheme was tested by Octopus Energy earlier this year, where it asked customers to turn down their appliances for a period of two hours on eight separate occasions in February and March. The supplier gave those who complied were given 22.7p for every kWh of energy saved. A National Grid ESO spokesman said: 'We are developing a new service that will be available for consumers to benefit from across this winter and will be announcing further information soon.' It comes as people find their wallets increasingly squeezed by price increases in most areas of their lives, with energy bills, food prices and the cost of fuel all rising in recent months. The UK is currently seeing the highest inflation for 40 years, driven by a surge in the wholesale price of gas and oil, something which has seen oil companies return record profits. This has in part been driven by the war in Ukraine, which has seen supplies from Russia and eastern Europe slow to a trickle. This has led energy suppliers having to pay more and they have passed cost this onto consumers after Ofgem, the energy regulator, chose to raise the price cap which limits how much they are allowed to charge. There was outcry when it was announced the price cap would rise by around £700 in April this year and since then the anger has only continued to rise, with predictions it could reach £4,200 in January 2023. Increased energy bills have contributed to rampant inflation, as companies selling goods and providing services try to make up for increased utility bills by increasing their own prices. Retailers have also been hit by the record fuel prices, which has driven up the price of transporting and importing goods, another cost that is being passed onto customers. Earlier this year it was revealed that consumers are wasting nearly £150 a year on average by keeping 'vampire devices' on standby. Research by British Gas found that the country spends £2.2billion a year by keeping microwaves, televisions and games consoles on when they're not being used. These appliances use energy even while on standby - with televisions and set-top boxes from providers such as Sky or Virgin Media the worst offenders, costing £24.61 and £23.10 a year. Other devices with high annual standby costs include microwaves (£16.37), games consoles (£12.17) and computers (£11.22). Other appliances that drain energy in the background include showers (£9.80), washing machines (£4.73) and printers (£3.81). In the coming months the cost of these 'vampire devices' could increase in line with gas and electricity bills, as the price cap gets set to rise to £4,200 in January - more than three times as much as at the beginning of this year. Experts have recommended that homeowners invest in smart plugs to ensure everything is turned off via their mobile phone, or connecting devices to an extension lead that can be switched off overnight. British Gas energy expert Marc Robson said today: 'With household costs on the rise, there are some actions we can take to reduce our energy usage at home which will really help the bank balance and the environment. 'Almost a third of total heating costs in the home are wasted through the roof and the walls and with vampire appliances, this figure is almost half of our electricity bills on wasted energy. 'Just switching some of these off can really help save straight away and those with a smart meter will be able to see the impact of this in real time. Turn it down or turn it off is a great motto for fighting the vampires.'"
2022-08-22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11133533/Fears-grow-Moscow-daughter-Putins-Rasputin-killed-RUSSIAN-car-bomb.html,Is Kremlin inner circle turning on Vladimir? Fears grow in Moscow that daughter of 'Putin's Rasputin' was killed by RUSSIAN car bomb as even president's former commander says Ukraine have made him look like a 'clown',"Rogue security agents from Russia's feared FSB spy agency are feared to be behind the car bombing attack which killed the daughter of Vladimir Putin's Rasputin-esque 'guru' advisor, amid mounting suspicions the Russian president's inner circle is turning on him. There are growing fears in Moscow that the attack on Putin loyalist Alexander Dugin's daughter, Darya Dugina, on Saturday night was conducted by Putin's own loyal agents amid rumours they want to oust the Russian leader from power. Frustration and anger is mounting over Russia's war in Ukraine, with one of Putin's former commanders even branding the president a 'clown' who has been outplayed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia has furiously claimed that Dugin had received death threats from 'Ukrainian nationalists' before Dugina was ripped to pieces in an attack believed to be intended for her ultranationalist father. But some experts have suggested that it was Putin's FSB spy agency that was behind the attack. Historian Yuri Felshtinsky, author of Blowing up Ukraine, said: 'The blowing up of the car of the famous Russian fascist and ideologist of the Putin regime, Alexander Dugin, was organized, it seems, by the Russian security services.' He added: 'On the latest Russian reports, the bomb was attached to Dugin's car inside his guarded compound. Ukraine focuses on military targets, unlike Russia, and there is no discernable gain in attacking one of Putin's media puppets or allocating scarce operatives inside the Russian Federation to such a goal that is meaningless to the liberation of Ukraine. 'The Kremlin will, however, likely exploit it to make it seem as if Ukraine is stooping to its own tactics of bombing harmless civilians in Ukraine.' Former Russian lawmaker Ilya Ponomarev also claimed that the explosion was the work of an unknown Russian group, the National Republican Party. The existence of the group could not be verified. He said on Russian TV: 'A momentous event took place near Moscow last night. This attack opens a new page in Russian resistance to Putinism. New – but not the last.' The mounting suspicions that Putin's inner circle may have turned against him and carried out the bombing attack comes as Igor Girkin, an intelligence and army veteran who was central to the seizure of Crimea and parts of the Donbas region in 2014, has mocked the Russian ruler's performance in Ukraine. Girkin said that Zelensky was often labelled a 'clown' because he was a TV comedian before being elected president 'But then came the war,' said Girkin. Unlike Putin, Zelensky 'didn't run away' or 'hide in a bunker' during the war, he said. The Ukrainian leader had 'announced, launched and conducted a general mobilisation' of his country's military-age men and 'achieved massive deliveries of weapons from NATO', adding that he had 'fooled the Kremlin'. Dugin, a Russian ultranationalist and fascist who has fantasies of rebuilding a vast new empire across Europe and Asia, was taken to hospital after his daughter, 29, was killed in an alleged assassination attempt on his life. He was travelling on a highway near the village of Bolshiye Vyazyomy just outside the capital on Saturday but decided to travel in a different car to his daughter, avoiding death only by chance Moscow investigators yesterday confirmed an explosive device was planted under the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado Dugina was driving. Russian ultra-right ideologue Alexander Dugin is responsible for shaping the world view of Putin's inner circle. He has called for Ukrainians to be killed and strongly pushed Russia to invade for decades. In his youth, Dugin emerged as a leader of the notorious anti-Semitic Russian nationalist organisation, Pamyat. He founded his own publishing house after the fall of the USSR, going on to win university positions for his writings. Dugin believes that the Russian Orthodox Church was destined to rule as an empire over all of Europe and Asia — uniting all the Russian-speaking peoples into a single state. He laid out his plan for achieving this aim in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics, a text which still has significant influence within Russian elites and has even been used as a textbook by the Russian military. The Russian professor formed the 'Eurasia Party' in 2001, named after the hypothetical state, which also appears in George Orwell's novel 1984. His novel calls for a Russian empire stretching from Dublin to Vladivostok, even calling for parts of China to be conquered. Dugin was dismissed from his position as head of the Department of Sociology of International Relations at Moscow University after arguing for 'people's republics' on the territory of Ukraine. Seven years later, his position would become a reality after the Kremlin annexed the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic out of Ukraine's occupied eastern territories. Dugin called for the annexation of Crimea as far back as 2008, during Russia's war with Georgia. He travelled to the disputed region of South Ossetia, where he was photographed with a rocket launcher. He was also involved with coordinating separatist movements in Ukraine during the 2014 occupation, for which the US sanctioned him. The political scientist claims he also played a key role in reconciling the relationship between Russia and Turkey in 2015 after a Russian warplane was shot down on the Syrian border. Dugin also developed links with far-right and far-left political parties in the European Union, attempting to influence EU policy on Ukraine and Russia. A distressing video from Baza media shows the bereft father - known as Putin's 'Rasputin' - at the scene of the explosion. The car is seen as a fireball as emergency services sirens wail. Reports said she died on the spot. But her father - seen as the brains behind Putin's interference in Ukraine from 2014 - was intended to be in the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado which was hit, but the former professor apparently switched cars at the last minute. The explosion took place as Ms Dugina was returning from a cultural festival she had attended with her father. Dugina was a political analyst and editor of pro-Putin journal United World International and a joint author of a book on Putin's war in Ukraine. Her father is the author of an extreme rightwing view of Russia's role in the world which held an appeal to Putin. The pair were pictured together at a pro-Putin public event shortly before she was slain. Andrey Krasnov, the head of the Russian Horizon social movement and a close friend of the dead woman, said: 'I knew Darya personally. 'This was the father's vehicle. Darya… took his car today, while Alexander went in a different way. He returned, and he was at the site of the tragedy. 'As far as I understand, Alexander or probably both of them were the target.' There is no direct evidence Ukraine or its agents were involved in the Moscow attack, but senior pro-Putin war supporters were quick to demand an all out attack on Kyiv over the alleged assassination. Margarita Simonyan, head of RT 'propaganda' network, posted on Telegram that Ukraine's key 'decision-making centres need to be bombed. She wrote: 'Decision-making centres! Decision-making centres!! Decision-making centres!!!' Her call echoes a demand from hardliners loyal to Putin for him to wreak havoc with massive missile strikes on central Kyiv. Propaganda journalist Maxim Kononenko messaged: 'The address of the main building of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services]: Volodymyrska 33, Kyiv. I'm going to try to sleep now, and when I wake up, I hope to read on the news that it was f****** bombed along with its basements.' There were also warnings that other pro-Putin propagandists could be in danger. Denis Pushilin, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic [DPR], a pro-Moscow puppet state in eastern Ukraine, posted: 'The terrorists of the Ukrainian regime, trying to eliminate Alexander Dugin blew up his daughter...in a car. Blessed memory of Daria, she is a real Russian girl.' He directly blamed 'terrorists of the Ukrainian regime'. Dugina was described as 'a young, smart, beautiful and incredibly talented and sympathetic woman'. While he has no formal role in government, Dugin, a far-Right occult writer who used to edit the staunchly pro-Putin Tsargrad TV network, is regarded as the Russian warmonger's 'guru advisor' and reportedly exerts heavy influence over him. He is credited with giving new life to the term Novorossiya (New Russia), which was adopted by Putin to justify his annexation of Crimea in 2014. Dugin has long dreamed of an expansionist Russia, advocating for Russian rule 'from Dublin to Vladisvostok' in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics. He once said not taking back control of Ukraine would be 'an enormous danger for all of Eurasia' - before he was sanctioned by the US in 2015 after allegedly recruiting fighters for Russia-backed forces in the country. His daughter Darya was also sanctioned by the US Treasury after she became chief editor of the United World International (UWI) website - which was owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is suspected of interfering in the 2016 election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The car bombing attacks comes as Russian forces pressed on with their offensive across several Ukrainian regions on Monday. Zelensky has called for vigilance, saying Moscow could try 'something particularly ugly' ahead of Wednesday, which marks Ukraine's Independence Day and also half a year since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Zelensky said he had discussed 'all the threats' with French President Emmanuel Macron and word had also been sent to other leaders including Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. 'All of Ukraine's partners have been informed about what the terrorist state can prepare for this week,' Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address, referring to Russia. He also said if Russia went ahead with plans to try captured Ukrainian defenders in Mariupol, then it would have violated international rules and cut itself off from negotiations. 'If this despicable show trial were to go ahead... this would be the line beyond which negotiations are no longer possible,' he said. 'There will be no more conversations. Our state has said everything.' Gennady Gatilov, Moscow's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told the Financial Times that Erdogan had tried to facilitate dialogue between Russia and Ukraine. But Gatilov dismissed speculation about direct talks between Zelensky and Putin, saying there 'was not any practical platform for having this meeting'. The Kremlin's propaganda arm has claimed Russian troops were 'poisoned in a chemical attack in Ukraine', prompting fears Moscow will seek to justify the use of chemical weapons in the country. Putin mouthpiece Russia Today reported traces of Botulinum toxin Type B, which is an 'organic poison of artificial origin,' were found in samples taken from soldiers, according to a statement from Russia's defence ministry. But Kyiv hit back, suggesting the soldiers simply could have eaten contaminated meat. Kyiv was accused of 'domestic terrorism' and Russian troops were 'hospitalised with signs of severe poisoning' after being stationed near the village of Vasilyevka in the Zaporozhzhia region on July 31. The statement added: 'The Zelensky regime has authorized terrorist attacks with the use of toxic substances against Russian personnel and civilians.' The Russian Ministry's report did not say how many servicemen had suffered or what their condition was now. It did not say what the 'supporting evidence' was. Botulinum toxin type B is a neurotoxin that can cause botulism when ingested in previously contaminated food products, but it can also have medical uses. Ukraine's interior ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said: 'The department (Russian defence ministry) does not clarify whether the poisoning could have been caused by expired canned meat, in which botulinum toxin is often found. 'Overdue rations have been massively complained about by the occupying forces since the first days of the invasion of Ukraine.' The Russian defence ministry said it was conducting an additional investigation into an incident in which Volodymyr Saldo, the Russian-installed administration in Ukraine's occupied Kherson region, was taken ill. Saldo, a former mayor of the city of Kherson who was appointed to head the region of the same name when Russian troops overran it in early March, fell ill in early August. Russia says its 'special military operation' launched on Feb. 24 is aimed at demilitarizing Ukraine and protecting Russian speakers on what President Vladimir Putin called historical Russian land. Ukraine and Western countries view it as an unprovoked war of conquest aimed at wiping out Ukraine's national identity. Yesterday, it was reported Ukrainian emergency workers were carrying out drills in the event of a meltdown at the Zaporizhizhia plant. The nuclear plant is not located in the Ukrainian-controlled city that shares its name, but is actually 30 miles down the Dnipro River on Russian-occupied territory. Kyiv says Moscow has turned the nuclear plant - Europe's largest - into a military base, stored explosives in and around the reactors, and is preparing a 'false flag' attack. Ukraine's nuclear regulator says the Russian commander in charge of the plant has told his troops they must be ready to blow it up rather than let Ukraine re-take it. Russia has occupied the power plant since the early weeks of Putin's war in Ukraine, after its forces swept out of occupied Crimea and took control of large areas of southern Ukraine. However, warnings about the stability of the plant have stepped up in recent weeks as Russia attempts to disconnect it from Ukraine's main power grid and divert its energy to Crimea - and as a major Ukrainian counter-offensive to re-take the south ratchets up. Guterres was due in Lviv Saturday alongside Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss the situation around the power plant and the possibility of sending in a team of international inspectors to ensure its safety. Erdogan, making his first visit to Ukraine since the war began, was also due to discuss a deal to allow Ukrainian ships carrying vital loads of grain out of the country to avoid a global famine. In the eastern Bakhmut region, Russian forces inflicted damage from artillery and multiple rocket launcher systems in the areas of Soledar, Zaytseve and Bilogorivka settlements, Ukraine's General Staff said in its daily update on Monday. They continued to focus their efforts on establishing full control over the territories of Luhansk and Donetsk regions, maintaining the captured areas of Kherson and parts of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Mykolaiv regions, the General Staff added. Of particular concern is the shelling of Nikopol. As a result of overnight rocket attacks on Nikopol, Krivyi Rih and Synelnykovsky districts of the Dnipropetrovsk region, four people were injured, regional Governor Valentyn Reznichenko wrote on Telegram on Monday. Over the past 24 hours, two civilians were killed in the Donetsk region in Ukraine's east, the regional administration said. Meanwhile, a kamikaze drone strike hit Russia's Navy headquarters in Crimea and sparked a huge explosion on Saturday, in another suspected Ukrainian raid. Smoke was seen billowing through the air following the attack, which came despite frantic attempts from Putin's forces to shoot down the UAV, as seen in a video where repetitive gunfire is heard. The naval HQ suffered a direct hit, said reports while terrified Russian tourists fled the popular summer peninsula. Governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhaev confirmed the attack, writing on Telegram: 'Unfortunately, [the drone] was not shot down, although they worked on the bay with small arms. [It] went low. There were no victims.' He warned: 'The tenacity of these Ukro-Reich morons is amazing. Everyone, if possible, needs to be home in the next hour.' Russia also suffered incoming attacks on resort Yevpatoriya, north of Sevastopol, where one man was heard saying: 'This is not funny. Let's pack up and get out of here. These are no fireworks.' The air defence system was activated in the Western Crimea, the head of Putin's regime in annexed Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said. 'The target is hit. There is no damage, nor any wounded. Our military clearly, professionally and effectively carry out their tasks. I ask everyone to remain calm and trust only official information.' Initially as the wave of attacks came in, Razvozzhaev said: 'I am at my workplace in the government. As well as many of the townspeople, I heard the clapping in the [city] centre. 'Similar sounds were heard in the Strelka area a little earlier. The air defence was operating in the bay. Naval artillery [operated] in the centre. The same as yesterday. According to preliminary data [they were shooting down drones. Targets were hit. We remain calm. The military is doing their job perfectly. Let's support them.' However, the fear of attacks on Crimea - a new development in the war this month - is palpable among tourists who are fleeing the peninsula. It is the latest in a string of mystery blasts, widely believed to be inflicted by Ukrainian forces, deep in the occupied peninsula. Intelligence officials revealed last night how the strikes have crippled the invaders' military capabilities, while also displaying Kyiv's ability to wreak havoc on Russian logistics. It follows a huge blast at a Russian air base in Crimea last week. Western officials have now revealed the incident knocked out half of Russia's Black Sea naval aviation force. A source said: 'They've lost their flagship Moskva, they lost Snake Island, they lost half of their naval aviation package and their military headquarters was struck. I think we can assume attacks by Ukrainians behind enemy lines.' The explosions were reported at an air base near the village of Belbek, on the south-west coast near Sevastopol, HQ of Vladimir Putin's Black Sea fleet. On the opposite end of the peninsula, the sky has been lit up at Kerch near a huge bridge to Russia, with what Moscow has claimed was fire from its air defences. Inside Russia, two villages have been evacuated after explosions at an ammunition dump in Belgorod province, more than 60 miles from territory controlled by Ukrainian forces. Kyiv also announced a strike on a bridge at the Kakhovska Dam, near Kherson – one of the last routes for Russia to supply its troops on the west bank of the Dnipro River. Such attacks were having a 'significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership', said the official. Russia has denied any aircraft were damaged in what it called an accident at the base, although satellite pictures showed at least eight warplanes completely burned out. The recent explosions have had a major psychological effect on Moscow's leadership, with its invasion of Ukraine at 'near operational standstill', Western officials have said. More than half of the Russian navy's Black Sea Fleet combat jets were put out of action in blasts last week at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea, an area Moscow previously considered secure, according to Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD). The Kremlin is busy seeking to allocate blame for the debacle and President Putin is struggling to hide Ukraine's success from the Russian population. This comes as thousands of Russians fleeing Crimea have streamed into the country, officials said on Friday, and as a fire at a munitions depot near the Russian village of Timonovo has led to the evacuation of two villages in Russia's Belgorod region. Roughly 1,100 people reside in the villages of Timonovo and Soloti, around 15 miles from the Ukrainian border. There were no casualties in the blaze late Thursday, Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. In the attack on the Crimean airbase last week, nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed. The strike demonstrated both the Russians' vulnerability and the Ukrainians' capacity to strike deep behind enemy lines, previously not thought possible. Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility, but President Volodymyr Zelensky alluded to Ukrainian attacks behind enemy lines after the blasts in Crimea, which Russia has blamed on 'sabotage.' Three alleged Kremlin spies caught breaking into an arms factory in Albania are accused of spraying chemicals into the faces of the soldiers who stopped them. Two men with Russian passports and one Ukrainian national, most likely from one of the country's Moscow-ruled breakaway republics, tried to enter the weapons factory tonight, the NATO country's ministry of defence explosively claimed. It added: 'The officers who were guarding the plant reacted immediately, but during their efforts to stop the three foreign nationals, two of our soldiers were injured.' Factory director Lorenc Zani confirmed there was a 'physical clash', at which point the defending soldiers were sprayed with the unknown material, Albanian Daily News reported. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said the three individuals are 'suspected of espionage.' Officers arrested the three men, with the Albanian soldiers now hospitalised with illnesses arising from the apparent chemical poisoning. They are said to be in a stable condition. The defense ministry said one of the arrested, identified only as a Russian national MZ, 24 years old, entered the plant's territory and was trying to take photos. Two others, a Russian woman identified as ST, 33, and Ukrainian man FA, 25, were also arrested nearby. Gramsh military base in central Albania is an unusual location for foreign 'tourists' to visit. On Ukraine's capabilities, one Western official said: 'Ukraine is now consistently achieving kinetic effects deep behind Russia's lines. 'The incidents have been having a material effect on Russia's logistics support, but as importantly, there's a significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership.' They added that the attacks had forced the Black Sea Fleet into a defensive posture and stymied Russia's ability to launch a successful amphibious assault on Odesa on Ukraine's coast, which would cut off much of Ukraine's access to the sea. It comes as the war has entered a phase of 'near operational standstill', with neither side's ground forces having enough concentrated combat power to launch effective offensive actions, the Western official said. Russia is facing an increasingly acute shortage of stocks, even of basic munition, as well as manpower issues as it struggles to reconstitute its forces. 'There was a point when there was constant shelling, there was a real high point, particularly around the battle for the Donbas,' they said. 'We aren't at that high point anymore. 'The whole tempo of the campaign has slowed down, partly because both sides have become more conscious that this is a marathon not a sprint and that expenditure rates and conserving their munitions is important'. At least a dozen civilians were killed by Russian strikes in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv this week, according to the MoD. 'This civilian suffering provides an unusually stark example of Russian cynicism,' the official said, adding that Moscow was not planning to launch an offensive in the area or gain any major operational advantage from the bombardment. Meanwhile, the head of the GCHQ intelligence service said Moscow had failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine. 'So far, President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the West,' Sir Jeremy Fleming wrote in an op-ed in The Economist. 'Just as with its land invasion, Russia's initial online plans appear to have fallen short.' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in televised remarks Friday that statements from Ukrainian officials about striking facilities in Crimea mark 'an escalation of the conflict openly encouraged by the US and its NATO allies.' Ryabkov said Russian officials had warned the US against such actions in phone calls with high-level members of the Biden administration. He added that 'deep and open US involvement' in the war in Ukraine 'effectively puts the US on the brink of becoming a party to the conflict.' 'We don't want an escalation,' Ryabkov said. 'We would like to avoid a situation where the US becomes a party to the conflict, but so far we haven't seen their readiness to deeply and seriously consider those warnings.' In response to the attacks, Putin sacked his Black Sea naval commander earlier this week. The removal of Igor Osipov marked the most prominent sacking of a military official in the nearly six months since Russia launched its war on Ukraine. State-owned RIA said the new chief, Viktor Sokolov, was introduced to members of the fleet's military council in the port of Sevastopol. One source said it was 'normal' that the appointment was not publicly announced at a time when Russia is conducting what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Speculation has followed that Osipov was sacked following the sinking of the Moskva flagship on April 14, but the naval commander appears to have kept his job until recently. Osipov was absent from the Red Square 'victory parade', with Moscow claiming he was 'not in the mood' to appear following the loss of the flagship."

The 2GB host said the farm sector's labour crisis would result in less food being planted and higher prices at the supermarket. 'It's the law of supply and demand,' Fordham said on Monday. 'Essentially the issue is this, they don't have enough workers, so they're not going to plant as many crops and less food leads to higher prices.' Fordham claimed 'lazy Aussies' were part of the problem and called for the government to 'weed out the bludgers'. 'We need to shift people off the couch and onto their feet,' Fordham said. 'We still got a chunk of lazy Aussies who'd rather collect a welfare cheque than have a go. We need to weed out the bludgers while looking after the genuine battlers.' The radio host called for an overhaul to Australia's visa system which included a fast-track of worker visas, extending working hours for temporary visa holders and creating a merit-based system for individuals applying for permanent residency. An estimated 172,000 jobs need to be filled across the country to ease product shortages and prevent price hikes at the counter. CEO of Independent Food Distributors Australia Richard Forbes said the estimated number of unfulfilled jobs was the first time the food industry had calculated their collective labour shortage. 'Staff shortages are at a level where it's almost unsustainable for the supply chain to continue to work effectively in order to get consumers all the products they want at the prices they want,' Mr Forbes told The Australian. 'Food and labour shortages have to be a priority of the government in the jobs summit, because people have to eat.' Mr Forbes urged the government to develop a national food strategy to ensure the food supply chain was not disrupted by natural disasters and global events like Covid-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war. In a Workforce Skills Survey, conducted by Business NSW, 93 per cent of businesses in the state revealed they were struggling to find staff. Exacerbating the shortages has been the government's continued doling out of Covid pandemic leave payment. Workers can collect as much as $750 a week for having to isolate due to possible Covid exposure - a scheme which will continue to at least the end of September. NSW Treasurer Matt Kean urged Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to bring in 'tens of thousands' of low-skilled foreign workers to help fill job vacancies. The demand was prompted by a new forecast predicting the state will face a shortfall of 304,000 employees by 2025-26. 'The Commonwealth doesn't need to wait for a jobs summit, it doesn't need to ask the unions for permission, it doesn't need to wait for an October federal budget; it needs to make the call to start stamping passports today,' Mr Kean said. 'I’ve been briefed that there are tens of thousands of skilled workers just waiting to be approved to come to Australia and work.' He added that 'practical solutions' were available to speed up the process including boosting the number of skilled visas or creating a new visa specifically designed for low-skilled jobs. Mr Albanese will address the matter at a jobs summit in Parliament House on September 1 and 2. However, the prime minister has tempered expectations about potential improvements to Australia's skills crisis following his announcement of the upcoming jobs summit. He told Sky News on Sunday that his government had more modest expectations. 'What we are interested in is making sure that we can have improvements in enterprise bargaining, that we can focus there on productivity, and we can focus on ways in which business and unions come together,' Mr Albanese said."
2022-08-22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11132925/Militant-unions-unleash-strikes-Felixstowe-lead-supermarket-shelves.html,"Militant unions closing down docks at UK's biggest container port 'will lead to empty supermarket shelves until CHRISTMAS': Eight-day walkout at Felixstowe 'will cause shortages, disrupt £700m of trade and send inflation through the roof'","Fears are growing that the huge strikes which militant unions have unleashed at Felixstowe - Britain's biggest container port and gateway to global trade - will trigger widespread disruption to the UK supply chain, interrupt £700million worth of trade and lead to shortages until Christmas. Around 1,900 members of Unite have begun eight days of industrial action at the port in Suffolk as hardline union bosses play chicken with the UK economy and potentially the living standards of millions of households in a dispute over pay. The unprecedented strike at Felixstowe, which handles nearly half of the containerised freight entering the country, is estimated to disrupt hundreds of millions of pounds in trade and trigger goods shortages, including at supermarkets such as Asda, Tesco and Marks & Spencer. Experts have warned that shortages could put pressure on the price of goods and fuel already-rampant inflation - perhaps even sending it through the roof by Christmas - as Britons face the most severe cost of living crisis in 60 years. The strike is taking place from yesterday until Monday, August 29. Manufacturers such as Rolls Royce, Jaguar Land Rover and JCB are also likely to be affected due to delays bringing in parts and exporting goods. As a result of the industrial action, Maersk, one of the world's largest container shipping groups, has already diverted three ships to alternative ports in Europe - and fears are growing that Britain could miss out on even more shipping to the Continent. The firm is monitoring a further 11 vessels that could be affected by the strikes. But a port source said the strikes will be an 'inconvenience not a catastrophe', claiming that the supply chain was used to disruption following the pandemic. It is the latest outbreak of industrial action to hit a growing number of sectors of the economy, as rail workers go on strike and teachers and NHS staff threaten mass walkouts unless they can secure higher pay amid the cost of living crisis - a demand which Boris Johnson's Government fears could trigger a wage-inflation spiral that would hurt households even more. Felixstowe handles nearly half of the containerised freight entering the country and the eight-day strike action could cause vessels to be diverted to ports elsewhere in the UK or Europe. The port is the UK's largest and is favoured due to its close proximity to the main European shipping lanes. It handles more than four million containers every year and operates 17 shipping lanes. But strike action is likely to disrupt £700m worth of trade and will have a direct impact on brands such as Asda, John Lewis, Tesco and Marks & Spencer, The Times reports. Manufacturers such as Rolls Royce, Jaguar Land Rover and JCB are also likely to be affected due to delays bringing in parts and exporting goods. As a result of the industrial action, Maersk, one of the world's largest container shipping groups, has already diverted three ships to alternative ports in Europe. He added: 'Disruption is the new normal. The supply chain has moved from 'just in time to just in case'.' Clothing and electronics are understood to be most at risk with warnings of a 'ripple effect across the economy'. Union members voted to strike despite the Port of Felixstowe saying it offered workers an eight per cent pay rise on average with those on lower salaries getting almost 10 per cent. Management claimed Unite did not consult the 1,900 employees on the offer of a pay deal having balloted them on the first industrial action to hit the port since 1989. Workers including crane drivers, machine operators and stevedores manned the picket lines yesterday after voting by more than 9-1 in favour of strikes. Unite says the owner of the port, which made £61m in profit in 2020, can afford to pay more than the seven per cent pay increase it is currently offering and claims the strike will have a big impact on day-to-day operations. Unite's Robert Morton said: 'Strike action will cause huge disruption... throughout the UK's supply chain, but this dispute is entirely of the company's own making.' He told the BBC: 'Blame [operator] Hutchison Ports for the actions they've taken in putting [this pay rise] on the table.' But the Port of Felixstowe hit back at the union saying it was 'disappointed' that it 'has not taken up our offer' to come back to the table. A spokesman said: 'We recognise these are difficult times but, in a slowing economy, we believe that the company's offer, worth over 8 per cent on average in the current year and closer to 10 per cent for lower paid workers, is fair. 'Unite has failed our employees by not consulting them on the offer and, as a result, they have been put in a position where they will lose pay by going on strike. 'The port regrets the impact this action will have on UK supply chains.' Unite, which represents mainly dock workers, says the proposal is significantly below the current inflation rate, and followed a below inflation increase last year. Felixstowe handles nearly half of the containerised freight entering the country and the action could mean vessels have to be diverted. The Suffolk port's operator, Hutchison Ports, claimed its workers' union, which represents about 500 staff, had accepted their deal. It has put in place a contingency plan for this week but there are fears this action could be just the start. Yesterday Unite general secretary Sharon Graham vowed: 'I will be with our members every step of the way, for as long as it takes.' The militant leader who has held over 450 strikes at a cost of £150m to employers in just one year fired off a series of bellicose tweets. She said the docks 'can well afford to give a decent pay rise and Unite will back workers'. It comes after Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union, called for a general strike if Liz Truss becomes Prime Minister and brings in legislation to halt strikes affecting the country. The Foreign Secretary has pledged to ensure 'militant action' from trade unions can no longer 'paralyse' the economy if she wins the Tory leadership contest. But Mr Lynch told the i newspaper that 'coordinated and synchronised industrial action' would be needed if legislation is brought in. He went on to say the 'very dangerous situation' risks taking the country back to 'Victorian times'. A general strike, which can only be called by the Trades Union Congress (TUC), is when a 'substantial proportion' of workers in multiple sectors refuse to work until their demands, usually around pay and working conditions, are met. Daniel Jones, Consumer Affairs Editor for The Mail On Sunday and Elizabeth Haigh for MailOnline Energy bills for the typical family could reach £6,000 a year by next April, it emerged last night. New figures show the energy price cap, to be updated this week, will hit even higher levels next year. The £6,089 figure, released by energy consultants Auxilione yesterday, represents a five-fold increase on where bills were until April this year, before wholesale prices took off and the price cap began to spiral. Since then, gas prices have spiked to levels never seen before, as Vladimir Putin's regime slashed supplies.Hard-pressed families are struggling with bills and face the prospect of more rises over the winter. On Friday, regulator Ofgem will announce the level of the price cap to run from October – as winter hits and energy use rises. It is expected to increase from £1,971 to a crippling £3,576 a year for typical users. It is feared millions will be unable to pay bills over the next year, unless Ministers increase the current £400 they've promised households as a discount. Those who get into debt could be moved to prepayment meters (PPMs) – where they have to pay in advance for gas and electricity, plus pay extra each time they top up to pay off the money owed. The price cap hike comes with Britain in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis, with inflation hitting ten per cent and interest rates rising. The looming economic crisis has dominated the Tory leadership campaign, with the rival camps under pressure to set out fully their plans to tackle it. Kwasi Kwarteng – who looks set to be the next Chancellor – writes in The Mail on Sunday today that 'help is coming'. And consumer groups and MPs say it will be desperately needed. What is the energy price cap? Introduced in 2019, it's a way of limiting what consumers pay to energy firms. Until last April it stood at £1,277, and then it was hiked 54 per cent to £1,971 for the average user. Crucially, the cap does not cover businesses, which face the full brunt of increases. What's happening this week? The next rise will be announced on Friday, and the cap is expected to go up to £3,576. New rules mean it will be updated every three months from October and it is predicted to go up again in January, to £4,799. What's it looking like for April? Industry experts predict it will be more than £6,000 – that means in the space of a year, the average bill is up around five-fold. What is the Government doing about it? The Government has promised £400 discount for every household over the winter, plus an extra £650 for hard-up families and cash for pensioners. But that won't be enough? No. That package was announced when the cap was predicted to be lower – at £2,800, some £700 lower than it will be from October. So what will the new PM do? Liz Truss has so far said little other than suggesting she will axe the green levy, saving bill payers around £150, but Kwasi Kwarteng, likely to be Chancellor in a Truss government, tells the MoS that 'help is on its way'. Rishi Sunak has said he will find up to £10 billion to soften the impact for up to 16 million vulnerable people. Critics say more will be needed, with more targeted help required for those on low incomes. What do they do elsewhere? France has forced state-owned EDF to limit price rises to four per cent. Holland is offering some households €800 (£680) off, plus cutting VAT. Germany is giving €300 (£250) off, plus a further €100 (£85) per child. Italy will give families €200 (£170). Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at consumer advocates Which? said: 'These projected hikes are eye-watering and millions of households will simply not be able to afford their energy bills without further financial support. 'The Government must take urgent further action. Businesses should also make sure customers are getting a good deal and those facing hardship are protected.' Labour MP Thangam Debbonaire said: 'People are having to make unthinkable choices.' PPMs are controversial because homes are cut off if they run out of money. If a customer has no credit, after an 'emergency' cushion – typically £10 – they receive no energy. In the past, energy firms had to obtain a court order to physically install a PPM – with a slot for a key or card to add top-ups, typically bought at a local newsagent. But it has emerged this week that families with smart meters will be automatically switched to pre-payment plans if they can't pay bills. Critics say smart meters, which are connected via the web to energy company computers, were sold to households as a way to help them cut usage – with no mention of this 'secret functionality'. For those still on old-style analogue meters, energy companies must still apply for warrants to swap them over. Suppliers say in such cases they will aim to put in smart meters – turning the pre-payment functionality on and off – since it is cheaper in the long run. But families can still refuse, under law, a smart meter, in which case an older PPM would be installed. A source at one firm said: 'It's going to be a tough winter for families, and also suppliers trying to deal with households who cannot pay bills. It may surprise people but we don't like high bills – there's a bigger chance customers cannot pay. We want to help them avoid getting in debt, which is why you will see most companies asking for the Government to give more help – and up the £400 discount. 'But we know hundreds of thousands or even millions won't be able to pay, and we have to work out how to get that money back from them. That is where prepayment meters come in.' Ofgem said: 'Protecting consumers is our top priority and installing a prepayment meter should only be a last resort for suppliers.' Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said more elderly people will die as their homes turn cold and some will go hungry in an effort to afford energy. Not only will this cause a 'public health emergency', but it will also pile pressure on the NHS, which is already in the middle of a crisis, the group claims. The letter states: 'We are urging you to take urgent and direct additional action to support those who need it most as we approach winter. 'We have been asked to convene this letter on an issue where NHS leaders, would not usually intervene – but they feel they can no longer stay silent. 'Their starting point is that they are already seeing huge suffering in our local communities because of the cost of living crisis. 'With energy prices set to rise, they fear that many people will face the awful choice of skipping meals to heat their homes or having to put up with living in cold, damp, conditions. 'From a health perspective, this will inevitably lead to more illness up and down the country. 'It will lead to worse health outcomes, including damaging children's life chances, as well as exacerbating health inequalities that have already been widened as a result of the pandemic.' The NHS bosses explained that those who cannot afford to heat their home, buy nutritious food or cook a hot meal will see their health 'quickly deteriorate'. This will cause a rise in the number of annual deaths linked to cold homes – which already stands at 10,000 a year. Millions of homes are likely to be kept very cold as people try to save what little they can on their energy bills. Spiraling gas prices are a result of several factors, and first rose sharply after the end of lockdowns around the world amid the coronavirus pandemic. The sharp rise in demand for gas was followed by a huge rise in costs too. Around the world, but especially within Europe, this was made drastically worse by war in Ukraine. Since then Russian gas supplies into Europe have been severely slashed. It has caused the gas price to spike to levels never seen before. In a sign of how serious the crisis is becoming, new figures released this week showed the UK inflation rate is now at least 10.1 per cent, the first time it has hit double figures since 1982. Families across the UK are struggling to have enough money for food and basic bills, as well as rent - with things only set to get worse. The average food bill is set to increase by £533 this year, a serious concern for many families who are already grappling with the choice between eating and heating this winter. There are fears the winter will not only lead to increased pressure on NHS services which are already reaching crisis-point, but higher levels of homelessness and child poverty too. PM Boris Johnson is coming under increasing pressure as critics blast him for refusing to introduce any more measures to support the public before the winner of the Conservative leadership election is crowned. He has been pictured on two separate holidays in recent weeks, with senior members of the government including the Chancellor also taking breaks away. This has led to backlash, especially online, after research has shown a 10.1 per cent inflation rate, new Ofgem price cap predictions and a risk that 45million people will fall into fuel poverty this winter. Earlier this month, a Downing Street spokesperson said it was 'not for this PM to make fiscal interventions during this period' as he returned to work after his honeymoon. During the last month of his premiership, Mr Johnson is expected to pick up around £13,600 in salary. 'It will be for a future prime minister to decide what physical interventions or whether fiscal interventions are necessary but I would simply note that both candidates have have talked about making further support available,' his spokesman said. Asked if it was fair to say the PM had been 'missing in action, the spokesman said 'no', adding: 'There is a significant amount already being done. On cost of living the prime minister will be speaking to the chancellor to make sure that the support that is coming in later in the year is on track.' Gordon Brown has been amongst leading figures criticising the 'vacuum' at the heart of government over the summer period. Small businesses are struggling too. Pubs and restaurants are particularly badly hit as people stay away in order to save money. One of these venues is a 280-year-old pub in Bath which is under threat of closure. The Faulkland Inn located in Radstock, 10 miles from Bath, first opened its doors when George II was on the throne and Britain was at war with Spain. Now, despite weathering over a dozen recessions, two world wars and the Covid pandemic, the soaring energy bills appear to be a battle too far. The village pub is facing closure with the loss of eight jobs because it can no longer afford to keep the lights on, the Guardian have reported. 'Our gas and energy bills have doubled since April and we're facing annual fuel costs of at least £20,000, which will wipe out our profits,' says the landlord, Andy Machen. 'Until April we needed to make £2,500 over the four days a week we are open in order to break even; now we'd need to make £4,000 and are paying staff out of our personal savings.' The pub is one of hundreds of hospitality venues facing the risk of extinction across the UK because of the soaring cost of fuel. Martin McTague, the national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, has warned that the 'toxic cocktail' of rising taxes, energy costs, inflation and shrinking economic growth means 'action is needed right now'. 'The cost of living crisis can't be solved without addressing the cost of doing business crisis,' he said. Tory MP Sir Robert Goodwill received backlash yesterday after suggesting that people must learn how to cook if they want to keep up with rising bills. The energy price cap, which is set by Ofgem, only limits the profits that energy suppliers can take. It does not protect customers from runaway wholesale energy prices. The consultants forecast that bills will slowly drop in the second half of next year, to £5,486 in July and £5,160 in October 2023. But this will be of little comfort to families who are already struggling."
2022-08-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11132369/Russia-claims-Dugin-got-death-threats-Ukrainian-nationalists-daughters-death.html,"Russia claims 'Putin's Rasputin' Alexander Dugin 'received death threats from Ukrainian nationalists' before his daughter, 35, was blown to pieces in 'assassination attempt' as Moscow faces call to take revenge on Kyiv","Russia has furiously claimed that Vladimir Putin's Rasputin-esque 'guru' advisor received death threats from 'Ukrainian nationalists' before his daughter was killed in a huge car bombing in Moscow last night - as the Kremlin faces calls to take revenge on Kyiv. Alexander Dugin, a Russian ultranationalist and fascist who has fantasies of rebuilding a vast new empire across Europe and Asia, was taken to hospital after his daughter Darya Dugina, 35, was ripped to pieces in an alleged assassination attempt on his life. He was travelling on a highway near the village of Bolshiye Vyazyomy just outside the capital but decided to travel in a different car to his daughter, avoiding death only by chance. Moscow investigators today confirmed an explosive device was planted under the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado she was driving. Putin's closest supporters have demanded vengeance on Ukraine over the alleged killing, with Russian media insisting that Dugin and his daughter both received threats from 'Ukrainian nationalists' and the pro-Kremlin puppets of the breakaway regions in the Donbas accusing Kyiv of 'terrorism'. Volodymyr Zelensky's Government strongly denied that it was involved in the explosion, adding: 'We are not a criminal state like the Russian Federation, and even more so not a terrorist state' - a reference to allegations that Putin's forced have been committing war crimes since the invasion. Russian ultra-right ideologue Alexander Dugin is responsible for shaping the world view of Putin's inner circle. He has called for Ukrainians to be killed and strongly pushed Russia to invade for decades. In his youth, Dugin emerged as a leader of the notorious anti-Semitic Russian nationalist organisation, Pamyat. He founded his own publishing house after the fall of the USSR, going on to win university positions for his writings. Dugin believes that the Russian Orthodox Church was destined to rule as an empire over all of Europe and Asia — uniting all the Russian-speaking peoples into a single state. He laid out his plan for achieving this aim in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics, a text which still has significant influence within Russian elites and has even been used as a textbook by the Russian military. The Russian professor formed the 'Eurasia Party' in 2001, named after the hypothetical state, which also appears in George Orwell's novel 1984. His novel calls for a Russian empire stretching from Dublin to Vladivostok, even calling for parts of China to be conquered. Dugin was dismissed from his position as head of the Department of Sociology of International Relations at Moscow University after arguing for 'people's republics' on the territory of Ukraine. Seven years later, his position would become a reality after the Kremlin annexed the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic out of Ukraine's occupied eastern territories. Dugin called for the annexation of Crimea as far back as 2008, during Russia's war with Georgia. He travelled to the disputed region of South Ossetia, where he was photographed with a rocket launcher. He was also involved with coordinating separatist movements in Ukraine during the 2014 occupation, for which the US sanctioned him. The political scientist claims he also played a key role in reconciling the relationship between Russia and Turkey in 2015 after a Russian warplane was shot down on the Syrian border. Dugin also developed links with far-right and far-left political parties in the European Union, attempting to influence EU policy on Ukraine and Russia. In a more menacing turn, some experts even suggest it could have been Moscow itself which attempted to kill Dugin. Historian and author Yuri Felshtinsky said: 'The blowing up of the car of the famous Russian fascist and ideologist of the Putin regime, Alexander Dugin, was organized, it seems, by the Russian security services.' The i reports he added: 'On the latest Russian reports, the bomb was attached to Dugin's car inside his guarded compound. Ukraine focuses on military targets, unlike Russia, and there is no discernable gain in attacking one of Putin's media puppets or allocating scarce operatives inside the Russian Federation to such a goal that is meaningless to the liberation of Ukraine. 'The Kremlin will, however, likely exploit it to make it seem as if Ukraine is stooping to its own tactics of bombing harmless civilians in Ukraine.' A distressing video from Baza media shows the bereft father - known as Putin's 'Rasputin' - at the scene of the explosion. The car is seen as a fireball as emergency services sirens wail. Reports said she died on the spot. But her father - seen as the brains behind Putin's interference in Ukraine from 2014 - was intended to be in the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado which was hit, but the former professor apparently switched cars at the last minute. The explosion took place as Ms Dugina was returning from a cultural festival she had attended with her father. Dugina was a political analyst and editor of pro-Putin journal United World International and a joint author of a book on Putin's war in Ukraine. Her father is the author of an extreme rightwing view of Russia's role in the world which held an appeal to Putin. The pair were pictured together at a pro-Putin public event shortly before she was slain. Andrey Krasnov, the head of the Russian Horizon social movement and a close friend of the dead woman, said: 'I knew Darya personally. 'This was the father's vehicle. Darya… took his car today, while Alexander went in a different way. He returned, and he was at the site of the tragedy. 'As far as I understand, Alexander or probably both of them were the target.' There is no direct evidence Ukraine or its agents were involved in the Moscow attack, but senior pro-Putin war supporters were quick to demand an all out attack on Kyiv over the alleged assassination. Margarita Simonyan, head of RT 'propaganda' network, posted on Telegram: 'Decision-making centres! Decision-making centres!! Decision-making centres!!!' Her call echoes a demand from hardliners loyal to Putin for him to wreak havoc with massive missile strikes on central Kyiv. Propaganda journalist Maxim Kononenko messaged: 'The address of the main building of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services]: Volodymyrska 33, Kyiv. I'm going to try to sleep now, and when I wake up, I hope to read on the news that it was f****** bombed along with its basements.' There were also warnings that other pro-Putin propagandists could be in danger. Denis Pushilin, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic [DPR], a pro-Moscow puppet state in eastern Ukraine, posted: 'The terrorists of the Ukrainian regime, trying to eliminate Alexander Dugin blew up his daughter...in a car. Blessed memory of Daria, she is a real Russian girl.' He directly blamed 'terrorists of the Ukrainian regime'. Dugina was described as 'a young, smart, beautiful and incredibly talented and sympathetic woman'. While he has no formal role in government, Dugin, a far-Right occult writer who used to edit the staunchly pro-Putin Tsargrad TV network, is regarded as the Russian warmonger's 'guru advisor' and reportedly exerts heavy influence over him. He is credited with giving new life to the term Novorossiya (New Russia), which was adopted by Putin to justify his annexation of Crimea in 2014. Dugin has long dreamed of an expansionist Russia, advocating for Russian rule 'from Dublin to Vladisvostok' in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics. He once said not taking back control of Ukraine would be 'an enormous danger for all of Eurasia' - before he was sanctioned by the US in 2015 after allegedly recruiting fighters for Russia-backed forces in the country. His daughter Darya was also sanctioned by the US Treasury after she became chief editor of the United World International (UWI) website - which was owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is suspected of interfering in the 2016 election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. News of Alexander Dugin's attempted assassination comes after a kamikaze drone strike hit Russia's Navy headquarters in Crimea and sparked a huge explosion on Saturday, in another suspected Ukrainian raid. Smoke was seen billowing through the air following the attack, which came despite frantic attempts from Putin's forces to shoot down the UAV, as seen in a video where repetitive gunfire is heard. The naval HQ suffered a direct hit, said reports while terrified Russian tourists fled the popular summer peninsula. The Kremlin's propaganda arm has claimed Russian troops were 'poisoned in a chemical attack in Ukraine', prompting fears Moscow will seek to justify the use of chemical weapons in the country. Putin mouthpiece Russia Today reported traces of Botulinum toxin Type B, which is an 'organic poison of artificial origin,' were found in samples taken from soldiers, according to a statement from Russia's defence ministry. But Kyiv hit back, suggesting the soldiers simply could have eaten contaminated meat. Kyiv was accused of 'domestic terrorism' and Russian troops were 'hospitalised with signs of severe poisoning' after being stationed near the village of Vasilyevka in the Zaporozhzhia region on July 31. The statement added: 'The Zelensky regime has authorized terrorist attacks with the use of toxic substances against Russian personnel and civilians.' The Russian Ministry's report did not say how many servicemen had suffered or what their condition was now. It did not say what the 'supporting evidence' was. Botulinum toxin type B is a neurotoxin that can cause botulism when ingested in previously contaminated food products, but it can also have medical uses. Ukraine's interior ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said: 'The department (Russian defence ministry) does not clarify whether the poisoning could have been caused by expired canned meat, in which botulinum toxin is often found. 'Overdue rations have been massively complained about by the occupying forces since the first days of the invasion of Ukraine.' The Russian defence ministry said it was conducting an additional investigation into an incident in which Volodymyr Saldo, the Russian-installed administration in Ukraine's occupied Kherson region, was taken ill. Saldo, a former mayor of the city of Kherson who was appointed to head the region of the same name when Russian troops overran it in early March, fell ill in early August. Russia says its 'special military operation' launched on Feb. 24 is aimed at demilitarizing Ukraine and protecting Russian speakers on what President Vladimir Putin called historical Russian land. Ukraine and Western countries view it as an unprovoked war of conquest aimed at wiping out Ukraine's national identity. Yesterday, it was reported Ukrainian emergency workers were carrying out drills in the event of a meltdown at the Zaporizhizhia plant. The nuclear plant is not located in the Ukrainian-controlled city that shares its name, but is actually 30 miles down the Dnipro River on Russian-occupied territory. Kyiv says Moscow has turned the nuclear plant - Europe's largest - into a military base, stored explosives in and around the reactors, and is preparing a 'false flag' attack. Ukraine's nuclear regulator says the Russian commander in charge of the plant has told his troops they must be ready to blow it up rather than let Ukraine re-take it. Russia has occupied the power plant since the early weeks of Putin's war in Ukraine, after its forces swept out of occupied Crimea and took control of large areas of southern Ukraine. However, warnings about the stability of the plant have stepped up in recent weeks as Russia attempts to disconnect it from Ukraine's main power grid and divert its energy to Crimea - and as a major Ukrainian counter-offensive to re-take the south ratchets up. Guterres was due in Lviv Saturday alongside Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss the situation around the power plant and the possibility of sending in a team of international inspectors to ensure its safety. Erdogan, making his first visit to Ukraine since the war began, was also due to discuss a deal to allow Ukrainian ships carrying vital loads of grain out of the country to avoid a global famine. Governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhaev confirmed the attack, writing on Telegram: 'Unfortunately, [the drone] was not shot down, although they worked on the bay with small arms. [It] went low. There were no victims.' He warned: 'The tenacity of these Ukro-Reich morons is amazing. Everyone, if possible, needs to be home in the next hour.' Russia also suffered incoming attacks on resort Yevpatoriya, north of Sevastopol, where one man was heard saying: 'This is not funny. Let's pack up and get out of here. These are no fireworks.' The air defence system was activated in the Western Crimea, the head of Putin's regime in annexed Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said. 'The target is hit. There is no damage, nor any wounded. Our military clearly, professionally and effectively carry out their tasks. I ask everyone to remain calm and trust only official information.' Initially as the wave of attacks came in, Razvozzhaev said: 'I am at my workplace in the government. As well as many of the townspeople, I heard the clapping in the [city] centre. 'Similar sounds were heard in the Strelka area a little earlier. The air defence was operating in the bay. Naval artillery [operated] in the centre. The same as yesterday. According to preliminary data [they were shooting down drones. Targets were hit. We remain calm. The military is doing their job perfectly. Let's support them.' However, the fear of attacks on Crimea - a new development in the war this month - is palpable among tourists who are fleeing the peninsula. It is the latest in a string of mystery blasts, widely believed to be inflicted by Ukrainian forces, deep in the occupied peninsula. Intelligence officials revealed last night how the strikes have crippled the invaders' military capabilities, while also displaying Kyiv's ability to wreak havoc on Russian logistics. It follows a huge blast at a Russian air base in Crimea last week. Western officials have now revealed the incident knocked out half of Russia's Black Sea naval aviation force. A source said: 'They've lost their flagship Moskva, they lost Snake Island, they lost half of their naval aviation package and their military headquarters was struck. I think we can assume attacks by Ukrainians behind enemy lines.' The explosions were reported at an air base near the village of Belbek, on the south-west coast near Sevastopol, HQ of Vladimir Putin's Black Sea fleet. On the opposite end of the peninsula, the sky has been lit up at Kerch near a huge bridge to Russia, with what Moscow has claimed was fire from its air defences. Inside Russia, two villages have been evacuated after explosions at an ammunition dump in Belgorod province, more than 60 miles from territory controlled by Ukrainian forces. Kyiv also announced a strike on a bridge at the Kakhovska Dam, near Kherson – one of the last routes for Russia to supply its troops on the west bank of the Dnipro River. Such attacks were having a 'significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership', said the official. Russia has denied any aircraft were damaged in what it called an accident at the base, although satellite pictures showed at least eight warplanes completely burned out. The recent explosions have had a major psychological effect on Moscow's leadership, with its invasion of Ukraine at 'near operational standstill', Western officials have said. More than half of the Russian navy's Black Sea Fleet combat jets were put out of action in blasts last week at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea, an area Moscow previously considered secure, according to Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD). The Kremlin is busy seeking to allocate blame for the debacle and President Putin is struggling to hide Ukraine's success from the Russian population. This comes as thousands of Russians fleeing Crimea have streamed into the country, officials said on Friday, and as a fire at a munitions depot near the Russian village of Timonovo has led to the evacuation of two villages in Russia's Belgorod region. Roughly 1,100 people reside in the villages of Timonovo and Soloti, around 15 miles from the Ukrainian border. There were no casualties in the blaze late Thursday, Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. In the attack on the Crimean airbase last week, nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed. The strike demonstrated both the Russians' vulnerability and the Ukrainians' capacity to strike deep behind enemy lines, previously not thought possible. Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility, but President Volodymyr Zelensky alluded to Ukrainian attacks behind enemy lines after the blasts in Crimea, which Russia has blamed on 'sabotage.' Three alleged Kremlin spies caught breaking into an arms factory in Albania are accused of spraying chemicals into the faces of the soldiers who stopped them. Two men with Russian passports and one Ukrainian national, most likely from one of the country's Moscow-ruled breakaway republics, tried to enter the weapons factory tonight, the NATO country's ministry of defence explosively claimed. It added: 'The officers who were guarding the plant reacted immediately, but during their efforts to stop the three foreign nationals, two of our soldiers were injured.' Factory director Lorenc Zani confirmed there was a 'physical clash', at which point the defending soldiers were sprayed with the unknown material, Albanian Daily News reported. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said the three individuals are 'suspected of espionage.' Officers arrested the three men, with the Albanian soldiers now hospitalised with illnesses arising from the apparent chemical poisoning. They are said to be in a stable condition. The defense ministry said one of the arrested, identified only as a Russian national MZ, 24 years old, entered the plant's territory and was trying to take photos. Two others, a Russian woman identified as ST, 33, and Ukrainian man FA, 25, were also arrested nearby. Gramsh military base in central Albania is an unusual location for foreign 'tourists' to visit. On Ukraine's capabilities, one Western official said: 'Ukraine is now consistently achieving kinetic effects deep behind Russia's lines. 'The incidents have been having a material effect on Russia's logistics support, but as importantly, there's a significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership.' They added that the attacks had forced the Black Sea Fleet into a defensive posture and stymied Russia's ability to launch a successful amphibious assault on Odesa on Ukraine's coast, which would cut off much of Ukraine's access to the sea. It comes as the war has entered a phase of 'near operational standstill', with neither side's ground forces having enough concentrated combat power to launch effective offensive actions, the Western official said. Russia is facing an increasingly acute shortage of stocks, even of basic munition, as well as manpower issues as it struggles to reconstitute its forces. 'There was a point when there was constant shelling, there was a real high point, particularly around the battle for the Donbas,' they said. 'We aren't at that high point anymore. 'The whole tempo of the campaign has slowed down, partly because both sides have become more conscious that this is a marathon not a sprint and that expenditure rates and conserving their munitions is important'. At least a dozen civilians were killed by Russian strikes in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv this week, according to the MoD. 'This civilian suffering provides an unusually stark example of Russian cynicism,' the official said, adding that Moscow was not planning to launch an offensive in the area or gain any major operational advantage from the bombardment. Meanwhile, the head of the GCHQ intelligence service said Moscow had failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine. 'So far, President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the West,' Sir Jeremy Fleming wrote in an op-ed in The Economist. 'Just as with its land invasion, Russia's initial online plans appear to have fallen short.' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in televised remarks Friday that statements from Ukrainian officials about striking facilities in Crimea mark 'an escalation of the conflict openly encouraged by the US and its NATO allies.' Ryabkov said Russian officials had warned the US against such actions in phone calls with high-level members of the Biden administration. He added that 'deep and open US involvement' in the war in Ukraine 'effectively puts the US on the brink of becoming a party to the conflict.' 'We don't want an escalation,' Ryabkov said. 'We would like to avoid a situation where the US becomes a party to the conflict, but so far we haven't seen their readiness to deeply and seriously consider those warnings.' In response to the attacks, Putin sacked his Black Sea naval commander earlier this week. The removal of Igor Osipov marked the most prominent sacking of a military official in the nearly six months since Russia launched its war on Ukraine. State-owned RIA said the new chief, Viktor Sokolov, was introduced to members of the fleet's military council in the port of Sevastopol. One source said it was 'normal' that the appointment was not publicly announced at a time when Russia is conducting what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Speculation has followed that Osipov was sacked following the sinking of the Moskva flagship on April 14, but the naval commander appears to have kept his job until recently. Osipov was absent from the Red Square 'victory parade', with Moscow claiming he was 'not in the mood' to appear following the loss of the flagship."

How PM soaked up the sun shirtless on private island hopper during Greek holiday with Carrie before returning to UK","A topless Boris Johnson showed off his body as he soaked up the sun on a private island hopper with his wife Carrie during their holiday in Greece. The ousted Prime Minister, 58, and his former Tory aide wife, 34, were pictured getting off the luxury boat on the island Evia in the Mediterranean as they enjoyed a second summer holiday - after their much-delayed honeymoon in the remote mountains of Slovenia. Mr Johnson and Carrie, who sported a t-shirt and shorts and a red swimsuit respectively, relaxed on the boat for around five hours and read, according to locals. One even joked that six Greek men had to help the PM as he struggled getting off the boat, telling The Sun: 'They looked so relaxed. They were laughing and joking. He read his book and she spent the time sunbathing. They got on the boat at 3.30pm and returned at 8.30pm, so they had a great time. 'He needed help stepping off the boat when it docked late evening, so six Greek men came to his rescue.' Downing Street today confirmed Mr Johnson has returned to the UK and is expected to fully resume work in No 10 again from tomorrow. Upon returning from his holiday today, he reiterated Britain's support for Ukraine against Vladimir Putin's Russia in a phone call with US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The leaders today discussed co-operation on international security, including the risk of the fighting around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant occupied by Vladimir Putin's troops. They welcomed the Russian president's agreement to allow the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit the site amid concerns over its safety. A No 10 statement said: 'They stressed the importance of ensuring the safety and security of nuclear installations and welcomed recent discussions on enabling an IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia facility.' Efforts to prevent prevent nuclear proliferation in Iran were also discussed. The No 10 statement continued: 'The Prime Minister welcomed the opportunity to speak, and the leaders agreed their teams would continue working closely together in the coming weeks.' He and Carrie said farewell to their Greek holiday with a slap up dinner at a restaurant famous for its spinach and cheese pies. The couple enjoyed a delicious meal with pals - including former No10 adviser Henry Newman - just hours before he left to return to Britain after his week-long break. Sitting at an outdoor table as they enjoyed the balmy summer evening Mr Johnson and the group tucked into a menu of traditional local delicacies including its legendary spinach and cheese pies. Olympia Banou, owner of Honi at Karystos, on the island of Evia, told MailOnline: 'Apparently he saw us on TripAdvisor and the friends he was with also recommended my restaurant. We are a traditional, small family place and we use local produce from our farm. 'We make fantastic pies and everyone knows that and they also had pasta and lamb chops. It was a simple dinner with some rose wine and pomegranate liqueur to finish with. 'He really enjoyed it and said it was one of the best meals he had eaten while on holiday here. He said he had been doing a lot of swimming while he was here and joked he would have to keep it up when he went back as he had eaten so well.' Mr Johnson arrived in Karystos last weekend and has been spotted eating out at several restaurants in the area and even left a generous 50 Euro tip at one, as MailOnline revealed earlier this week. Mrs Banou added: 'The party split the bill and it wouldn't be very nice of me to say how much each paid but they did leave a tip and the staff were very happy. 'He seemed a very nice man and his wife was lovely, he was very friendly and he was happy to talk to the staff and to other customers. He even agreed to pose for a picture with me. 'The group was here for about two hours before they left and he told me he was travelling back to Britain on Saturday as he had to be in work on Monday. He said he'd had a fantastic time and would be back again as soon as he could.' It came just days after the couple enjoyed a belated honeymoon trip at Vila Planinka in Slovenia. The resort, situated in a valley near the village of Jezersko, is 30 minutes from the capital Ljubljana and promised a 'soothing balance of energies' and where guests can also dine on bear prosciutto. But Asda chairman and Tory peer Lord Rose slammed the timing of the trip amid soaring inflation and the prospect of energy prices shooting up again. He criticised a 'horrifying' absence of fresh support, adding: 'The captain of the ship is on shore leave - nobody is in charge at the moment.' Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said Mr Johnson had 'abdicated his responsibility and bailed on the country' in his final weeks in No 10 ahead of his replacement, either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak. The Prime Minister, who will officially stand down on September 5, is now looking ahead to his future career. Earlier this week removal vans were seen outside Downing Street, with aides confirming that work was ongoing for the 'transition' to the next PM. Mr Johnson is allowed to take away any furnishings he paid for himself as part of a controversial revamp of his official residence and he and Carrie are said to be house hunting in the south east London suburb of Dulwich. He is believed to be in negotiations with leading speaking agencies in both Washington and London. The Washington Speakers Bureau signed up his predecessor Theresa May, while the London Speaker Bureau has former Chancellor Philip Hammond on its books. Twice-divorced Mr Johnson has admitted money struggles in the past and saw his income slashed on entering No 10. He earned £155,376 a year as Prime Minister – but has made more then £4million from outside interests in the past 14 years, according to the FT. Mrs May has earned more than £2.1million on the US lecture circuit but Mr Johnson is set to earn a great deal more."
2022-08-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11131965/Dennis-Rodman-says-hes-going-Russia-release-Brittney-Griner.html,NBA champion and Kim Jong Un pal Dennis Rodman says he 'got permission' to visit Russia and negotiate release of imprisoned WNBA star Brittney Griner,"NBA legend Dennis Rodman plans to travel to Russia to seek the release of the WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was sentenced to nine years in prison for drug possession. Rodman said he got permission to travel to the war-fueled country, and hopes to book his trip soon to see Russian President Vladimir Putin who he says he knows 'too well.' 'I got permission to go to Russia to help that girl,' Rodman told NBC News. 'I'm trying to go this week.' Rodman is notorious for befriending controversial world leaders, and even noted Russian President Vladimir Putin as being 'cool' after he returned from a 2014 venture to Moscow. Aside from Putin, the former NBA star considers North Korea leader Kim Jong Un to be a good friend. Rodman has taken several trips to the Communist country and even said he helped in the 2014 release of Christian missionary Kenneth Bae, who was charged in the country for attempting to overturn the government. Griner is currently locked in prison in Russia for bringing two vape cartridges containing cannabis oil into the country in February. Cannabis in Russia is illegal. The WNBA star was sentenced to nine years behind bars on August 4 as the White House scrambles to swap her out with Viktor Bout, who has been in prison in the US since 2010. Bout was a convicted Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year prison sentence on charges that he conspired to sell tens of millions of dollars in weapons to Colombia's former FARC guerrilla army. At the time of his conviction in 2008, the group was classified by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization, though that designation was lifted last year. Putin originally held off on the swap, citing the ongoing legal trial, but is now ready to negotiate the exchange for Bout. The deal would bring Griner home but would also let free one of the worst war criminals the US has ever locked up. It's unclear how Rodman plans to negotiate Griner's release, but will travel to the country despite the State Department travel advisory urging people to not travel to Russia as the war with Ukraine persists. If Rodman is successful, it will be his second time contributing to a prisoner swap. In 2014, Rodman claimed that he was behind the release of various US citizens detained in North Korea, including Bae. The former basketball star wrote to his 'friend for life' Kim Jong-Un and begged him for mercy in the case of Bae - who had been imprisoned in the hermit kingdom for six months. Bae was let go along with Matthew Miller who was serving a sex-year jail term on charges of espionage, after he allegedly ripped his tourist visa at Pyongyang's airport and demanded asylum. In a letter sent to the communist dictator earlier this year that was shown to TMZ, Rodman wrote: '[I] would be eternally grateful for his safe return and make a big step towards bridging the gap between our two nations.' He also compliments the leader's progress, such as the construction of new water parks and airport terminals, in his 'beautiful country' and thanked him for a special stay. The note continues: 'I understand the crimes he committed and ask you my dear friend, the highly respected Marshall Kim Jong Un for his release to show my country how loving and compassionate you and the DPRK can be.' Rodman told the site he sent the letter and January and believes his trips to the communist country influenced the developments. He visited the country three times in 2013, but previously said he had been threatened with sanctions by Washington if he continued his activities in the country."
2022-08-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11131975/Ailing-cornered-Putin-driven-extremes-using-nuclear-weapons-admitting-defeat.html,"'Ailing' Putin is flailing over his war strategy and torn between using nuclear weapons or admitting defeat and handing back invaded Ukrainian regions, claims Telegram channel","An ailing Vladimir Putin is flailing over his war strategy, torn between using nuclear weapons and accepting defeat and handing back Ukrainian regions invaded by his forces, a Telegram channel claims. Amid fresh concerns over his health, his security officials have bluntly told the warmonger president that he has run out of 'good' options. This comes as the death toll in the Russian armed forces plus separatist fighters and pro-Putin private armies has reached almost 65,000, said General SVR Telegram channel, an opposition source offering 'insider' information which the Kremlin is 'seeking to shut down'. There is 'despondency' among Putin’s senior entourage that he had privately raised the 'extreme' option with 'top aides” of a 'goodwill' to cede newly invaded territories to Ukraine. At the same time, there is a warning from his defence chiefs that a Ukrainian military counter strike is likely to be 'effective'. Such an outcome would threaten his presidency, being seen as a humbling, crushing defeat. But Putin’s leading officials are also said to be braced for a 'sharp deterioration' in his medical condition. 'With a high degree of probability, we can say that soon the president will not be able to personally hold meetings and participate in large events,' said the channel, which has long asserted the he suffers from cancer and other serious medical problems. Putin’s absence will be explained as due to a return of the Covid pandemic, it was alleged. Body doubles 'have also recently been used quite often', it alleged without specifying where or when. In recent meetings with his security and defence aides, claimed General SVR, 'various options were discussed, from the possibility of mobilising and using tactical nuclear weapons, to opening a second front in a third country, and, finally, to ""gestures of good will"" with the return of the occupied territories of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv regions to Ukraine.' A second front might involve an invasion of northern Kazakhstan, a region with many ethnic Russians, as a distraction to hide the ignominy of his failings in Ukraine. He has so far rejected a full mobilisation, another option, amid fears it would trigger mass mutiny. But an ‘extreme’ course was also discussed involving the return of land in the Luhansk and Donetsk 'people’s republic's' won during the almost six-month war, in addition to land in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv, stated the channel. The discussion of the ‘extreme’ options in the presence and at the initiative of the President led many in his war team to 'despondency'. 'Without exception, all of Putin's interlocutors realised that the president simply does not have ‘good’ options for solving urgent and upcoming problems at the front.' Such a move would amount to the 'beginning of the end' for his rule and the regime he heads. The report also argued that military chiefs blame Putin for tactics which have led them to such heavy loses. 'Almost the entire military leadership of Russia lays the blame for both the unsuccessful start and, in general, the course of the military operation, and the huge losses of manpower and weapons, precisely on President Vladimir Putin,' said the channel. Yet the military leadership 'has no doubt that they will be made guilty for all the failures and problems at the front'. Close Putin crony, hardliner Nikolai Patrushev, his leading security advisor and a key proponent of the war, urged Putin 'to find a way out of the current situation'. Failure to do so would cause deeper problems if there was a successful counteroffensive by Ukraine. The channel said Putin had been told the Russian death toll from his war now tops 60,400, including 48,745 from the regular forces, 2,366 from the country’s national guard, and 13,494 from Wagner and other private military companies. Among the dead are at least a dozen generals and more than 100 colonels and lieutenant colonels. Among the latest to perish was Lt-Col Ruslan Mukhametkhanov, 43, a father of two girls. General SVR said the Kremlin is pressuring messenger outlet Telegram to axe it after a string of revelations. The channel has claimed that Putin is suffering from serious illnesses including cancer, Parkinson’s disease and a schizoaffective disorder. This channel is reportedly authored by an exiled Kremlin lieutenant-general, who is known by the alias Viktor Mikhailovich. It claims insider knowledge despite being hostile to Putin. Will Stewart for MailOnline This is the moment Putin's aide Alexander Dugin watches the flaming wreckage of a car bomb meant for him that killed his daughter instead when the two switched vehicles last minute. Dugin, a notorious fascist and Russian ultranationalist, is in hospital after being filmed at the scene of the explosion that killed his 35 year old daughter, Darya Dugina. He was travelling on a highway near the village of Bolshiye Vyazyomy just outside the capital on Saturday night — but decided to travel in a different car to his daughter, avoiding death only by chance. Vladimir Putin’s closest supporters have demanded vengeance on Ukraine over the ‘assassination’ of Dugina, daughter of the Russian leader’s spiritual guru, who died in his stead. A distressing video from Baza media shows the bereft father - known as Putin’s ‘Rasputin’ - at the scene of the explosion. The car is seen as a fireball as emergency services sirens wail. Reports said she died on the spot. But her father - seen as the brains behind Putin’s interference in Ukraine from 2014 - was intended to be in the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado which was hit, but the former professor apparently switched cars at the last minute. The explosion took place as Ms Dugina was returning from a cultural festival she had attended with her father. Dugina was a political analyst and editor of pro-Putin journal United World International and a joint author of a book on Putin's war in Ukraine. Her father is the author of an extreme rightwing view of Russia’s role in the world which held an appeal to Putin. The pair were pictured together at a pro-Putin public event shortly before she was slain. Andrey Krasnov, the head of the Russian Horizon social movement and a close friend of the dead woman, said: 'I knew Darya personally. 'This was the father’s vehicle. Darya… took his car today, while Alexander went in a different way. He returned, and he was at the site of the tragedy. 'As far as I understand, Alexander or probably both of them were the target.' Russian ultra-right ideologue Alexander Dugin is responsible for shaping the world view of Putin's inner circle. He has called for Ukrainians to be killed and strongly pushed Russia to invade for decades. In his youth, Dugin emerged as a leader of the notorious anti-Semitic Russian nationalist organisation, Pamyat. He founded his own publishing house after the fall of the USSR, going on to win university positions for his writings. Dugin believes that the Russian Orthodox Church was destined to rule as an empire over all of Europe and Asia — uniting all the Russian-speaking peoples into a single state. He laid out his plan for achieving this aim in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics, a text which still has significant influence within Russian elites and has even been used as a textbook by the Russian military. The Russian professor formed the 'Eurasia Party' in 2001, named after the hypothetical state, which also appears in George Orwell's novel 1984. His novel calls for a Russian empire stretching from Dublin to Vladivostok, even calling for parts of China to be conquered. Dugin was dismissed from his position as head of the Department of Sociology of International Relations at Moscow University after arguing for 'people's republics' on the territory of Ukraine. Seven years later, his position would become a reality after the Kremlin annexed the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic out of Ukraine's occupied eastern territories. Dugin called for the annexation of Crimea as far back as 2008, during Russia's war with Georgia. He travelled to the disputed region of South Ossetia, where he was photographed with a rocket launcher. He was also involved with coordinating separatist movements in Ukraine during the 2014 occupation, for which the US sanctioned him. The political scientist claims he also played a key role in reconciling the relationship between Russia and Turkey in 2015 after a Russian warplane was shot down on the Syrian border. Dugin also developed links with far-right and far-left political parties in the European Union, attempting to influence EU policy on Ukraine and Russia. There is no direct evidence Ukraine or its agents were involved in the Moscow attack, but senior pro-Putin war supporters were quick to demand an all out attack on Kyiv over the alleged assassination. Margarita Simonyan, head of RT ‘propaganda’ network, posted on Telegram: 'Decision-making centres! Decision-making centres!! Decision-making centres!!!' Her call echoes a demand from hardliners loyal to Putin for him to wreak havoc with massive missile strikes on central Kyiv. Propaganda journalist Maxim Kononenko messaged: 'The address of the main building of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services]: Volodymyrska 33, Kyiv. I'm going to try to sleep now, and when I wake up, I hope to read on the news that it was f****** bombed along with its basements.' There were also warnings that other pro-Putin propagandists could be in danger. Denis Pushilin, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic [DPR], a pro-Moscow puppet state in eastern Ukraine, posted: 'The terrorists of the Ukrainian regime, trying to eliminate Alexander Dugin blew up his daughter...in a car. Blessed memory of Daria, she is a real Russian girl.' He directly blamed 'terrorists of the Ukrainian regime'. Dugina was described as 'a young, smart, beautiful and incredibly talented and sympathetic woman'. While he has no formal role in government, Dugin, a far-Right occult writer who used to edit the staunchly pro-Putin Tsargrad TV network, is regarded as the Russian warmonger's 'guru advisor' and reportedly exerts heavy influence over him. He is credited with giving new life to the term Novorossiya (New Russia), which was adopted by Putin to justify his annexation of Crimea in 2014. Dugin has long dreamed of an expansionist Russia, advocating for Russian rule 'from Dublin to Vladisvostok' in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics. He once said not taking back control of Ukraine would be 'an enormous danger for all of Eurasia' - before he was sanctioned by the US in 2015 after allegedly recruiting fighters for Russia-backed forces in the country. His daughter Darya was also sanctioned by the US Treasury after she became chief editor of the United World International (UWI) website - which was owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is suspected of interfering in the 2016 election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. News of Alexander Dugin's attempted assassination comes after a kamikaze drone strike hit Russia's Navy headquarters in Crimea and sparked a huge explosion on Saturday, in another suspected Ukrainian raid. Smoke was seen billowing through the air following the attack, which came despite frantic attempts from Putin's forces to shoot down the UAV, as seen in a video where repetitive gunfire is heard. The naval HQ suffered a direct hit, said reports while terrified Russian tourists fled the popular summer peninsula. The Kremlin's propaganda arm has claimed Russian troops were 'poisoned in a chemical attack in Ukraine', prompting fears Moscow will seek to justify the use of chemical weapons in the country. Putin mouthpiece Russia Today reported traces of Botulinum toxin Type B, which is an 'organic poison of artificial origin,' were found in samples taken from soldiers, according to a statement from Russia's defence ministry. But Kyiv hit back, suggesting the soldiers simply could have eaten contaminated meat. Kyiv was accused of 'domestic terrorism' and Russian troops were 'hospitalised with signs of severe poisoning' after being stationed near the village of Vasilyevka in the Zaporozhzhia region on July 31. The statement added: 'The Zelensky regime has authorized terrorist attacks with the use of toxic substances against Russian personnel and civilians.' The Russian Ministry's report did not say how many servicemen had suffered or what their condition was now. It did not say what the 'supporting evidence' was. Botulinum toxin type B is a neurotoxin that can cause botulism when ingested in previously contaminated food products, but it can also have medical uses. Ukraine's interior ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said: 'The department (Russian defence ministry) does not clarify whether the poisoning could have been caused by expired canned meat, in which botulinum toxin is often found. 'Overdue rations have been massively complained about by the occupying forces since the first days of the invasion of Ukraine.' The Russian defence ministry said it was conducting an additional investigation into an incident in which Volodymyr Saldo, the Russian-installed administration in Ukraine's occupied Kherson region, was taken ill. Saldo, a former mayor of the city of Kherson who was appointed to head the region of the same name when Russian troops overran it in early March, fell ill in early August. Russia says its 'special military operation' launched on Feb. 24 is aimed at demilitarizing Ukraine and protecting Russian speakers on what President Vladimir Putin called historical Russian land. Ukraine and Western countries view it as an unprovoked war of conquest aimed at wiping out Ukraine's national identity. Yesterday, it was reported Ukrainian emergency workers were carrying out drills in the event of a meltdown at the Zaporizhizhia plant. The nuclear plant is not located in the Ukrainian-controlled city that shares its name, but is actually 30 miles down the Dnipro River on Russian-occupied territory. Kyiv says Moscow has turned the nuclear plant - Europe's largest - into a military base, stored explosives in and around the reactors, and is preparing a 'false flag' attack. Ukraine's nuclear regulator says the Russian commander in charge of the plant has told his troops they must be ready to blow it up rather than let Ukraine re-take it. Russia has occupied the power plant since the early weeks of Putin's war in Ukraine, after its forces swept out of occupied Crimea and took control of large areas of southern Ukraine. However, warnings about the stability of the plant have stepped up in recent weeks as Russia attempts to disconnect it from Ukraine's main power grid and divert its energy to Crimea - and as a major Ukrainian counter-offensive to re-take the south ratchets up. Guterres was due in Lviv Saturday alongside Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss the situation around the power plant and the possibility of sending in a team of international inspectors to ensure its safety. Erdogan, making his first visit to Ukraine since the war began, was also due to discuss a deal to allow Ukrainian ships carrying vital loads of grain out of the country to avoid a global famine. Governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhaev confirmed the attack, writing on Telegram: 'Unfortunately, [the drone] was not shot down, although they worked on the bay with small arms. [It] went low. There were no victims.' He warned: 'The tenacity of these Ukro-Reich morons is amazing. Everyone, if possible, needs to be home in the next hour.' Russia also suffered incoming attacks on resort Yevpatoriya, north of Sevastopol, where one man was heard saying: 'This is not funny. Let's pack up and get out of here. These are no fireworks.' The air defence system was activated in the Western Crimea, the head of Putin's regime in annexed Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said. 'The target is hit. There is no damage, nor any wounded. Our military clearly, professionally and effectively carry out their tasks. I ask everyone to remain calm and trust only official information.' Initially as the wave of attacks came in, Razvozzhaev said: 'I am at my workplace in the government. As well as many of the townspeople, I heard the clapping in the [city] centre. 'Similar sounds were heard in the Strelka area a little earlier. The air defence was operating in the bay. Naval artillery [operated] in the centre. The same as yesterday. According to preliminary data [they were shooting down drones. Targets were hit. We remain calm. The military is doing their job perfectly. Let's support them.' However, the fear of attacks on Crimea - a new development in the war this month - is palpable among tourists who are fleeing the peninsula. It is the latest in a string of mystery blasts, widely believed to be inflicted by Ukrainian forces, deep in the occupied peninsula. Intelligence officials revealed last night how the strikes have crippled the invaders' military capabilities, while also displaying Kyiv's ability to wreak havoc on Russian logistics. It follows a huge blast at a Russian air base in Crimea last week. Western officials have now revealed the incident knocked out half of Russia's Black Sea naval aviation force. A source said: 'They've lost their flagship Moskva, they lost Snake Island, they lost half of their naval aviation package and their military headquarters was struck. I think we can assume attacks by Ukrainians behind enemy lines.' The explosions were reported at an air base near the village of Belbek, on the south-west coast near Sevastopol, HQ of Vladimir Putin's Black Sea fleet. On the opposite end of the peninsula, the sky has been lit up at Kerch near a huge bridge to Russia, with what Moscow has claimed was fire from its air defences. Inside Russia, two villages have been evacuated after explosions at an ammunition dump in Belgorod province, more than 60 miles from territory controlled by Ukrainian forces. Kyiv also announced a strike on a bridge at the Kakhovska Dam, near Kherson – one of the last routes for Russia to supply its troops on the west bank of the Dnipro River. Such attacks were having a 'significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership', said the official. Russia has denied any aircraft were damaged in what it called an accident at the base, although satellite pictures showed at least eight warplanes completely burned out. The recent explosions have had a major psychological effect on Moscow's leadership, with its invasion of Ukraine at 'near operational standstill', Western officials have said. More than half of the Russian navy's Black Sea Fleet combat jets were put out of action in blasts last week at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea, an area Moscow previously considered secure, according to Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD). The Kremlin is busy seeking to allocate blame for the debacle and President Putin is struggling to hide Ukraine's success from the Russian population. This comes as thousands of Russians fleeing Crimea have streamed into the country, officials said on Friday, and as a fire at a munitions depot near the Russian village of Timonovo has led to the evacuation of two villages in Russia's Belgorod region. Roughly 1,100 people reside in the villages of Timonovo and Soloti, around 15 miles from the Ukrainian border. There were no casualties in the blaze late Thursday, Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. In the attack on the Crimean airbase last week, nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed. The strike demonstrated both the Russians' vulnerability and the Ukrainians' capacity to strike deep behind enemy lines, previously not thought possible. Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility, but President Volodymyr Zelensky alluded to Ukrainian attacks behind enemy lines after the blasts in Crimea, which Russia has blamed on 'sabotage.' Three alleged Kremlin spies caught breaking into an arms factory in Albania are accused of spraying chemicals into the faces of the soldiers who stopped them. Two men with Russian passports and one Ukrainian national, most likely from one of the country's Moscow-ruled breakaway republics, tried to enter the weapons factory tonight, the NATO country's ministry of defence explosively claimed. It added: 'The officers who were guarding the plant reacted immediately, but during their efforts to stop the three foreign nationals, two of our soldiers were injured.' Factory director Lorenc Zani confirmed there was a 'physical clash', at which point the defending soldiers were sprayed with the unknown material, Albanian Daily News reported. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said the three individuals are 'suspected of espionage.' Officers arrested the three men, with the Albanian soldiers now hospitalised with illnesses arising from the apparent chemical poisoning. They are said to be in a stable condition. The defense ministry said one of the arrested, identified only as a Russian national MZ, 24 years old, entered the plant's territory and was trying to take photos. Two others, a Russian woman identified as ST, 33, and Ukrainian man FA, 25, were also arrested nearby. Gramsh military base in central Albania is an unusual location for foreign 'tourists' to visit. On Ukraine's capabilities, one Western official said: 'Ukraine is now consistently achieving kinetic effects deep behind Russia's lines. 'The incidents have been having a material effect on Russia's logistics support, but as importantly, there's a significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership.' They added that the attacks had forced the Black Sea Fleet into a defensive posture and stymied Russia's ability to launch a successful amphibious assault on Odesa on Ukraine's coast, which would cut off much of Ukraine's access to the sea. It comes as the war has entered a phase of 'near operational standstill', with neither side's ground forces having enough concentrated combat power to launch effective offensive actions, the Western official said. Russia is facing an increasingly acute shortage of stocks, even of basic munition, as well as manpower issues as it struggles to reconstitute its forces. 'There was a point when there was constant shelling, there was a real high point, particularly around the battle for the Donbas,' they said. 'We aren't at that high point anymore. 'The whole tempo of the campaign has slowed down, partly because both sides have become more conscious that this is a marathon not a sprint and that expenditure rates and conserving their munitions is important'. At least a dozen civilians were killed by Russian strikes in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv this week, according to the MoD. 'This civilian suffering provides an unusually stark example of Russian cynicism,' the official said, adding that Moscow was not planning to launch an offensive in the area or gain any major operational advantage from the bombardment. Meanwhile, the head of the GCHQ intelligence service said Moscow had failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine. 'So far, President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the West,' Sir Jeremy Fleming wrote in an op-ed in The Economist. 'Just as with its land invasion, Russia's initial online plans appear to have fallen short.' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in televised remarks Friday that statements from Ukrainian officials about striking facilities in Crimea mark 'an escalation of the conflict openly encouraged by the US and its NATO allies.' Ryabkov said Russian officials had warned the US against such actions in phone calls with high-level members of the Biden administration. He added that 'deep and open US involvement' in the war in Ukraine 'effectively puts the US on the brink of becoming a party to the conflict.' 'We don't want an escalation,' Ryabkov said. 'We would like to avoid a situation where the US becomes a party to the conflict, but so far we haven't seen their readiness to deeply and seriously consider those warnings.' In response to the attacks, Putin sacked his Black Sea naval commander earlier this week. The removal of Igor Osipov marked the most prominent sacking of a military official in the nearly six months since Russia launched its war on Ukraine. State-owned RIA said the new chief, Viktor Sokolov, was introduced to members of the fleet's military council in the port of Sevastopol. One source said it was 'normal' that the appointment was not publicly announced at a time when Russia is conducting what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Speculation has followed that Osipov was sacked following the sinking of the Moskva flagship on April 14, but the naval commander appears to have kept his job until recently. Osipov was absent from the Red Square 'victory parade', with Moscow claiming he was 'not in the mood' to appear following the loss of the flagship."
2022-08-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11131861/Topless-protesters-gas-embargo-painted-chests-target-Olaf-Scholz-Berlin.html,Flash mob! Topless protesters with 'gas embargo now' painted on their chests target German chancellor Olaf Scholz during event in Berlin,"Topless demonstrators stormed the stage to interrupt German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday in Berlin. The protestors ran on the stage with a slogan on their skin reading 'GAS EMBARGO NOW' as the security team tried to wrestle them away from the podium. Scholz was speaking at the Federal Government's Open Day event at the Chancellery in Berlin on August 21. Over the weekend, German citizens have the chance to visit the Federal Chancellery, the Federal Ministries and the Federal Press Office during the open day event where Scholz decided to give a speech. The Germany Chancellor has come under fire for his energy policy, which critics say gives leverage to Russia in its war against Ukraine. Germany's chancellor also had a rough reception after he visited the eastern German town of Neuruppin last weekend. Scholz spoke to outline new measures to help with the cost-of-living crisis, but was booed by protesters and drowned out by shouting while on stage. Germany has decided to replace all Russian energy imports, most notably natural gas, by as soon as mid-2024, a Herculean effort given Europe's top economy depends on Moscow for the fuel to power its industry. Since a landmark strategic shift outlined in a speech by the Chancellor, Germany has taken numerous measures to tackle the challenge while softening the blow to its economy and citizens. The promise to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas is squeezing many Germans to their financial limit as energy bills soar. Scholz has promised €30 billion of financial help for citizens, though not all of it has yet been made available. In 2021, Russia accounted for 55% of Germany's gas imports, a level that had declined to 26% by the end of June 2022, due to significantly reduced flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which is operating at just 20% of capacity."
2022-08-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11131471/4Com-boss-gives-431-staff-200-month-bonus-help-rising-energy-bills.html,Britain's best boss? Managing director of phone systems firm 4Com gives ALL of his 431 staff a £200-a-month bonus to help with rising energy bills,"The managing director at a UK phone systems company is giving his entire staff a monthly £200 bonus to help offset soaring energy costs. Daron Hutt met with his 'truly fantastic team' at 4Com last week to announce the firm's Energy Support Bonus program which will remain in effect until further notice. He said the company was in the position to help thanks to the firm's 'growth,' which he attributed to the successes of the 431-member staff. 4Com's new initiative comes as households have been warned that energy bills could hit a massive £3,615 this winter, according to energy consultant Cornwall Insight. Global energy prices have soared since Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, while Gazprom, Russia's state-run supplier, has cut the flow of gas from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that runs beneath the Baltic Sea to try and end European support for Kyiv. Mr Hutt announced the initiative during a team meeting last week, telling his staff: 'I said a couple of months ago that we wanted to be able to help if costs rose, and we are now seeing the situation with energy costs crystallising. He said the company can 'can help offset some of the price rises that are clearly coming' and that staff would start receiving the monthly pay increase immediately. 'What we are putting into place, effective immediately, is an Energy Support Bonus, whereby each and every person in the company will receive an increase of £200 a month in their payslips until further notice,' he explained. 'Our priority with our Energy Support Bonus is supporting the team we've built here over the years - they're our most valuable asset,' echoed Chief Executive Gary Scutt. Both firm leaders touted the company's recent growth, noting those successes made the bonus program possible. 'We've built a truly fantastic team here, and the combined efforts of everyone have helped the company continue to grow,' explained Mr Hutt. 'Thanks to that growth, we're in a position where we can help offset some of the price rises that are clearly coming.' Mr Scutt added: 'We are continuing to grow with over 50 roles available and this bonus will be extended to all joining.' 4Com, based in Bournemouth, Dorset, was founded in 1999. The firm topped the Sunday Times 100 Best Companies list in 2017. Meantime energy bills could reach extreme highs in the new year - worth hundreds of pounds more than previous predictions, Cornwall Insight revealed. The increase represents a huge jump from October 2021, when the average bill was £1,400, before the price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers for average energy usage - then rose to £2,000. Last month, Cornwall Insight predicted that annual energy bills would typically rise to £3,244 from October and £3,363 from January, but circumstances have changed significantly since then, adding yet more pressure to families already struggling. The company told BBC Breakfast earlier this month that such a bill is now likely to rise to £3,358 from October and £3,615 from January. The skyrocketing energy bills in the UK come as energy prices are soaring across the globe. Germany switched off hot water and central heating in public buildings and stopped lighting monuments overnight to save energy, as British bosses paid the highest price on record for electricity last month as part of desperate efforts to avoid a power blackout. In May, the British government announced an energy costs support package – worth £400 per household – but this was in response to predictions that bills would rise to £2,800 for the average household in October. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) currently reviews the energy price cap every six months, but will now review it four times a year. The government is expected to announce October's price cap later this week. Another review is set for January 2023w. Charity National Energy Action last month predicted that, should the average bill reach £3,250 per year, 8.2 million UK households will be in fuel poverty, or one in three. Experts also fear energy bills for the typical family could reach £6,089 a year by next April. The figure, released by energy consultants Auxilione on Friday, represents a five-fold increase on where bills were until April this year, before wholesale prices took off and the price cap began to spiral. Since then, gas prices have spiked to levels never seen before, as Vladimir Putin's regime slashed supplies. Hard-pressed families are struggling with bills and face the prospect of more rises over the winter. It is feared millions will be unable to pay bills over the next year, unless Ministers increase the current £400 they've promised households as a discount. Those who get into debt could be moved to prepayment meters (PPMs) – where they have to pay in advance for gas and electricity, plus pay extra each time they top up to pay off the money owed. The price cap hike comes with Britain in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis, with inflation hitting ten per cent and interest rates rising. What is the energy price cap? Introduced in 2019, it's a way of limiting what consumers pay to energy firms. Until last April it stood at £1,277, and then it was hiked 54 per cent to £1,971 for the average user. Crucially, the cap does not cover businesses, which face the full brunt of increases. What's happening this week? The next rise will be announced on Friday, and the cap is expected to go up to £3,576. New rules mean it will be updated every three months from October and it is predicted to go up again in January, to £4,799. What's it looking like for April? Industry experts predict it will be more than £6,000 – that means in the space of a year, the average bill is up around five-fold. What is the Government doing about it? The Government has promised £400 discount for every household over the winter, plus an extra £650 for hard-up families and cash for pensioners. But that won't be enough? No. That package was announced when the cap was predicted to be lower – at £2,800, some £700 lower than it will be from October. So what will the new PM do? Liz Truss has so far said little other than suggesting she will axe the green levy, saving bill payers around £150, but Kwasi Kwarteng, likely to be Chancellor in a Truss government, tells the MoS that 'help is on its way'. Rishi Sunak has said he will find up to £10 billion to soften the impact for up to 16 million vulnerable people. Critics say more will be needed, with more targeted help required for those on low incomes. What do they do elsewhere? France has forced state-owned EDF to limit price rises to four per cent. Holland is offering some households €800 (£680) off, plus cutting VAT. Germany is giving €300 (£250) off, plus a further €100 (£85) per child. Italy will give families €200 (£170)."
2022-08-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11131413/Alexander-Dugin-holds-head-hands-amid-aftermath-Moscow-car-bomb-killed-daughter.html,"Moment Putin's closest aide Alexander Dugin holds head in his hands amid aftermath of Moscow car bomb that killed his daughter: Ukraine war mastermind is spotted at scene after Darya Dugin, 35, was 'assassinated in attack meant for her father'","This is the moment Putin's aide Alexander Dugin watches the flaming wreckage of a car bomb meant for him that killed his daughter instead when the two switched vehicles last minute. Dugin, a notorious fascist and Russian ultranationalist, is in hospital after being filmed at the scene of the explosion that killed his 35 year old daughter, Darya Dugina. He was travelling on a highway near the village of Bolshiye Vyazyomy just outside the capital on Saturday night — but decided to travel in a different car to his daughter, avoiding death only by chance. Vladimir Putin’s closest supporters have demanded vengeance on Ukraine over the ‘assassination’ of Dugina, daughter of the Russian leader’s spiritual guru, who died in his stead. A distressing video from Baza media shows the bereft father - known as Putin’s ‘Rasputin’ - at the scene of the explosion. The car is seen as a fireball as emergency services sirens wail. Reports said she died on the spot. But her father - seen as the brains behind Putin’s interference in Ukraine from 2014 - was intended to be in the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado which was hit, but the former professor apparently switched cars at the last minute. The explosion took place as Ms Dugina was returning from a cultural festival she had attended with her father. Dugina was a political analyst and editor of pro-Putin journal United World International and a joint author of a book on Putin's war in Ukraine. Her father is the author of an extreme rightwing view of Russia’s role in the world which held an appeal to Putin. The pair were pictured together at a pro-Putin public event shortly before she was slain. Andrey Krasnov, the head of the Russian Horizon social movement and a close friend of the dead woman, said: 'I knew Darya personally. 'This was the father’s vehicle. Darya… took his car today, while Alexander went in a different way. He returned, and he was at the site of the tragedy. 'As far as I understand, Alexander or probably both of them were the target.' Russian ultra-right ideologue Alexander Dugin is responsible for shaping the world view of Putin's inner circle. He has called for Ukrainians to be killed and strongly pushed Russia to invade for decades. In his youth, Dugin emerged as a leader of the notorious anti-Semitic Russian nationalist organisation, Pamyat. He founded his own publishing house after the fall of the USSR, going on to win university positions for his writings. Dugin believes that the Russian Orthodox Church was destined to rule as an empire over all of Europe and Asia — uniting all the Russian-speaking peoples into a single state. He laid out his plan for achieving this aim in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics, a text which still has significant influence within Russian elites and has even been used as a textbook by the Russian military. The Russian professor formed the 'Eurasia Party' in 2001, named after the hypothetical state, which also appears in George Orwell's novel 1984. His novel calls for a Russian empire stretching from Dublin to Vladivostok, even calling for parts of China to be conquered. Dugin was dismissed from his position as head of the Department of Sociology of International Relations at Moscow University after arguing for 'people's republics' on the territory of Ukraine. Seven years later, his position would become a reality after the Kremlin annexed the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic out of Ukraine's occupied eastern territories. Dugin called for the annexation of Crimea as far back as 2008, during Russia's war with Georgia. He travelled to the disputed region of South Ossetia, where he was photographed with a rocket launcher. He was also involved with coordinating separatist movements in Ukraine during the 2014 occupation, for which the US sanctioned him. The political scientist claims he also played a key role in reconciling the relationship between Russia and Turkey in 2015 after a Russian warplane was shot down on the Syrian border. Dugin also developed links with far-right and far-left political parties in the European Union, attempting to influence EU policy on Ukraine and Russia. There is no direct evidence Ukraine or its agents were involved in the Moscow attack, but senior pro-Putin war supporters were quick to demand an all out attack on Kyiv over the alleged assassination. Margarita Simonyan, head of RT ‘propaganda’ network, posted on Telegram: 'Decision-making centres! Decision-making centres!! Decision-making centres!!!' Her call echoes a demand from hardliners loyal to Putin for him to wreak havoc with massive missile strikes on central Kyiv. Propaganda journalist Maxim Kononenko messaged: 'The address of the main building of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services]: Volodymyrska 33, Kyiv. I'm going to try to sleep now, and when I wake up, I hope to read on the news that it was f****** bombed along with its basements.' There were also warnings that other pro-Putin propagandists could be in danger. Denis Pushilin, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic [DPR], a pro-Moscow puppet state in eastern Ukraine, posted: 'The terrorists of the Ukrainian regime, trying to eliminate Alexander Dugin blew up his daughter...in a car. Blessed memory of Daria, she is a real Russian girl.' He directly blamed 'terrorists of the Ukrainian regime'. Dugina was described as 'a young, smart, beautiful and incredibly talented and sympathetic woman'. While he has no formal role in government, Dugin, a far-Right occult writer who used to edit the staunchly pro-Putin Tsargrad TV network, is regarded as the Russian warmonger's 'guru advisor' and reportedly exerts heavy influence over him. He is credited with giving new life to the term Novorossiya (New Russia), which was adopted by Putin to justify his annexation of Crimea in 2014. Dugin has long dreamed of an expansionist Russia, advocating for Russian rule 'from Dublin to Vladisvostok' in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics. He once said not taking back control of Ukraine would be 'an enormous danger for all of Eurasia' - before he was sanctioned by the US in 2015 after allegedly recruiting fighters for Russia-backed forces in the country. His daughter Darya was also sanctioned by the US Treasury after she became chief editor of the United World International (UWI) website - which was owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is suspected of interfering in the 2016 election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. News of Alexander Dugin's attempted assassination comes after a kamikaze drone strike hit Russia's Navy headquarters in Crimea and sparked a huge explosion on Saturday, in another suspected Ukrainian raid. Smoke was seen billowing through the air following the attack, which came despite frantic attempts from Putin's forces to shoot down the UAV, as seen in a video where repetitive gunfire is heard. The naval HQ suffered a direct hit, said reports while terrified Russian tourists fled the popular summer peninsula. The Kremlin's propaganda arm has claimed Russian troops were 'poisoned in a chemical attack in Ukraine', prompting fears Moscow will seek to justify the use of chemical weapons in the country. Putin mouthpiece Russia Today reported traces of Botulinum toxin Type B, which is an 'organic poison of artificial origin,' were found in samples taken from soldiers, according to a statement from Russia's defence ministry. But Kyiv hit back, suggesting the soldiers simply could have eaten contaminated meat. Kyiv was accused of 'domestic terrorism' and Russian troops were 'hospitalised with signs of severe poisoning' after being stationed near the village of Vasilyevka in the Zaporozhzhia region on July 31. The statement added: 'The Zelensky regime has authorized terrorist attacks with the use of toxic substances against Russian personnel and civilians.' The Russian Ministry's report did not say how many servicemen had suffered or what their condition was now. It did not say what the 'supporting evidence' was. Botulinum toxin type B is a neurotoxin that can cause botulism when ingested in previously contaminated food products, but it can also have medical uses. Ukraine's interior ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said: 'The department (Russian defence ministry) does not clarify whether the poisoning could have been caused by expired canned meat, in which botulinum toxin is often found. 'Overdue rations have been massively complained about by the occupying forces since the first days of the invasion of Ukraine.' The Russian defence ministry said it was conducting an additional investigation into an incident in which Volodymyr Saldo, the Russian-installed administration in Ukraine's occupied Kherson region, was taken ill. Saldo, a former mayor of the city of Kherson who was appointed to head the region of the same name when Russian troops overran it in early March, fell ill in early August. Russia says its 'special military operation' launched on Feb. 24 is aimed at demilitarizing Ukraine and protecting Russian speakers on what President Vladimir Putin called historical Russian land. Ukraine and Western countries view it as an unprovoked war of conquest aimed at wiping out Ukraine's national identity. Yesterday, it was reported Ukrainian emergency workers were carrying out drills in the event of a meltdown at the Zaporizhizhia plant. The nuclear plant is not located in the Ukrainian-controlled city that shares its name, but is actually 30 miles down the Dnipro River on Russian-occupied territory. Kyiv says Moscow has turned the nuclear plant - Europe's largest - into a military base, stored explosives in and around the reactors, and is preparing a 'false flag' attack. Ukraine's nuclear regulator says the Russian commander in charge of the plant has told his troops they must be ready to blow it up rather than let Ukraine re-take it. Russia has occupied the power plant since the early weeks of Putin's war in Ukraine, after its forces swept out of occupied Crimea and took control of large areas of southern Ukraine. However, warnings about the stability of the plant have stepped up in recent weeks as Russia attempts to disconnect it from Ukraine's main power grid and divert its energy to Crimea - and as a major Ukrainian counter-offensive to re-take the south ratchets up. Guterres was due in Lviv Saturday alongside Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss the situation around the power plant and the possibility of sending in a team of international inspectors to ensure its safety. Erdogan, making his first visit to Ukraine since the war began, was also due to discuss a deal to allow Ukrainian ships carrying vital loads of grain out of the country to avoid a global famine. Governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhaev confirmed the attack, writing on Telegram: 'Unfortunately, [the drone] was not shot down, although they worked on the bay with small arms. [It] went low. There were no victims.' He warned: 'The tenacity of these Ukro-Reich morons is amazing. Everyone, if possible, needs to be home in the next hour.' Russia also suffered incoming attacks on resort Yevpatoriya, north of Sevastopol, where one man was heard saying: 'This is not funny. Let's pack up and get out of here. These are no fireworks.' The air defence system was activated in the Western Crimea, the head of Putin's regime in annexed Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said. 'The target is hit. There is no damage, nor any wounded. Our military clearly, professionally and effectively carry out their tasks. I ask everyone to remain calm and trust only official information.' Initially as the wave of attacks came in, Razvozzhaev said: 'I am at my workplace in the government. As well as many of the townspeople, I heard the clapping in the [city] centre. 'Similar sounds were heard in the Strelka area a little earlier. The air defence was operating in the bay. Naval artillery [operated] in the centre. The same as yesterday. According to preliminary data [they were shooting down drones. Targets were hit. We remain calm. The military is doing their job perfectly. Let's support them.' However, the fear of attacks on Crimea - a new development in the war this month - is palpable among tourists who are fleeing the peninsula. It is the latest in a string of mystery blasts, widely believed to be inflicted by Ukrainian forces, deep in the occupied peninsula. Intelligence officials revealed last night how the strikes have crippled the invaders' military capabilities, while also displaying Kyiv's ability to wreak havoc on Russian logistics. It follows a huge blast at a Russian air base in Crimea last week. Western officials have now revealed the incident knocked out half of Russia's Black Sea naval aviation force. A source said: 'They've lost their flagship Moskva, they lost Snake Island, they lost half of their naval aviation package and their military headquarters was struck. I think we can assume attacks by Ukrainians behind enemy lines.' The explosions were reported at an air base near the village of Belbek, on the south-west coast near Sevastopol, HQ of Vladimir Putin's Black Sea fleet. On the opposite end of the peninsula, the sky has been lit up at Kerch near a huge bridge to Russia, with what Moscow has claimed was fire from its air defences. Inside Russia, two villages have been evacuated after explosions at an ammunition dump in Belgorod province, more than 60 miles from territory controlled by Ukrainian forces. Kyiv also announced a strike on a bridge at the Kakhovska Dam, near Kherson – one of the last routes for Russia to supply its troops on the west bank of the Dnipro River. Such attacks were having a 'significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership', said the official. Russia has denied any aircraft were damaged in what it called an accident at the base, although satellite pictures showed at least eight warplanes completely burned out. The recent explosions have had a major psychological effect on Moscow's leadership, with its invasion of Ukraine at 'near operational standstill', Western officials have said. More than half of the Russian navy's Black Sea Fleet combat jets were put out of action in blasts last week at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea, an area Moscow previously considered secure, according to Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD). The Kremlin is busy seeking to allocate blame for the debacle and President Putin is struggling to hide Ukraine's success from the Russian population. This comes as thousands of Russians fleeing Crimea have streamed into the country, officials said on Friday, and as a fire at a munitions depot near the Russian village of Timonovo has led to the evacuation of two villages in Russia's Belgorod region. Roughly 1,100 people reside in the villages of Timonovo and Soloti, around 15 miles from the Ukrainian border. There were no casualties in the blaze late Thursday, Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. In the attack on the Crimean airbase last week, nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed. The strike demonstrated both the Russians' vulnerability and the Ukrainians' capacity to strike deep behind enemy lines, previously not thought possible. Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility, but President Volodymyr Zelensky alluded to Ukrainian attacks behind enemy lines after the blasts in Crimea, which Russia has blamed on 'sabotage.' Three alleged Kremlin spies caught breaking into an arms factory in Albania are accused of spraying chemicals into the faces of the soldiers who stopped them. Two men with Russian passports and one Ukrainian national, most likely from one of the country's Moscow-ruled breakaway republics, tried to enter the weapons factory tonight, the NATO country's ministry of defence explosively claimed. It added: 'The officers who were guarding the plant reacted immediately, but during their efforts to stop the three foreign nationals, two of our soldiers were injured.'

Two others, a Russian woman identified as ST, 33, and Ukrainian man FA, 25, were also arrested nearby. Gramsh military base in central Albania is an unusual location for foreign 'tourists' to visit.

At least a dozen civilians were killed by Russian strikes in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv this week, according to the MoD. 'This civilian suffering provides an unusually stark example of Russian cynicism,' the official said, adding that Moscow was not planning to launch an offensive in the area or gain any major operational advantage from the bombardment. Meanwhile, the head of the GCHQ intelligence service said Moscow had failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine. 'So far, President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the West,' Sir Jeremy Fleming wrote in an op-ed in The Economist.

'We would like to avoid a situation where the US becomes a party to the conflict, but so far we haven't seen their readiness to deeply and seriously consider those warnings.' In response to the attacks, Putin sacked his Black Sea naval commander earlier this week. The removal of Igor Osipov marked the most prominent sacking of a military official in the nearly six months since Russia launched its war on Ukraine.

One source said it was 'normal' that the appointment was not publicly announced at a time when Russia is conducting what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Speculation has followed that Osipov was sacked following the sinking of the Moskva flagship on April 14, but the naval commander appears to have kept his job until recently. Osipov was absent from the Red Square 'victory parade', with Moscow claiming he was 'not in the mood' to appear following the loss of the flagship."
2022-08-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11130687/Russia-displays-destroyed-Australian-Bushmaster-war-Ukraine.html,Russia proudly shows off an Australian Bushmaster as it adds the destroyed icon to a war trophy museum amid its bloody war with Ukraine,"Russia has displayed a destroyed Australian-made Bushmaster as part of a war trophy exhibition of military vehicles captured from Ukrainian forces. The gutted and blast-damaged Bushmaster was shown with a placard and sign displaying Australian flag in Patriot Park, which is located just outside Moscow. It was reported in May that one of the 20 Australian Bushmasters vehicles sent as military aid to Ukrainian forces was destroyed between Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. Footage emerged of a burnt-out wreckage of a Bushmaster sitting in an empty field but a Ukrainian commander told an Australian reporter all those in the vehicle survived. The vehicle on display outside of Moscow showed extensive bomb blast damage on its armoured panels but remained otherwise mostly intact. Various other tanks, armoured vehicles and even boats from different countries were also put on display outside Moscow as part of the International Military-Technical Forum 'Army 2022', Russia's largest annual defence showcase. Ukrainian soldiers have sung the praises of Australian-made Bushmasters and and pleader for more to be sent to fight off the brutal Russian invasion of their country. The sturdy adaptable vehicles are reportedly being used as frontline ambulances and were in constant action under heavy fire in Ukraine's east. It was announced last month that Australia would be sending 40 more of the vehicles to the country as well as 14 heavier M113AS4 vehicles, four of which have already gone. During a July visit to the factory, in the Victorian city of Bendigo, where the Bushmasters are made, Ukrainian ambassador Vasyl Myroshnychenko said they were proving vital to his country's war effort. 'Bushmasters are actually saving lives in Ukraine,' he told the ABC. 'Australia is the biggest ally outside of NATO for us — it demonstrates solidarity. 'Australia is punching above its weight in this support.' Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last month announced an additional $99.5 million aid package for war-torn Ukraine. This brings the overall commitment to $388 million, which is the largest non-NATO country contribution to the Ukrainian war effort. Mr Myroshnychenko says more military equipment still is needed as the brutal conflict drags on. 'We have several Bushmasters which are operating as ambulances, so they're used to deliver wounded from the battlefield to the military hospital where they get the treatment,' he said. 'Because of the scale of this war we could benefit from more, definitely — we could make use of another 40, make it 100. 'If you look at the scale of the war in Ukraine, we have the biggest deployment of ground troops since the Second World War, so vehicles like the Bushmaster are in high demand. 'Every day Ukraine is losing about a hundred soldiers.' In August a Bushmaster commander, who was only named as Vitaly, told the Sydney Morning Herald he saw the Bushmaster get destroyed during the eastern battle. 'I was there, I saw that Bushmaster go in for the first time, bring the guys back and then go in a second time. And then it got hit,' unit commander Vitaly said. 'It's armoured inside and that's a big plus for this vehicle because it protects the safety and the health of the soldiers inside. 'If we had more vehicles like this, we would save more lives - and the lives of our soldiers are the most important thing.' It's not just the safety of the Bushmasters that make the vehicle popular with the Ukrainian defenders compared to their Soviet-era troop transports. 'First of all, it's very comfortable,' Vitaly said. It has air-conditioning, it's like a house on wheels. 'I would have lived inside. I stay in it all the time.' The Bushmaster, nicknamed 'The Bushy', is an 11-tonne armoured military vehicle built in the Victorian city of Bendigo and is designed to deploy up to 10 soldiers to the battlefield. The 20 vehicles sent to Ukraine were refitted for duty after being 'retired' having seen extensive service in Afghanistan and emergency relief zones. They were repainted olive green with Ukraine's flag stencilled on each side. The words 'United with Ukraine' were emblazoned on the vehicles in both English Ukrainian along with a kangaroo bounding next to a Ukrainian flag. Vitaly made a plea for Australia to send more along with other munitions, such as the six light-weight towed howitzer cannons that accompanied the Bushmasters. The Bushmaster Protected Military Vehicle (PMV) - or Infantry Mobility Vehicle - is an Australian built, four-wheel drive armoured vehicle that has seen action in several wars and is designed to carry up to 10 soldiers to the battlefield. Nicknamed 'the Bushy', the vehicle is built to withstand any environment and protect troops from bomb blasts, and were widely used by the Australian Defence Force during the conflict in Afghanistan. The Bushmaster can carry mortars and other heavier weapons, and can also be equipped with machine guns and other military equipment. It can also carry enough fuel and supplies to operate for three days without resupply and has a central tyre inflation system allowing it to function with punctures. 'We need artillery and ammunition for the artillery,' he said. 'We need howitzers, we need more tanks and armoured vehicles – a lot of armoured vehicles.' On June 9, Australia sent the first four of 14 heavier M113AS4 armoured personnel carriers to the Ukraine. The vehicles were loaded onto a Ukrainian Antonov AN-124 aircraft at the RAAF Base Amberley just outside of Brisbane. The M113AS4 is an advanced variant of the American M113 model, which has been in service since the Vietnam war. In response to requests made by Ukraine, Australia has pledged over $285million in military aid which also includes anti-armour weapons, ammunition, drones, medical supplies plus other equipment. Defence Minister Richard Marles said it showed Australia's continued commitment to the Ukrainian people. 'Australia stands with Ukraine, and again calls on Russia to cease its unprovoked, unjust, and illegal invasion of Ukraine,' Mr Marles said. Since launching its all-out assault on the Ukraine in February Russia has encountered staunch resistance. It is now concentrating its efforts on securing the eastern area of Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. The area was largely held by Russian-backed separatists before the invasion."
2022-08-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11130779/Russian-spies-arrested-spraying-chemicals-faces-soldiers-NATO-weapons-factory.html,Three Kremlin 'spies' are arrested after 'spraying chemicals in faces of soldiers when they were caught breaking into weapons factory in NATO member Albania',"Three alleged Kremlin spies caught breaking into an arms factory in Albania are accused of spraying chemicals into the faces of the soldiers who stopped them. Two men with Russian passports and one Ukrainian national, most likely from one of the country's Moscow-ruled breakaway republics, tried to enter the weapons factory tonight, the NATO country's ministry of defence explosively claimed. It added: 'The officers who were guarding the plant reacted immediately, but during their efforts to stop the three foreign nationals, two of our soldiers were injured.' Factory director Lorenc Zani confirmed there was a 'physical clash', at which point the defending soldiers were sprayed with the unknown material, Albanian Daily News reported. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said the three individuals are 'suspected of espionage.' Officers arrested the three men, with the Albanian soldiers now hospitalised with illnesses arising from the apparent chemical poisoning. They are said to be in a stable condition. The defense ministry said one of the arrested, identified only as a Russian national MZ, 24 years old, entered the plant's territory and was trying to take photos. Two others, a Russian woman identified as ST, 33, and Ukrainian man FA, 25, were also arrested nearby. Gramsh military base in central Albania is an unusual location for foreign 'tourists' to visit. Albania's status as NATO member for more than a decade has raised eyebrows. It joined the western military alliance in 2009. During communism, Gramsh was used to produce Russian AK-47 machine guns. According to the ministry's website, the plant today provides manufacturing services for the defense industry, without giving more details. The latest potential escalation in NATO-Russia tensions comes as the daughter of Putin's 'Rasputin' was allegedly assassinated in a car bomb 'meant for her father'. Darya Dugin was 'blown to pieces' in an elaborate 'contract killing' near the village of Bolshiye Vyazyomy, on the outskirts of Moscow on Saturday night. The hit was reportedly meant for her father Alexander Dugin, 60, who had planned to travel back with her from a festival before deciding to take a separate car. Denis Pushilin, head of the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine, branded the authors of the apparent attack 'vile villains'. He added on Telegram: 'The terrorists of the Ukrainian regime, trying to eliminate Alexander Dugin, blew up his daughter... In a car. Blessed memory of Daria, she is a real Russian girl!' Russian forces today stepped up their battle to seize one of the dwindling number of cities in embattled eastern Ukraine not already under their control, while continuing to fire on towns and villages in the country's north and south. Ukrainian officials said on Saturday that Russian shelling had collapsed balconies and blown out windows in the southern region of Mikolayiv, injuring at least nine civilians. A five-storey apartment building and private homes in the town of Voznesensk were badly damaged, the Black Sea region's governor said. Vitaliy Kim wrote in a Telegram post: 'As of 1.30pm (local time) - nine wounded, including four children. 'All children in a serious condition. Ages range from three to 17.' He added that a young girl lost an eye as a result of Saturday's attack."
2022-08-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11130731/Daughter-Ukraine-war-mastermind-blown-pieces-Moscow-car-bomb.html,Daughter of Ukraine war mastermind 'is blown to pieces in Moscow car bomb': Darya Dugin 'assassinated in attack meant for her father Alexander' - one of Putin's closest aides often dubbed the Russian leader's 'brain',"The daughter of Vladimir Putin's so-called 'Rasputin' - one of the architects of the Russian tyrant's war in Ukraine - has reportedly been 'blown to pieces' in a car bombing on the outskirts of Moscow, in an alleged assassination plot meant for her father. Darya Dugin, a sanctioned Russian nationalist whose father Alexander Dugin, 60, is a notorious fascist dubbed 'Putin's brain', is thought to have been killed in an explosion on a highway near the village of Bolshiye Vyazyomy just outside the capital on Saturday night. Footage apparently taken at the scene of the alleged bombing shows Darya's Land Cruiser Prado engulfed in flames by a roadside with at least one fire truck in attendance. Though claims that this was a hit gone wrong are unconfirmed, Putin stooge Denis Pushilin, head of the pro-Kremlin breakaway Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine, accused Ukrainian 'terrorists' of 'blowing up' Dugin's daughter. He wrote on Telegram: 'The terrorists of the Ukrainian regime, trying to eliminate Alexander Dugin, blew up his daughter... In a car. Blessed memory of Daria, she is a real Russian girl!' While he has no formal role in government, Dugin, a far-Right occult writer who used to edit the staunchly pro-Putin Tsargrad TV network, is regarded as the Russian warmonger's 'guru advisor' and reportedly exerts heavy influence over him. He is credited with giving new life to the term Novorossiya (New Russia), which was adopted by Putin to justify his annexation of Crimea in 2014. Dugin has long dreamed of an expansionist Russia, advocating for Russian rule 'from Dublin to Vladisvostok' in his 1997 book Foundations of Geopolitics. He once said not taking back control of Ukraine would be 'an enormous danger for all of Eurasia' - before he was sanctioned by the US in 2015 after allegedly recruiting fighters for Russia-backed forces in the country. His daughter Darya was also sanctioned by the US Treasury after she became chief editor of the United World International (UWI) website - which was owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is suspected of interfering in the 2016 election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The Kremlin's propaganda arm has claimed Russian troops were 'poisoned in a chemical attack in Ukraine', prompting fears Moscow will seek to justify the use of chemical weapons in the country. Putin mouthpiece Russia Today reported traces of Botulinum toxin Type B, which is an 'organic poison of artificial origin,' were found in samples taken from soldiers, according to a statement from Russia's defence ministry. But Kyiv hit back, suggesting the soldiers simply could have eaten contaminated meat. Kyiv was accused of 'domestic terrorism' and Russian troops were 'hospitalised with signs of severe poisoning' after being stationed near the village of Vasilyevka in the Zaporozhzhia region on July 31. The statement added: 'The Zelensky regime has authorized terrorist attacks with the use of toxic substances against Russian personnel and civilians.' But in response, an adviser to Ukraine's interior ministry said that the alleged poisoning could have been caused by Russian forces eating expired canned meat. The Russian Ministry's report did not say how many servicemen had suffered or what their condition was now. It did not say what the 'supporting evidence' was. Botulinum toxin type B is a neurotoxin that can cause botulism when ingested in previously contaminated food products, but it can also have medical uses. Ukraine's interior ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said: 'The department (Russian defence ministry) does not clarify whether the poisoning could have been caused by expired canned meat, in which botulinum toxin is often found. 'Overdue rations have been massively complained about by the occupying forces since the first days of the invasion of Ukraine.' The Russian defence ministry said it was conducting an additional investigation into an incident in which Volodymyr Saldo, the Russian-installed administration in Ukraine's occupied Kherson region, was taken ill. Saldo, a former mayor of the city of Kherson who was appointed to head the region of the same name when Russian troops overran it in early March, fell ill in early August. Russia says its 'special military operation' launched on Feb. 24 is aimed at demilitarizing Ukraine and protecting Russian speakers on what President Vladimir Putin called historical Russian land. Ukraine and Western countries view it as an unprovoked war of conquest aimed at wiping out Ukraine's national identity. Yesterday, it was reported Ukrainian emergency workers were carrying out drills in the event of a meltdown at the Zaporizhizhia plant. The nuclear plant is not located in the Ukrainian-controlled city that shares its name, but is actually 30 miles down the Dnipro River on Russian-occupied territory. Kyiv says Moscow has turned the nuclear plant - Europe's largest - into a military base, stored explosives in and around the reactors, and is preparing a 'false flag' attack. Ukraine's nuclear regulator says the Russian commander in charge of the plant has told his troops they must be ready to blow it up rather than let Ukraine re-take it. Russia has occupied the power plant since the early weeks of Putin's war in Ukraine, after its forces swept out of occupied Crimea and took control of large areas of southern Ukraine. However, warnings about the stability of the plant have stepped up in recent weeks as Russia attempts to disconnect it from Ukraine's main power grid and divert its energy to Crimea - and as a major Ukrainian counter-offensive to re-take the south ratchets up. Guterres was due in Lviv Saturday alongside Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss the situation around the power plant and the possibility of sending in a team of international inspectors to ensure its safety. Erdogan, making his first visit to Ukraine since the war began, was also due to discuss a deal to allow Ukrainian ships carrying vital loads of grain out of the country to avoid a global famine. News of Alexander Dugin's attempted assassination comes after a kamikaze drone strike hit Russia's Navy headquarters in Crimea and sparked a huge explosion on Saturday, in another suspected Ukrainian raid. Smoke was seen billowing through the air following the attack, which came despite frantic attempts from Putin's forces to shoot down the UAV, as seen in a video where repetitive gunfire is heard. The naval HQ suffered a direct hit, said reports while terrified Russian tourists fled the popular summer peninsula. Governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhaev confirmed the attack, writing on Telegram: 'Unfortunately, [the drone] was not shot down, although they worked on the bay with small arms. [It] went low. There were no victims.' He warned: 'The tenacity of these Ukro-Reich morons is amazing. Everyone, if possible, needs to be home in the next hour.' Russia also suffered incoming attacks on resort Yevpatoriya, north of Sevastopol, where one man was heard saying: 'This is not funny. Let's pack up and get out of here. These are no fireworks.' The air defence system was activated in the Western Crimea, the head of Putin's regime in annexed Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said. 'The target is hit. There is no damage, nor any wounded. Our military clearly, professionally and effectively carry out their tasks. I ask everyone to remain calm and trust only official information.' Initially as the wave of attacks came in, Razvozzhaev said: 'I am at my workplace in the government. As well as many of the townspeople, I heard the clapping in the [city] centre. 'Similar sounds were heard in the Strelka area a little earlier. The air defence was operating in the bay. Naval artillery [operated] in the centre. The same as yesterday. According to preliminary data [they were shooting down drones. Targets were hit. We remain calm. The military is doing their job perfectly. Let's support them.' However, the fear of attacks on Crimea - a new development in the war this month - is palpable among tourists who are fleeing the peninsula. It is the latest in a string of mystery blasts, widely believed to be inflicted by Ukrainian forces, deep in the occupied peninsula. Intelligence officials revealed last night how the strikes have crippled the invaders' military capabilities, while also displaying Kyiv's ability to wreak havoc on Russian logistics. It follows a huge blast at a Russian air base in Crimea last week. Western officials have now revealed the incident knocked out half of Russia's Black Sea naval aviation force. A source said: 'They've lost their flagship Moskva, they lost Snake Island, they lost half of their naval aviation package and their military headquarters was struck. I think we can assume attacks by Ukrainians behind enemy lines.' The explosions were reported at an air base near the village of Belbek, on the south-west coast near Sevastopol, HQ of Vladimir Putin's Black Sea fleet. On the opposite end of the peninsula, the sky has been lit up at Kerch near a huge bridge to Russia, with what Moscow has claimed was fire from its air defences. Inside Russia, two villages have been evacuated after explosions at an ammunition dump in Belgorod province, more than 60 miles from territory controlled by Ukrainian forces. Kyiv also announced a strike on a bridge at the Kakhovska Dam, near Kherson – one of the last routes for Russia to supply its troops on the west bank of the Dnipro River. Such attacks were having a 'significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership', said the official. Russia has denied any aircraft were damaged in what it called an accident at the base, although satellite pictures showed at least eight warplanes completely burned out. The recent explosions have had a major psychological effect on Moscow's leadership, with its invasion of Ukraine at 'near operational standstill', Western officials have said. More than half of the Russian navy's Black Sea Fleet combat jets were put out of action in blasts last week at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea, an area Moscow previously considered secure, according to Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD). The Kremlin is busy seeking to allocate blame for the debacle and President Putin is struggling to hide Ukraine's success from the Russian population. This comes as thousands of Russians fleeing Crimea have streamed into the country, officials said on Friday, and as a fire at a munitions depot near the Russian village of Timonovo has led to the evacuation of two villages in Russia's Belgorod region. Roughly 1,100 people reside in the villages of Timonovo and Soloti, around 15 miles from the Ukrainian border. There were no casualties in the blaze late Thursday, Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. In the attack on the Crimean airbase last week, nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed. Three alleged Kremlin spies caught breaking into an arms factory in Albania are accused of spraying chemicals into the faces of the soldiers who stopped them. Two men with Russian passports and one Ukrainian national, most likely from one of the country's Moscow-ruled breakaway republics, tried to enter the weapons factory tonight, the NATO country's ministry of defence explosively claimed. It added: 'The officers who were guarding the plant reacted immediately, but during their efforts to stop the three foreign nationals, two of our soldiers were injured.' Factory director Lorenc Zani confirmed there was a 'physical clash', at which point the defending soldiers were sprayed with the unknown material, Albanian Daily News reported. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said the three individuals are 'suspected of espionage.' Officers arrested the three men, with the Albanian soldiers now hospitalised with illnesses arising from the apparent chemical poisoning. They are said to be in a stable condition. The defense ministry said one of the arrested, identified only as a Russian national MZ, 24 years old, entered the plant's territory and was trying to take photos. Two others, a Russian woman identified as ST, 33, and Ukrainian man FA, 25, were also arrested nearby. Gramsh military base in central Albania is an unusual location for foreign 'tourists' to visit. The strike demonstrated both the Russians' vulnerability and the Ukrainians' capacity to strike deep behind enemy lines, previously not thought possible. Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility, but President Volodymyr Zelensky alluded to Ukrainian attacks behind enemy lines after the blasts in Crimea, which Russia has blamed on 'sabotage.' On Ukraine's capabilities, one Western official said: 'Ukraine is now consistently achieving kinetic effects deep behind Russia's lines. 'The incidents have been having a material effect on Russia's logistics support, but as importantly, there's a significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership.' They added that the attacks had forced the Black Sea Fleet into a defensive posture and stymied Russia's ability to launch a successful amphibious assault on Odesa on Ukraine's coast, which would cut off much of Ukraine's access to the sea. It comes as the war has entered a phase of 'near operational standstill', with neither side's ground forces having enough concentrated combat power to launch effective offensive actions, the Western official said. Russia is facing an increasingly acute shortage of stocks, even of basic munition, as well as manpower issues as it struggles to reconstitute its forces. 'There was a point when there was constant shelling, there was a real high point, particularly around the battle for the Donbas,' they said. 'We aren't at that high point anymore. 'The whole tempo of the campaign has slowed down, partly because both sides have become more conscious that this is a marathon not a sprint and that expenditure rates and conserving their munitions is important'. At least a dozen civilians were killed by Russian strikes in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv this week, according to the MoD. 'This civilian suffering provides an unusually stark example of Russian cynicism,' the official said, adding that Moscow was not planning to launch an offensive in the area or gain any major operational advantage from the bombardment. Meanwhile, the head of the GCHQ intelligence service said Moscow had failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine. 'So far, President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the West,' Sir Jeremy Fleming wrote in an op-ed in The Economist. 'Just as with its land invasion, Russia's initial online plans appear to have fallen short.' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in televised remarks Friday that statements from Ukrainian officials about striking facilities in Crimea mark 'an escalation of the conflict openly encouraged by the U.S. and its NATO allies.' Ryabkov said Russian officials had warned the U.S. against such actions in phone calls with high-level members of the Biden administration. He added that 'deep and open U.S. involvement' in the war in Ukraine 'effectively puts the U.S. on the brink of becoming a party to the conflict.' 'We don't want an escalation,' Ryabkov said. 'We would like to avoid a situation where the U.S. becomes a party to the conflict, but so far we haven't seen their readiness to deeply and seriously consider those warnings.' In response to the attacks, Putin sacked his Black Sea naval commander earlier this week. The removal of Igor Osipov marked the most prominent sacking of a military official in the nearly six months since Russia launched its war on Ukraine. State-owned RIA said the new chief, Viktor Sokolov, was introduced to members of the fleet's military council in the port of Sevastopol. One source said it was 'normal' that the appointment was not publicly announced at a time when Russia is conducting what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Speculation has followed that Osipov was sacked following the sinking of the Moskva flagship on April 14, but the naval commander appears to have kept his job until recently. Osipov was absent from the Red Square 'victory parade', with Moscow claiming he was 'not in the mood' to appear following the loss of the flagship."
2022-08-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11130153/Pop-star-28-filmed-dancing-Finlands-married-party-Prime-Minister-DENIES-affair.html,"EXCLUSIVE: 'Hand on heart I can just say nothing inappropriate happened': Pop star, 28, filmed enjoying intimate dance with Finland's married 'party Prime Minister' Sanna Marin, 36, DENIES they're having an affair","The rock star who was secretly videoed dancing intimately with Finland's party-loving prime minister has insisted that they are not having an affair. Olavi Uusivirta, 28, claimed that he and prime minister Sanna Marin, 36, were simply 'friends' and 'nothing inappropriate' had happened between them. The footage which emerged on Friday showed the pair dancing hip-to-hip at 4am in a Helsinki nightclub just a stone's throw away from the country's Parliament building. The grainy mobile phone video featured Ms Marin, who is married with a four-year-old daughter, draping her arms around the singer. He was seen pressing his face against her neck at one point in the clip in a gesture that some elements of the Finnish media have claimed was a kiss. The Polish leader today defended Finland's party-loving Prime Minister, saying he was 'very happy' to see her enjoying a night out. Mateusz Morawiecki said: 'The prime minister has a reason to be happy because Finland joined NATO,' Mateusz Morawiecki told a news conference when asked about the videos. 'So if on this occasion the prime minister of Finland drank a little more Finlandia (vodka) and because of this danced, there is nothing terrible in that.' NATO's 30 allies signed the accession protocol for Sweden and Finland last month, allowing them to join the nuclear-armed alliance once all member states ratify the decision. Witnesses told Finnish media that she danced with another two men in similar fashion and sat on the laps of another two during the high-spirited night out. But Finnish singer-songwriter Uusivirta who got divorced from his wife last year, dismissed any suggestion that he was in a relationship with his country's leader. In a post on his social media accounts, he said: 'There has been speculation in the public about the quality of the relationship between me and prime minister Sanna Marin. 'Hand on heart I can just say it like it is: we are friends and nothing inappropriate has happened. I won't comment on the matter anymore publicly. Have a great weekend!' Uusirvirta and Ms Marin were filmed on the dancefloor at Klubi nightclub which is part of the Ravintola Teatteri restaurant and bar complex in central Helsinki. The nightspot is known as one of the trendiest in Finland's capital and attracts a well-heeled crowd of party lovers of all ages. MailOnline can reveal that a lounge area where revellers can relax with drinks features a collection of erotic portraits of naked women on the walls. The four full frontal paintings all feature natural-looking women, rather than skinny catwalk models, reflecting Finland's relaxed attitude to nudity. Staff at the Teatteri today refused to comment about their prime minister's visit to the complex which was filmed in the early hours on August 7. One waitress told a MailOnline reporter: 'Of course we are not saying anything. There is nobody here who will talk to you. 'We cannot confirm whether our prime minister was here. Anyway, how is your prime minister Boris Johnson?' The new video is believed to have been filmed on the same night as earlier footage showing Ms Marin partying with celebrity friends in two apartments. One of the videos raised eyebrows in Finland as it featured someone in the background shouting 'Flour Gang'. The word 'flour's is often used as slang for cocaine in Finland. But Ms Marin has strongly denied ever taking drugs and said she saw no drugs on the night in question. Fun-loving Ms Marin's appearance in the videos has sparked a debate in Finland about whether she should be out drinking and socialising with friends Some commentators have accused her of behaviour which is unbecoming of a world leader, while others have pointed out that she might not have been capable of making proper decisions if an emergency had arisen during her party weekend. But many are more relaxed and say that she deserves to let her hair down, like anyone else. MailOnline can reveal that Uusirvirta and Ms Marin posed with three other women for a group picture at Helsinki's Flow music festival earlier this month. The singer posted the picture on his Instagram account on August 12 with a message saying, 'Happy Flow' accompanied by three emojis of cherries. His followers were quick to comment on the presence of the prime minister in a sparkly top standing alongside him in the image. One said: 'A person has the right to go and spend time with their friends on the weekend, even if they are in high office.' Another added: 'Sanna, you are a young woman… do what you will… you do a good job, then you can also have a lot of fun.' But a third responded saying: 'I don't want to see the prime minister on Vogue's cover - on vacation – on festivals – party – in a glitter dress. I want to see the prime minister taking care of the affairs of the citizens of Finland.' Ms Marin answered her critics by holding a press conference on Friday when she admitted that she had taken a drugs test to prove to her critics that she had not taken anything. She insisted that 'everyone needs a fun and relaxed evening out' and that she should be allowed to enjoy herself after spending most of her time juggling the responsibilities of governing her country and being a mother. Ms Marin also claimed that 'nothing inappropriate' had happened in the videos, and her only regret was that 'private' footage had made it into the public domain. When it was put to her that she might have been required to respond to an emergency while out partying, she replied that her entire time in office has been spent in 'crisis' and she had never been called for a meeting in the middle of a Saturday night. Questioned specifically about Finland's growing military threat from Russia, she said that her security services would have detected a troop build-up on the border ahead of time and informed her. She insisted that she would have left the nightclub and gone to her desk, had it been required. Ms Marin has consistently made a virtue of her 'normal person' image and claims to have received supportive messages from the public since the videos of her night out leaked. Giving more details of her night out, she said that the evening had been spent in two separate flats with about twenty people, before they headed out into town and went to two bars. The first videos to leak were from the houses of friends, including Finnish pop star Alma and her sister Anna, TikTok influencer Sabin Särkkä, rapper Petri Nygard, TV host Tinni Wikstrom, photographer and influencer Janita Autio, radio host Karoliina Tuominen, as well as MPs from Ms Marin's own Social Democratic party. They show the group dancing to music, signing and posing provocatively. At one point, a voice can then be heard making a reference to 'flour gang'. She is said to have arrived the Klubi nightlclub at around 2.30am and stayed in until 4.30am. Ms Marin wed long-term partner Markus Raikkonen - a former footballer - in 2020. The couple's daughter was born two years earlier in 2018. She was dubbed 'the coolest politician in the world' by German tabloid Bild just this week for her relaxed and down-to-earth style of leadership which some critics have slammed as 'careless'. The paper described her as 'relaxed, modern and self-confident' but it added that she 'can also party'. Ms Marin belongs to the 'cool generation' which Putin really doesn't like, Bild wrote. Despite the incoming flak for the young prime minister, there are also those who see the videos as giving her a potential popularity boost for behaving the way many young people do. Ms Marin was forced to apologise last December for going out clubbing with her husband until 4am after coming into contact with a Covid-19 case. She came under criticism for missing a text telling her she needed to isolate because she did not have her work phone with her. In a statement on Facebook, she said: 'I am very sorry for not understanding that I needed to do that.' Ms Marin's Instagram lifestyle and celebrity friendships attracted the criticism of Sweden's largest morning newspaper Dagens Nyheter after the nightclub incident. Columnist Saga Cavalli wrote that she 'seems to love surrounding herself with celebrities and likes to pose on social media,' and described it as 'celebrity ass licking'. Ms Marin became one of the youngest world leaders and Finland's youngest ever when she assumed the role of prime minister at the age of 34 in 2019. Not your average stuffy politician! Finnish PM Sanna Marin, 36, seen dancing wildly in leaked video leads Pride events after being raised by two mothers, posed 'topless' on fashion magazine cover and still goes clubbing By Jessica Taylor for MailOnline Sanna Marin has broken down several barriers since she became Finland's prime minister in 2019 when she was just 34 years old. At the time, the daughter of a female same-sex couple became the youngest world leader and the Scandinavian country's third female prime minister. But while Finnish opinion polls for Marin's coalition government remain steadily positive, some people have raised questions about the mother-of-one's 'partying' lifestyle. After a video surfaced of Marin, who shares a daughter Emma Amalia Marin with her husband Markus Räikkönen, dancing with some celebrity friends while music blared in the background, the PM received criticism for her antics. Included in the group of revellers was Finnish singer Alma and her sister Anna, rapper Petri Nygard, TV host Tinni Wikstrom, photographer and influencer Janita Autio, radio host Karoliina Tuominen, as well as MPs from her own Social Democratic party. The video comes just eight months after Marin was forced to apologise for going out clubbing after coming into contact with a Covid-19 case. Pictured out in Helsinki with her friends last December, she did not have her official phone on her, which was where she received the notification she needed to isolate. In 2020, she became the subject of controversy and was accused off posing 'topless' by her critics after appearing on the cover of Finnish fashion magazine Trendi wearing a black blazer without a top underneath. The the politician's outfit choice was branded 'inappropriate' by some social media users after a snap of her wearing the jacket with a deep neckline, and without a blouse underneath, was shared on the magazine's Instagram account. One suggested the outfit 'eroded' her credibility, while another commented: 'Yeah a real role model. It would have been better in the darkest of clouds. Ridiculous that the breasts of a woman appear in two without a blouse. Someone with taste and sense of style.' But Marin's outraged fans were quick to show their support and rally behind her, launching the hashtag #imwithsanna and sharing photographs of themselves posed in similar ensembles to the prime minister's. Bild described her as 'relaxed, modern and self-confident' but it added that she 'can also party'. In 2015 Ms Marin told the Menaiset website that as a child she felt 'invisible' because she was unable to talk openly about her unconventional family. 'The silence was the hardest,' she said. 'Invisibility caused a feeling of incompetence. We were not recognised as a true family or equal with others. But I wasn't much bullied. Even when I was little, I was very candid and stubborn. I wouldn't have taken anything easy.' She also admitted that she never expected to get into politics, telling the publication: 'When I was in high school, I felt that the people who make politics are quite different and come from different backgrounds than I am. At that time, I didn't think it was possible to get involved myself.' Ms Marin, who spent her teenage years working in a bakery, added that her mother has always been very supportive and made her believe she could do anything she wanted. While Marin has criticised the person who leaked the video, she is known for sharing some snippets of her personal life with the public on her Instagram account - including trips with Markus and lavish events where she shows off her glamorous side. Earlier this summer Marin donned a sequinned dress and teamed up with photographer and influencer Janita Autio to let down their hair at the Flow Festival in Helsinki, where it's thought she took to the stage. She also knows how to rock a ballgown and is often pictured on the red carpet at events with Markus. Just two months ago Marin headed up the Pride parade in Helsinki - a cause important to her after being raised by two mothers. The mother-of-one wore a white dress with pink embroidery in an Aztec-style as she waved rainbow flags and walked through the streets of Helsinki. However, while she certainly knows how to party, Marin used her Instagram account to set a good example during the Covid pandemic, posting photos of herself meeting friends outside while socially distanced. She also posts about honest aspects of motherhood, sharing a photo of herself breastfeeding Emma when she was a baby. In May this year, Marin visited Kyiv where she met with Volodymyr Zelenskyy while Ukraine was under attack from Russia. She posted a photo of herself alongside the Ukrainian President on Instagram and wrote: 'Finland and the wide international community condemn Russia's offensive war against Ukraine, which blatantly violates the UN Constitution, international law and the jointly agreed basic principles of European security. 'We must extend support for Ukraine, while we continue to extend sanctions against Russia.' Marin rose to the top job after she was elected as the new leader of Finland's centre-left Social Democratic party. Previously assuming the role of the transport minister Helsinki-born Marin narrowly beat rival Antti Lindtman to take over the role from incumbent Antti Rinne. The mother-of-one was first elected to the City Council of Tampere in 2012 and became its chairperson in 2013 - a role she held until 2017, when she was re-elected. In 2014 she was elected second deputy chairperson of the Social Democratic Party and in 2015 she was voted into the Parliament of Finland from the electoral district of Pirkanmaa. During her rise to success in the political field she charted her pregnancy journey on her Instagram page, sharing selfies of her baby bump and even a candid breastfeeding shot. She's also shared poolside shots from a romantic holiday to Italy in July 2017, during which she and Markus travelled to Portofino, Rome, Sardinia and Veneto, and snaps from Pride events, where she showed her support for same-sex unions. And Marin appears to have a sweet tooth, having shared fun photos of her tucking into ice cream and candy floss. After the video of Marin's latest party antics surfaced, an MP from the Centre Party, Marin's coalition partner, took to Twitter urging the mother-of-one to take a drugs test. Marin, 36, responded to the request in a press conference on Thursday morning and explained her night out had taken place at two bars before the group of around 20 friends headed to someone's apartment. She also agreed to take a test because she had 'nothing to hide'. She told reporters: 'I haven't used any drugs, so it's not a problem to take a drug test, but I also think it's quite special that something like this is required.'"
2022-08-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11130037/Energy-prices-soar-HIGHER-Cost-electricity-gas-hit-6-000-April.html,"Now energy prices could rocket past £6,000 a year this Spring: Fears grow that soaring cost of electricity and gas could plunge millions of UK households into Christmas blackouts as experts warn of looming winter power crisis","Energy bills for the typical family could reach £6,000 a year by next April, it emerged last night. New figures show the energy price cap, to be updated this week, will hit even higher levels next year. The £6,089 figure, released by energy consultants Auxilione yesterday, represents a five-fold increase on where bills were until April this year, before wholesale prices took off and the price cap began to spiral. Since then, gas prices have spiked to levels never seen before, as Vladimir Putin's regime slashed supplies.Hard-pressed families are struggling with bills and face the prospect of more rises over the winter. On Friday, regulator Ofgem will announce the level of the price cap to run from October – as winter hits and energy use rises. It is expected to increase from £1,971 to a crippling £3,576 a year for typical users. It is feared millions will be unable to pay bills over the next year, unless Ministers increase the current £400 they've promised households as a discount. Those who get into debt could be moved to prepayment meters (PPMs) – where they have to pay in advance for gas and electricity, plus pay extra each time they top up to pay off the money owed. The price cap hike comes with Britain in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis, with inflation hitting ten per cent and interest rates rising. The looming economic crisis has dominated the Tory leadership campaign, with the rival camps under pressure to set out fully their plans to tackle it. Kwasi Kwarteng – who looks set to be the next Chancellor – writes in The Mail on Sunday today that 'help is coming'. And consumer groups and MPs say it will be desperately needed. What is the energy price cap? Introduced in 2019, it's a way of limiting what consumers pay to energy firms. Until last April it stood at £1,277, and then it was hiked 54 per cent to £1,971 for the average user. Crucially, the cap does not cover businesses, which face the full brunt of increases. What's happening this week? The next rise will be announced on Friday, and the cap is expected to go up to £3,576. New rules mean it will be updated every three months from October and it is predicted to go up again in January, to £4,799. What's it looking like for April? Industry experts predict it will be more than £6,000 – that means in the space of a year, the average bill is up around five-fold. What is the Government doing about it? The Government has promised £400 discount for every household over the winter, plus an extra £650 for hard-up families and cash for pensioners. But that won't be enough? No. That package was announced when the cap was predicted to be lower – at £2,800, some £700 lower than it will be from October. So what will the new PM do? Liz Truss has so far said little other than suggesting she will axe the green levy, saving bill payers around £150, but Kwasi Kwarteng, likely to be Chancellor in a Truss government, tells the MoS that 'help is on its way'. Rishi Sunak has said he will find up to £10 billion to soften the impact for up to 16 million vulnerable people. Critics say more will be needed, with more targeted help required for those on low incomes. What do they do elsewhere? France has forced state-owned EDF to limit price rises to four per cent. Holland is offering some households €800 (£680) off, plus cutting VAT. Germany is giving €300 (£250) off, plus a further €100 (£85) per child. Italy will give families €200 (£170). Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at consumer advocates Which? said: 'These projected hikes are eye-watering and millions of households will simply not be able to afford their energy bills without further financial support. 'The Government must take urgent further action. Businesses should also make sure customers are getting a good deal and those facing hardship are protected.' Labour MP Thangam Debbonaire said: 'People are having to make unthinkable choices.' PPMs are controversial because homes are cut off if they run out of money. If a customer has no credit, after an 'emergency' cushion – typically £10 – they receive no energy. In the past, energy firms had to obtain a court order to physically install a PPM – with a slot for a key or card to add top-ups, typically bought at a local newsagent. But it has emerged this week that families with smart meters will be automatically switched to pre-payment plans if they can't pay bills. Critics say smart meters, which are connected via the web to energy company computers, were sold to households as a way to help them cut usage – with no mention of this 'secret functionality'. For those still on old-style analogue meters, energy companies must still apply for warrants to swap them over. Suppliers say in such cases they will aim to put in smart meters – turning the pre-payment functionality on and off – since it is cheaper in the long run. But families can still refuse, under law, a smart meter, in which case an older PPM would be installed. A source at one firm said: 'It's going to be a tough winter for families, and also suppliers trying to deal with households who cannot pay bills. It may surprise people but we don't like high bills – there's a bigger chance customers cannot pay. We want to help them avoid getting in debt, which is why you will see most companies asking for the Government to give more help – and up the £400 discount. 'But we know hundreds of thousands or even millions won't be able to pay, and we have to work out how to get that money back from them. That is where prepayment meters come in.' Ofgem said: 'Protecting consumers is our top priority and installing a prepayment meter should only be a last resort for suppliers.' Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said more elderly people will die as their homes turn cold and some will go hungry in an effort to afford energy. Not only will this cause a 'public health emergency', but it will also pile pressure on the NHS, which is already in the middle of a crisis, the group claims. The letter states: 'We are urging you to take urgent and direct additional action to support those who need it most as we approach winter. 'We have been asked to convene this letter on an issue where NHS leaders, would not usually intervene – but they feel they can no longer stay silent. 'Their starting point is that they are already seeing huge suffering in our local communities because of the cost of living crisis. 'With energy prices set to rise, they fear that many people will face the awful choice of skipping meals to heat their homes or having to put up with living in cold, damp, conditions. 'From a health perspective, this will inevitably lead to more illness up and down the country. 'It will lead to worse health outcomes, including damaging children's life chances, as well as exacerbating health inequalities that have already been widened as a result of the pandemic.' The NHS bosses explained that those who cannot afford to heat their home, buy nutritious food or cook a hot meal will see their health 'quickly deteriorate'. This will cause a rise in the number of annual deaths linked to cold homes – which already stands at 10,000 a year. Millions of homes are likely to be kept very cold as people try to save what little they can on their energy bills. Spiraling gas prices are a result of several factors, and first rose sharply after the end of lockdowns around the world amid the coronavirus pandemic. The sharp rise in demand for gas was followed by a huge rise in costs too. Around the world, but especially within Europe, this was made drastically worse by war in Ukraine. Since then Russian gas supplies into Europe have been severely slashed. It has caused the gas price to spike to levels never seen before. In a sign of how serious the crisis is becoming, new figures released this week showed the UK inflation rate is now at least 10.1 per cent, the first time it has hit double figures since 1982. Families across the UK are struggling to have enough money for food and basic bills, as well as rent - with things only set to get worse. The average food bill is set to increase by £533 this year, a serious concern for many families who are already grappling with the choice between eating and heating this winter. There are fears the winter will not only lead to increased pressure on NHS services which are already reaching crisis-point, but higher levels of homelessness and child poverty too. PM Boris Johnson is coming under increasing pressure as critics blast him for refusing to introduce any more measures to support the public before the winner of the Conservative leadership election is crowned. He has been pictured on two separate holidays in recent weeks, with senior members of the government including the Chancellor also taking breaks away. This has led to backlash, especially online, after research has shown a 10.1 per cent inflation rate, new Ofgem price cap predictions and a risk that 45million people will fall into fuel poverty this winter. Earlier this month, a Downing Street spokesperson said it was 'not for this PM to make fiscal interventions during this period' as he returned to work after his honeymoon. During the last month of his premiership, Mr Johnson is expected to pick up around £13,600 in salary. 'It will be for a future prime minister to decide what physical interventions or whether fiscal interventions are necessary but I would simply note that both candidates have have talked about making further support available,' his spokesman said. Asked if it was fair to say the PM had been 'missing in action, the spokesman said 'no', adding: 'There is a significant amount already being done. On cost of living the prime minister will be speaking to the chancellor to make sure that the support that is coming in later in the year is on track.' Gordon Brown has been amongst leading figures criticising the 'vacuum' at the heart of government over the summer period. Small businesses are struggling too. Pubs and restaurants are particularly badly hit as people stay away in order to save money. One of these venues is a 280-year-old pub in Bath which is under threat of closure. The Faulkland Inn located in Radstock, 10 miles from Bath, first opened its doors when George II was on the throne and Britain was at war with Spain. Now, despite weathering over a dozen recessions, two world wars and the Covid pandemic, the soaring energy bills appear to be a battle too far. The village pub is facing closure with the loss of eight jobs because it can no longer afford to keep the lights on, the Guardian have reported. 'Our gas and energy bills have doubled since April and we're facing annual fuel costs of at least £20,000, which will wipe out our profits,' says the landlord, Andy Machen. 'Until April we needed to make £2,500 over the four days a week we are open in order to break even; now we'd need to make £4,000 and are paying staff out of our personal savings.' The pub is one of hundreds of hospitality venues facing the risk of extinction across the UK because of the soaring cost of fuel. Martin McTague, the national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, has warned that the 'toxic cocktail' of rising taxes, energy costs, inflation and shrinking economic growth means 'action is needed right now'. 'The cost of living crisis can't be solved without addressing the cost of doing business crisis,' he said. Tory MP Sir Robert Goodwill received backlash yesterday after suggesting that people must learn how to cook if they want to keep up with rising bills. The energy price cap, which is set by Ofgem, only limits the profits that energy suppliers can take. It does not protect customers from runaway wholesale energy prices. The consultants forecast that bills will slowly drop in the second half of next year, to £5,486 in July and £5,160 in October 2023. But this will be of little comfort to families who are already struggling. KWASI KWARTENG: Liz Truss will deliver affordability, self-sufficiency and security... she has exactly the right approach to helping people through the crisis The brutality unleashed by Vladimir Putin's forces in Ukraine has been horrifying. The humanitarian impact has been catastrophic, but the invasion has also pushed European gas prices to unimaginable highs. Russia is the world's largest natural gas producer. By deliberately restricting exports, they are manipulating the price we pay at home. If there's less gas on the market, we all pay more. When I speak to ministers across Europe, they are all facing the same challenge. Energy rationing is looming for Germany. In France, households are being asked to take showers rather than baths. In terms of physical gas supply, Britain has a strategic advantage. Unlike most of Europe, we are not dependent on Russian gas, so less vulnerable to geopolitical leverage. We are fortunate to have access to our own North Sea gas reserves, the second-largest liquefied natural gas port infrastructure in Europe, and reliable imports from friends and allies. Thanks to a £90 billion investment in clean energy in the past decade, the UK now has one of the most secure and diverse energy systems in the world. With the preparations we have made since January –from buying extra gas, to extending the life of our coal plants – households, businesses and industry can be confident they get the energy they need. However, while our energy supplies are secure, no country is immune from rising prices – least of all Britain. I understand the deep anxiety this is causing. As winter approaches, millions of families will be concerned about how they are going make ends meet. But I want to reassure the British people that help is coming. Right now, work is happening across government to assess all the options at our disposal to mitigate the worst effects of the gas crisis. And in just over two weeks' time, our next prime minister will walk into 10 Downing Street ready to hit the ground running and deliver. On day one, the new prime minister will have the full information and analysis before them, allowing them to work up the best package measures that will help deal with the issue. Liz Truss has said she will do all she can to help households across Britain. She has already announced she will reverse the National Insurance contribution rise and introduce a temporary moratorium on energy levies. Of course, she will look at what more can be done to help families, but it is entirely reasonable not to detail the exact shape of that support until she has all the information to hand. Liz has also been extremely clear that without radical supply-side reform, we cannot protect ourselves from this gas crisis, or other price shocks into the future. She understands the need to secure Britain's energy independence. That means generating and producing more energy in the UK – and for the UK – so we are no longer held hostage by rogue petrostates. We need to crack on with more nuclear power stations, back British-made small modular reactors, invest in cheap renewable energy such as offshore wind and lift the ban on shale gas extraction in England where there is local consent. We also need to maximise North Sea oil and gas production. Rather than slapping a punitive windfall tax, as Rishi Sunak has done, we need to incentivise investment in domestic oil and gas for our energy security. I appreciate windfall taxes are sometimes popular. But popularity won't keep the lights on. We need to boost North Sea production, or we will end up importing more from abroad, exacerbating the problem even further. Energy produced in Britain is by far the safest option, and that's how Liz will deliver security, affordability and self-sufficiency for our country and our people. In the meantime, she has offered a bold and ambitious vision for the country that is based on her core principles of higher growth and lower taxes. I share Liz's firmly-held view that we must allow people to keep more of the money they earn. She understands that your money is far better spent by you, rather than the State. Cutting taxes will have the double effect of supporting hard-working people and triggering economic growth. Liz is right to focus on reversing the 70-year-high tax burden and going for growth. Because without economic growth, wages won't rise and jobs will be lost. Each tax we levy acts as a disincentive on economic activity. The gas crisis is not going anywhere in the short term, but work is being done to furnish the new prime minister with the detailed options and information needed to tackle the situation head on from day one. Liz Truss has exactly the right approach to helping people through the crisis, to grow our economy and boost our energy security to make Britain more resilient in the long term."
