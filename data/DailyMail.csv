2022-11-05,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11394307/Putins-deranged-Hiroshima-threat-conversation-Macron.html,Putin's deranged Hiroshima threat: Russian leader tells Macron the 1945 atom bomb is proof 'you don't have to launch nuclear strike on a major city to win a war',"Russian leader Vladimir Putin has alarmed Western leaders by referencing the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in a conversation with French president Emmanuel Macron, diplomatic sources have said. According to the sources, Putin expressed the view that the bombings – which triggered the Japanese surrender and the end of the Second World War – demonstrated that ‘you don’t need to attack the major cities in order to win’. The United States detonated two atomic bombs over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively. The bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians. Japan surrendered to the Allies on August 15. The reported remarks come amid growing concern that the Russian leader could be prepared to use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, where Russian forces have suffered increasing setbacks in the conflict. A source said: ‘Macron was distinctly alarmed. It sounded like a very heavy hint that Putin might detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the east of Ukraine, while leaving Kyiv intact. That appeared to be the thrust of his remarks.’ A French government source told this newspaper: ‘The two presidents have undoubtedly discussed the risk of nuclear weapons use. Putin wants to get the message across that all options are on the table, in line with Russian doctrine relating to nuclear weapons.’ This newspaper revealed last week that during the final days of her time in Downing Street, Liz Truss became increasingly concerned that Putin might use a ‘battlefield’ nuclear weapon in Ukraine – to the extent that she became fixated with the weather forecast in case the wind blew a radioactive cloud over the UK. Ms Truss had been told by the intelligence agencies that Putin might explode a weapon in the air above the Black Sea, which would show the West what he was capable of without triggering a full-scale nuclear war. Officials had warned that Putin might ‘go nuclear’ after Ukrainian forces attacked the road bridge connecting Russia and Crimea, something the Russian president had said would ‘cross a red line’ and prompt ‘judgment day’. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky was told by his security services there was a ‘very high’ risk that Russia might use tactical nuclear weapons. Putin warned that if Western forces endangered the ‘integrity’ of Russian territory then ‘we will certainly use all the means at our disposal’, adding: ‘This is not a bluff.’ On October 12, Mr Macron said in an interview that France would ‘evidently’ not use nuclear weapons in response to a Russian nuclear attack on Ukraine. He said: ‘France has a nuclear doctrine that is based on the vital interests of the country and which are clearly defined. These would not be at stake if there was a nuclear ballistic attack in Ukraine or in the region.’ Mr Macron last spoke to Mr Zelensky on Tuesday, when he agreed to help boost Ukraine’s air defences. The French president’s last publicised phone call with Putin was on September 11 when Mr Macron ‘demanded a ceasefire in Ukraine, and restoration of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity’. The revelation about the Hiroshima/Nagasaki comments came as Putin warned the residents of the Ukrainian city of Kherson to leave or face being forcibly deported to Russian-held territory. Kyiv’s forces have been steadily advancing on the strategic port, which is the only major city gained by Moscow since its troops invaded in February. At least 70,000 people are reported to have been moved already from Kherson, with Russian soldiers also reported to be leaving the city. Putin said: ‘Those who still live in Kherson should certainly be removed from the area of the most dangerous hostilities. ‘Civilians should not suffer from shelling, from attacks, counter-attacks or something like that.’ Officials in Ukraine have admitted privately that they are wary, saying it could be an attempt to lure their troops into a trap. Putin also claimed that 318,000 military recruits had signed up for duty during the recent mobilisation – exceeding his target of 300,000 – of which 49,000 were already involved in active fighting in Ukraine. The Ministry of Defence said this weekend that Putin was planning to deploy special forces to execute his own troops if they retreat from the war in Ukraine – so-called ‘blocking units’ which ‘threaten to shoot their own retreating soldiers in order to compel offensives’. A spokesman for the French government declined to comment. The Russian embassy in London was approached for comment. The news that Vladimir Putin has openly discussed using nuclear weapons against Ukraine with President Macron should shock but not surprise us. The Russian dictator has crossed so many red lines in the course of this war – the indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets such as residential flats and hospitals, the repeated breaking of ceasefire agreements over humanitarian corridors, the use of white phosphorus and thermobaric weapons. Then there’s the flattening by 500kg bombs of the Mariupol theatre where children had been sheltering (the word ‘children’ was prominently displayed in large Cyrillic Russian lettering), the deliberate use of rape and torture and the attempted disposal of the evidence in mass graves. Little can genuinely shock us now. Yet we must examine our consciences and recognise that Putin’s threats to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine should indeed shock us all over again, however repulsively he has behaved so far. Nuclear warfare is a Rubicon. And if Putin crosses it, that must mark him as an international pariah whose ousting will be the duty of any world leader worthy of the name. Of course, as ever with him, the remarks that Putin made about the precedents for his intended action were couched in ignorance. When he claimed that ‘you don’t have to bomb the major cities to win a war’ – a sinister reference to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – he ignored the fact that the larger Japanese cities of Tokyo and Kyoto had already seen terrible destruction by then. Similarly, Berlin suffered huge casualties before the war was won against Germany. To equate the Allied destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end a world war against fascism in which about 60 million people had died after six years, with the maniacal dreams of today’s Russian fuhrer is to delve into the mind of a dictator who is starting to recognise that he might lose the war he so stupidly started. As with his historically illiterate 6,500-word essay of July 2021 entitled ‘On the Historical Unity of the Russian and Ukrainian Peoples’, which was intended to provide the intellectual justification for his invasion of Ukraine the following February, Putin’s grasp of history is dangerously weak considering the vast weight he places on it to justify actions with devastating real-life consequences for millions of people. The signs are that the Russian high command knows it will have to give up Kherson in the south, the only major Ukrainian city it has captured in this war so far. Senior commanders are evacuating, leaving only untrained conscripts to try to hold up the relentless Ukrainian advance. Kherson is nearly 400 miles to the east of the disputed Donbas region, and when it falls – which many experts are predicting will happen before Christmas – there will be no Russian-occupied city to the west of the Dnipro river. It is therefore possible that Putin’s disgracefully inflammatory remarks regarding nuclear weapons are merely a bluff to distract from his coming humiliation, more of the same nuclear brinkmanship in which he has indulged regularly since the invasion, often when things are going badly. On occasion he and his defence minister Sergei Lavrov have brought up the nuclear option to try to split Nato. Indeed, mentioning it to Macron, who is notoriously the least anti-Putin of the major Western leaders, and the most open to an negotiated ‘off-ramp’ settlement, might be just the latest iteration of this bluffing, combined with the macho posturing that Putin enjoys. At least this time he did it with his shirt on. If he truly thinks he will win the Russo-Ukrainian War with nuclear weapons, he has still not taken the measure of the Ukrainian people, let alone understood the limits of the rest of the world’s patience. So far, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and several other major countries upon which what is left of the Russian economy depends, have indulged Putin to a far greater degree than they would have if it had been a democratic Western-leaning nation that had transgressed so foully against every decent international norm. Selling huge amounts of cheap oil and gas, buying weapons, and generally acting as a thorn in the side of the West, Putin has been a useful friend for these countries, which have not yet denounced him in the United Nations. Yet were Putin to let off a nuclear bomb, all of those countries except Iran would be forced to sever ties with Russia – partly because of their own on-the-record denunciation of nuclear first-use, but also because the revulsion would be felt strongly by their own populations. Putin only has four allies in the United Nations today – the paradises of Syria, Belarus, North Korea and Eritrea – but 30 that regularly abstain in votes rather than condemn what is happening in Ukraine. A nuclear bomb would force them off the fence, and declare Putin an international leper. All it would take would be for the wind to change direction after a nuclear attack for leukaemia-inducing clouds of fallout to drift towards Belarus, Russian-held Crimea, or south-western Russia itself. Such considerations might even induce anti-Putin elements in the military to refuse to undertake such a clearly immoral order as to use even tactical nuclear weapons in a war that is not existential for Mother Russia. It would certainly revivify internal opposition to Putin within Russia, depleted somewhat recently by the exodus of the intelligentsia and educated middle classes, but still bravely led by the political prisoner Alexei Navalny. In retrospect, for all that Ukraine was lauded internationally for giving up her nuclear weapons under the Budapest Agreement in 1994, it proved an appalling misjudgment. Were Putin to use a nuclear weapon, the message would go out to every country that could build one – Japan, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan and Egypt among them – that they needed nukes as soon as possible. The consequences for global proliferation, and thus Armageddon, would be incalculable. All this is before considering what Nato might have to undertake in response to such a monstrous escalation of the war, or indeed what the Ukrainians themselves might do. Certainly, surrender is not an option because they have seen what comes of Russian occupation in places where mass graves have been unearthed, such as Bucha, Mariupol and Izyum. If today President Zelensky was presented with an opportunity to have the highly capable Ukrainian secret services and special forces smuggle a dirty bomb into Red Square in Moscow, he would not take it. After Putin had let off a nuclear weapon against his homeland, why would he hesitate? You might not have to ‘bomb the major cities to win a war,’ but what if the Ukrainians, in response to an attack, were to make the Kremlin and its environs uninhabitable for three generations? Vladimir Putin is faced with what for him might genuinely be an existential decision. We know he has practised and wargamed the use of nuclear weapons, and now he is openly discussing their use with a Western leader (who one hopes was at least eloquent in dissuasion). The fact that no leaders in the world today beyond Kim Jong-un and the Iranian mullahs make such nuclear threats shows us where Putin has now reached in his terrifying descent into evil."
2022-11-05,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11394445/Liz-Truss-FOURTH-new-mobile-phone-number-July-alleged-Russian-hacking.html,Liz Truss is on her FOURTH new mobile phone number since July after she was allegedly hacked by Russian agents,"Liz Truss is on her fourth new mobile phone number since July, as the security services battle to protect her from being further compromised by foreign powers. The Mail on Sunday revealed last week that the former Prime Minister had to change her number during the summer leadership contest after she was hacked by agents suspected of working for Russia. Now this newspaper can disclose new details about the panic the hack caused in Ms Truss’s team – and how she is still suffering the consequences. A former aide says Ms Truss, who was Foreign Secretary, was ‘ashen-faced’ when she was told that the number she had been using for more than a decade had been ‘compromised’. She was also warned a year’s worth of messages – including exchanges with former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and sensitive information about military strategy in Ukraine – were in the hands of an individual who had alerted her office to the security breach. The aide said: ‘GCHQ laid the blame for the hack squarely at the feet of Russia. Liz was told that the individual had agreed to hand them over because they were clearly the work of Russia.’ One adviser in the room asked Ms Truss what she worried might be in the messages. She is understood to have replied: ‘Stuff between me and my guys.’ Ms Truss initially told just two of her closest advisers about the hack out of fear the information would leak but more knew as the campaign progressed. The aide added Ms Truss ‘exchanged concerned looks’ with her political aide responsible for national security policy while explaining events. As soon as they were notified of the unprecedented security breach, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case moved to ensure information about the incident was suppressed. ‘The individual who had been handed the messages was advised in strong terms not to publish on security grounds,’ the aide said. They added that questions have been raised about why GCHQ was unaware of the hack until the individual came forward with the messages. It is believed that key international allies the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand – who comprise the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence alliance – were informed. According to one security source: ‘As a matter of normal protocol, intelligence of this nature will have been shared with Five Eyes. But that will probably have been within the intelligence community, rather than at Ministerial level.’ Initially security services believed the phone may have been hacked while Ms Truss was overseas, either in her role as Foreign Secretary or as International Trade Secretary. According to one security source: ‘What people miss is hacking like this is relatively easy. Lots of countries do it, including Tanzania, Ethiopia, etc.’ Particular focus was paid to Ms Truss’s trip to Moscow in February, where she held talks on the Ukraine crisis with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. However officials with knowledge of that visit claim it is unlikely that was where the hack occurred. ‘Liz took extensive security precautions in Russia,’ one Government source revealed. ‘She was given a temporary “burner” phone, and the aircraft carrying her didn’t stay on Russian soil to ensure its own communications systems couldn’t be compromised.’ GCHQ believes the hack probably occurred on British soil. After the incident, Ms Truss was handed a secure phone for the duration of the leadership campaign. However, after she entered No 10, it was felt an even higher level of precaution was required. In early September she was handed her third phone in as many months. But the technology in the third phone was so sensitive that when she stood down last month she was required to hand it back in – and had to change her number for a fourth time. Tobias Ellwood, Tory chairman of the Defence Select Committee, said: ‘This is a constant threat from Russia. They are getting better and better at cyber-attacks and hacking. It is something for the intelligence and security committee to investigate.’"
2022-11-05,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11393969/Russia-sends-North-Korea-30-thoroughbred-horses-amid-claims-Kim-Jong-helping-war-efforts.html,Do Putin and Kim have an 'arms for horses' deal? Russia sends North Korea 30 thoroughbred horses by train after Pyongyang shipped Moscow artillery shells in bid to bolster its bungled Ukraine invasion,"Russia has sent 30 prized thoroughbred horses to North Korea just days after the White House alleged Pyongyang supplied artillery shells for Putin's war efforts. The prized Orlov Trotters were shipped via cargo train and are considered a sign of status and wealth in North Korea. There are mounting concerns the shipment may have been payment for Kim Jong-un's support of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, particularly after Russian media revealed plans are underway to deliver medicine to the pariah state in the near future. On Wednesday, the White House revealed intelligence suggested North Korea was covertly sending weapons shipments to bolster Russia's supplies. 'Our information indicates that the DPRK is covertly supplying Russia's war in Ukraine with a significant number of artillery shells, while obfuscating the real destination of the arms shipments by trying to make it appear as though they're being sent to countries in the Middle East or North Africa,' John Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council, said. Mr Kirby said the shells would not 'change the course of the war', but raised enough of a concern that it would be monitored by United States officials moving forward. Both Russia and North Korea have denied the allegations. According to the 38 North project, which monitors developments with North Korea, a train crossed into Russia on Friday afternoon, marking the first time the route is known to have been used since 2020. The 800-metre Tumangang Friendship Bridge is the only land link between the two countries, but was blocked in February 2020 amid rising concerns about the Covid pandemic. Russian state media said the 30 thoroughbreds - five stallions and 25 mares - were quarantined in Russia before making the journey into North Korea. A professor at the Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, Artyom Lukin, told NK News in 2020, North Korean dignitaries, including Kim Jong-un, favoured Orlov Trotters because of their 'royal look'. 'In 2003, Putin gifted Orlov horses to Kim Jong Il as a birthday present,' he said. 'The North Koreans came to like Orlov trotters. I think one reason they took to them is the Orlovs' magnificent, royal look as well as their good temper.' Kim Jong-un was pictured on the back of an Orlov Trotter in October 2019, when he climbed the sacred Mount Paektusan on horseback. North Korea was one of the only countries to publicly recognise the independence of Ukrainian regions that were 'liberated' by Russia during the war. As Putin's war efforts stagnate, UK government defence chiefs revealed he is planning to deploy special units to shoot his own military if they retreat. Britain's Ministry of Defence said Russia will deploy so-called 'blocking units' which 'threaten to shoot their own retreating soldiers in order to compel offensives'. 'Due to low morale and reluctance to fight, Russian forces have probably started deploying 'barrier troops' or 'blocking units',' the Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update on Friday. 'Recently, Russian generals likely wanted their commanders to use weapons against deserters, including possibly authorising shooting to kill such defaulters after a warning had been given. Generals also likely wanted to maintain defensive positions to the death.' Joseph Stalin used 'barrier troops' in the Second World War as part of his 'No One Turn Back' order."
2022-11-05,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11393945/Fury-Iran-FINALLY-admits-sent-Russia-suicide-drones-used-Putin-rain-death-Ukraine.html,Fury as Iran FINALLY admits it sent Russia 'suicide drones' used by Putin to rain down death on Ukraine: Kyiv warns the Islamic Republic the 'consequences of helping Moscow will be greater than the benefits',"Iran sparked fury in Kyiv as the country admitted for the first time on Saturday that it had sent drones to Russia - but insisted they were supplied to its ally before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. In response, Kyiv has warned Iran that the 'consequences' of supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine are greater than the 'benefits'. This comes as Kyiv and its Western allies have accused Russia of using Iranian-made 'kamikaze' drones in recent weeks to carry out attacks in Ukraine and hit key infrastructure sites. Previously, Tehran denied the accusations, but on Saturday Iran's foreign minister said a small number of the vehicles had been sent to Moscow. Iran's Hossein Amir-Abdollahian was quoted as saying that drones had been sent to Russia before the invasion began in late February. 'We supplied Russia with a limited number of drones months before the war in Ukraine,' the official news agency IRNA quoted Amir-Abdollahian as saying. For weeks, Russian forces have rained missiles and explosive drones onto Ukraine infrastructure, as a major Ukrainian ground offensive - propelled by Western arms deliveries - has pushed Russian troops back in swathes of the country. Russian strikes over the past month have destroyed around a third of Ukraine's power stations and the government has urged Ukrainians to conserve electricity as much as possible. Ukraine's state energy company on Saturday announced additional power rationing in Kyiv and several other regions of the country. 'In a telephone conversation with the Ukrainian foreign minister last week, we agreed that if there was evidence (of Moscow's use of Iranian drones), he would provide it to us,' Amir-Abdollahian said. 'If the Ukrainian side keeps its promise, we can discuss this issue in the coming days and we will take into account their evidence,' he added. And he again denied Iran had supplied missiles to Russia, calling the accusations 'completely false'. In response Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesman hit back and warned Iran on Saturday in a post on Facebook that 'the consequences of complicity' with Moscow would be 'greater than the benefit from Russia's support.' 'Tehran should realise that the consequences of complicity in the crimes of the Russian Federation's aggression against Ukraine will be much greater than the benefit of Russia's support,' foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said. Kyiv claims around 400 Iranian drones have already been used against the civilian population of Ukraine and that Moscow has ordered around 2,000. Britain and the European Union have imposed sanctions on three Iranian generals and an arms firm accused of supplying Russia with drones. Ukrainian and Russian forces appear to be gearing up for a fierce battle in Kherson, a southern city with a population of around 288,000 people before the conflict. It was the first major Ukrainian city to fall to Russian forces after the Moscow invasion. Russia has been pulling civilians out of the Kherson region, with President Vladimir Putin saying residents must be 'removed' from danger zones. But Kyiv has likened the departures to Soviet-style 'deportations' of its people. The Ukrainian presidency has accused the Russians of 'trying to identify residents who refuse to be evacuated' to Moscow-occupied areas further away from the front line. A judge in a Ukrainian town controlled by Moscow was in a 'serious' condition after surviving an assassination attempt, a separatist leader in Donetsk said Saturday."
2022-11-05,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11393641/Ukrainian-nurse-abducted-home-HANGED-street-pro-Russian-police.html,Ukrainian nurse is 'abducted from her front garden and HANGED in the street by pro-Russian police after confronting Putin's troops',"A Ukrainian nurse was allegedly abducted from her own home and hanged in front of a courthouse for rebuffing occupiers in Russian-occupied Ukraine. Disabled children's nurse Tetyana Mudryenko, 56, and her husband Anatoly Orekhov, 69, were reportedly kidnapped on October 7 from their front garden in the occupied coastal city of Skadovsk, in the Kherson region of Ukraine. On a seaside walk in the spring, Mrs Mudryenko and her sister came across a group of Russian soldiers wearing balaclavas - and confronted them asking: 'Why are you here? Will you shoot me?' Eyewitness reports say that in early October Mrs Mudryenko criticised Ukrainian police officers who were cooperating with Russians. The Financial Times reported she cried: 'Skadovsk is Ukraine!' She was then dragged into the streets by pro-Moscow authorities and hanged in public execution on October 15. Her official cause of death was recorded as 'mechanical asphyxiation' by the medical examiner. Mrs Mudryenko's twin sister Natalia Chorna, 56, warned her not to antagonise the Russian troops. 'In occupied Skadovsk, you can't have your own opinion,' she said. The sisters attended demonstrations in Skadovsk since the Russian occupation in late February, chanting slogans and singing Ukrainian songs. They demanded that Mayor Oleksandr Yakovlev, who was taken prisoner, be released. Ms Chorna said that during one protest pro-Russian forces unexpectedly threw smoke grenades at the crowd and chased protesters down two blocks. Ms Chorna learned her sister, also known as Tanya, was missing from pro-Ukrainian members of the public, the Ukrainian non-governmental organisation The Media Initiative for Human Rights reports. Natalia Chorna later found out about sister's death when she was sent photos of her dead body in the morgue along with the medical examiner's report which claimed she died by asphyxiation. It has also been reported that Mrs Mudryenko's home was ransacked by Russian forces who stole her and her husband's car and bicycles. Natalia wrote a post on a social network: 'This is my twin sister, she and her husband have been held in the Skadovsk pre-trial detention center for two days, the husband was beaten, the house was searched, a car and two bicycles were taken. 'She said that ""Skadovsk is Ukraine"". You can't have your own opinion in Skadovsk.' A few days later, the message 'A woman was brought in with strangulation' appeared in another group. 'The contributor's name was erased. I called the occupied police, they answered that they knew my name and threatened that they were waiting for me. I panicked, started calling friends who once worked in law enforcement,' she continues. At first, the occupiers denied the information about Tetyana's death by phone, but on October 15 they confirmed it. Natalie was sent the photo in question from the local morgue. 'One local resident told me that Tetyana was allegedly hanged by police collaborators in front of the court building,' Natalya said. 'People say that the sister's phrase ""Skadovsk is Ukraine"" could have been the reason, and the local internet community wrote that at the time when Tetyana and Anatoliy were kept in the station.' Mrs Mudryenko's husband Mr Oryekhov was also reportedly been released from captivity with a broken arm on October 18 but his whereabouts are currently unknown. The Ukrainian state security service, the SBU, conveyed on Telegram on October 14 that there had been multiple 'instances of murder and torture of local residents during the temporary occupation' of the Kherson region."
2022-11-05,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11393435/Donetsk-judge-sentenced-two-Britons-death-condition-assassination-attempt.html,Donetsk judge who sentenced two Britons to death for fighting in Ukraine is 'in serious condition in hospital with gunshot wounds following assassination attempt',"A Russian judge who sentenced two Britons to death is in a critical condition after being shot in a suspected 'assassination attempt'. Alexander Nikulin is 'fighting for his life' after being hit by a bullet in Vuhlehirsk, in the Russian-controlled region of Donetsk in Ukraine last night. According to Russian news agency TASS, police are still hunting the 'attackers'. Denis Pushilin, leader of the self-declared 'Donetsk People's Republic', said the judge had previously 'sentenced Nazi criminals'. The Nazi label is often attached to Ukrainians as part of Vladimir Putin's attempts to justify his barbaric invasion, launched in February this year. 'There was attempt with the use of firearms on a judge of the Supreme Court of the Donetsk Republic Alexander Nikulin,' Pushilin said on Telegram. 'The Ukrainian regime continues to show its vile terrorist methods,' Pushilin added, 'His condition is assessed by doctors to be stable but serious.' Brits Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, were convicted by Nikulin in June of being 'mercenaries' for fighting with Ukrainian troops, weeks after they were captured by Russian forces during the siege of Mariupol. They appeared behind a metal cage at a court in Donetsk as the verdict was read out. In harrowing scenes, ex-British Army soldier Pinner stared at the ground and appeared distraught and close to tears, while former care worker Aslin remained composed. Judge Nikulin had said: 'The aggregated penalty for the crimes [means] the sentence Aiden Aslin to an exceptional measure of punishment, the death penalty,' before reading out the same verdict for Pinner. The sentence was issued after a three day trial in which the five 'witnesses' in the case did not appear. The Brits were eventually released in September after an agreement was brokered by the Saudi Crown Prince to free a total of 10 POWs who had been captured during fighting in Ukraine. A total of five Britons, along with two Americans, one Swede, one Croat and one Moroccan, were airlifted to Riyadh, where they were checked over before being sent home. In a video which was posted on Instagram, the pair smiled at the camera as they sat in their seats on the plane to Riyadh. Aslin said: 'We just want everyone to know that we are now out of the danger zone and we're on our way home to our families. Pinner, who is sat next to him, chipped in: 'By the skin of our teeth'. Aslin added: 'Not just us, there was in total 10 foreigners that were in captivity. We're going to be pretty quiet... until we get things sorted out, but we just want everyone to know the good news.' It comes as Putin is set to deploy special units to shoot his own military if they retreat from the war in Ukraine, UK government defence chiefs said on Friday. Britain's Ministry of Defence said that Russia will deploy so-called 'blocking units' which 'threaten to shoot their own retreating soldiers in order to compel offensives'. With low morale at a peak among Russian soldiers, Putin is turning on his own men. 'Due to low morale and reluctance to fight, Russian forces have probably started deploying 'barrier troops' or 'blocking units',' the Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update on Friday. 'These units threaten to shoot their own retreating soldiers in order to compel offensives and have been used in previous conflicts by Russian forces,' the briefing added. 'Recently, Russian generals likely wanted their commanders to use weapons against deserters, including possibly authorising shooting to kill such defaulters after a warning had been given. Generals also likely wanted to maintain defensive positions to the death.' Stalin used 'barrier troops' in the Second World War as part of his 'No One Turn Back' order. This comes after the Russian president issued a chilling warning to the residents of Ukraine's occupied Kherson, telling them to leave or face being forcibly deported to Russian-held territory. The despot made his remarks in an interview with state media in Moscow that indicated his troops could soon be on the retreat, with Ukraine pushing further towards the city snatched by Russia's armed forces in the early days of the war. 'Those who still live in Kherson should certainly be removed from the area of the most dangerous hostilities... civilians should not suffer from shelling, from attacks, counter-attacks or something like that,' said Putin. Reports have emerged of Russian soldiers abandoning checkpoints in Kherson and moving to the eastern bank of the Dnipro River. Kirill Stremousov, one of Putin's puppet officials in the occupation administration, last night slapped a 24-hour curfew across the city. The former Ukrainian politician, wanted for treason by Kyiv, said it was 'in order to defend our city of Kherson' from what he called 'terrorist attacks'. He urged civilians to flee, saying columns of Ukrainian vehicles had been spotted on the frontline and that an attack was possible. On Thursday, he admitted 'we have to take some very difficult decisions' after pictures circulated of his main HQ with Russia's flag no longer flying atop it. Officials in Ukraine have admitted privately that they are wary, saying it could be an attempt to lure Ukrainian troops into a trap. The Institute for the Study of War, a US think-tank, said it remains 'unclear' whether the occupying forces truly plan not to put up a fight for the strategic Black Sea port. In another apparent sign of Russia's huge military weakness, Putin yesterday signed a decree allowing serious convicted criminals to sign up with the Russian army, effectively granting murderers and rapists their freedom if they are willing to fight. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of 'energy terrorism' after strikes on Ukraine's facilities left millions of residents without power. Russia has carried out missile and drone attacks on power facilities in recent weeks, leaving 4.5million across the country without electricity."
2022-11-05,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11393163/Russian-police-arrest-suspect-caused-huge-fire-bar-killed-15-people.html,"Moment Russian serviceman, 23, is arrested after 'firing a flare gun into the ceiling of a nightclub' sparking an inferno which killed at least 15 people and injured dozens of others is revealed","Russian police have detained a man suspected of starting a fire at a bar that killed at least 15 people after he reportedly fired a 'flare gun' on the dance floor. The man was detained after the fire broke out at the 'Polygon' bar in Kostroma in the early hours of Saturday morning. Police said at least 15 people were killed, and others injured. The man reportedly arrested was a 23-year-old married man named Stanislav Ionkin. He was detained on suspicion of starting the fire when he fired the flare gun into the ceiling of the night club. Other reports described a fight inside the club which turned into a 'mass brawl'. Fire fighters fought through the early hours to put out the blaze at the bar around 300 kilometres (180 miles) northeast of Moscow. A video from Mash media showed military serviceman Stanislav Ionkin being detained by police over the night club fire. 'Police officers identified and detained the suspect (behind) unlawful acts in an entertainment establishment in the city of Kostroma, which resulted in a fire and the death of people,' Russian police said in a statement. 'He has now been handed over to investigative authorities.' Reports say the suspect, Stanislav Ionkin, had been wounded in the war in Ukraine during clashes in August. After suffering a broken leg, he was hospitalised in the Russian city of Astrakhan. He was on medical leave when he returned to the Kostroma region where he had lived. The video shows Ionkin pleading with police: 'Don't hit me. It's not my fault. Men, don't twist my arms.' He then tells the officers: 'I give up.' The motive for the incident was unclear. Russia's Investigative Committee have since opened a criminal case of 'causing death by negligence'. Among the dead in the nightclub inferno were beautician Natalya Kineshemtseva. Others identified as having died in the blaze were Alexei Yakimov, 40, and Yury Zachinalov. As the inferno ripped through the Polygon club in Kostroma in the early hours of the morning, the fire caused the ceiling to collapse. Some 60 suffered burns and other injuries in the fire which triggered panic among revellers. Authorities said the fire started at around 2.00 am local time and was put out at around 7.30 am. 'People were running out, just screaming and moaning,' said one man in the club. The governor of the Kostroma region, Sergei Sitnikov, earlier said 13 people were killed, but emergency services then said the remains of two other people were found. 'Two more bodies were recovered. This means the number of victims is now 15,' the Russian TASS news agency quoted law enforcement sources as saying. 'He was spending time in the bar with a woman, ordered her flowers, with a flare gun in his hands,' the source told the agency. 'Then he went to the dance floor and fired it.' A horrifying video from inside the nightclub shows the moment the blaze caused the ceiling to collapse. The death toll was reportedly worse due to four fire doors being bolted. Fire-fighters had to use special cutting gear to break in to rescue people. The club was owned by a local politician Ikhtiyar Mirzoyev, a member of United Russia, the main party backing Vladimir Putin. Hero Andrei Kuzmin saved dozens of lives by kicking down a door to allow clubbers to escape. Around 250 people were evacuated from the building. 'When the fight started they switched on the lights, there was a pop and there was instant smoke,' said Kuzmin. 'It was instantaneous. There was a clap, there was smoke, panic, smoke. The only thing I said was 'calm down'. Then I went to kick down the door. I kicked the door open and people went out. 'There were a lot of people in the place because it was very popular. I can't say for sure, but at a rough guess there were about 300 people, because everything was packed, both the bar and the dance floor, and the tables were all taken. '[After the fire started] I wasn't thinking about anything. I was thinking about how I was going to get out of here, that's what I was thinking about. 'I took it [the door] out and the crowd rushed through. If I hadn't taken it out, it would have been terrible. 'We went outside and seconds later there were clouds of smoke bursting through. People were running out, just screaming and moaning. ' A woman clubber said: 'If it wasn't for Andrei, we wouldn't have survived.' A woman named Yulia said: 'The fight started initially, and the bouncers were pushing everyone away. The fight kind of stopped. The it started again on the dance floor. 'I saw smoke where the fight was going on. There was a loud clap and there was a lot of smoke. Luckily we had an emergency exit. 'We ran outside through the kitchen. There was panic and shouting.' Sergei Vinogradov, 45, said: 'We got a lot of people out the window. And then I choked on smoke. I felt I was going to fall down, and I climbed out, too'. He said music was playing, people were dancing and suddenly there was a flash and the plastic ceiling burst into flames. People panicked and ran towards the only unblocked exit. Sergei and his friends broke a window and began dragging people out. He suffered burns on his back and hands. Local emergency services said the blaze had spread out over 3,500 square meters. On its website, 'Polygon' says it acts as an evening and night-time 'place for recreation and entertainment'. By day, it is a typical Russian 'stolovaya' - a casual restaurant serving traditional food. It says it is housed in a 'distribution centre' and is popular with traffic police. State television showed images of dozens of emergency workers fighting a huge fire that had engulfed the single-storey building. The sign 'Polygon' was visible amid the flames raging on its roof. One fire fighter told regional state television that it took 50 people to extinguish the fire and that they had used 20 fire engines. He said the fire was especially difficult to put out because of the risk of the building collapsing. Kostroma, a city on the Volga river of around 230,000 people, is one of Russia's oldest cities and is famous for its medieval architecture and monasteries."

Britain's Ministry of Defence said that Russia will deploy so-called 'blocking units' which 'threaten to shoot their own retreating soldiers in order to compel offensives'. With low morale at a peak among Russian soldiers, Putin is turning on his own men. 'Due to low morale and reluctance to fight, Russian forces have probably started deploying 'barrier troops' or 'blocking units',' the Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update on Friday. 'These units threaten to shoot their own retreating soldiers in order to compel offensives and have been used in previous conflicts by Russian forces,' the briefing added. 'Recently, Russian generals likely wanted their commanders to use weapons against deserters, including possibly authorising shooting to kill such defaulters after a warning had been given. Generals also likely wanted to maintain defensive positions to the death.' Stalin used 'barrier troops' in the Second World War as part of his 'No One Turn Back' order. This comes after the Russian president issued a chilling warning to the residents of Ukraine's occupied Kherson, telling them to leave or face being forcibly deported to Russian-held territory. The despot made his remarks in an interview with state media in Moscow that indicated his troops could soon be on the retreat, with Ukraine pushing further towards the city snatched by Russia's armed forces in the early days of the war. 'Those who still live in Kherson should certainly be removed from the area of the most dangerous hostilities... civilians should not suffer from shelling, from attacks, counter-attacks or something like that,' said Putin. Reports have emerged of Russian soldiers abandoning checkpoints in Kherson and moving to the eastern bank of the Dnipro River. Kirill Stremousov, one of Putin's puppet officials in the occupation administration, last night slapped a 24-hour curfew across the city. The former Ukrainian politician, wanted for treason by Kyiv, said it was 'in order to defend our city of Kherson' from what he called 'terrorist attacks'. He urged civilians to flee, saying columns of Ukrainian vehicles had been spotted on the frontline and that an attack was possible. On Thursday, he admitted 'we have to take some very difficult decisions' after pictures circulated of his main HQ with Russia's flag no longer flying atop it. Officials in Ukraine have admitted privately that they are wary, saying it could be an attempt to lure Ukrainian troops into a trap. The Institute for the Study of War, a US think-tank, said it remains 'unclear' whether the occupying forces truly plan not to put up a fight for the strategic Black Sea port. In another apparent sign of Russia's huge military weakness, Putin yesterday signed a decree allowing serious convicted criminals to sign up with the Russian army, effectively granting murderers and rapists their freedom if they are willing to fight. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of 'energy terrorism' after strikes on Ukraine's facilities left millions of residents without power. Russia has carried out missile and drone attacks on power facilities in recent weeks, leaving 4.5million across the country without electricity."
2022-11-05,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11392983/Australian-sniper-dubbed-Ninja-killed-Ukraine.html,Australian sniper dubbed 'Ninja' is killed in Ukraine while fighting Vladimir Putin's forces as his incredible last act of bravery against the Russians is revealed: 'Our sadness is unfathomable',"An Australian freedom fighter dubbed 'the Ninja' has been killed fighting Russian forces in Ukraine. Trevor Kjeldal, 40, from Brisbane, was reportedly killed in action in the Donbas region of Ukraine this week. Mr Kjeldal, who was described as 'a very treasured and loved member' of his family, is believed to have arrived in Ukraine earlier this year. Social media posts suggest he had been wounded in action in July - suffering near-fatal gunshot wounds - before bravely returning to the frontlines in September. When he was injured, he suffered shrapnel wounds to the head. However, he said he had no plans to return to Australia and wanted to remain in Ukraine until the war is over. 'I've beat the odds once, so let's just see if I can do it again,' Mr Kjedal said at the time. Mr Kjedal is believed to have been serving in the 49th 'Select Carpathian' battalion of the Ukrainian army. He was dubbed 'the Ninja' on social media, after causing a stir during his time on the frontlines. Just last month he told a Nine News crew he felt compelled to help in the war. 'Ukraine was in trouble, they needed people to come and help, so we came and helped,' he said. In October, he also shared his belief that the tide is turning in Ukraine's favour. His death was confirmed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who say they are now providing assistance to his family. In a statement, his family expressed their grief at Mr Kjeldal's death. 'Our depth of sadness at his loss is unfathomable,' the family said. 'We would like to thank DFAT for their ongoing assistance in bringing him home to us. 'At this incredibly sad time, we would request that the media respect our privacy as we grieve.' DFAT expressed its deepest condolences to the family and said it was unable to provide further comment. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also passed on his condolences to Mr Kjeldal's family and friends on Saturday. 'This is tragic news. I remind people that the DFAT advice is that people do not travel to Ukraine,' he said during a press conference in Queensland. 'It is a dangerous place, but my heart goes out to the family and friends of the gentleman involved.' Consular assistance can include support and guidance to families and liaison with local and Australian authorities to assist with funeral arrangements or repatriation of remains. The Australian Government's advice for Ukraine remains at do not travel. Mr Kjedal's death comes as a 23-year-old man from Washington, in the US 'with no military experience who snuck out of his family home' to fight in the Ukraine War also died. Skyler James Gregg was fighting on the frontline with the International Legion in Ukraine - which consists of foreigners and operates under the command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Its believed Gregg died in north-eastern Ukraine when soldiers from the International Legion came under artillery fire in the last week of October, a Ukrainian army contact told The Daily Beast. Despite his father's aversion to the idea Gregg made the decision to sneak out of his home and travel to Ukraine to volunteer despite having no military experience. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin issued a chilling warning last night to the residents of Ukraine’s occupied Kherson – leave or face being forcibly deported to Russian-held territory. The despot made his remarks in an interview with state media in Moscow that indicated his troops could soon be on the retreat, with Ukraine pushing further towards the city snatched by Russia’s armed forces in the early days of the war. ‘Those who still live in Kherson should certainly be removed from the area of the most dangerous hostilities... civilians should not suffer from shelling, from attacks, counter-attacks or something like that,’ said Putin. Reports have emerged of Russian soldiers abandoning checkpoints in Kherson and moving to the eastern bank of the Dnipro River. In another apparent sign of Russia’s huge military weakness, Putin yesterday signed a decree allowing serious convicted criminals to sign up with the Russian army, effectively granting murderers and rapists their freedom if they are willing to fight. Meanwhile, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said yesterday that Russia is deploying so-called ‘blocking units’ which ‘threaten to shoot their own retreating soldiers in order to compel offensives’."
2022-11-05,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11392857/Worried-Biden-laments-Musks-Twitter-spewing-lies-world-despite-mistruths.html,'Worried' Biden laments Musk's purchase of Twitter that 'spews lies all across the world' – despite his own very recent history of bending the truth and making things up,"Joe Biden has claimed that Twitter under Elon Musk's ownership 'spews lies across the world' - with his remarks raising eyebrows given the president's own history of spouting untruths. Speaking at a fundraiser in Rosemont, Ill., on Friday, Biden said he was 'worried' about Musk's October 27 purchase of Twitter. Musk vowed to end censorship on the platform, and stop policing free speech. Biden on Friday said he was disturbed. 'And now what are we all worried about: Elon Musk goes out and buys an outfit that sends - that spews lies all across the world,' the president said. 'There's no editors anymore in America. There's no editors. How do we expect kids to be able to understand what is at stake?' Musk, who fired 3,700 people on Friday - half of Twitter's workforce - was unrepentant amid the torrent of criticism. 'Power to the people!' he tweeted. Biden's concern about the 'spewing of lies' came amid a flurry of mistruths from the president himself. On Tuesday, Biden claimed that the United States has 'the lowest inflation rate' of almost every developed country - despite the US faring significantly worse than Japan, France and Canada and Germany. 'We have the lowest inflation rate of almost any major country in the world. We've done a lot to try to take it under control,' Biden told the crowd in Florida. Inflation in the US as measured by the Consumer Price Index is currently at 8.2 percent, for September's data. Among G7 countries, only Italy and the United Kingdom have worse inflation according to the OECD's latest data, from August. The US is at 8.26 percent, with Italy at 8.37 and the UK at 8.6 percent. Japan, France, Canada, and Germany are all out-performing the US - in Canada, inflation was 7.1 percent, while in France it was 5.91, and in Japan a mere 3 percent. Biden has repeatedly claimed his son, Beau, died in Iraq when in fact he passed away from a brain tumor in a Maryland hospital. Beau Biden, who served as Delaware's attorney general and in the Delaware Army National Guard in the Iraq War, died at age 46 in 2015 from brain cancer. He passed away at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The president has long linked his service, and the military's use of burn pits, to Beau's brain cancer diagnosis. 'In my view, I can't prove it yet, he came back with stage 4 glioblastoma. Eighteen months he lived, knowing he was going to die,' Biden said in 2019. 'Inflation is a worldwide problem right now because of a war in Iraq and the impact on oil, and what Russia is doing — I mean, excuse me, the war in Ukraine,' said Biden on Tuesday. 'And — I'm thinking of Iraq because that's where my son died. The — because he died. 'But the point is that there — you know, that's why it's up.' Biden was also mocked online for his claim about insulin, and its pioneers. One of his signature achievements has been to reduce the cost of insulin for diabetics. 'Okay, you know how much it cost to make that insulin drug for diabetes?' Biden asked the crowd. 'It was invented by a man who did not patent it because he wanted it available for everyone. 'I spoke to him, OK? And guess what? It cost $10 to make. Ten bucks to make. And if you count packaging and everything, you can maybe get it up to $15. 'Well, guess what? They're not going to have to pay more than $35 a month. They'll still make a significant profit instead of an average of $400 a month.' Canadian doctors Frederick Banting and Charles Best successfully isolated the hormone insulin in July 1921. Banting died in 1941, the year before Biden was born. Best died in 1978, five years after Biden was elected to the Senate - making a meeting not impossible, but not confirmed. As far back as 1987, during his first presidential run, Biden was forced to withdraw after it emerged that his claims about his education were exaggerated. He said that he 'went to law school on a full academic scholarship,' and that he 'ended up in the top half' of his law school class, and 'graduated with three degrees from undergraduate school'. If fact, as he later admitted, he had only a partial scholarship, was 76th out of 85 law school student and graduated with one bachelor's degree: a double major in history and political science. Biden, in May, claimed he was 'appointed' to the Naval Academy. 'I was appointed to the Academy in 1965 by a senator who I was running against in 1972,' he said. In his 2008 biography, Biden never mentioned that he considered going to the Naval Academy. Furthermore, the 1965 date does not make sense as Biden graduated from the University of Delaware that year. The Naval Academy does not offer graduate programs. In 2010, Biden claimed that he applied to the Naval Academy in 1960. 'In 1960, I was a pretty good football player at the University of Delaware, and I was one of the guys that applied to come to this great academy,' he said. Biden graduated from high school in 1961. In July 2021, Biden claimed he used to be a truck driver. 'I used to drive an 18-wheeler, man,' he said on a visit to a Mack Truck facility in Pennsylvania. He then clarified that he 'got to' drive one. But challenged by Fox News to produce evidence, a White House spokesperson could only point to a December 1973 article from the Wilmington Evening Journal that showed Biden rode in an 18-wheeler, not that he drove one. In September 2021, he told Jewish leaders that he remembered 'spending time at' and 'going to' the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh after the mass murder of 11 people there in 2018: it later emerged he never visited. The White House said he was referencing a phone call and misspoke. Biden claimed in January this year, while speaking to students of historically black colleges in Atlanta, that he was arrested during civil rights protests - a claim for which there is no evidence. In September, Biden finally admitted that his oft-repeated story about being arrested in South Africa, while attempting to see the imprisoned Nelson Mandela, was not true. Biden set the record straight during a meeting with South Africa's current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in the White House on September 16. Biden recounted meeting Mandela in 1990 and said the anti-apartheid leader thanked him for facing arrest in order to meet him in South Africa. The president told Ramaphosa that meeting Mandela was 'one of the great moments of my career.' 'I was a senator at the time, and we met in the Senate Foreign Relations executive committee room. And he came in we all stood there and said hello to him and the like and afterwards, he asked if he could come by my office and he came by to say thank you because he heard I had been stopped trying to get to visit him, to see him in prison.' Biden then admitted he had never been arrested in South Africa. 'I wasn't arrested, I got stopped, prevented from moving. But he was extremely gracious.' Biden is known for his exaggerations, and his contorted, misremembered stories. The 79-year-old president, who joined the Senate Foreign Relations Committee aged 32, and became its chair in 2001, has frequently spoken about his 'arrest' by the South African police. On February 11, 2020, Biden told a South Carolina audience that he had been arrested in the African nation. 'This day, 30 years ago, Nelson Mandela walked out of prison and entered into discussions about apartheid,' he told the crowd. 'I had the great honor of meeting him. I had the great honor of being arrested with our UN ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him on Robben Island.' Biden did not specify the year, but was in South Africa in 1977. Mandela was held behind bars on Robben Island from 1964 to 1982 - but Robben Island is off the coast of Cape Town, while Biden said he was in the Johannesburg district of Soweto. Later the same month, Biden repeated the story of his arrest to a Nevada crowd at a black history brunch. '[Mandela] came to Washington and came to my office,' Biden said, during a presidential campaign meeting in Las Vegas. 'He threw his arms around me and said, 'I want to say thank you.' 'I said, 'What are you thanking me for, Mr. President?' 'He said: ''You tried to see me. You got arrested trying to see me.''' And at a second Las Vegas event, days later, Biden repeated the arrest story for a third time. He told the crowd he 'came back from South Africa, trying to see Nelson Mandela and getting arrested for trying to see him.' The claim of an arrest was debunked by The New York Times in February 2020, with multiple officials and former colleagues in the Senate telling the paper they had no recollection of the arrest. The paper even noted that Biden's own accounts, in his autobiography and in his statements about Mandela, did not reference an arrest. Fact-checkers, who gave Biden's account 'four Pinocchios' and declared it 'Pants on Fire', did find that he had been separated from black colleagues when landing at the airport in neighboring Lesotho in December 1976. At the time, Biden was among 13 members of Congress to travel to Lesotho. 'When I exited the plane I was directed to one side of the tarmac, while the African American congressmen traveling with me were sent to the other side,' he said. 'I refused to break off, and the officials finally relented.' At the end of February 2020, amid intense interest in whether he was actually arrested, Biden told CNN that he was not. 'When I said arrested, I meant I was not able to move,' Biden said, after recounting what had happened to him. 'Cops would not let me go with them. I wasn't arrested, I was stopped. I was not able to move where I wanted to go.' He did not specify whether that encounter was in Lesotho or South Africa."
2022-11-05,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11392369/The-big-one-coming-Stratcom-commander-warns-lagging-China-tested.html,"'The big one is coming': US military nuclear commander warns America is falling behind China, is 'going to get tested in ways that we haven't been tested in a long time' - and that Ukraine is 'just the warmup'","One of America's most senior military commanders who oversees the US nuclear weapons program has urged the United States to dramatically upgrade its defense capabilities, warning that the China was developing nuclear weapons faster than the U.S. and adding: 'The big one is coming'. Navy Adm. Charles A. Richard, the commander of U.S. Strategic Command, issued an unusually blunt warning on Wednesday, saying that China's nuclear threat was a 'near-term problem'. 'As I assess our level of deterrence against China, the ship is slowly sinking,' Richard said. 'It is sinking slowly, but it is sinking, as fundamentally they are putting capability in the field faster than we are.' He said the military was encumbered by red tape, slow to react, and at risk of being dramatically outspent and outmaneuvered by its adversaries. 'As those curves keep going, it isn't going to matter how good our [operating plan] is or how good our commanders are, or how good our horses are — we're not going to have enough of them. 'And that is a very near-term problem.' He added that the country needed to regain the dynamism and can-do spirit of the 1950s and 60s. 'This Ukraine crisis that we're in right now, this is just the warmup,' he said, addressing the Naval Submarine League's annual gathering in Arlington, Virginia. 'The big one is coming. And it isn't going to be very long before we're going to get tested in ways that we haven't been tested a long time.' Richard, who has led Stratcom since November 2019, is in described by the Pentagon as being 'responsible for the global command and control of U.S. strategic forces to meet decisive national security objectives'. As such, his job is to provide recommendations to the President and Secretary of Defense on the military capacity necessary to keep the U.S. safe, and fulfill its strategic aims. Richard said the current thinking was outdated - and Russian President Vladimir Putin's nuclear sabre-rattling showed that an urgent reassessment was overdue. 'We have to do some rapid, fundamental change in the way we approach the defense of this nation,' he said. 'I will tell you, the current situation is vividly illuminating what nuclear coercion looks like and how you, or how you don't stand up to that.' He said America's rivals, such as China, are making dramatic strides in military innovation - posing a threat to the U.S. Richard said the only bright spot was America's underseas capabilities, with the U.S. submarine fleet. The admiral served on multiple submarines before rising to command Submarine NR-1 - then the U.S. Navy's only nuclear-powered, deep-submergence submarine. He went on to be named Director of Undersea Warfare at the Pentagon, and command the fleet based in Norfolk, Virginia. 'Undersea capabilities is still the one ... maybe the only true asymmetric advantage we still have against our opponents,' Richard said. 'But unless we pick up the pace, in terms of getting our maintenance problems fixed, getting new construction going. 'If we can't figure that out we are not going to put ourselves in a good position to maintain strategic deterrence and national defense.' Richard, who graduated from the University of Alabama in 1982, said the United States had 'lost the art' of rapid response to new threats. He noted that, 60 years ago, America's military was more agile, resourceful and innovative. 'We used to know how to move fast, and we have lost the art of that,' he said, giving as an example the invention of the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile, which entered service in 1960. 'The Air Force went from a request, almost written on a napkin,' he said. 'They figured out in the late 1950s that the Soviet integrated air defense systems were getting to the point that the B-52 just wasn't going to make it in, and we needed a thing called up 'cruise missile.' 'And so, they envisioned what a standoff weapon looks like.' The U.S. military was able to deliver the Hound Dog cruise missile in just 33 months. 'We had two squadrons of B-52s equipped with this 800-nautical-mile Mach two-plus, one megaton nuclear warhead with accuracy that was really good for its day, hanging off the wings of B-52s in less than three years,' he said. 'This weapon was so cool you could actually turn the engines on, on its cruise missiles on your wings, to give you additional thrust on takeoff.' He continued: 'We have got to get back into the business of not talking about how we are going to mitigate our assumed eventual failure.' He said the policy makers needed to 'flip it to the way we used to ask questions in this nation, which is: What's it going to take? Is it money? Is it people? Do you need authorities? What risk? 'That's how we got to the Moon by 1969. We need to bring some of that back. 'Otherwise, China is simply going to outcompete us, and Russia isn't going anywhere anytime soon.' Extraordinary photos of Beijing's military bases in the South China Sea have given the most-detailed view yet of what Xi Jinping has been building — and show them bristling with defenses. The Chinese Communist Party has spent the better part of a decade turning a remote series of atolls and reefs in the region into highly developed military bases that are now equipped with naval guns, anti-aircraft systems, radar arrays, attack ships and hangars capable of housing dozens of fighters. At least two huge vehicle bays have also been built which are large enough to conceal mobile launchers designed to fire anti-ship, anti-air, and ballistic missiles which could be tipped with nuclear warheads. The bases are part of a territory-grab by Xi over the entirety of the South China Sea within borders that Beijing refers to as the 'Nine Dash Line'. By controlling the sea, Xi aims to project power over neighboring countries as well as fertile fishing grounds, and shipping lanes through which $5trillion-worth of goods pass each year. However, Beijing's claims have no basis in international law and were overruled by an international arbitration court. Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims to the same piece of ocean. Fiery Cross Reef Fiery Cross Reef is controlled by China as part of Sansha of Hainan Province, despite Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines all claiming the island as their own. Large, multi-story hangers capable of housing ballistic missiles tipped with nuclear material can be seen across the island next to radar systems. A US Navy reconnaissance mission in March revealed the militarisation of the reefs, but high-quality photos of the islands have not emerged until recently. The mission found the artificial islands armed with anti-ship and anti-aircraft missile systems, laser and jamming equipment and fighter jets. The US sent a P-8A Poseidon plane on the reconnaissance mission, which spotted the structures, despite President Xi's promise not to convert the islands into military bases. US Indo-Pacific commander Admiral John C. Aquilino called the sight 'the largest military build up since World War II' by the People's Republic of China. Beijing says its military profile is purely defensive, arranged to protect what it says are its sovereign rights. The Fiery Cross was the name of a famous British tea clipper, a speedy merchant sailing vessel, which took part in the Great Tea Race of 1866 — where vessels competed to be the first to transport tea from China to Britain. Subi Reef On the smaller side of the Spratly Islands, Subi Reef is also administered by China Hainan province. But under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, only the Philippines has the right to build structures there. From the close-up photos, Subi Reef also appears to feature hangers capable of housing nuclear weapons. China sought to shore up its vast territorial claims over virtually the entire South China Sea by building island bases on coral atolls nearly a decade ago. The US responded by sending its warships through the region in what it calls freedom of operation missions. The US has no claims itself but has deployed Navy ships and aircraft for decades to patrol and promote free navigation in international waterway and airspace. China routinely objects to any action by the US military in the region. The other countries in the area claim all or part of the sea, through which approximately $5 trillion in goods are shipped every year. Mischief Reef On Mischief Reef, one of the larger islands, two Type 022 Houbei class catamaran fast attack missile craft can be seen docked on the left side of the island, readily recognizable by their camouflage scheme. Reports emerged that the People's Liberation Army Navy had deployed Type 022s to the islands last year. The boats can carry up to eight YJ-83 subsonic anti-ship missiles and a 30mm H/PJ-13 Gatling guns. Last April, the missile craft apparently chased away the boat operated on behalf of the ABS-CBN news crew, in an aggressive encounter when they approached the island. The reef sparked a 2016 ruling from the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, which found that China's claim over the island was without basis. Cuarteron Reef Cuarteron Reef photos show naval gun emplacements on a series of towers, alongside a radar gunnery director. China has long used the 'nine-dash line', a maritime boundary drawn up by it in 1947, to justify its jurisdiction over most of the resource-rich sea - often to the displeasure of Hanoi, which also claims parts of the waterway. The nine-dash line is a maritime boundary in the South China Sea drawn up by China, which claims to own the territory inside the line. The U-shaped line was initially claimed by the government of the Republic of China in 1947. In 1992, the Communist Party of China adopted the boundary while updating its law on the territorial sea and the contiguous zone, according to Strategic Regions in 21st Century Power Politics, a Cmabridge Scholas book edited by Martin Riegl, Jakub Landovský, and Irina Valko. Chinese passports issued from 2012 onwards feature the Chinese map printed with the nine-dash line on three pages. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled that there was no legal basis for much of China's claims to the area. The Chinese government has strongly objected to the ruling. Gaven Reef Gaven Reef was first pictured when the Philippine released photographs of Chinese construction work in the disputed waters in 2015. Last year, photos emerged of more than 200 boats lashed together in rows, in an act of aggression from China designed to 'squeeze out' other countries in Asia. The Philippine government's National Task Force-West Philippines Sea said they counted 254 ships as well as four Chinese warships in the Spratly Islands on March 29, 2021. They claimed the ships were not fishing vessels as China said — but instead part of China's maritime militia, an group of sometimes armed civilians in the sea. China refused to move the boats from the area. Hughes Reef Hughes Reef appears to have a helicopter pad and a multi-story building at the other end, complete with what looks like a large swimming pool. Photos of Chinese 'Island Fortresses' emerged last year, which experts said would allow the Chinese government to extend the range of its navy, air force, coastguard and fishing fleets in the region.

The despot made his remarks in an interview with state media in Moscow that indicated his troops could soon be on the retreat, with Ukraine pushing further towards the city snatched by Russia’s armed forces in the early days of the war. ‘Those who still live in Kherson should certainly be removed from the area of the most dangerous hostilities... civilians should not suffer from shelling, from attacks, counter-attacks or something like that,’ said Putin. Reports have emerged of Russian soldiers abandoning checkpoints in Kherson and moving to the eastern bank of the Dnipro River. Kirill Stremousov, one of Putin’s puppet officials in the occupation administration, last night slapped a 24-hour curfew across the city. The former Ukrainian politician, wanted for treason by Kyiv, said it was ‘in order to defend our city of Kherson’ from what he called ‘terrorist attacks’. He urged civilians to flee, saying columns of Ukrainian vehicles had been spotted on the frontline and that an attack was possible. On Thursday, he admitted ‘we have to take some very difficult decisions’ after pictures circulated of his main HQ with Russia’s flag no longer flying atop it. Officials in Ukraine have admitted privately that they are wary, saying it could be an attempt to lure Ukrainian troops into a trap. The Institute for the Study of War, a US think-tank, said it remains ‘unclear’ whether the occupying forces truly plan not to put up a fight for the strategic Black Sea port. In another apparent sign of Russia’s huge military weakness, Putin yesterday signed a decree allowing serious convicted criminals to sign up with the Russian army, effectively granting murderers and rapists their freedom if they are willing to fight. Britain’s Ministry of Defence said yesterday that Russia is deploying so-called ‘blocking units’ which ‘threaten to shoot their own retreating soldiers in order to compel offensives’. n President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of ‘energy terrorism’ after strikes on Ukraine’s facilities left millions of residents without power. Russia has carried out missile and drone attacks on power facilities in recent weeks, leaving 4.5million across the country without electricity."
2022-11-04,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11390737/Xi-Jinping-warns-Putin-not-use-nukes-rare-rebuke-Ukraine-war.html,Xi Jinping warns Putin not to use nukes in Ukraine and urges peace talks in Chinese leader's most direct rebuke yet to the Kremlin,"Xi Jinping has issued a direct warning to Putin not to use nukes in Ukraine in China's bluntest rebuke yet to the Kremlin. Xi also urged German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was visiting Beijing, to push for peace talks - saying the international community should 'create conditions for the resumption of negotiations (and) oppose the use or threat of nuclear weapons.' Scholz, the first Western leader to visit Beijing since Xi was given his third term as leader, urged Xi to put pressure on Putin to end attacks which have killed civilians and destroyed cities. 'President Xi and I agree: nuclear threats are irresponsible and incendiary,' Scholz said after the meeting. 'By using nuclear weapons, Russia would be crossing a line that the community of states has drawn together.' Though Xi stopped short of criticising Putin directly, asking Russia to withdraw its troops, or blaming Moscow for the war - his comments none-the-less mark the biggest public rebuke yet delivered to the Kremlin. Just before Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine on February 24, the two leaders put out a join statement hailing a new era of boundless cooperation and friendship. In the early days of the war, China's foreign ministry repeated Russian talking points about NATO expansionism, the West's 'Cold War mindset', and castigated journalists for using the words 'war' or 'invasion'. But as Moscow's forces have been mauled on the battlefield China's tone has changed. At a summit in Uzbekistan in September, Putin was forced to publicly acknowledge that Xi had 'questions and concerns' after meeting with him. Li Keqiang, China's outgoing premiere who also took part in the talks with Scholz, also said the world 'cannot afford any further escalation' in Ukraine. It comes after Putin warned the West that he is ready to use 'all means' to defend occupied territories in Ukraine, adding that he is 'not bluffing'. '[We] hope the crisis ends soon,' Li said. During lunch with Scholz, Xi stressed that it is easy to destroy political trust but difficult to rebuild it, and both sides need to take care of it, according to Xinhua. Earlier, while greeting Scholz at the Great Hall of the People in the heart of Beijing, Xi urged the two countries to work more closely on international issues. Before their lunch of beef strips, prawn and sweet and sour fish, Scholz told Xi that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was creating problems for the rules-based global order, according to a recording of the remarks provided by the German delegation. During a news conference after his discussion with Li, Scholz said he raised the issue of Taiwan. China claims the island as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. 'Like the U.S. and other countries, we are pursuing a one-China policy. But I have made equally clear that any change in Taiwan's status quo must be peaceful or by mutual consent,' he said. While touching on the human rights of minorities in the Xinjiang region, Scholz denied Germany was meddling in China's domestic affairs. He also asked Xi, who has supported President Vladimir Putin since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, to promote peace. Scholz's visit is likely a welcome development for the Chinese leadership, who will be looking to shore up relations with the outside world after Covid. Scholz is pushing for greater market access at a time when the German economy, Europe's largest, is fighting decades-high inflation and a looming recession. The meeting comes ahead of world leaders gathering for the COP27 summit in Egypt a week from now, followed by the G20 summit the following week. Putin is not expected to attend COP27 and it is unclear whether he will go to the G20, after President Zelensky was given permission to address the summit by video."
2022-11-04,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11391233/Greenpeace-activists-stopped-tanker-carrying-Russian-diesel-unloading-UK-CLEARED.html,Greenpeace activists who stopped tanker carrying Russian diesel from unloading in UK are CLEARED in court as judge says Russia's invasion of Ukraine 'could be described as terrorism',"Ten Greenpeace activists who forced a tanker carrying £30million of Russian diesel to U-turn in the River Thames have been cleared of aggravated trespass, with a judge stating Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine 'could be described as terrorism'. The defendants, aged between 27 and 72, claimed they were 'preventing a crime' by occupying a jetty at Navigator Terminals in Grays, Essex, preventing the vessel from unloading. District judge Christopher Williams, who returned his judgment at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Friday, said: 'I take the view it's more than likely the Russian war could be described as terrorism.' The 10 defendants had denied, and were each cleared of, a single charge of obstructing or disrupting a person engaged in a lawful activity under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. The charge said that they trespassed on land at Navigator Terminals and blocked the jetty, obstructing or disrupting 'a lawful activity, namely fuel distribution'. Henry Blaxand KC, defending, questioned whether the unloading of the Russian diesel was lawful activity, and the judge said that 'in my view the unloading of the oil was the potential offence'. The protesters broke out into applause and there were cheers as the judge found each of them not guilty. Prosecutor Monali Ralerasker argued that the case did not 'require an analysis of what's morally right and what's morally wrong'. But the judge said it was 'arguable that offences may have been committed under the Terrorism Act 2000', and that the 'activity which the defendants disrupted was the very thing they were protesting about'. The protesters took two dinghy boats to access the jetty from the riverside late on May 15 this year. Activists attached themselves to the structure and displayed a banner that said 'oil fuels war'. The Andromeda tanker, which was Greek-flagged and carrying Russian oil, was turned around in the Thames in the early hours of May 16. One of the activists who scaled the jetty, former lieutenant colonel Michael Grant, 62, told the court: 'The purpose of the action was to draw attention to the fact that fossil fuels were being imported and thereby funding Putin's war.' Speaking afterwards, Mr Grant said: 'This is a fantastic result. 'This verdict is not just a relief for us but a complete vindication of the ethical beliefs that led us to act.' Another of the activists, teacher Zoe Pontida, described it as a 'seismic verdict'. The 32-year-old said: 'It doesn't just fully vindicate our action, it also puts the UK government squarely in the dock. 'The judge has recognised that we are just ordinary people whose conscience compelled us to stop the oil funding Putin's campaign of state terrorism in Ukraine.' The defendants were: Benji Bailes, 38, of Gloucester; Michael Grant, 62, of Rosewell, Midlothian; Kim Harrison, 38, of Oldham, Greater Manchester; Benjamin Hearne-Salter, 41, of Kashmir Road, south London; David James, 62, of Bromfelde Road, south London; Ian Mills, 56, of Chippenham, Wiltshire; Zoe Pontida, 32, of Oxford; Henry Rayner, 28, of Ivanhoe Road, south London; Lyndall Stein, 72, of Surrey Row, south London; Rhiannon Wood, 27, of Hedge End, near Southampton, Hampshire."
2022-11-04,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11391219/Russian-general-takes-three-weeks-holiday-day-Western-officials-said-FIRED.html,Top Russian general 'takes three weeks' holiday' - a day after Western officials said he had been FIRED: Hapless military leader condemned for his performance in Ukraine is latest officer sacked,"The heavily criticised commander of one of Russia's five military districts is taking a three-week holiday, it has been revealed, a day after reports said he had been fired. Major-General Alexander Lapin has been the subject of rare public criticism in Russia for the performance of his troops fighting in Ukraine. Western officials reported on Thursday that the hapless general, thought to be responsible for defences in Donbas, had been given the sack by the Kremlin. However, according to regional news agency Ura.ru, Lapin is in fact taking a three week break - despite Moscow's armies being nine months into a faltering invasion. The Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters Thursday about the current employment status of the Vladimir Putin-appointed head of Russia's central military district. But the Russian newspaper Kommersant cited the press office of the Central Military District, based like Ura.ru in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, as confirming that a temporary commander was standing in for Lapin. Lapin has been the subject of rare public criticism by two close and increasingly vocal allies of President Vladimir Putin: Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner private military group. Both have sent units to Ukraine to bolster the efforts of the regular army. Kadyrov said a month ago, after Russian forces were driven out of the strategic logistics hub of Lyman in eastern Ukraine, that Lapin should be stripped of his medals and sent to the front with a gun to wash away his shame with blood. Russia has made sweeping changes to its military leadership in the last two months as Ukrainian forces have reclaimed thousands of square kilometres in the northeast, east and south from Russian occupation. On October 8 it named Air Force General Sergei Surovikin as the overall commander of Russian forces fighting in Ukraine, shortly after the reported sacking of the commanders of the Eastern and Western military districts. In September, the deputy defence minister in charge of logistics, General Dmitry Bulgakov, was replaced by Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev, accused by the European Union of orchestrating a siege of the Ukrainian port of Mariupol early in the conflict that killed thousands of civilians. And in August, the state-owned RIA news agency reported that the commander of the Black Sea Fleet had been fired after a series of humiliations including the sinking of its flagship and the loss of eight warplanes in an attack on a Russian base in Crimea. Lapin's stand-in as commander of the Central District is Major-General Alexander Linkov, head of its organisational and mobilisation department, Kommersant said. General Lapin is the last commander who ordered Russian forces across Ukraine's border in February who was still in post. His departure would speak to a shift of power taking place inside the Kremlin away from the Ministry of Defence and to warlords such as Kadyrov and Prigozhin. News of Lapin's 'holiday' came as Moscow pushed ahead with a civilian pullout from the Russian-occupied Kherson region amid a mounting Ukrainian counter-offensive, with Putin saying residents must be 'removed' from danger zones. The Russian army said 'more than 5,000 civilians' were being led across the Dnipro River every day, showing footage of soldiers directing lines of cars onto flotillas crossing over to the river's eastern bank. Moscow's forces began urging civilians to leave Kherson in mid-October, vowing to turn the region's main city of the same name into a fortress ahead of an anticipated Ukrainian offensive. Kyiv has likened the departures to Soviet-style 'deportations' of its people. 'Those who live in Kherson should be removed from zones of dangerous fighting,' Putin said on Red Square as he marked Russian Unity Day, a patriotic holiday. 'The civilian population should not suffer from shelling, an offensive, a counter-offensive or other such things,' he said. While no final call has been made, western officials believe Russian commanders have decided that Kherson 'is not worth defending' and that fleeing to better positions across the Dnipro will improve their chances of holding on as winter falls. They spoke Thursday as footage emerged from Kherson showing a Russian flag that has been flying over city hall for months has suddenly disappeared. News of Russia's withdrawal from Kherson follows weeks of back-and-forth claims about the situation there - with Russia hinting the city is about to fall while Ukraine insists Putin is reinforcing it. Complicating the situation is a near-total news blackout from Ukrainian forces on the frontlines as they try to break through Russian defences. Two weeks ago, there was hope the city was on the verge of being liberated as General Surovikin - head of Russian forces in Ukraine - warned of a 'tense' situation and began evacuating civilians. But as the days ticked by with no sign of a Ukrainian breakthrough, Kyiv began briefing that wet weather and mud was hindering its advance. Western countries, meanwhile, have urged Putin to extend a landmark deal for the export of Ukrainian grain to avert a global food crisis, which is up for renewal on November 19. Russia rejoined the UN-brokered deal on Wednesday, after suspending its participation for four days over a drone attack on its Black Sea fleet in Russian-annexed Crimea, but has threatened to pull out again. On a visit to China, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged Putin to extend the deal. 'Hunger must not be used as a weapon,' he said. 'I urge the Russian president not to refuse to extend the grain agreement which ends in a few days.' He asked China's Xi Jinping - who has good relations with Putin - to use Beijing's 'influence' on Moscow to stop fighting in Ukraine. 'The Russian war in Ukraine is a dangerous situation for the whole world,' Scholz said. The G7 group of wealthy nations also said it wants Russia to prolong the deal that allows the safe passage of grain shipments from Ukraine. Its top diplomats have held two days of talks in the western German city of Muenster, with Ukraine topping the agenda."
2022-11-04,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11390355/Washington-man-23-snuck-fathers-house-fight-Ukraine-war-dies.html,"Washington man, 23, who snuck out of father's house to fight in Ukraine war dies 'in artillery fire' as his father says he's a 'hero' and 'a big-hearted man'","A 23-year-old Washington man 'with no military experience who snuck out of his family home' to fight in the Ukraine War has died. Skyler James Gregg was fighting on the frontline with the International Legion in Ukraine - which consists of foreigners and operates under the command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Its believed Gregg died in north-eastern Ukraine when soldiers from the International Legion came under artillery fire in the last week of October, a Ukrainian army contact told The Daily Beast. In his Washington state hometown of Orcas Island, Gregg had been living with his father, Steve, who had been against him going to Ukraine to fight. Despite his father's aversion to the idea Gregg made the decision to sneak out of his home and travel to Ukraine to volunteer despite having no military experience. Gregg joined the International Legion in April after seeing the images of Russia entering Ukraine and being shocked by the atrocities taking place. Just two months after joining the International Legion Gregg was wounded near Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine when an explosive hit his posting near the frontline. Talking to The Daily Beast in a hospital where he had been recovering from his injuries Gregg said he was determined to return to the frontline after his recovery. 'I couldn't just sit by, I had to do something,' Gregg said at the time. 'I have friends in Ukraine, it's so terrible what is happening. I needed to do something; the job isn't finished.' A total of 14 fragments had penetrated his body, including his right foot, right arm and shoulder at the time. 'I didn't want to seem more experienced than I really was, so I just told them that I had the bare minimum experience,' he said. He later became an LMG machine gunner and said his training in Ukraine was short and chaotic. 'There was an opportunity to go, so I had to do it,' he said. 'It would, of course, be possible for me to help in a humanitarian way, but I was just so angry. I was just so angry about the Russian invasion, so I couldn't just work in a warehouse.' His death was confirmed by his father Steve and a former commander, who wished to remain nameless, who said the 23-year-old was a 'hero' and 'very brave, big-hearted man.' In his last messages to his father, Gregg shared photos with a woman from one of the liberated territories in north-eastern Ukraine. Gregg had been proud to show his father how he helped the woman connect with her daughters through a Starlink internet connection after five months apart, Steve explained to The Daily Beast. Ukrainian forces have been carrying out counter-offensive operations in the north-eastern regions in recent months and have already liberated more than 300 settlements. 'I will be honest and say that in the first couple of days, I was filled with frantic, frantic pain,' said Steve. Steve, who describes himself as a pacifist, had repeatedly warned Gregg against volunteering. 'He did not have my permission to go, but I have a ton of respect for him,' he said. Back in June, Steve had told The Daily Beast that Gregg liked to read the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway – which is about a young American who joins a guerrilla unit in the Spanish Civil War and is badly wounded after blowing up a bridge. 'I haven't read the book in decades, but it might be time to look at it again to see what it means,' he said at the time. 'You know, Skyler always wanted to give his all, and if he died, then he wanted it to set an example and to live his life fully.' 'He relished human connections, and it is tough for me to criticize his drive to help people. I cannot criticize that.' Family and friends described Gregg on Facebook as being a brave, strong young man with a good heart. 'My precious brave nephew Skyler died doing what he was convicted to do, help out his Ukrainian friends in the war with Russia,' his aunt posted this week. 'My last conversation with him was several months ago when he was in the hospital recovering from wounds he received when a bomb carrying drone came dangerously close. 'I had the opportunity to tell him how much I loved him and admired him for following his convictions. 'My heart is broken that I won't get to see him again this side of heaven. Rest well Skyler.' Another family member posting on behalf of the Gregg family wrote how much the young soldier would be missed. 'Our hearts are broken, there are no adequate words to describe the loss of someone we love so dearly, so much sooner than should have been,' it read. 'At this time, we have very little information regarding the events surrounding Skyler's death. 'We know that he was wounded several months ago but had recently recovered enough to begin working to reunify families who had been separated due to warfare. 'In the midst of our pain we have taken comfort in the fact that Skyler died doing what he believed in, in an effort to heal a portion of our broken world which he held dear to his heart.' Dailymail.com has contacted Gregg's father for further comment. It is unclear how many Americans are currently fighting in Ukraine, some however have little to no military experience. In the last week, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. revealed that his son Conor Kennedy, 28, 'talked his way' into enlisting for the war in Ukraine despite having no military experience. Conor, who is also the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, secretly enlisted to join the war in Ukraine because he felt Vladimir Putin is a 'gangster' and a 'bully', his father said. Conor's father appeared on The Megyn Kelly Show on Tuesday to speak about his son joining the fight in Ukraine. He revealed that he and his wife had no idea that Conor was joining the war effort, and that there was only one person on the ground in Ukraine who knew who Conor was. In September, two American veterans captured by the Russians while fighting in Ukraine were returned to the United States, to be united with their overjoyed families. Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, 27, and Alexander Drueke, 39, were both freed on Wednesday as part of a Saudi-brokered prisoner swap. But the same cannot be said of all American troops, revealed on family this week who are still enduring the 'nightmare' that is the Ukraine war. This week an American family who lost their son and is waiting to get the remains back revealed that his body is being held pending a possible war crimes investigation. Joshua Jones, 24, was killed on August 26 while fighting for the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. After his death, the soldier's body was held by Russian troops for several weeks in the Donbas region. Last week, the family was finally told that Joshua's body had been given to Ukraine following a negotiation period. Now, however, his family says that they are being told his body will not be sent back just quite yet. Joshua was in the US Army for three years, his family said. He decided to leave for Ukraine in March after news of the invasion had broken. His mom said he left the day before his birthday."

Footage captured the Russian president awkwardly climbing out of his bulletproof limousine on Red Square, watched by nervous security apparatchiks. He appeared to show signs of a limp as he approached the monument, and seemed uncomfortable as he bent down to lay the bouquet to mark Unity Day - a national holiday to mark Russia's expulsion of invading forces in the early 1600s. At the event, Putin addressed his invasion of Ukraine - saying civilians should be taken out of Moscow-occupied Kherson, where Russian forces have been leading evacuations since mid-October as Kyiv's forces advance. Kyiv has likened Moscow's efforts to remove the civilian population from Kherson to Soviet-like 'deportations' of its people. Scroll down for video His public appearance came days after reports that an intelligence source close to the Kremlin had confirmed he is suffering from Parkinson's and pancreatic cancer. Putin, 70, is being watched closely as the conflict in Ukraine continues, with Moscow's armies continuing to be pushed back in key areas. The invasion, seen as his personal war, could be brought to an end if his supposed illness worsened or he was overthrown by scheming officials - were they to decide he was no longer fit to be the country's president. Putin was seen arriving on Red Square to lay flowers at a newly renovated monument to Kuzma Minin - a famed merchant - and Dmitry Pozharsky - a Russian prince. Together, the historical figures became national heroes in defending Russia against the Polish invasion in the early 17th century. The Russian despot was driven a short distance of 300 feet from the Spassky Tower gate of his Kremlin seat of power with his security retinue around him. Anti-Putin online media outlets questioned if this was because he was unable to walk a longer distance. 'Old age is not a joy,' commented CрTD media. Once out of his limousine he appeared to walk with a slight limp, as shown on footage from Russian defence ministry TV channel Zvezda. Putin told how at the beginning of the 17th century the country was on the verge of losing its sovereignty, but Russians did not allow this. Having united in a militia army led by Minin and Pozharsky, they defended their homeland, he said. The irony of speaking about the historic event before addressing Russia's on-going invasion of sovereign Ukraine appeared lost on Putin. Claims have been circulating among opposition figures for years, fuelled by his unexplained absences and his shaky public appearances, that Putin is battling serious health problems but they have always been rubbished by the Kremlin. A Russian intelligence source was reported earlier this week as confirming Putin had been diagnosed with early stage Parkinson's and pancreatic cancer, claims long made by Telegram channel General SVR. His circle is worried that his 'thinness and persistent cough' is becoming noticeable and will be seen by the elites in Russia as a 'sign of the leader's rapidly deteriorating health', claimed the channel last month. Despite appearing considerably bloated and puffy in the face, the president has lost 18lb in recent months, said the channel which purports to have sources inside the Kremlin. Leaked documents, reported by The Sun this week, also allegedly read: 'I can confirm he has been diagnosed with early stage Parkinson's disease, but it's already progressing. This fact will be denied in every possible way and hidden. 'Putin is regularly stuffed with all kinds of heavy steroids and innovative painkilling injections to stop the spread of pancreatic cancer he was recently diagnosed with. 'It not only causes a lot of pain, Putin has a state of puffiness of the face and other side effects - including memory lapses. 'In his close circle, there are rumours that in addition to pancreatic cancer, which is gradually spreading, Putin also has prostate cancer.' The tyrant was recently spotted with apparent track marks from IV treatment on the back of his hand, adding further fuel to the fire. Ever since Putin ordered his military forces to invade Ukraine on February 24, the rumours have going into overdrive. Rumours have been circling for years that Vladimir Putin is suffering from health problems, and they have intensified since he launched his brutal invasion of Ukraine. Critics and Kremlin sources have indicated he may be suffering from cancer and Parkinson's, supported by footage showing the leader shaking uncontrollably and gripping a table for support. He has also disappeared from the public eye for weeks at a time, with suggestions he is undergoing surgery. Valery Solovey, professor at Moscow State Institute of Foreign Affairs first hinted at Putin's health problems, saying in 2020 he had undergone surgery for cancer. Another unnamed source suggested the operation was on Putin's abdomen. He said: 'One is of a psycho-neurological nature, the other is a cancer problem. If anyone is interested in the exact diagnosis, I'm not a doctor, and I have no ethical right to reveal these problems. 'The second diagnosis is a lot, lot more dangerous than the first named diagnosis as Parkinson's does not threaten physical state, but just limits public appearances. 'Based on this information people will be able to make a conclusion about his life horizon, which wouldn't even require specialist medical education.' The Kremlin has consistently denied there is anything wrong with Putin's health. Others have previously noted his 'gunslinger's gait' – a clearly reduced right arm swing compared to his left, giving him a lilting swagger. An asymmetrically reduced arm swing is a classic feature of Parkinson's and can manifest in 'clinically intact subjects with a predisposition to later develop' the disease, according to the British Medical Journal. In February, Putin was seen with a shaking hand as he firmly gripped the side of his chair for support. The clip, which was taken on February 18, just before the onset of his invasion of Ukraine, shows him welcoming fellow strongman Alexander Lukashenko at the Kremlin. He pulls his trembling hand into his body in an attempt to quell the shakes, but then he almost stumbles as he unsteadily walks towards the Belarusian leader. Later, Putin sits on a chair but is unable to remain still, constantly fidgeting and tapping his feet while he grips on to the arm for support. In a meeting with defence minister Sergei Shoigu, Putin's poor posture and his apparently bloated face and neck fuelled the speculation. Video showed Putin speaking to Shoigu whilst gripping the edge of the table with his right hand - so hard that it appears white - and tapping his foot consistently. He has since been seen limping and shaking his hands and legs, further bolstering the rumours. He has been seen uncontrollably shaking, gripping tables and chairs for support, and appeared bloated and ill-at-ease. The president has also frequently disappeared from the public eye for weeks at a time in recent years amid rumours he is undergoing surgery. Over the summer, the Russian president was pictured awkwardly swatting mosquitos from his face with one arm while the other hung limply by his side. Similarly, at a huge Victory Day parade in Moscow in May, the now 70-year-old autocrat appeared to walk with a limp and had a blanket over his lap, while in April he was seen gripping a table in a televised meeting with his defence minister Sergei Shoigu. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also quashed any health rumours about Putin as 'nothing but fakes'. The General SVR channel has long claimed that Putin is suffering from abdominal cancer, Parkinson's disease and a schizoaffective disorder. Its claims cannot be verified but it was among the first to report in advance the shape of Putin's recent mobilisation strategy. The channel is reportedly authored by an exiled Kremlin lieutenant-general, known by the alias Viktor Mikhailovich. Speaking in Moscow's Red Square, Putin on Friday said civilians should be taken out of Moscow-occupied Kherson in southern Ukraine, where Russian forces have been leading evacuations since mid-October as Kyiv's forces advance. 'Those who live in Kherson should be removed from zones of dangerous fighting,' the Russian president told young volunteers from the occupied Ukrainian territories. 'The civilian population should not suffer from shelling, an offensive, a counter-offensive or other such things,' he said. The Russian army later said it was evacuating 'more than 5,000 civilians' from the Kherson region each day. Moscow's occupation authorities in Kherson say they have helped tens of thousands leave the region and have vowed to turn Kherson city into a 'fortress'. Putin was speaking to volunteers involved in helping people leave Kherson, in remarks made after laying flowers at a monument honouring those who fought off a Polish invasion in 1612. He said Moscow had mobilised 318,000 recruits since he announced a military call-up in September, which has since been completed. 'We already have 318,000 (mobilised),' Putin said. That exceeded his target of 300,000 because 'volunteers keep coming', he added. The Kremlin chief said he wanted to restore historical monuments in the occupied territories so that those 'who lived under crazy, idiotic propaganda for 30 years' would know 'where their ancestors came from.' He singled out the port city of Mariupol on the Azov Sea, which was flattened by weeks of battles over its steelworks, which fell into Russian hands in May. 'Mariupol is a very famous - an ancient, you could say - Russian city,' Putin said. 'Peter the Great, as is well known, founded his first military flotilla there, had his first victories there,' he said of the 17th-century tsar. General Alexander 'Suvorov had his steppe campaigns there, and Catherine the Second built up these lands,' he added. 'There is a lot to work on,' he said, referring to reconstruction plans."

The armoured vehicle, one of Russia's modern T-80 main battle tanks, was driving along a dirt track lined by wooded areas - perfect concealment for Ukrainian soldiers lying in wait. As it passed one particular row of trees, a lone Ukrainian soldier leapt out from cover, shouldered his weapon - an anti-tank guided missile - and fired a single shot. He did so even as another Russian tank sat downrange appeared to have its barrel aimed directly at the Ukrainian position - though it is unclear whether this vehicle had been abandoned or disabled. In a flash, the missile streaked across the track and impacted the passing tank, exploding in a plume of fire and white smoke. The stricken vehicle initially continued to roll slowly onward, perhaps damaged if not completely scuttled. But moments later the armoured hull erupted in a series of explosions as the ammunition inside cooked off, the detonations spewing metal across the dirt track and causing huge trails of smoke to rise above the wood. The video was released by the 95th Air Assault Brigade of the Ukrainian Air Assault Forces earlier today, along with a statement that read: 'A fighter of the 1st Airborne Assault Battalion of the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade destroyed an enemy tank at close range. 'Every day, the soldiers of the Armed Forces risk their lives, demonstrate courage and heroism, and step by step liberate our land from the Russian invaders. 'Glory to Ukraine! Glory to Air Assault Forces! Together to victory!' Images from the footage were also relayed by the Office of Strategic Communications (StratCom) of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 'A fighter of the 1st Airborne Assault Battalion of the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade destroyed an enemy tank with one shot at close range,' StratCom announced. The footage was released in tandem with images showing another group of Ukrainian troops blowing up two Russian ammunition trucks, joking that they were 'fined' for being improperly parked. Black smoke could be seen rising into the air from the site of the detonations as ammunition burned in the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. The images were obtained from the 93rd Independent Kholodnyi Yar Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian Ground Forces this morning, along with a statement saying: 'The 93rd brigade destroyed warehouses with ammunition of the Russian occupiers in the Bakhmut area. 'A mechanized battalion of Kholodnyi Yar soldiers ''issued a fine'' to two enemy Kamaz vehicles with ammunition for improper parking. In addition, the building containing the ammunition was destroyed. 'We continue to eliminate the forces and means of the occupying forces and defend Bakhmut!' Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 in what the Kremlin is still calling a 'special military operation'. Today marks the 254th day of the war. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine today reported that between February 24 and November 4, it estimates that Russia has lost about 74,840 personnel, 2,750 tanks, 5,580 armoured combat vehicles, 1,772 artillery units, 391 multiple launch rocket systems, 201 air defence systems, 277 planes and 258 helicopters. Russia has claimed that its casualties have been much lower but provides infrequent updates on its latest figures. It comes as the Russian Ambassador to the United Kingdom claimed that British special forces participated in a drone attack on Russia's Black Sea fleet, which Moscow had previously accused Ukraine of authoring. Ambassador Andrei Kelin told Sky News: 'We perfectly know about [the] participation of British specialists in [the] training, preparation and execution of violence against the Russian infrastructure and the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. We know that it has been done.' Kelin added: 'This is a warning actually that Britain is too deep in this conflict. It means the situation is becoming more and more dangerous.' Ukrainian military officials meanwhile warned that Russia could be setting a trap by pretending to pull out of the Kherson region, only to catch oncoming Ukrainian defenders in an ambush. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine's southern military command, said: 'This could be a manifestation of a particular provocation, in order to create the impression that the settlements are abandoned, that it is safe to enter them, while they are preparing for street battles.' Humeniuk added: 'We continue fighting, also in the Kherson direction, despite the fact that the enemy is trying to convince us that they are leaving the settlements and creating the effect of a total evacuation.' The comments come after Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy civilian administrator of the Kherson region, said: 'Most likely our units, our soldiers, will leave for the left [eastern] bank' of the Dnieper River. Lloyd Austin, the US Secretary of Defence, said that he thinks that Ukrainian military forces can retake Kherson, saying that they were working in an 'effective' and 'methodical' manner. Ukraine has said that the forced relocation of Ukrainian citizens in the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia amounts to 'war crimes' and 'deportations'. Russia has claimed that 70,000 civilians in Kherson are being 'temporarily resettled deep into the Kherson region, as well as to other regions of the Russian Federation.' Moscow said that this was due to 'possible damage to the dam of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station'."
2022-11-04,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11389547/Putin-faces-losing-power-power-brokers-throats-expert-claims.html,"Putin is losing his grip over his inner circle and facing a collapse of his regime, with power-brokers at each others' throats, Russian secret service expert claims","Vladimir Putin faces losing power as different factions within his regime turn on each other with the strongman leader too weak to stop them, and expert has said. Yevgenia Albats, who specialises in Russian secret services and politics, says power-brokers in Moscow's elite are now 'at each other's throats' with Putin struggling to control a 'lunch of the predators'. The Russian leader traditionally acted as a mediator between these groups - playing them off against one another while insuring everyone's safety - but his role is increasingly untenable which puts him in the firing line, Albats added. Russia is now into the ninth month of a war in Ukraine that Putin believed would be over within days, has seen his powerful military mauled by a smaller adversary, and has almost no hope of achieving any of his pre-war aims. Albats, editor of The New Times magazine who was exiled from Russia in September after being declared a 'foreign agent', said: 'A fight has begun inside the very top echelons of Russian power. 'We are witnessing the lunch of the predators. What's happening now is a key manifestation of breakdown within the power [structures]. 'And of the fact that Putin can no longer act as mediator between various interest groups - that the war of all against all has begun….' She told independent channel TV Rain: 'I want to hope this will crash this inhumane regime, [which is] killing people in Ukraine and its own mobilised people in Russia. '[What we now see] is war at the very top of the power echelon. And Putin can no longer serve as a mediator, which is his key function. Therefore, he [Putin] is next.' As evidence, she pointed to the increasingly public attempts by warlords Ramzan Kadyrov and Yevgeny Prigozhin - Chechen dictator and founder of the Wagner mercenary group, respectively - to oust defence minister Sergei Shoigu. Kadyrov and Prigozhin have been hugely critical of the way the war has been run, while suggesting generals should be sent to the front barefoot to fight. They were particularly critical of Colonel-General Aleksander Lapin, who was in charge of the defence of Lyman before Ukraine routed Russian forces in the region. Western officials now believe Lapin has 'probably' been fired, meaning all of the generals who ordered troops across Ukraine's border in February have been sacked. If confirmed, it would be a major coup for Kadyrov and Prigozhin against Shoigu. Albats also highlighted the legal moves against Putin's 'goddaughter' Ksenia Sobchak, who fled Russia for the West last week. Sobchak is thought to have run to Lithuania after a business associate was slapped with criminal charges and left facing 15 years in prison, sparking fears for her safety. Many assumed that Putin would have protected Sobchak, 40, whose father Anatoly, ex-mayor of St Petersburg, was his mentor and former law professor. The Moscow home of another journalist, uber-loyalist Andrey Karaulov - now in Dubai - was searched, and another Kremlin-supporting editor Modest Kolerov was suddenly fired from his Regnum news agency. The action appears to show scores being settled without reference to Putin. A common thread in the Sobchak and Karaulov cases were claims of wrongdoing made by Putin crony Sergey Chemezov, chief executive of the Rostec Corporation defence group. Yet Chemezov, who spied for the KGB alongside Putin in East Germany and is now a billionaire, is seen as having upset the Kremlin president over the poor quality of Russian arms in Ukraine by failing to develop Western-quality high technologies. 'Modest results have been demonstrated in the areas for which Rostec is responsible,' said Putin in a crushing attack at a meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects. Rostec, a state corporation that owns more than a 1,000 enterprises in the Russian military-industrial complex, has failed to provide high-quality weapons, tanks, night vizors, body armour, and other ammunition, it is claimed. Chemezov, at 70 the same age as Putin, appears to be lashing out in a bid for survival, some observers claim. In the past, Putin would have dampened such flames, but now powerbrokers close to the Kremlin are flexing their muscles and he cannot stop them, Albats suggests. Other observers see a fight for the succession cranking up between key Putin aide Sergey Kiriyenko, 60, a former Russian prime minister who is now deputy chief of staff in the Kremlin, and Dmitry Patrushev, 45, the agriculture minister, and son of secretary of Putin's security council, Nikolai Patrushev, 71."
2022-11-04,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11388673/I-probably-Trump-teases-2024-run-Iowa.html,"'I will very, very, very probably do it again': Trump teases 2024 run at Iowa rally where he complains he 'got screwed' in the last election and shares a Biden gaffe-reel with crowd","Former President Donald Trump came close to announcing a 2024 White House bid at a Thursday night rally in Iowa - which holds the nation's first presidential contest - and on the anniversary of his 2020 election loss. 'And now in order to make our country successful and safe and glorious - I will very, very, very probably do it again,' he said. 'OK? Very, very, very probably. Very, very, very probably.' He told the riled up Sioux City crowd to 'get ready!' 'That's all I'm telling you, very soon,' he added. Trump also entertained his audience by sharing a gaffe-reel featuring President Joe Biden with supporters, showing footage of the Democrat tripping up Air Force One's stairs and other awkward moments. Ever the reality TV star, Trump played dramatic and sinister music throughout the final portion of his speech, using a melody associated with the QAnon movement. Trump was stumping for Iowa Republicans, Sen. Chuck Grassley and Gov. Kim Reynolds - who aren't facing tough competition from Democrats - with just five days before the midterm elections. He encouraged his supporters: 'If you want safety for your family and security for your community, throw every Democrat the hell out of office and vote for Republicans up and down the line.' But the bulk of the rally was devoted to how he'd been wronged. 'Your favorite president, excuse me to all those young people, your favorite president got screwed,' he told the audience, while floating that the 2020 election should have been invalidated. Trump still boasted - falsely - that he was the winner of that election. 'I did much better the second time than I did the first. Getting millions more votes in 2020 than I got in 2016 and likewise getting more votes than any sitting president in the history of our country thus far,' Trump said. He also mentioned the slew of investigations encircling him. 'Biden and his left wing handlers are turning America into a police state like something straight out of a communist country. The radical Democrats are locking up pro-life activists, persecuting their political opponents - nobody can believe this is happening,' Trump said. 'They even raided Mar-a-Lago. They raided Mar-a-Lago.' 'Tell you what I'd like to do,' he added. Trump's Florida home and private club Mar-a-Lago was searched by the FBI in August under suspicion that the ex-president had held onto classified documents after his White House tenure. Hundreds of classified documents were found during the raid. Later in the rally he returned to the raid adding, 'It is a nice house, you have to say.' Trump also pointed to a decision made only hours before by a New York judge - who appointed an independent monitor to oversee the Trump Organization's financial transactions, as part of New York Attorney General Letitia James' ongoing civil suit against the ex-president' company. 'And just moments ago, a radical-left lunatic judge in New York City, who's totally controlled by my worst enemies in the Democrat Party - and by the New York attorney general, there's another beauty - who was given his position by them at the request of the out-of-control attorney general who's let violent crime in New York rage in the state, including murders, robberies, rape and drugs at levels never seen before - started a process of property confiscation that is akin to Venezuela, Cuba or the old Soviet Union,' Trump said. 'It's communism, what's going on in our country,' he said. 'They're weaponizing the Justice Department. They're weaponizing things that shouldn't be weaponized.' The ex-president also pointed to the investigation in Georgia over Trump and his allies pushing false election fraud claims. 'A local left-wing DA in Atlanta is after me for an absolutely perfect phone call,' Trump said. 'I would say even better than better than the Ukrainian call to the president.' Trump described the call in question, where he asked Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to 'find' the number of votes he'd need to win the state, as a query on 'election integrity.' 'No, it was a perfect call - even better than my first perfect call. Remember? They impeached me on a perfect call,' Trump said. He spoke of the great progress that was being made under his leadership. 'You had no problems with anything, frankly,' he told the crowd. 'And then unfortunately we had a roadblock with this character, these people that are there now,' he also said. 'It's a disgrace.' He hit the Democrats for 'indoctrinating our children with twisted race and gender lunacy in our schools.' But he suggested the Republicans would be successful in retaking the House. 'And we're going to end crazy Nancy Pelosi's political career once and for all,' he said, using the nickname he gave her years ago, despite the recent hammer attack on her husband, Paul. He also told Grassley, who made remarks before and during Trump's appearance, that he was going to be easily re-elected. 'I think he's not going to have a problem,' Trump said. 'But now I know after this tonight,' he said, gazing into his crowd. Of Biden, Trump said, 'You could take the five worst presidents in American history and put them together and they would not have done the damage Joe Biden has done to our nation in just two years.' He then asked the crowd if they'd like to see 'a little clip on a nice expensive monitor,' turning the audience's attention to the Jumbotron screens. The gaffe-reel showed a number of Biden's slip of the tongues. Afterward, Trump spoke in serious tones. 'It's not really anything that's funny because our world is in a very dangerous place with nuclear weapons,' the former president warned. Trump pushed that the U.S. could end up in World War Three under Biden's leadership. 'We could end up in world war three and World War Three will blow everything away because World War Three has nuclear weapons like nobody's ever seen,' he told the crowd. He pointed to both Russia and North Korea as threats, remarking of the latter that 'we got along very well,' as he thrice met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his presidency, but wasn't successful in inking a denuclearization deal. As for the Russian assault on Ukraine, Trump called it 'horrible thing,' but suggested the U.S.'s border crisis was worse. 'This year, more Americans will die of Fentanyl and drug overdoses than the number of Ukrainians killed in the gruesome and bloody war - that by the way would have never happened,' Trump said."

Volunteer rescue workers said the soldiers committed horrendous acts of cruelty at Yampil Zoo in the eastern Donetsk region. Yampil village was liberated by Ukrainian forces on September 30. The rescue workers arrived ten days later to find animal skeletons and pieces of flesh and bone scattered across the zoo grounds. ‘Many animals were eaten by the orcs,’ said one of the volunteers, using the Ukrainian slang for Russian invaders. According to the authorities, two camels, a kangaroo, a bison, some piglets, birds and wolves were killed. Those animals that were saved are being care for in the city of Dnipro. Before the February 24 invasion, zookeepers said the compound was home to a wide range of animals, including bears, camels, antelopes, and wild boars. Volunteers are collecting materials in order to contact Ukrainian law enforcement agencies with a view to pressing charges."
2022-11-03,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11383427/Body-American-killed-fighting-Ukraine-held-amid-possible-war-crimes-investigation.html,"Body of American man, 24, killed while fighting as a volunteer in Ukraine in August is being held as part of a potential war crimes investigation, his family says","An American family who has been waiting to receive their son's body back after he died fighting in Ukraine says his remains are now being held pending a possible war crimes investigation. Joshua Jones, 24, was killed on August 26 while fighting for the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. After his death, the soldier's body was held by Russian troops for several weeks in the Donbas region. Last week, the family was finally told that Joshua's body had been given to Ukraine following a negotiation period. Now, however, his family says that they are being told his body will not be sent back just quite yet. Misty Gossett, 48, Joshua's mother, recently sat down with NBC News to talk about the latest heartbreaking update. The mom told the national news outlet that this is yet another step in what feels like a nightmare. Gossett said that the family had already begun to prepare to receive Joshua's body. 'Every day this gets prolonged and we're just trying to put him to rest,' Gossett said during the interview. The mother said that she was not given any additional details, including what is going on with his body or why. She also said that the Ukrainians who got in touch with her told her they would be conducting a second autopsy and needed family members to send a DNA sample for testing, but did not specify what kind of testing. 'We don't know anything as far as how much longer it's going to be, when he's coming home. The communication is exhausting.' This news she gave to NBC on Tuesday, less than one week after she said she was informed that her son's body had been secured. A CNN team witnessed the transfer of Joshua's body in the Zaporizhzhia region on October 26. The two sides had agreed to a two-hour ceasefire in no-man's land between Russian and Ukrainian-held Ukraine. In a phone call with CNN last week, Jeff Jones, Joshua's dad told the outlet: 'We got him back!' 'I cannot tell you what a burden is lifted off this family,' the father said at the time. 'I couldn't give up that hope.' Joshua's mother told NBC that she is terrified of the next steps and how long the process could take. Gossett says it's already been a difficult process for all of those involved. 'We got to the point that we were at a standstill and were told over and over, 'He's on a list, he's on a list, he's on a list,'' she said. The mother said that even getting his body back to Ukraine seemed impossible at times. She told a reporter that family members would spend eight to 10 hours a day making calls trying to see how the process could be moved along. The mom also said the family accumulated two notebooks of contacts they used to try and bring Josh home. Despite having been told that her son had died, Gossett told NBC News that she often held onto hope that they may have been wrong and that Joshua may have survived. 'Your mind during grief plays tricks on you,' she said during her recent interview. 'He was so strong that I thought there was a chance. On Wednesday — it's just emotions that bounce back so cruelly.' The hope has since died as the family continues to advocate for their loved one to be brought home and laid to rest. She said that her son was a 'rebellious yet loving child' who was committed to serving his country, which he ultimately did. Joshua was in the U.S. Army for three years, family said. He decided to leave for Ukraine in March after news of the invasion had broken. His mom said he left the day before his birthday. The mom says that if nothing else, she hopes that other families and Americans learn about the 'exhausting' process they have been through. 'It's just so unorganized and exhausting,' Gossett told NBC. 'If your child goes or your spouse goes there and you lose them, what you have to go through is something no one should have to do — on top of losing someone they love. The national news outlet spoke with individuals who have dealt with similar cases and they estimated that this new hold up could take weeks or even months. 'We've seen this process take a month or so from when the Ukrainians get the body,' said Dominik Byrne, the leader of a nonprofit that helps families who have lost a loved one fighting in Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied any of the war crimes allegations that have been lodged against the massive nation. Ukraine, however, continues to document instances of potential war crimes carried out by the country and it's troops. Ned Price, spokesperson for the State Department, released the following statement last week after the news of Joshua's body being recovered had broken. 'The United States expresses our condolences to the family of the U.S. citizen killed in the fighting in Ukraine, whose remains have now been identified and released to Ukraine's custody,' he said. 'They will soon be returned to the family. The United States is appreciative of Ukraine for including recovery of this individual's remains in its negotiations with Russia.' In early October, another American fighting in Ukraine was identified as having been killed while volunteering in the country, which has been attacked by Russian troops. Dane Partridge was struck and killed by shrapnel, his family confirmed in a Facebook post last month. On October 10, Dane's sister, Jenny Partridge Corry, shared an update to his Facebook page, telling his friends that he had been involved in an incident and that he was on life support. One Kyiv military doctor spoke with the family, letting them know that Dane's scans showed 'brain damage and edema,' with extensive damage to the spinal cord, brain stem, and neck. At the time, the doctor, according to a Facebook post, told the family that the results were 'not conducive to life.' Less than 48 hours after that post, Jenny shared another grim update. 'We have just been informed that Dane aka Bird has passed away while still being on life support,' Jenny wrote. 'He was a fine soldier who fought with valor and bravery on the battlefield. We have been told that he was known to be at the front of his team leading his men as he would never ask his men to do anything that he wasn't willing to do,' Jenny said. Dane had traveled to Ukraine in April after saying he felt a call to help the people and the country during their time of need. He said at the time he 'felt a need to go,' and that he was confident in his choice. 'I've felt a need to go to Ukraine. This has been discussed with several people and I am confident in my decision to go. I am reaching out to see if I can get some support in getting over there,' Dane wrote. Dane left behind a wife and children, whom he loved very much, according to his sister."
2022-11-03,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11387727/Top-Indonesian-diplomat-says-doesnt-know-Putin-join-Biden-G20-Bali-summit.html,'Let's wait until D-Day': Top Indonesian diplomat says he STILL doesn't know if Putin will go to upcoming G20 summit Biden is attending in Bali – and Zelensky says Ukraine won't go if Vlad shows,"Days before world leaders are set to gather in Bali for the G20 summit meeting, Indonesia's foreign minister says he doesn't know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will attend. Putin, who has been overseeing Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, phoned Indonesian President Joko Widodo Wednesday. The country's foreign minister Retno Marsudi told Reuters that Putin's own attendance is still up in the air, and the answer might not be clear until shortly before it begins. 'Let's wait until D-Day,' she said. Putin himself has been playing coy, saying recently that he will send a high-level delegation if he is unable to attend. President Biden is going, at the tail end of a trip that will also send him to the ASEAN summit of Southeast Asian nations in Cambodia, with an early stop at the COP27 summit in Egypt. He has called Putin a 'war criminal,' following reports of horrific attacks on civilians in Ukrainian towns and villages. President Widodo visited Moscow and Kiev this summer in preparations for his role as host. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose nation is not a member of the G20 but who has been invited at the request of allies, says he won't go if Putin does. 'My personal position and the position of Ukraine was that if the leader of the Russian Federation takes part, then Ukraine will not take part. We'll see what it will be like in the future,' he said. Administration officials say they are trying to discourage even a 'sideline' meeting between Biden and Putin at the meeting, should Putin attend. Biden himself had earlier said last month, 'Look, I have no intention of meeting with him, but look, if he came to me at the G20 and said, ""I want to talk about the release of [detained American Brittney] Griner,"" I would meet with him, but that would depend.' Officials have stressed there is no meeting in the works. The State Department said Thursday U.S. embassy officials in Moscow had finally been able to meet with WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was sentenced in a Russian court to nine-years in prison after being arrested at a Moscow airport with a small amount of cannabis oil."
2022-11-03,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11388081/Ukraine-brands-Jeremy-Corbyn-one-Putins-useful-idiots-hes-set-speak-propaganda-event.html,Ukraine brands ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn one of Putin's 'useful idiots' after he signs up to speak at Russian propaganda event in the US,"Ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was last night branded one of Vladimir Putin's 'useful idiots' by Ukraine's government for agreeing to speak at a Russian propaganda event in New York. The MP for Islington North, who now sits as an independent, is set to appear at the 'Real Path to Peace in Ukraine' on November 19. He lost the party whip in October 2020 when he said the scale of anti-Semitism within Labour during his tenure had been 'dramatically overstated'. Hard-left organisers The People's Forum parrot pro-Moscow talking points on the event's web page, blaming the invasion of Ukraine on NATO expansion and US imperialism. Mr Corbyn will join a panel that urges Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to talk peace with Putin and tells Kyiv's Western allies to halt the delivery of arms. 'There is no road to peace if US government policy remains to obstruct negotiations and send endless weapons into the war zone,' the activist group said. His decision to join the conference that calls on Ukraine to back down to Russia could even raise eyebrows amongst some of his most ardent Left-wing backers. Russia's armed forces have been accused of committing horrific war crimes by UN experts during the eight-month war. They include deliberate attacks on civilian targets, massacres of civilians, torture and the rape of women and children. One grisly video showed Russian troops castrating a Ukrainian soldier alive with a box-cutting knife before shooting him in the head. Mr Corbyn claims on his official website that his interests in global affairs 'are widespread with particular attention to human rights, peace and justice'. Dasha Zarivna, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, told the Mail that the hard-Left forum aims to 'spread narratives that have been carefully crafted by the Russian intelligence services'. 'Once again Jeremy Corbyn finds himself cosying up to known associates of Vladimir Putin and other useful idiots manipulated by the Kremlin,' Miss Zarivna said. 'Demanding that Ukraine start negotiating with an aggressor state and calling on the West to end the supply of weapons that allow us to defend ourselves from an illegal, unprovoked invasion that has caused a genocide of the Ukrainian people is nothing short of a disgrace,' she added. The 'Real Path to Peace in Ukraine' will also feature ex-Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who was wined and dined by Putin at a 2015 Moscow gala. On the very night the Kremlin despot invaded the country, Miss Stein went on a bizarre Twitter rant that backed Russia's reasoning for the war by blaming US and NATO 'provocations'. 'In 2014 the US backed a coup in Ukraine led by far-right insurrectionists,' she wrote of the 2014 Maidan revolution. 'The US kept pouring weapons into Ukraine and peddling the pipe dream of NATO membership, sabotaging the actual solution for peace and security.' Fellow participant Brian Becker, a self-styled anti-war activist, has also argued that the 2014 Maidan Revolution in Kyiv was a 'Nazi-led coup d'état'. Another speaker, Eugene Puryear, is a former presenter for Moscow-funded Kremlin mouthpiece Sputnik Radio. Labour leader Keir Starmer has refused to return the whip to Mr Corbyn after he called in April this year for NATO to be disbanded. But he remains a member of the party having served a suspension after a damning probe into anti-Semitism during his five-year tenure in charge. However, a Labour spokesman was unable to say whether sharing a platform with pro-Moscow propagandists would see him kicked out of the party for good. But Mr Corbyn told the Mail last night that he was unaware of who would be joining him for the event that has been widely advertised on social media. 'I don't even know who is on the panel yet,' he said, refusing to be drawn on whether he would make the journey to New York in person or address the conference online. Not a single Ukrainian has been invited to the so-called debate."
2022-11-03,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11386163/Biden-IMPEACHED-Americans-expect-Republican-led-Congress-president.html,"Biden IMPEACHED? Americans expect a Republican-led Congress to go after the president, ban abortions nationwide, stop arming Ukraine, and lower spending, taxes, and inflation, says survey","Five days before the midterm elections, voters are readying for the prospect of Republicans gaining control of Congress and its powerful committees — and wondering how they will use their gavels. A YouGov survey shows sizeable numbers of US adults expecting Republican power brokers on Capitol Hill to hew to party norms and cut social services, reduce taxes and tame inflation. Many had other predictions for GOP lawmakers — ranging from reducing aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia, a wholesale ban on abortions and even impeaching President Joe Biden, a Democrat. The survey comes ahead of voting on November 8, and polls that suggest the Democrats are on track to lose control of the House of Representatives and possibly also the Senate, as some analysts predict a ‘Red Wave’ will sweep the nation. The poll of 1,500 adults found that 42 percent expected cutbacks to social services and nearly a quarter predicted tax cuts. Slightly more, 28 percent, said inflation would start to fall from its painful nearly four-decade high of 8.2 percent. Some 27 percent of respondents expected a Republican-led Congress would impeach Biden — a view that was held by roughly equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats, the survey showed. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican of Georgia, and other hardliners have accused the president of ‘high crimes and misdemeanors’ and called for his impeachment, through it is not understood to be a mainstream position within the party. The allegations range from Biden’s failure to secure the southern border and his role in wrongdoings by his son, Hunter. For some, it would be retaliation for the Democrats’ two-time effort to impeach former president Donald Trump. More than a third of respondents expected a Republican legislature to enact a nationwide ban on abortions — an option that came into play after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. Most Democrats, 55 percent, would expect a nationwide abortion ban, compared to only 17 percent of Republicans. While some conservative states restricted access to abortions after the Supreme Court ruling, a nationwide ban would be wildly unpopular, various polls show. Among the most widely-expected moves of a Republican-controlled Congress would be the reduction of aid to Ukraine, which was rated as likely by 38 percent of respondents, including roughly comparable shares of Republicans and Democrats. The Biden administration has stumped up billions of dollars in support to Ukraine, including $275 million in arms, munitions and other gear announced last week, aimed at thwarting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s land grab. The largesse is unpopular among isolationist Republicans. Representative Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican and likely next Speaker, says there would be no ‘blank check’ for Ukraine if Republicans take over. Nearly a fifth of respondents said putting Republicans in charge would lead to a rise in Covid-19 cases. The virus, which has claimed 1.07 million lives in the US, has proven more deadly in Republican-run areas. This may be down to lower vaccination rates, resistance to masking and other factors. The Republicans have for months been forecasted to take back the House, but a last-minute wave of voter enthusiasm could see them also take the Senate, which Democrats were hoping to hang on to. Fears of rising crime rates and concerns about the state of the economy — including runaway inflation — appear to have won out as the top issues for likely voters. Republicans are now projected to pick up four seats in the Senate, according to RealClearPolitics, for a total of 54 GOP lawmakers to 46 Democrats — including the two Independents who caucus with the left.

The State Department confirmed that U.S. embassy officials in Moscow were able to visit the basketball star, whose wife and family have pleaded with officials to try to secure her release. 'We are told she's doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. State Department spokesman Ned Price announced the visit on his Twitter account. 'They saw firsthand her tenacity and perseverance despite her present circumstances. We continue to press for the immediate release of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan and fair treatment for every detained American,' he said, referencing the former Marine Moscow accused by Moscow of espionage. Whelan's family denies the charge. 'We are told she's doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters after U.S. embassy officials were able to visit WNBA star Brittney Griner In July, the administration offered to exchange convicted arms trafficker Viktor Bout for Griner, 32, and Whelan, CNN reported at the time. The administration has refused to confirm the details of any offer, but has upbraided Russia for failing to respond. 'As we have said before, the US government made a significant offer to the Russians to resolve the current unacceptable and wrongful wrongful detentions of American citizens Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan,' said Jean-Pierre. She then provided an update on negotiations that indicated the U.S. had shown movement. 'I can also tell you that in the subsequent weeks, despite a lack of good faith negotiation by the Russians, the US government has continued to follow up on that offer and propose alternative potential ways forward with Russians through all available channels. This continues to be a top priority,' she said. Griner was arrested in February after police said they found vape canisters that included cannabis oil in her luggage at a Moscow airport. Griner admitted having the canisters, but said she accidentally included them when packing her luggage. She was returning to play for a Russian team. The arrest came during a moment of high tension between the U.S. and Russia, in the same month when Russia invaded Ukraine."
2022-11-03,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11387435/Russia-warns-Britain-faces-dangerous-consequences-involvement-Ukraine-war.html,Russia's ambassador warns 'Britain is too deep' into the Ukraine conflict and says Moscow will publish 'proof' UK helped carry out suicide drone attack on the Black Sea fleet - adding: 'It is dangerous... it escalates the situation',"The UK is 'too deep' in the Ukraine war, Russia's ambassador warned - while insisting that Putin will not use nuclear weapons in an attack despite a series of thinly veiled threats. Diplomat Andrei Kelin alleges he has evidence of UK special forces' participation in a Ukrainian drone attack on Russia's Black Sea fleet, which he claims to have passed on to his UK counterpart. Speaking to Sky News' Mark Austin, Mr Kelin said: 'We perfectly know about the participation of British specialists in [the] training, preparation and execution of violence against the Russian infrastructure and the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. We know that it has been done.' Mr Kelin told media that the evidence will be made public 'pretty soon'. He said: 'It is dangerous because it escalates the situation. It can bring us up to the line of... I won't say ""no return"", because return is always possible. But anyway, we should avoid escalation. 'And this is a warning actually that Britain is too deep in this conflict. It means the situation is becoming more and more dangerous.' The ambassador also insisted that President Putin wants a negotiated settlement to the war in Ukraine. He said: 'We need a certain outcome, a negotiated outcome and we are not hiding away from the negotiations.' But UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverley has strongly rejected the Russian ambassador's claims, tweeting a report by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which found no evidence of undeclared nuclear activities in the areas suggested by Russia. Mr Cleverley tweeted: 'The world sees through Putin’s continued disinformation campaign. Russia’s baseless allegations have been heard, investigated and rejected. I welcome the IAEA’s independent report finding of no undeclared nuclear activities by Ukraine.' However Mr Kelin suggested that any settlement may require some Russian troops to remain in Ukraine to protect the Russian population - something the government in Kyiv has rejected. 'If we will need to protect the Russian population which is populating all this area right now, of course we will need Russian troops to stay over there,' he said. Mr Kelin insisted that Russia had no intention of using nuclear weapons in the conflict. 'Nuclear war cannot be won and it should never be fought. We stick strongly to this statement. We will not use a nuclear weapon because it is designed for different purposes,' he stated. Russia has previously warned of 'dangerous consequences' after summoning the UK's ambassador to show her 'evidence' that Britain helped plan attacks on the Nord Stream pipes and its Black Sea Fleet. Britain's ambassador to Russia Deborah Bronnert was hauled into the foreign ministry in Moscow Thursday morning and forced to run a gauntlet of stage-managed protesters holding placards that said 'Britain is a terrorist state' and 'Britain will answer for the Nord Stream'. Moscow said it had delivered a 'strong protest' to Bronnert, adding that 'such confrontational actions of the English carry a threat of escalation and could lead to unpredictable and dangerous consequences.' The UK has not given its own run-down of the meeting, but denies carrying out any direct attacks on Russia or its assets. Britain has been upfront about providing aid to Ukraine's war effort, which Moscow was warned about before Putin invaded. Bronnert arrived at Moscow's towering Soviet-era foreign ministry building, with a line of people chanting 'Britain is a terrorist state', state media showed. The foreign ministry said it had handed 'concrete facts' of London's 'hostile provocations' to her. 'A demand was put forward to stop them immediately,' it said. Moscow claimed UK military specialists were training Ukrainian special forces in the southern city of Ochakiv, 'including training for underwater saboteurs for operations in the waters of the Black and Azov seas'. Russia last week also accused the UK of being implicated in explosions on the Nord Stream pipelines in September. The UK says these are 'false claims on an epic scale.' Western officials said on Wednesday that Russia's increasingly wild allegations about nuclear weapons and sabotage attacks are a way to distract from its failing war. The protests follow a frenzy of anti-British claims, while demands to retaliate against the UK have come from Russian officials and state TV. The UK is being spuriously blamed for explosions in the Nord Stream gas pipelines and a drone attack on the naval port Sevastopol in annexed Crimea. 'The UK ambassador will be summoned and will be given the appropriate materials,' said foreign ministry spokesman Maria Zakharova a day ahead of the meeting. The official alleged 'the participation of British specialists in the preparation of Kyiv's attacks'. If anti-Putin protesters want to organise a demonstration in Moscow, it is almost impossible to get permission. Close Putin crony Nikolai Patrushev - secretary of the Russian security council - repeated the allegations against Britain in a Moscow speech today. 'According to the Russian defence ministry, representatives of the British naval forces took part in [the] planning and implementation [of attacks],' he said. 'It is impossible not to pay attention to the SMS message, which at that time British Prime Minister Liz Truss immediately reports to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken after the gas pipelines were blown up that 'everything is done'.' He claimed: 'Literally from the first minutes after the reports of explosions on the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines, an active campaign was launched to accuse Russia. 'However, it is obvious that the main beneficiary of these terrorist attacks is the United States.' Ms Zakharova had accused Bronnert of 'criminal hypocrisy' in laying flowers at the Solovetsky Stone on the eve of the Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Political Repression while Britain was supposedly involved in the drone attacks on the weekend. Earlier today, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Ukrainian forces can retake the strategic southern city of Kherson from Putin's troops, in what would be a major defeat for Russia in its invasion of its neighbor. Austin's remarks coincided with a Russian-installed official in Kherson region saying Moscow was likely to pull its troops from the west bank of the Dnipro River, signaling a significant treat, if confirmed. Ukraine said it was still fighting in the area and was wary of the occupying Russian forces setting a trap. Austin did not answer a question about whether Russian forces were preparing to leave. But, in perhaps his most optimistic comments yet on the Ukrainian counter-offensive, expressed confidence in their ability to beat back Russian forces. 'On the issue of whether the Ukrainians can take the remaining territory on the west side of the Dnipro river and in Kherson, I certainly believe that they have the capability to do that,' Austin told a news conference at the Pentagon. 'Most importantly, the Ukrainians believe they have the capability to do that. We have seen them engage in a very methodical but effective effort to take back their sovereign territory.' The region's capital and river port Kherson is the only big city Russia has captured intact since its invasion began on February 24."
2022-11-03,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11386753/US-Air-Force-tanker-appears-draw-sky-penis-near-Russias-Syrian-naval-base.html,Ballsy move! USAF tanker draws a giant PENIS in the sky near Russia's Syrian naval base as Vladimir Putin's ailing Ukraine war is made mockery of,"A US Air Force tanker appeared to draw a penis in the sky nearby Russia's Syrian naval base as the war in Ukraine persists. The cheeky sighting on Tuesday night was hard to ignore as the US KC-135 Stratotanker refueling plane outlined the ballsy drawing over Russia's naval facility in Tartus off the Mediterranean, according to Politico. US military members took off in the planes amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Earlier this week Russia lost 950 soldiers to Ukraine, marking the deadliest day for Vladimir Putin. It's unclear whether the drawing was intentional or where the refueling plane came from. This weeks event wasn't the first time US military aircrafts got too close to Russian territory. Before the war between Russia and Ukraine, three US navy planes closely approached Russian aircraft in the Mediterranean in February, according to Reuters. The unintentional approach occurred as tension was rising between Russia and Ukraine a week before the war broke out on February 24. While the interactions are common, the Pentagon was concerned at the time about the potential outcomes during the uncertain time. 'While no one was hurt, interactions such as these could result in miscalculations and mistakes that lead to more dangerous outcomes,' a Pentagon spokesperson said. The war between Russia and Ukraine persists as nearly 1,000 Russian soldiers were killed on Sunday in Ukraine, Kyiv. The event went down as the deadliest day for Putin since his troops invaded eight months ago. The Russian death toll in Kyiv is now up to at least 71,200. It comes as as Russia tries to round up as many men as possible and quickly push them to the front lines, regardless of skill, training and equipment. The UK's Ministry of Defense (MoD) said in its latest intelligence briefing that Russia has deployed several thousand newly mobilized reservists to the front line in Ukraine - but in many cases they are 'poorly equipped'. 'In September, Russian officers were concerned that some recently mobilised reservists were arriving in Ukraine without weapons,' the MoD said. Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's power plants and other key infrastructure as the war enters its ninth month. Large parts of Ukraine are already experiencing rolling power cuts as a result."
2022-11-03,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11385799/Russia-planning-retreat-Kherson-Western-officials-claim.html,"Russia is planning to RETREAT from Kherson and play it off as a civilian evacuation - and has already removed its flag from buildings - as Putin sacks ANOTHER top general, Western officials say","Russia is planning to retreat from the city of Kherson and play it off as a civilian evacuation, Western officials said today. Putin's troops are in the advanced stages of preparing for the retreat, the officials said, having moved conscripts into the city to cover the backs of the fleeing soldiers and beefed up defences on the other side of the Dnipro River. While no final call has been made, officials believe Russian commanders have decided that Kherson 'is not worth defending' and that fleeing to better positions across the Dnipro will improve their chances of holding on as winter falls. They spoke as footage emerged from Kherson showing a Russian flag that has been flying over city hall for months has suddenly disappeared. Meanwhile Colonel-General Alexander Lapin, head of Russia's central military district now thought to be responsible for defences in Donbas, has 'probably' been sacked. It comes after General Lapin came under heavy criticism from both Ramzan Kadyrov and Yevgeny Prigozhin, Putin loyalists and hardliners, for perceived failings since the start of the war. General Lapin was the last commander who ordered Russian forces across Ukraine's border in February who was still in post. His departure, if confirmed, speaks to a shift of power taking place inside the Kremlin away from the Ministry of Defence and to warlords such as Kadyrov - Chechen dictator - and Prigozhin - founder of Wagner. News of Russia's withdrawal from Kherson follows weeks of back-and-forth claims about the situation there - with Russia hinting the city is about to fall while Ukraine insists Putin is reinforcing it. Complicating the situation is a near-total news blackout from Ukrainian forces on the frontlines as they try to break through Russian defences. Two weeks ago, there was hope the city was on the verge of being liberated as General Surovikin - head of Russian forces in Ukraine - warned of a 'tense' situation and began evacuating civilians. But as the days ticked by with no sign of a Ukrainian breakthrough, Kyiv began briefing that wet weather and mud was hindering its advance. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's military intelligence, then gave an interview in which he said Russia is sending reinforcements to the city and plans to defend it. He confidently predicted that Kyiv's forces would push the Russians out, but said it would take until the end of this month to do so. Amidst the conflicting reports, some have suggested that Moscow is playing a disinformation game aimed at luring Ukraine into a death-trap. Western officials, speaking on condition of anonymity on Thursday, sought to clarify the situation by saying Russia is planning an 'orderly, well-planned and deliberate' retreat to the east bank of the Dnipro. Russia's commanders have already crossed the river, they added, leaving a force of regular troops - largely conscripts - behind to face the Ukrainians. However, they refused to say when the retreat might take place and admitted that Ukraine's advances have been 'slow going' - which will likely get even slower as wetter weather turns the ground to mud. Losing the city of Kherson - the only regional capital that Russian forces have captured since February - would be the most-humiliating loss Putin has yet suffered. It is also the capital of the wider Kherson region, which he recently annexed to Russia and vowed to use 'all forces' to defend. That has raised fears that he could deploy Russia's nuclear arsenal, though the Western officials said they have not yet seen any sign of that happening. Putin is likely to come under huge pressure from within Russia if Kherson falls. The last retreat - a disorderly route in Kharkiv - saw sharp criticism levelled at his generals for failing to hold the territory and led to mobilistion being declared. That order, in turn, sparked protests across Russia and saw hundreds of thousands flee the country, further worsening Putin's situation. Losing Kherson would also open the door for Ukraine to mount an offensive towards Crimea, the jewel in Putin's imperialistic crown. The peninsula was annexed during his last invasion, in 2014, and has become a symbol of Putin's personal prowess and power as a Russian leader. Losing control of that would spell disaster - not just for his invasion, but for his rule of Russia and could see him toppled from power."
2022-11-03,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11385411/Mystery-Putins-goddaughter-fled-Russia-said-returning-soon.html,Mystery as Putin's 'goddaughter' who fled Russia for the West a week ago because she was in 'big trouble' is now said to be returning 'very soon',"A week after fleeing Russia for the West amid fear of arrest, there are suggestions that Vladimir Putin's 'goddaughter' is soon to return to her homeland. TV star and opposition politician Ksenia Sobchak, 40, was seen last week walking across the border between Belarus and Lithuania in dramatic CCTV footage. Her attempt to flee came after her luxury home near Moscow was searched amid reports she was a suspect in a criminal case that could see her jailed for up to 15 years. She has remained largely quiet since fleeing Russia, having shared only one short message to her followers that read: 'Yes, I am in trouble. Possibly, in big trouble.' But her mother Lyudmila Narusova, a senator, told a state-run news agency Ksenia is set to return to Russia, saying: 'She will, very soon.' Narusova confirmed her daughter had used an Israeli passport to flee to Lithuania, noting that 'the constitution of the Russian Federation allows dual citizenship'. Contrary to earlier fears, Narusova claimed Ksenia was not a suspect in an extortion case against her business partner Kirill Sukhanov and former Russian Tatler editor Arian Romanovsky. Her lawyers were appealing against the move to search her house, said Narusova, who has been a staunch critic of Putin's war in Ukraine. Sobchak's desperate dash to Lithuania came amid suspicions she was tipped off by a senior Russian official of moves to arrest her, giving her time to flee. As she left the country, Sobchak was named as a suspect in the same case as Sukhanov and Romanovsky, namely 'extortion to obtain property on a particularly large scale'. But Narusova has pointed to reports that her daughter is no longer a suspect in the case, and Sobchak earlier dismissed Sukhanov's detention as 'laughable nonsense.' The moves were 'more oppression' against her and the Russian media, she said. The alleged victim of the 'extortion' was Sergey Chemezov, chief executive of Rostec Corporation, a close KGB colleague of Putin's in the Cold War who has remained close ever since. CCTV footage last week appeared to show the moment Sobchak fled to the West on foot to avoid arrest - hours after police raided her mansion. The TV star was seen crossing into Lithuania, a member of NATO, at the Vidzy frontier point 106 miles north of Minsk, according to reports. Sobchak, accompanied by an unknown man, was shown covering her face and wearing a cap as she crosses the border, reports RIA Novosti news agency. The video was apparently leaked from Belarusian border cameras - and Lithuania later confirmed that Sobchak had entered the Baltic state using an Israeli passport. Sobchak, who has known Putin since she was a child, fled Russia for Belarus before entering Lithuania hours after Russian investigators raided her luxury home in a prestigious Moscow suburb. The CCTV from the border reportedly shows a man carrying Sobchak's bag and at one point, he appears to look back to see if they are being followed. At one point the man appears to warn her to lower her head to avoid being seen by the cameras. The footage apparently shows Sobchak going through Belarus passport control at 13.32 local time last Wednesday and telling a border control officer that she is heading to Lithuania. Sobchak is then seen being accompanied by two uniformed men as she carries her own bag to the frontier. The video was leaked, likely with official sanction, to a Telegram channel called Three Sisters with less than 2,000 subscribers. It has links to the security apparatus of Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko. Lithuania's director of the State Security Department (VSD) Darius Jauniškis confirmed that Sobchak had entered Lithuania. He told radio station Zhinyu Radijas that she had Israeli citizenship and could enter and remain for 90 days without a visa. Earlier in the war Sobchak had travelled to Israel and back to Russia but at the time denied reports that she had been issued with an Israeli passport. Lithuania normally now blocks entry to Russian citizens due to Putin's war. Separately, Russian political scientist Sergei Markov claimed that a 'high-ranking official' had tipped off Sobchak that she faced arrest. The timing of the Russian state media announcement that she had left Belarus for Lithuania was only 36 minutes after she had apparently been cleared for exit by the Belarus border guard. This may indicate that Putin had given her tacit permission to flee to the West rather than see his 'goddaughter' held in detention like his other political foes. Sobchak reportedly bought tickets to both Turkey and Dubai to 'confuse' state investigators seeking her arrest. Then she travelled to Belarus by car and left for the West in a 'smart operational escape plan in order to avoid arrest'. A socialite-turned-politician, Sobchak was once called the Paris Hilton of Moscow. She was a popular reality TV presenter and once posed for Playboy. She hosted the Russian version of Big Brother and went on to stand as a liberal candidate against Putin in the 2018 presidential election - rigged in Putin's favour - when she came fourth. One of Russia's best known faces, she now runs independent media outlets which have angered Putin's officials. Putin has known her since her childhood and he attended her baptism in the Orthodox Church, leading to rumours he is her godfather. Her father, Anatoly Sobchak, was Putin's law professor and mentor who later gave the KGB spy his first foothold in politics as his deputy when he served as mayor of St Petersburg. Later Putin even smuggled Ksenia's father out of Russia for medical treatment in the West at a time when his patron was accused by foes of corruption. Putin was later pictured at the former mayor's funeral in 2000, alongside Ksenia, and her mother. Narusova has voted against war-linked legislation in the Russian parliament and accused his state TV of 'shameless lies' over the conflict. Despite criticising Putin, Ksenia held a private meeting with the Russian leader before announcing she would oppose him in the poll. This led to claims that she was conspiring with him to give a cloak of respectability to a rigged election. The close family links have not saved Sobchak from harassment by Putin's police. Sobchak was named as a suspect in the same case, namely 'extortion to obtain property on a particularly large scale'. Footage showed the other men involved in the criminal case, who face sentences of up to 15 years, in court. Had she not fled, Sobchak would also have been brought to court on the same accusation. Police were reported as seeking to detain Sobchak at a VIP Moscow airport when it was announced she had reached the West by land. Sobchak had dismissed Sukhanov's detention as 'simply delirium', adding: 'It is laughable, nonsense.' She said her outlets were 'the last free media office in Russia', which Putin's regime had decided to 'shut'. 'They have got nothing to dig on us, which infuriates them,' she said of Putin's authorities. When details of the criminal case emerged, pro-Putin propagandist Sergei Mardan said it was a warning for her to flee. 'The land is burning under Sobchak and the best way out would be to change her country of residence, and at the same time citizenship,' he posted. 'Perhaps the detention of Kirill Sukhanov and the searches at Sobchak's place are a subtle hint from above about the undesirability of her further stay on the territory of Russia.' Political scientist Sergei Markov said: 'If you are ready to arrest for a trifle, for simple extortion, for money, even the daughter of President Putin's beloved teacher and mentor, who everyone forgave for many years, then there are no untouchables now.' The exit of Sobchak, who was both loved and loathed, led to trolling on social media, accusing her of abandoning her motherland. She had earlier denied claims she had secret Israeli citizenship, and insisted she would not quit Russia. There is no passport control between 'union state' Russia and Belarus, which means the Vidzy crossing acted as her exit point from Russia. Belarus has been used as a transit point by some escapees from Putin's mobilisation in recent weeks."
2022-11-03,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11384139/US-admits-increasingly-concerned-Moscows-nuclear-sabre-rattling-sparked-setbacks.html,Alarm bells ring in the White House after Putin's generals discussed NUKING Ukraine: US admits it's 'increasingly concerned' over Moscow's nuclear sabre-rattling sparked by Russian setbacks in the battlefield,"The US has admitted it is 'increasingly concerned' over Moscow's nuclear sabre-rattling after it emerged top Russian military officials discussed nuking Ukraine. The New York Times report, which cited unnamed US officials, said Russian President Vladimir Putin did not take part in the discussions, and there was no indication that the Russian military had decided to deploy the weapons. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said: 'We have grown increasingly concerned about the potential as these months have gone on.' Kirby did not confirm the report that said high-level Russian military officials recently discussed when and how they might use tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield. But Kirby said any comments on the use of nuclear weapons by Russia are 'deeply concerning,' and said the US takes them seriously. He pointed to recent Putin comments talking about nuclear weapons and referencing the bombs US forces dropped on the Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki near the end of World War II. 'We take note of that,' Kirby said. 'It increasingly is unsettling in terms of the degree to which he feels he has to continue to stretch to prosecute this war,' he said. At the same time, Kirby reiterated, Washington sees no indications that Russia is making preparations to use nuclear weapons, adding that US intelligence does not necessarily see or know everything. The US has been warning Moscow for weeks over public comments from top Russian officials that they could use nuclear weapons in Ukraine in certain cases, particularly if they felt there was a threat to Russian territorial integrity. The most recent threat came from former Russian president and senior security council official Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev said on Tuesday that Ukraine's objective to reclaim all its territories occupied by Russia, which include the Donbas region and Crimea, would be a 'threat to the existence of our state.' That, Medvedev said, would be 'a direct reason' to invoke nuclear deterrence. However, early Wednesday Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Western media was 'deliberately pumping up the topic of the use of nuclear weapons.' Moscow does 'not have the slightest intention to take part in this,' he said, calling the Times report 'very irresponsible.' In September, Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden's national security advisor, said that the US has warned Russia at 'very high levels' of 'catastrophic consequences' for using nuclear arms. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned on October 13 that Russian forces would be 'annihilated' by the West if Putin uses nuclear weapons against Ukraine. Russia's nuclear stockpile, the largest in the world, consists of 'tactical', lower-yield bombs and strategic weapons that can annihilate cities and population centres. Its tactical nukes, with a yield of between ten and 100 kilotons, are designed for use on the battlefield in contested territory. In comparison, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 was approximately 18 kilotons. Last week, Putin spoke at length about nuclear weapons, having threatened the West several times with an atomic strike – sparking fears he may also use one in Ukraine. The despot denied he has any plans to use one on his neighbour, saying there is 'no political or military justification' for doing so. But he also referred back to Russia's nuclear doctrine which allows them to be used in the event the country is threatened which – at least according to the Kremlin – now includes occupied parts of Ukraine. Fears of escalation have been building as the war in Ukraine grinds into its ninth month, with Kyiv on the front foot and Putin nowhere near achieving his aims. Though the official purpose of the invasion remains the 'liberation' of the eastern Donbas region, according to Putin, in reality his troops have stopped advancing almost everywhere besides the town of Bakhmut, in Donetsk. Meanwhile they are being pushed back in the northern Kharkiv region and southern region of Kherson – the latter of which Putin has declared to be part of Russia. That has sparked fears he could resort to nukes, after he said he would use 'all available means' to defend the territory. It comes after Moscow alleged that Ukraine is preparing to detonate a so-called 'dirty bomb' on its territory, meaning a conventional explosive laced with radioactive material to cause contamination. Kyiv said accusations it would use such tactics on its own territory are absurd, but that Russia might be planning such actions itself to blame Ukraine. The UN's atomic watchdog has been dispatched to two areas of Ukraine where Putin alleges the bomb is being prepared – at Kyiv's insistence – as President Volodymyr Zelensky and his allies dismiss the claims as fiction. Instead, they said Russia may be preparing the ground to use one of its own nukes as a pretext for escalating the conflict. US President Joe Biden, asked about Putin's assertion he would never use nukes in Ukraine, responded last week: 'Why does he keep talking about it? 'Why is he talking about the ability to use a tactical nuclear weapon? He's been very dangerous in how he's approached this and he should just get out. 'He can end this all, get out of Ukraine.'"

Here, in a portentous dispatch, he explains how they have their sights set on victory","For Ukrainians, the situation is clear. Vladimir Putin's torture of their country through invasion started eight years ago when 'little green men' suddenly began blocking roads, building checkpoints and seizing government buildings in Crimea. These were Putin's special forces, in unmarked uniforms and vehicles, who grabbed the precious peninsula for the Kremlin - and began a war that exploded into bloodshed, carnage and devastation across their land this year. 'Everything started with Crimea and will end with it,' declared President Volodymyr Zelensky two months ago. 'Crimea stands with Ukraine and is waiting for us to return. I want you all to know, we will definitely be back.' Bold words from a brave leader, spoken shortly before his forces made a stunning breakthrough in eastern Ukraine that dramatically changed the narrative of this dispiriting war. Now Ukraine is advancing towards that goal of liberating Crimea, the ultimate prize in this cruellest of conflicts. Its forces are moving forward in the key southern region that supplies the peninsula's water, mounting daring raids on military sites across the area — and sparking fears, which escalate with each mile of advance, that Moscow might respond with the use of nuclear weapons. For the 2014 annexation may have been illegal but it was wildly popular in Russia. It was a defining moment for Putin, supposedly fulfilling his pledge to restore his nation's greatness after the collapse of the Soviet empire. The seizure caused Putin's support to surge to record levels as he claimed: 'Crimea has always been an integral part of Russia in the hearts and minds of people.' He talks about it in mystical terms, describing it as a 'sacred place' and their 'holy land'. This is the dictator, after all, who has posed as a successor to the great Russian Tsars such as Peter the Great — who launched his nation's imperial expansion with a battle in central Ukraine at the start of the 18th century — and Catherine the Great, who captured Crimea in 1783. Putin's brazen theft of Crimea underscored his own propaganda by expanding Russia's terrain. Now he claims to be the strongman standing up for his people, absurdly proclaiming that he will protect them from 'Nazis' in Ukraine and Nato. Yet Kyiv thinks it can win back Crimea by next summer as its forces advance. And, after doing so, it intends to order hundreds of thousands of Russians to leave immediately, ratcheting up the stakes. Tamila Tasheva, President Zelensky's adviser on Crimea, told me up to 800,000 Russians had entered their land without permission. 'According to our law and international law, if people cross the border illegally they need to be deported.' Ukraine is also drawing up plans to review all property deals and court decisions made under Russian occupation to ensure their citizens have not had homes stolen, assets seized or been treated unfairly by courts under the Kremlin's repressive system. But can the country really retake Crimea — that lush slab of land beneath Ukraine in the Black Sea; the long-standing base for Russia's navy, home to more than two million people and such a crucial prop for the carefully constructed narrative of Putin's regime? And what will happen if Kyiv recaptures the city of Kherson —administrative capital of the region that controls Crimea's water supply — and then moves on towards the peninsula? Could this be the trigger for a nuclear conflagration? Certainly Ukraine's leaders are well aware of the huge risks as their forces advance through the Belgium-sized region of Kherson, carving through the 'fresh meat' of poorly equipped conscripts sent by Moscow to shore up Putin's bungled invasion. Several Ukrainian sources have acknowledged to me the diminutive despot might not be bluffing when he warns that he is prepared to use 'all existing means' to protect Russia's 'territorial integrity' as the Kremlin ramps up its bellicose rhetoric. Officials candidly admit their moves to retake Crimea present a serious risk, given its emotional and political significance to Putin. 'That's when he might use tactical nuclear weapons,' said Anton Gerashchenko, an interior ministry adviser. Another source close to Zelensky said they fear Russia might respond with tactical nuclear weapons to close off the narrow land connection from Ukraine to Crimea. 'But if they do that, this issue goes beyond Ukraine — it becomes something international,' he said. Even Kyrylo Budanov, Kyiv's audacious head of military intelligence who is blamed by Moscow for overseeing recent attacks on Crimea, admits the threat is real since 'our neighbour is sick' — although he downplays the threat of a nuclear strike. But while Ukraine's wartime leaders acknowledge the severity of the risk, they believe they cannot give in to nuclear blackmail. Otherwise their country's torment will continue for many years as Moscow's dictatorship tries to smash their democracy. Intriguingly, however, one well-placed source told me that Ukraine would accept a peace deal based on Russia pulling back to the borders as they were before the full-scale invasion in February. This would let Putin retain Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine seized later in 2014. 'But if you write this, we'll deny it,' he said. Given Ukraine's visceral hatred of the enemy following months of atrocities, it seems unlikely the country's population would accept such a deal. Besides, since the war started, Putin has claimed four more stolen regions of Ukraine for Russia, in addition to Crimea. His move last month to annex chunks of eastern and southern Ukraine, using the same template that I witnessed him using in Crimea in 2014 — of sham referendums with voters made to cast their ballots at gunpoint under Russian occupation — almost certainly crushes hopes of such a ceasefire. It means the dictator must now defend these new 'Russian' regions, which include Kherson, however many of his fellow citizens die on the bloodstained frontline — or else he will see his pretensions of greatness shredded and his rule possibly come to a sudden end. So Ukraine is determined to press on for Crimea, aware that it is vulnerable to a battlefield nuclear weapon being used to block its passage. Its forces are pushing hard to retake Kherson city by the end of this month, having made several previous unsuccessful assaults — and I understand there are hopes of another major breakthrough further along the frontline, despite the arrival of the muddy season that turns offensive operations into a tough slog. Russia has withdrawn heavy offensive weapons from Kherson to avoid the massive losses of equipment it suffered in last month's retreat in eastern Ukraine. But it has beefed up troop numbers with hundreds of recently mobilised men as it prepares to defend the key city. It is also building lines of 'dragon's teeth' anti-tank fortifications deep in Luhansk to slow Kyiv's advance. Meanwhile there has been a string of assaults on Crimea by Ukraine to disrupt supply lines and spread fear. These began in July when a drone blasted the Black Sea fleet's headquarters, injuring five and forcing cancellation of their Navy Day celebrations. Then came a devastating strike on an airfield, knocking out half the fleet's combat aircraft, followed by a huge explosion at an ammunition dump. Such attacks had 'a significant psychological effect' on Russia's leaders, according to one Western official. But the biggest humiliation for Putin came with last month's damaging explosion on his beloved road and rail Kerch Bridge that links Russia to Crimea, which he opened in 2018 by driving a truck over its 12-mile span. The attack sparked panic buying of food and fuel. The Kremlin responded by launching drone and missile strikes across Ukraine two days later. These have continued now for almost a month, and crippled energy and heating facilities as temperatures fall ahead of winter. Yet the devastating strikes have not deterred Ukraine. Three Russian warships, including the Black Sea fleet flagship, were reportedly damaged in the latest daring Ukrainian response — an attack by a swarm of drones, nine in the air and seven at sea. A flick of film footage leaked to a Ukrainian journalist is thought to have come from a drone boat that rammed a Russian frigate, showing once again how this conflict is rewriting the tactics of modern warfare. Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine's intelligence chief who has family links to Crimea, insists they will recapture the peninsula and is dismissive of those saying Ukraine should not provoke Russia for fear of escalation. 'It's just plain stupid,' he told me. 'All types of weapons existing in the world are already being used in Ukraine — from firing ballistic missiles from submarines to using tanks and aerial bombardments.' But for Putin, already facing criticism of his botched invasion from some hardline nationalists who are normally his most loyal of allies, the loss of Crimea would be catastrophic given his bogus claim to have righted an historic injustice for Russia with its annexation. The reality is rather different. Crimea, originally wrenched by Russia from the decaying Ottoman Empire, was handed to the Soviet republic of Ukraine in 1954 — a logical move given its location. After the collapse of communism, its citizens voted in a referendum for Ukrainian independence in 1991 like every other region. The peninsula is the traditional home of Muslim Tatars, who have been targeted repeatedly by Russian leaders — most infamously in 1944, when Joseph Stalin deported 200,000 of them to Central Asia. Families were given just 15 minutes to pack — then huge numbers died from cold, hunger and thirst after being crammed into cattle trucks. Putin has continued the ethnic cleansing since stealing Crimea. Russians moved en masse to the peninsula, lured by its benign climate, beachside resorts and coastal cliffs, while 100,000 Ukrainians —including 50,000 Tatars — have fled Putin's rule. Another 10,000 Tatars left in recent weeks after their community was targeted for mobilisation. 'Papers were handed to teachers, hospital staff, people at mosques during Friday prayers,' said Oleksii Tilnenko, director of activist group Crimea SOS. 'They fear mobilisation as covert genocide. Many tried to leave but this amounts to deportation again.' Putin has used more subtle ploys than Stalin to change the ethnic composition, relying on a mixture of repression to silence dissent and bureaucracy to make life difficult for non-Russians to buy homes, run firms or educate children. 'Many people accepted a different identity because they know it is risky for your life, your liberty, your security to stay Ukrainian,' said Tilnenko. 'Now if you walk down the street, one in three people is not from Crimea.' In recent months Russia's stooges have intensified the crackdown —even arresting six guests at a Tatar wedding for dancing to a pro-Ukrainian song. 'People who behave like this are traitors,' claimed Sergei Aksyonov, the patsy leader of Crimea. Putin spent an astonishing £20 billion on Crimea in the first five years of his annexation, beefing up military bases and building infrastructure projects such as a new airport at Sevastopol and that bridge — the longest in Europe — over to the mainland. But Ukraine argues most new Russian arrivals will have to leave when they take back the peninsula. Presidential adviser Tasheva, a Crimean Tatar who was born in Uzbekistan after her grandparents were deported from their homeland, insists: 'If they are illegal they must return or flee Crimea after de-occupation. Then they can request to the Ukrainian state the right to get residence.' She said applications from Russians with Ukrainian spouses or children would be viewed sympathetically, along with those offering evidence of support for Kyiv. 'This is a difficult issue — they are illegally staying on territory of another state and taking part in illegal colonisation.' Tasheva admits that Crimea is a place of pride for Putin, a symbol of his rule. 'His narrative during years of occupation was that we will protect our people. Now our military forces are on the offensive in these regions. Putin could do anything.' But as she says, this is the rightful territory of Ukraine and Crimean Tatars. 'We are fighting for our people. Russia is going to leave this war zone and we are going to bring back our land.' Additional reporting by Kate Baklitskaya Alarm bells ring in the White House after Putin's generals discussed NUKING Ukraine: US admits it's 'increasingly concerned' over Moscow's nuclear sabre-rattling sparked by Russian setbacks in the battlefield ByJonathan Rose For Mailonline The US has admitted it is 'increasingly concerned' over Moscow's nuclear sabre-rattling after it emerged top Russian military officials discussed nuking Ukraine. The New York Times report, which cited unnamed US officials, said Russian President Vladimir Putin did not take part in the discussions, and there was no indication that the Russian military had decided to deploy the weapons. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said: 'We have grown increasingly concerned about the potential as these months have gone on.' Kirby did not confirm the report that said high-level Russian military officials recently discussed when and how they might use tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield. But Kirby said any comments on the use of nuclear weapons by Russia are 'deeply concerning,' and said the US takes them seriously. He pointed to recent Putin comments talking about nuclear weapons and referencing the bombs US forces dropped on the Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki near the end of World War II. 'We take note of that,' Kirby said. 'It increasingly is unsettling in terms of the degree to which he feels he has to continue to stretch to prosecute this war,' he said. At the same time, Kirby reiterated, Washington sees no indications that Russia is making preparations to use nuclear weapons, adding that US intelligence does not necessarily see or know everything. The US has been warning Moscow for weeks over public comments from top Russian officials that they could use nuclear weapons in Ukraine in certain cases, particularly if they felt there was a threat to Russian territorial integrity. The most recent threat came from former Russian president and senior security council official Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev said on Tuesday that Ukraine's objective to reclaim all its territories occupied by Russia, which include the Donbas region and Crimea, would be a 'threat to the existence of our state.' That, Medvedev said, would be 'a direct reason' to invoke nuclear deterrence. However, early Wednesday Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Western media was 'deliberately pumping up the topic of the use of nuclear weapons.' Moscow does 'not have the slightest intention to take part in this,' he said, calling the Times report 'very irresponsible.' In September, Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden's national security advisor, said that the US has warned Russia at 'very high levels' of 'catastrophic consequences' for using nuclear arms. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned on October 13 that Russian forces would be 'annihilated' by the West if Putin uses nuclear weapons against Ukraine. Russia's nuclear stockpile, the largest in the world, consists of 'tactical', lower-yield bombs and strategic weapons that can annihilate cities and population centres. Its tactical nukes, with a yield of between ten and 100 kilotons, are designed for use on the battlefield in contested territory. In comparison, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 was approximately 18 kilotons. Last week, Putin spoke at length about nuclear weapons, having threatened the West several times with an atomic strike – sparking fears he may also use one in Ukraine. The despot denied he has any plans to use one on his neighbour, saying there is 'no political or military justification' for doing so. But he also referred back to Russia's nuclear doctrine which allows them to be used in the event the country is threatened which – at least according to the Kremlin – now includes occupied parts of Ukraine. Fears of escalation have been building as the war in Ukraine grinds into its ninth month, with Kyiv on the front foot and Putin nowhere near achieving his aims. Though the official purpose of the invasion remains the 'liberation' of the eastern Donbas region, according to Putin, in reality his troops have stopped advancing almost everywhere besides the town of Bakhmut, in Donetsk. Meanwhile they are being pushed back in the northern Kharkiv region and southern region of Kherson – the latter of which Putin has declared to be part of Russia. That has sparked fears he could resort to nukes, after he said he would use 'all available means' to defend the territory. It comes after Moscow alleged that Ukraine is preparing to detonate a so-called 'dirty bomb' on its territory, meaning a conventional explosive laced with radioactive material to cause contamination. Kyiv said accusations it would use such tactics on its own territory are absurd, but that Russia might be planning such actions itself to blame Ukraine. The UN's atomic watchdog has been dispatched to two areas of Ukraine where Putin alleges the bomb is being prepared – at Kyiv's insistence – as President Volodymyr Zelensky and his allies dismiss the claims as fiction. Instead, they said Russia may be preparing the ground to use one of its own nukes as a pretext for escalating the conflict. US President Joe Biden, asked about Putin's assertion he would never use nukes in Ukraine, responded last week: 'Why does he keep talking about it? 'Why is he talking about the ability to use a tactical nuclear weapon? He's been very dangerous in how he's approached this and he should just get out. 'He can end this all, get out of Ukraine.'"
2022-11-02,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11379819/Thousands-troops-added-Army-new-Defence-Secretary.html,Thousands more troops will be added to Army under new move by Defence Secretary,"Thousands more junior troops will be added to the Army under plans being put to the Treasury. The scheme would bolster the lower ranks by around 4,000. But to balance the books, there would be fewer senior officers. The plans come after current projections, drawn up before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, suggest full-time troop numbers will fall from 77,000 to 73,000 by 2025. The Defence Secretary is expected to put the proposals to the Chancellor this week. Ben Wallace will tell Jeremy Hunt that, as the threat to UK and international security increases, so must the capability of our Armed Forces. In testimony to a House of Lords committee yesterday Mr Wallace, a former Scots Guards officer, said: ‘In my negotiations with the Treasury I will be looking at whether we should go down [to 73,000] or whether we can maintain it. ‘I have also asked the army to reduce its salary envelope and to review its structures. 'I don’t think my regiment has changed its structure since 1930, the same number of captains, the same number of lieutenants ‘The Army’s salvation is in its own hands. It might be able to have more people if we produce a different looking salary package. 'We can also further reflect modernisation and autonomy.’ Mr Wallace added the Army was ‘15 years out of date’ compared to some other NATO members in its equipment due to successive budget cuts. While the RAF has more stealth jets than pilots capable of flying them due to issues around training. Mr Wallace hopes Mr Hunt will ensure the defence budget is protected from inflation and changes in currency values - which affect the cost of purchasing kit from overseas. He said: ‘We are having to take account of the economic challenges at the moment and we will wait to see what the budget produces. ‘I will have a meeting with the Chancellor this week around what that will mean for my department. ‘I am confident defence is moving up the funding priority ladder. Inflation is the biggest enemy. I am particularly vulnerable to inflation and exchange rate pressures. I will be seeking insulation from those.’"
2022-11-02,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11383061/Russian-conscripts-resorting-playing-dead-battlefield.html,Russian conscripts are resorting to 'playing dead on the battlefield' as they are sent in to fight with poor equipment and insufficient training,"Russian conscripts are resorting to 'playing dead on the battlefield' as they are sent to fight in Ukraine with poor equipment and insufficient training. The wife of a Russian man sent to fight in Moscow’s 423rd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment said that her husband and his fellow conscripts pretended to be dead, as they only had machine guns to defend themselves. He and others are facing court martial after leaving the frontline in Ukraine. It comes as antidepressant sales in Russia skyrocketed as the miserable reality of Putin's war in Ukraine finally dawns on the public, Western officials said. Russians spent 70 per cent more on the pills in the first eight months of this year compared to last, even though they spent much of 2021 in Covid lockdowns, figures have shown. 'Russians feel frightened' as the 'catastrophic error' of Vladimir Putin's invasion - including conscription and a tanking economy - begin to hit people's lives, the officials added. At least 400,000 have fled since Putin announced he would begin drafting people into the army in September, significantly more than the 300,000 he added to his ranks. Ekaterina said that her 27-year-old husband was trained in trench digging before being moved to the frontline. She told independent Russian outlet Novaya Gazeta Europe: 'For many hours they simply lay on the ground and pretended to be dead for one simple reason: they no longer had any weapons other than machine guns. 'There were mortars against them, drones flew over them, if they even moved a finger, then a drone would immediately fly in and destroy them.' Another wife, Irina, said that her husband, 24, was shelled for 12 hours, with one of his commanders 'torn to pieces' by the attack. She told the Russian news site that the surviving commander ordered a retreat, before more senior military authorities sent them back to the front line. 'After they refused to return, they were offered new equipment, bulletproof vests, helmets—or a court martial,' the woman told the news outlet. Ukraine will push Russia back to its pre-invasion border by the end of the year and retake Crimea next summer, a retired US general has predicted. Ben Hodges, former commander of US forces in Europe, believes Ukraine is capable of re-taking thousands of square miles of territory in the south and east within the next two months before pushing into Crimea - the crown jewel of Putin's 2014 war. General Hodges, speaking in Westminster on Monday at an event hosted by the Council on Geostrategy, admitted his vision is 'optimistic' but confidently predicted that 'Ukraine will win.' Officials say there is no sign that Putin has decided to change course in Ukraine and no sign that anyone is preparing to replace him. Russia is now into its ninth month of fighting in Ukraine and has failed to achieve any of the military objectives set by Putin at the start of the war. The Kremlin thought it was getting involved in an easy conflict that would take days to resolve and had 'no Plan B' for what to do if the war went awry, officials said. 'They still don't have Plan B,' the officials added. That has led to growing dissent both within the Russian population and the elite close to Putin, who are increasingly willing to voice that discontent in public. Russians are not in favour of the war, the officials said, and elites are increasingly worried about the cost to their businesses and also the prospect that their children may be called to fight on the frontlines. That has led to the likes of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner boss dubbed 'Putin's chef', to publicly criticise the way the war is being run - though not Putin himself. Officials added there is 'no likely prospect of a change of leadership' in Russia in the near-term - though did flag elections due in 2024 as a moment of likely tension. 'He has been weakened by this really catastrophic error,' said the Western official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'We are seeing the Russian military humbled on the battlefield by Ukraine. People can see that he has made a big error,' said the same official. 'That has to mean that people are talking more about succession, they are talking more about what comes next, they are imagining a life beyond. But what I am not doing is suggesting that that's anytime soon.' In an attempt to distract from his own failures, the officials said that Putin is making increasingly wild and baseless claims as a way of diverting attention. They picked out threats of a 'dirty bomb', allegations that the UK and US attacked the Nord Stream pipes, and claims about Liz Truss's hacked phones as examples. Russia is also increasingly relying on missiles strikes on Ukraine's power grid, water supplies and cities as a means of breaking Ukrainian support for the conflict. But, if anything, it appears to have strengthened their resolve, the officials said. They also revealed that 'frequent' conversations are taking place with Russian counterparts about 'serious' peace talks, though there is no sign of that yet. Moscow is facing a dire situation on the battlefields of Ukraine as it attempts to defend a frontline hundreds of miles long with badly mauled units as winter hits. Kyiv has taken advantage of that fact by launching counter-attacks in the north and south which have recaptured swathes of territory. Troops continue to make plodding advances towards the city of Kherson and into Luhansk oblast, in the northwest, amid the hope of another breakthrough. But as the ground softens through autumn those are expected to slow, while vehicles getting bogged down in mud. Winter - which is bitterly cold in Ukraine - is expected to bring a near-total halt to advances as both sides dig in, before renewed fighting in spring. During that time, hundreds of thousands of Russian conscripts are expected to arrive in Ukraine to plug holes in the defensive line and perhaps to carry out attacks when the conditions improve. However, it remains vanishingly unlikely that Putin will be able to achieve his initial aim of toppling the government - and even the reduced aim of 'liberating' the Donbas region looks unlikely."
2022-11-02,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11382643/The-worlds-five-nuclear-superpowers-brink-direct-armed-conflict.html,"The world's five nuclear superpowers are 'on the brink of a direct armed conflict' which will have 'catastrophic consequences', Russia warns","The world's five nuclear superpowers are 'on the brink of a direct armed conflict' which will have 'catastrophic consequences', Russia has warned. The Kremlin said on Wednesday that avoiding a nuclear clash between the world's nuclear powers was its first priority, but accused the West of 'encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction'. Western capitals have said Moscow is behind a ramping up of nuclear rhetoric since Russia invaded Ukraine in February - most recently by repeatedly accusing Kyiv of planning to use a radioactive 'dirty bomb' without offering evidence. Kyiv has denied having any such plan. The Russian Foreign Ministry said it feared the five declared nuclear powers were teetering 'on the brink of a direct armed conflict' and that the West must stop 'encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction, which can lead to catastrophic consequences'. 'We are strongly convinced that in the current complicated and turbulent situation, caused by irresponsible and impudent actions aimed at undermining our national security, the most immediate task is to avoid any military clash of nuclear powers,' the ministry said in a statement. Moscow said it stood by a joint declaration issued together with the US, China, Britain and France in January affirming their joint responsibility for avoiding a nuclear war. 'We fully reaffirm our commitment to the joint statement of the five nuclear-weapon states' leaders on the prevention of nuclear war and the avoidance of an arms race from Jan. 3, 2022,' the ministry said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has appeared on several occasions to threaten a nuclear strike in connection with the war in Ukraine, and Moscow has repeatedly said its military doctrine permits the use of nuclear weapons if Russia's territorial integrity is under threat. In September, Putin said he was 'not bluffing' when he stated that Russia was prepared to use 'all available means' to defend its territory. He also said the US had created a 'precedent' at the end of World War Two when it dropped two atomic bombs on Japan. Shortly afterwards, Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the Chechnya region and a key ally of Putin's, called for Russia to use a 'low-yield nuclear weapon' in Ukraine. Moscow also frequently accuses Kyiv of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, and alleged at the start of the war that the Western NATO alliance planned to use Ukraine as a bridgehead to threaten Russia - allegations denied by Ukraine and NATO. It was previously reported that senior Russian military leaders have discussed when and how they would use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine. The officials talked about scenarios in which they would use nuclear weapons, showing how frustrated the generals are about setbacks on the battlefield in Ukraine. They did not talk about using the weapons with Putin - but the conversations have heightened concern about the prospect of a nuclear Armageddon. US government officials learned about the discussions in mid-October, as Moscow's nuclear rhetoric intensified, reports The New York Times. It comes after Putin joked about the prospect of a nuclear war last week. The Kremlin leader was asked to reassure an audience at the Valdai Discussion Club think-tank that the world is not on the verge of nuclear annihilation – and chose to respond with a long pause. When host Fyodor Lukyanov pointed out his silence was 'alarming', a smirking Putin responded: 'I did that on purpose so you would be on your guard. The effect has been achieved.' John F. Kirby, a National Security Council official, told the New York Times: 'We've been clear from the outset that Russia's comments about the potential use of nuclear weapons are deeply concerning, and we take them seriously. 'We continue to monitor this as best we can, and we see no indications that Russia is making preparations for such use.' Russia's nuclear stockpile, the largest in the world, consists of 'tactical', lower-yield bombs and strategic weapons that can annihilate cities and population centres. Its tactical nukes, with a yield of between ten and 100 kilotons, are designed for use on the battlefield in contested territory. In comparison, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 was approximately 18 kilotons.

Poland begins work on 130-mile fence along its border amid fears Russia is planning to orchestrate an influx of migrants from Africa and the Middle East ByTom Brown For Mailonlineand Afp The Polish government today announced the construction of a 130-mile razor-wire fence along the border with Russia's exclave of Kaliningrad to prevent illegal crossings. Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak announced the decision amid concerns in Warsaw that Russia plans to orchestrate an influx of migrants. 'The airport in Kaliningrad is now accepting flights from the Middle East and North Africa. I decided to take action to enhance the security of the Polish border,' Blaszczak told reporters. 'Already today work will begin... on a temporary barrier' along the 130-mile border, he added. He said the razor-wire fence will be 8ft high and 10ft wide, and will also feature an electronic monitoring system and cameras. Moscow will 'in the near future' summon the British ambassador to hand over 'evidence' of its claim that the UK helped orchestrate an attack on the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Crimea, the foreign ministry said Wednesday. Russia has claimed UK 'specialists' helped Kyiv launch a drone attack on the fleet in Moscow-annexed Crimea at the weekend. Russia has also accused London of being behind September explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines. Russian authorities have so far provided no proof to back up their claims. 'The UK ambassador will be summoned and will be given the appropriate materials,' foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, adding the meeting would take place 'in the near future.' 'The basic materials will be handed over as evidence to the British side and will also be shown to the general public,' she added. Poland already built a steel wall last year along its border with Russian ally Belarus after a migrant influx there. Tens of thousands of migrants and refugees, mostly from the Middle East, have crossed or attempted to cross into Poland from Belarus since 2021. Poland's border guard and NGOs on site continue to report dozens of attempted illegal crossings there on a daily basis. The West believes the influx was orchestrated by Minsk to destabilise the region, a charge denied by the Belarusian regime. Poland sent thousands of troops and police officers to reinforce border guard patrols at the height of the crisis and approved a law allowing migrants to be forced back into Belarus. The so-called pushbacks, and the government's overall tough anti-migration stance, drew condemnation from activists and aid organisations. Lithuania, too, already has a fence along its border with Russia in Vistytis. The existing fence skirts the Suwalki Gap, a stretch of land along the Lithuanian and Polish border between Kaliningrad and Russia-loyal Belarus, which is thought to be an important chokepoint into Europe by Russian strategists. The news comes after four Russian fighter jets were intercepted after taking off from Kaliningrad and forced to return to base after they infringed on Polish air space in early October. Reports came that the jets also infringed on Swedish airspace. Poland is a long-time member of NATO having joined in 1999, while Sweden earlier this year applied for membership to the security bloc alongside Nordic neighbour Finland. Terrified Russia: Antidepressant sales surge as military mobilisation brings reality of Ukraine war home - seeing 400,000 flee the country to avoid conscription.. but there's no sign of Putin toppling yet, Western officials reveal ByChris Pleasance for MailOnline Antidepressant sales in Russia have skyrocketed as the miserable reality of Putin's war in Ukraine finally dawns on the public, Western officials have said.

'The basic materials will be handed over as evidence to the British side and will also be shown to the general public,' she added. Despite that, officials say there is no sign that Putin has decided to change course in Ukraine and no sign that anyone is preparing to replace him. Russia is now into its ninth month of fighting in Ukraine and has failed to achieve any of the military objectives set by Putin at the start of the war. The Kremlin thought it was getting involved in an easy conflict that would take days to resolve and had 'no Plan B' for what to do if the war went awry, officials said. 'They still don't have Plan B,' the officials added. That has led to growing dissent both within the Russian population and the elite close to Putin, who are increasingly willing to voice that discontent in public. Russians are not in favour of the war, the officials said, and elites are increasingly worried about the cost to their businesses and also the prospect that their children may be called to fight on the frontlines. That has led to the likes of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner boss dubbed 'Putin's chef', to publicly criticise the way the war is being run - though not Putin himself. Officials added there is 'no likely prospect of a change of leadership' in Russia in the near-term - though did flag elections due in 2024 as a moment of likely tension. 'He has been weakened by this really catastrophic error,' said the Western official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'We are seeing the Russian military humbled on the battlefield by Ukraine. People can see that he has made a big error,' said the same official. 'That has to mean that people are talking more about succession, they are talking more about what comes next, they are imagining a life beyond. But what I am not doing is suggesting that that's anytime soon.' In an attempt to distract from his own failures, the officials said that Putin is making increasingly wild and baseless claims as a way of diverting attention. They picked out threats of a 'dirty bomb', allegations that the UK and US attacked the Nord Stream pipes, and claims about Liz Truss's hacked phones as examples. Russia is also increasingly relying on missiles strikes on Ukraine's power grid, water supplies and cities as a means of breaking Ukrainian support for the conflict. But, if anything, it appears to have strengthened their resolve, the officials said. They also revealed that 'frequent' conversations are taking place with Russian counterparts about 'serious' peace talks, though there is no sign of that yet. Moscow is facing a dire situation on the battlefields of Ukraine as it attempts to defend a frontline hundreds of miles long with badly mauled units as winter hits. Kyiv has taken advantage of that fact by launching counter-attacks in the north and south which have recaptured swathes of territory. Troops continue to make plodding advances towards the city of Kherson and into Luhansk oblast, in the northwest, amid the hope of another breakthrough. But as the ground softens through autumn those are expected to slow, while vehicles getting bogged down in mud. Winter - which is bitterly cold in Ukraine - is expected to bring a near-total halt to advances as both sides dig in, before renewed fighting in spring. During that time, hundreds of thousands of Russian conscripts are expected to arrive in Ukraine to plug holes in the defensive line and perhaps to carry out attacks when the conditions improve. However, it remains vanishingly unlikely that Putin will be able to achieve his initial aim of toppling the government - and even the reduced aim of 'liberating' the Donbas region looks unlikely."
2022-11-02,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11382565/Ukraine-push-Russia-pre-invasion-borders-New-Year.html,"Ukraine will push Russia back to pre-invasion borders by New Year while Putin resorts to bombing power plants to spark fresh European refugee crisis, retired US general predicts","Ukraine will push Russia back to its pre-invasion border by the end of the year and retake Crimea next summer, a retired US general has predicted. Ben Hodges, former commander of US forces in Europe, believes Ukraine is capable of re-taking thousands of square miles of territory in the south and east within the next two months before pushing into Crimea - the crown jewel of Putin's 2014 war. General Hodges, speaking in Westminster on Monday at an event hosted by the Council on Geostrategy, admitted his vision is 'optimistic' but confidently predicted that 'Ukraine will win.' In the meantime, he expects Putin to continue shelling Ukrainian power plants and cities with the aim of driving 'hundreds of thousands of refugees' into Europe with the aim of breaking Western support. He said: 'It is too early to plan victory parades, there is still months and months of hard fighting ahead, Russia will continue to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians, but there is no doubt in my mind that Ukraine has achieved irreversible momentum. 'Thousands of years of war has taught us that war is a test of will, and it is a test of logistics... 'It is indisputable that Ukrainian soldiers have superior will over the Russian soldiers... [and] it is clear that after eight or nine months of war Russia's logistical system is on the verge of collapse.' Russia first invaded Ukraine back in 2014, when Putin marched in troops and occupied Crimea following a revolution that toppled the government. Meanwhile Russian-backed groups went into the eastern Donbas region and occupied part of it, kick-starting a simmering conflict that continued until Putin re-invaded the country in February this year. Since February, Russia has seized swathes of additional territory including the cities of Mariupol, Melitopol, Berdyansk and Kherson in the south, and most of the northern part of the Luhansk region. Pushing Putin's forces back to the 2014 borders within the next two months would mean re-taking all of those places, along with thousands of square miles of surrounding terrain. Seizing back Crimea by next summer will require and extremely complex attack across marshland and islands that separate the peninsula from mainland Ukraine, against Russian occupiers who have spent years building defences. Russia also has two major airbases in Crimea, the home port of its Black Sea Fleet, and multiple smaller troop bases. The area - which is of huge propaganda importance to Putin - has often been likened to one giant military base, and the despot is expected to spare no resources to make sure it isn't taken away from him. But until then, General Hodges believes Putin will continue his tactic of shelling Ukrainian cities and power plants - even though he is running low on guided missiles and cannot replace them due to sanctions. He added: '[This] is not just out of spite, it is intended to make Ukrainian cities uninhabitable as winter approaches. 'What this is going to do, potentially, is put hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees back on the road to Europe. If they're not able to find heat, and power, and if we're not able to restore that it will cause problems in the rest of Europe. This is not lost on the Kremlin. 'This will be one of the intended outcomes as well as continuing to destroy Ukraine as a state and even the idea of Ukraine as a state.' To counter Putin's tactics, General Hodges called on Ukraine's Western allies to provide anti-air missiles to shield its cities and power networks. He also called on the US government to provide long-range ATACAMS missiles which can be fired from HIMARS launchers and would put all of Crimea within range. Lastly, he says tracked vehicles - tanks and armoured vehicles with tracks instead of tyres - will be essential to keep Ukraine's armies moving through autumn and winter as the weather turns wetter and the ground softens. Russia is now into its ninth month of fighting in Ukraine and has failed to achieve any of the military objectives set by Putin at the start of the war. That has led to growing dissent both within the Russian population and the elite close to Putin, who are increasingly willing to voice that discontent in public. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner boss dubbed 'Putin's chef', has publicly criticised the way the war is being run - though has stopped short of bashing Putin himself. It remains vanishingly unlikely that Putin will be able to achieve his initial aim of toppling the government - and even the reduced aim of 'liberating' the Donbas region looks beyond his grasp."
2022-11-02,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11382055/North-Korea-covertly-supplying-shells-Russia-support-Ukraine-invasion-White-House-says.html,"North Korea is 'covertly' supplying artillery shells to Russia in support of its Ukraine invasion, White House claims","North Korea is sending a 'significant' amount of artillery ammunition to Russia under cover of shipments to the Middle East or Africa, the Unites States has said. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said US officials were trying to track the shipments, but did not know whether Russia has received the ammunition. 'Our indications are that the DPRK is covertly supplying and we are going to monitor to see whether the shipments are received,' Kirby told a virtual briefing, referring to North Korea by the initials of its official name. He said North Korea is 'trying to make it appear as though they're being sent to countries in the Middle East or North Africa'. He declined to provide a specific estimate on the quantity of ammunition being sent to bolster Vladimir Putin's ailing invasion of Ukraine, but called the amount 'significant'. Kirby insisted that the North Korean shipments are 'not going to change the course of the war,' citing Western efforts to resupply the Ukrainian military. The White House would not specify the mode of transportation or whether the U.S. or other nations would attempt to interdict the shipments to Russia. Russia is one of Pyongyang's few allies, and North Korea has sought to tighten relations with Russia as much of Europe and the West has pulled away, blaming the United States for the Ukraine crisis and decrying the West's 'hegemonic policy' as justifying military action by Russia in Ukraine to protect itself. The North Koreans have shown interest in sending construction workers to help rebuild Russian-occupied territories in the country's east. North Korea's ambassador to Moscow has met with envoys from two Russia-backed separatist territories in the Donbas region of Ukraine and expressed optimism about cooperation in the 'field of labour migration,' citing his country's easing of pandemic border controls. In July, North Korea became the only nation aside from Russia and Syria to recognise the independence of the territories, Donetsk and Luhansk, further aligning with Russia over the conflict in Ukraine. The North's arms export to Russia would be a violation of U.N. resolutions that ban the country from exporting to or importing weapons from other countries. Its possible dispatch of labourers to the Russian-held territories in Ukraine would also breach a U.N. resolution that required all member states to repatriate all North Korean workers from their soil by 2019. The Kremlin has been desperately trying to turn the fortunes of its forces around in the on-going invasion. Russia is into its ninth month of fighting in Ukraine and has failed to achieve any of the military objectives set by Putin at the start of the war. Instead, Putin's soldiers have been pushed back and lost vast amounts of territory in key areas in the east and south by a fierce Ukrainian resistance. In addition to North Korea, Moscow has also been purchasing weapons from Iran. Iranian-supplied kamikaze drones in particular have been used to strike civilian infrastructure across Ukraine - to devastating effect. Iran has denied that it is supplying weapons to Russia, but there is a growing body of evidence that shows Iran has been supplying the drones, as well as missiles. The White House in August said the Russian military took delivery of hundreds Iranian-manufactured drones for use on the battlefield in Ukraine. The US also says that Iran has sent personnel to Russian-controlled Crimea to provide technical support to the Russians on operation of the drones. Meanwhile, in September, Putin announced military mobilisation with the goal of recruiting 300,000 soldiers, and in October declared martial law in the four illegally annexed Ukrainian territories Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk. There have also been reports of Moscow hiring mercenaries from Syria and Afghanistan to join the Russian war effort. But in a sign that Russia's armies are facing a significant morale problem, reports from Russia on Tuesday identified at least 83 Russian conscripts drafted to fight in Ukraine that had already been killed. A total of 23 were killed in training, reports said. Meanwhile, antidepressant sales in Russia have skyrocketed in recent months. Russians spent 70 per cent more on the pills in the first eight months of this year compared to last, even though they spent much of 2021 in Covid lockdowns, figures have shown, Western officials have said. 'Russians feel frightened' as the 'catastrophic error' of Putin's invasion - including conscription and a tanking economy - begin to hit people's lives, the officials added. That is underlined by the fact that at least 400,000 have fled since Putin announced he would begin drafting people into the army in September, significantly more than the 300,000 he added to his ranks. Despite the military struggles, officials say there is no sign that Putin has decided to change course in Ukraine and no sign that anyone is preparing to replace him. The White House's accusation came as the Polish government announced the construction of a 130-mile razor-wire fence along the border with Russia's exclave of Kaliningrad to prevent illegal crossings. Poland's Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak announced the decision amid concerns in Warsaw that Russia plans to orchestrate an influx of migrants from Africa and the Middle East, to pile further pressure on Ukraine's EU backers. Moscow will 'in the near future' summon the British ambassador to hand over 'evidence' of its claim that the UK helped orchestrate an attack on the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Crimea, the foreign ministry said Wednesday. Russia has claimed UK 'specialists' helped Kyiv launch a drone attack on the fleet in Moscow-annexed Crimea at the weekend. Russia has also accused London of being behind September explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines. Russian authorities have so far provided no proof to back up their claims. 'The UK ambassador will be summoned and will be given the appropriate materials,' foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, adding the meeting would take place 'in the near future.' 'The basic materials will be handed over as evidence to the British side and will also be shown to the general public,' she added. 'The airport in Kaliningrad is now accepting flights from the Middle East and North Africa. I decided to take action to enhance the security of the Polish border,' Blaszczak told reporters. 'Already today work will begin... on a temporary barrier' along the 130-mile border, he added. He said the razor-wire fence will be 8ft high and 10ft wide, and will also feature an electronic monitoring system and cameras. Poland already built a steel wall last year along its border with Russian ally Belarus after a migrant influx there. Tens of thousands of migrants and refugees, mostly from the Middle East, have crossed or attempted to cross into Poland from Belarus since 2021. Poland's border guard and NGOs on site continue to report dozens of attempted illegal crossings there on a daily basis. The West believes the influx was orchestrated by Minsk to destabilise the region, a charge denied by the Belarusian regime. Poland sent thousands of troops and police officers to reinforce border guard patrols at the height of the crisis and approved a law allowing migrants to be forced back into Belarus. The so-called pushbacks, and the government's overall tough anti-migration stance, drew condemnation from activists and aid organisations. In 2021, thousands of migrants flown into Belarus attempted to cross the border with Poland. Lithuania already has a fence along its border with Russia in Vistytis. The existing fence skirts the Suwalki Gap, a stretch of land along the Lithuanian and Polish border between Kaliningrad and Russia-loyal Belarus, which is thought to be an important chokepoint into Europe by Russian strategists. The news comes after four Russian fighter jets were intercepted after taking off from Kaliningrad and forced to return to base after they infringed on Polish air space in early October. Reports came that the jets also infringed on Swedish airspace. Poland is a long-time member of NATO having joined in 1999, while Sweden earlier this year applied for membership to the security bloc alongside Nordic neighbour Finland. Meanwhile, Wednesday saw test-fire missiles off each-other's coasts for the first time, amid rapidly spiralling tensions between the bitter neighbouring nations. Pyongyang launched at least 23 missiles off both its west and east coasts Wednesday including one which flew from the city of Wonsan, across the unofficial maritime border, and landed 37 miles off the South Korean coast - the first time a tested missile has done so. President Yoon Suk-yeol call it 'effectively a territorial invasion.' The North Korean weapon also triggered an air raid siren on the inhabited South Korean island of Ulleungdo after heading towards it, though it ultimately landed 100 miles short. The siren sent people scrambling for bunkers. In response, Seoul ordered fighter jets to fire three air-to-surface missiles back which flew a similar distance across the ocean border before splashing down in the sea. It was also the first test of its kind by South Korea. Kim Jong-un also ordered his artillery units to fire 100 shells into an ocean 'buffer zone' in the Sea of Japan, hours after one of his closest aides threatened the South and the US with nuclear weapons - saying they would 'pay the most horrible price in history' if the North were attacked. North Korea is furious at Seoul and Washington for staging war games near its borders which it considers to be a rehearsal for an invasion. The allies deny the games are a provocation and say they are a response to weapons tests by Kim's regime. The tit-for-tat actions have ramped up tensions around the Korean peninsula. Antidepressant sales in Russia have skyrocketed as the miserable reality of Putin's war in Ukraine finally dawns on the public, Western officials have said. Russians spent 70 per cent more on the pills in the first eight months of this year compared to last, even though they spent much of 2021 in Covid lockdowns, figures have shown. 'Russians feel frightened' as the 'catastrophic error' of Putin's invasion - including conscription and a tanking economy - begin to hit people's lives, the officials added.

'He has been weakened by this really catastrophic error,' said the Western official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'We are seeing the Russian military humbled on the battlefield by Ukraine. People can see that he has made a big error,' said the same official. White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said: 'We reject the notion that [the war games] serve as any sort of provocation. 'We have made clear that we have no hostile intent towards [North Korea] and call on them to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy. '[North Korea] continues to not respond. At the same time, we will continue to work closely with our allies and partners to limit the North's ability to advance its unlawful weapons programs and threaten regional stability.' On Monday the US and South Korea began Vigilant Storm, one of their largest combined military air drills, with hundreds of warplanes from both sides staging mock attacks 24 hours a day. North Korea has test-fired a record number of missiles this year, and has said that a recent flurry of launches were in response to the allied drills. Animosities on the Korean Peninsula have been running high in recent months, with North Korea testing a string of nuclear-capable missiles and adopting a law authorising the pre-emptive use of its nuclear weapons in a broad range of situations. Experts still doubt North Korea could use nuclear weapons first in the face of more superior US and South Korean forces. North Korea has argued its recent weapons tests were meant to issue a warning to Washington and Seoul over their series of joint military drills that it views as an invasion rehearsal, including this week's exercises involving about 240 warplanes. Pak Jong Chon, a secretary of the ruling Workers' Party who is considered a close confidant of leader Kim Jong Un, called the so-called 'Vigilant Storm' air force drills 'aggressive and provocative.' Mr Pak also accused the Pentagon of formulating a North Korean regime collapse as a major policy objective in an apparent reference to the Pentagon's recently released National Defence Strategy report. The report stated any nuclear attack by North Korea against the United States or its allies and partners 'will result in the end of that regime'. He slammed South Korean military leaders over what he called 'rubbish' comments that threatened to destroy North Korea if it uses nuclear weapons. South Korea's military has warned North Korea that using its nuclear weapons would put it on a 'path of self-destruction'. 'If the US and South Korea attempt to use armed forces against (North Korea) without any fear, the special means of the (North's) armed forces will carry out their strategic mission without delay,' Mr Pak said, in an apparent reference to his country's nuclear weapons. 'The US and South Korea will have to face a terrible case and pay the most horrible price in history,' he said. US and South Korean officials have steadfastly said their drills are defensive in nature and that they have no intentions of attacking North Korea. Mr Pak's statement is the North's second warning to the United States and South Korea this week. On Monday, the North's Foreign Ministry warned of 'more powerful follow-up measures' in response to its rivals' air force drills. South Korean officials have said North Korea could up the ante in coming weeks by detonating its first nuclear test device since September 2017, which could possibly take the country a step closer to its goals of building a full-fledged nuclear arsenal capable of threatening regional US allies and the American mainland. Some experts say North Korea would eventually want to use its expanded nuclear arsenal as a leverage in future negotiations with the United States to win sanctions relief and other concessions. Footage shows 100 Russian recruits mutiny and refuse to be sent to Ukraine after learning £4,200 lump sum they were promised has NOT been paid to their families By Will Stewart for MailOnline A mutiny ignited in Ulyanovsk after more than 100 mobilised Russians refused to be sent to the frontline to fight against Ukraine, footage shows. The troops revolted because Vladimir Putin's officials failed to pay a 'promised' payment of £4,200 to their families in the impoverished Chuvashia region, they claimed. A female military officer is earlier seen remonstrating with the uniformed men, amid reports that national guards and OMON riot police were called in to suppress the insubordination. The officer tells them: 'Guys, I didn't promise you 300,000 [roubles].' 'It's clear – we were f***ing fooled,' said one mutineer. Senior Russian military leaders have discussed when and how they would use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, multiple US officials have claimed. The officials talked about scenarios in which they would use nuclear weapons, showing how frustrated the generals are about setbacks on the battlefield in Ukraine. They did not talk about using the weapons with Russian president Vladimir Putin - but the conversations have heightened concern about the prospect of a nuclear Armageddon. US government officials learned about the discussions in mid-October, as Moscow's nuclear rhetoric intensified, reports The New York Times. It comes after Putin joked about the prospect of a nuclear war last week. The Kremlin leader was asked to reassure an audience at the Valdai Discussion Club think-tank that the world is not on the verge of nuclear annihilation – and chose to respond with a long pause. When host Fyodor Lukyanov pointed out his silence was 'alarming', a smirking Putin responded: 'I did that on purpose so you would be on your guard. The effect has been achieved.' The incident reportedly followed an earlier failed attempt to pacify the furious recruits by army officers. us recruits by army officers. The military unit was undergoing training in Ulyanovsk before they are due to be sent to the front. The General Staff of Ukraine has previously said that Russian private military companies were conscripting inmates from prisons in the city to fight in the war. Critics say the call-up is sending men as cannon fodder to the front, but thousands have been lured by promises of payments far higher than their usual salaries. 'I came here from Moscow,' said one enlisted reservist in the mutiny, furious that money did not reach his family. 'Because this is the Motherland, and the President appealed to us all.' He declared: 'When I came to the enlistment office, the military commissar told me 'As soon as you get there, there will be a one time payment of 300,000 roubles [£4,200] within two, three days…'' The money was meant to go to their families in the impoverished Chuvashia region, but it never arrived. Mobilised men are heard demanding: 'Who fooled us?' Others said, 'Its hopeless' adding: 'Why are we even here?' The female military officer tells them that the promise of an advance payment was in a draft law by the Communist Party, and was not ratified. One recruit hits back: 'They should give back their party IDs and go themselves then…' This is when a man is heard saying: 'It's clear we were f***ing fooled.' Another clip shows what appears to be the same soldiers taking to the streets in the night and chanting slogans. 'Dear, citizens of the Russian Federation, mobilised servicemen of the Chuvash Republic appeal to you! 'We are risking our lives to die for your safety and your peaceful life!' An open letter from the men also emerged with a different figure for the sum they had not been paid. 'Our state refuses to pay us the sum of 195,000 [£2,750] roubles which we were promised by our President Vladimir Putin! 'Why then would we go to war for this state, leaving our families without support? 'We refuse to participate in the Special Military Operation and will seek justice until we are paid the money promised by our government headed by the President of the Russian Federation!' Unconfirmed reports say the uprising has been crushed by Putin's forces."

The existing fence skirts the Suwalki Gap, a stretch of land along the Lithuanian and Polish border between Kaliningrad and Russia-loyal Belarus, which is thought to be an important chokepoint into Europe by Russian strategists. The news comes after four Russian fighter jets were intercepted after taking off from Kaliningrad and forced to return to base after they infringed on Polish air space in early October. Reports came that the jets also infringed on Swedish airspace. Poland is a long-time member of NATO having joined in 1999, while Sweden earlier this year applied for membership to the security bloc alongside Nordic neighbour Finland. Footage shows 100 Russian recruits mutiny and refuse to be sent to Ukraine after learning £4,200 lump sum they were promised has NOT been paid to their families By Will Stewart for MailOnline A mutiny ignited in Ulyanovsk after more than 100 mobilised Russians refused to be sent to the frontline to fight against Ukraine, footage shows. The troops revolted because Vladimir Putin’s officials failed to pay a 'promised' payment of £4,200 to their families in the impoverished Chuvashia region, they claimed. A female military officer is earlier seen remonstrating with the uniformed men, amid reports that national guards and OMON riot police were called in to suppress the insubordination. The officer tells them: 'Guys, I didn’t promise you 300,000 [roubles].' 'It’s clear – we were f***ing fooled,' said one mutineer. Senior Russian military leaders have discussed when and how they would use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, multiple US officials have claimed. The officials talked about scenarios in which they would use nuclear weapons, showing how frustrated the generals are about setbacks on the battlefield in Ukraine. They did not talk about using the weapons with Russian president Vladimir Putin - but the conversations have heightened concern about the prospect of a nuclear Armageddon. US government officials learned about the discussions in mid-October, as Moscow's nuclear rhetoric intensified, reports The New York Times. It comes after Putin joked about the prospect of a nuclear war last week. The Kremlin leader was asked to reassure an audience at the Valdai Discussion Club think-tank that the world is not on the verge of nuclear annihilation – and chose to respond with a long pause. When host Fyodor Lukyanov pointed out his silence was 'alarming', a smirking Putin responded: 'I did that on purpose so you would be on your guard. The effect has been achieved.' The incident reportedly followed an earlier failed attempt to pacify the furious recruits by army officers. us recruits by army officers. The military unit was undergoing training in Ulyanovsk before they are due to be sent to the front. The General Staff of Ukraine has previously said that Russian private military companies were conscripting inmates from prisons in the city to fight in the war. Critics say the call-up is sending men as cannon fodder to the front, but thousands have been lured by promises of payments far higher than their usual salaries. 'I came here from Moscow,' said one enlisted reservist in the mutiny, furious that money did not reach his family. 'Because this is the Motherland, and the President appealed to us all.' He declared: 'When I came to the enlistment office, the military commissar told me ""As soon as you get there, there will be a one time payment of 300,000 roubles [£4,200] within two, three days…""' The money was meant to go to their families in the impoverished Chuvashia region, but it never arrived. Mobilised men are heard demanding: 'Who fooled us?' Others said, 'Its hopeless’ adding: ‘Why are we even here?’ The female military officer tells them that the promise of an advance payment was in a draft law by the Communist Party, and was not ratified. One recruit hits back: 'They should give back their party IDs and go themselves then…' This is when a man is heard saying: 'It’s clear we were f***ing fooled.' Another clip shows what appears to be the same soldiers taking to the streets in the night and chanting slogans. 'Dear, citizens of the Russian Federation, mobilised servicemen of the Chuvash Republic appeal to you! 'We are risking our lives to die for your safety and your peaceful life!' An open letter from the men also emerged with a different figure for the sum they had not been paid. 'Our state refuses to pay us the sum of 195,000 [£2,750] roubles which we were promised by our President Vladimir Putin! 'Why then would we go to war for this state, leaving our families without support? 'We refuse to participate in the Special Military Operation and will seek justice until we are paid the money promised by our government headed by the President of the Russian Federation!'

2022-11-02,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11381283/Brittney-Griners-wife-says-struggling-deal-imprisonment.html,'She's 100% not okay': Brittney Griner's wife Cherelle asks supporters to write to the 32-year-old basketball star because she is struggling to stay strong after her appeal against the nine and a half year prison term was denied last week,"Brittney Griner's wife has said she is not doing well in prison and asked members of the public to write to her after her appeal against the nine-year jail term was rejected last week. Her wife Cherelle is devastated by the WNBA star's imprisonment which she is serving in Russia after pleading guilty to drug possession. Brittney, 32, was sentenced earlier this fall for carrying two vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage at Sheremetyevo airport. She had been playing basketball in Russia to supplement her income in the WNBA off-season as players are paid more there. Cherelle, who desperately wants to reunite with her wife, made an emotional speech to the attendees of Glamour's 2022 Women of the Year Ceremony in New York. The attendees included Women of the Year Angela Bassett, Jennifer Hudson, Shannon Watts and the Haim sisters. She said: 'I've spent the last eight months riding waves of grief and to be honest, just total disbelief. 'I can't believe that I'm standing in front of you guys and living without my favourite person, my greatest love, my sanctuary.' Griner is expected to serve out the entirety of her sentence in a penal colony labor camp in Russia, which are known for harsh conditions. The 32-year-old has a huge network of supporters including the American government and human rights organizations working to get her home. Her devoted wife added in her speech at the Glamour Awards that while Brittney is strong, she is '100 percent not okay.' She explained that there is little she can do to ease the pain that her wife is feeling and that she cannot bring her back. But she said she is using the power of words to make a difference, encouraging guests and viewers to write a note to her in support. Those who want to write her a message to her can use the hashtag #WeAreBG or go on weareBG.org. In her own recent message to her wife, she said: 'Babe, I'm missing everything about you. Especially your friendship. I took for granted being able to talk with you. I catch myself picking up my phone, only to sit it back down because your voice is the only voice I want to hear. 'It's giving, I'll likely talk your ear off once you're home. 'I know your heart is heavy right now babe. I wish you were here to feel all the love that surrounds you. You are not forgotten. So, keep your head up champ. This too shall pass! I love you and I cannot wait for the day that I get to embrace you! Love, Relle.' Brittney was in Russia during the WNBA off-season to make some extra money. Other colleagues including Jonquel James and Diana Taurasi have played in the same country as they make better money than in the US. Cherelle's emotional speech comes after she said the Russian court's decision to deny the WNBA star's appeal has left her in 'complete disbelief' and that the nine-year prison sentence feels 'political.' Cherelle appeared on Tuesday's episode of The View just days after her wife's harsh sentence was upheld in a Russian court. She described her wife's sentence as 'absurd' and 'disproportionate' compared to other crimes and punishments in the country. The Phoenix Mercury star and a two-time Olympic gold medalist was convicted in August on drug possession charges after police said they found vape canisters containing cannabis oil in her luggage at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. Griner is expected to serve out the entirety of her sentence in a penal colony labor camp in Russia, which are known for harsh conditions. 'To see that the totality of the circumstances of who she is as a person was not taken into account when they rendered a decision, it makes me feel like this – at this point – has to be political,' Cherelle told the co-hosts Tuesday. 'It's not her footprint. Her footprint is amazing for Russia. She's paying taxes there,' she continued. 'She's great for Russia.' Griner was not at the Moscow Regional Court hearing but appeared via video link from a penal colony outside the capital where she is held. The nine-year sentence was close to the maximum of 10 years, and Griner's lawyers argued after the conviction that the punishment was excessive. They said in similar cases defendants have received an average sentence of about five years, with about a third of them granted parole. 'I understand being in the field of law that every state, every country has their own rules, but this is just absurd,' Cherelle said. 'The crime and the punishment is disproportionate at its finest ... There are people convicted of murder in Russia who [have] a sentence way less than B.G., and it just makes absolutely no sense to me.' 'That was the complete end of it. There's nothing more to expect from a legal standpoint and all eggs are in basket, you know, for our government and for America to see how important this issue is,' she continued. 'This could happen to anybody and we should be praying that we have a country that recognizes the importance of that and are willing to actually go get our Americans and bring them back home.' Cherelle said she has only spoken to her wife a few times since her imprisonment in February and said that Griner's mental health is suffering. 'It has been really hard trying to adjust how to live every day,' she told the hosts. 'There's nothing more to expect from a legal standpoint,' she said. But added that viewers can support Griner by joining the letter-writing campaign. She said she will hold onto hope that her wife's 'personality can do her a little bit of favor in keeping her safe' inside the Russian labor camp. 'If you met BG, it's impossible not to love her,' she said. At her trial in August, Griner admitted to having the canisters in her luggage but testified she packed them inadvertently in her haste to make her flight and had no criminal intent. Her defense team presented written statements saying she had been prescribed cannabis to treat chronic pain. While upholding the sentence, the court said last week Griner's prison time will be recalculated to reflect what she has already served in pre-trial detention. One day in pre-trial detention will be counted as 1 1/2 days in prison, so she still will have to serve about eight years in prison. Griner's lawyers Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov said in an email that they were 'very disappointed' with the decision because they still believe 'the punishment is excessive and contradicts to the existing court practice.' 'Brittney's biggest fear is that she is not exchanged and will have to serve the whole sentence in Russia,' they said. 'She had hopes for today, as each month, each day away from her family and friends matters to her.' They said they had to discuss with Griner what legal steps they should take next. Griner's arrest in February came at a time of heightened tensions between Moscow and Washington, just days before Russia sent troops into Ukraine. At the time, Griner was returning to play for a Russian team during the WNBA´s offseason. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the decision 'another failure of justice, compounding the injustice of her detention,' adding that 'securing her release is our priority.' President Joe Biden told reporters that his administration is in 'constant contact' with Russian authorities on Griner and other Americans who are detained there. While there has not been progress on bringing her back to the U.S., Biden said, 'We´re not stopping.' Before her conviction, the U.S. State Department declared Griner to be 'wrongfully detained' - a charge that Russia has sharply rejected. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement that Biden 'is willing to go to extraordinary lengths and make tough decisions to bring Americans home.' WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said the decision 'while unfortunate, was not unexpected. ... It is time to bring this case to an end and bring BG home.' The WNBA Players Association said the ruling was 'further verification that BG is not just wrongfully detained -- she is very clearly a hostage.' Because of the growing pressure on the Biden administration to do more to bring Griner home, Blinken took the unusual step of revealing in July that Washington had made a 'substantial proposal' to get Griner home, along with Paul Whelan, an American serving a 16-year sentence in Russia for espionage. WNBA star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner is seen on October 25 during her hearing to appeal her conviction on drug charges Blinken didn't elaborate, but The Associated Press and other news organizations have reported that Washington has offered to exchange Griner and Whelan for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer who is serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S. and once earned the nickname the 'merchant of death.' The White House said it has not yet received a productive response from Russia to the offer. Russian diplomats have refused to comment on the U.S. proposal and urged Washington to discuss the matter in confidential talks, avoiding public statements. But some Russian officials have said a deal is more likely once appeals have been exhausted. In September, Biden met with Cherelle Griner, the player's wife, as well as her agent, Lindsay Colas. Biden also sat down separately with Elizabeth Whelan, Paul Whelan´s sister. The White House said after the meetings that the president stressed to the families his 'continued commitment to working through all available avenues to bring Brittney and Paul home safely.' The U.S. and Russia carried out a prisoner swap in April. Moscow released U.S. Marines veteran Trevor Reed in exchange for the U.S. releasing a Russian pilot, Konstantin Yaroshenko, who was convicted in a drug trafficking conspiracy."

When host Fyodor Lukyanov pointed out his silence was 'alarming', a smirking Putin responded: 'I did that on purpose so you would be on your guard. The effect has been achieved.' John F. Kirby, a National Security Council official, told the New York Times: 'We've been clear from the outset that Russia's comments about the potential use of nuclear weapons are deeply concerning, and we take them seriously. 'We continue to monitor this as best we can, and we see no indications that Russia is making preparations for such use.' Russia's nuclear stockpile, the largest in the world, consists of 'tactical', lower-yield bombs and strategic weapons that can annihilate cities and population centres. Its tactical nukes, with a yield of between ten and 100 kilotons, are designed for use on the battlefield in contested territory. In comparison, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 was approximately 18 kilotons. Last week, Putin spoke at length about nuclear weapons, having threatened the West several times with an atomic strike – sparking fears he may also use one in Ukraine. The despot denied he has any plans to use one on his neighbour, saying there is 'no political or military justification' for doing so. But he also referred back to Russia's nuclear doctrine which allows them to be used in the event the country is threatened which – at least according to the Kremlin – now includes occupied parts of Ukraine. Fears of escalation have been building as the war in Ukraine grinds into its ninth month, with Kyiv on the front foot and Putin nowhere near achieving his aims. Though the official purpose of the invasion remains the 'liberation' of the eastern Donbas region, according to Putin, in reality his troops have stopped advancing almost everywhere besides the town of Bakhmut, in Donetsk. Meanwhile they are being pushed back in the northern Kharkiv region and southern region of Kherson – the latter of which Putin has declared to be part of Russia. That has sparked fears he could resort to nukes, after he said he would use 'all available means' to defend the territory. It comes after Moscow alleged that Ukraine is preparing to detonate a so-called 'dirty bomb' on its territory, meaning a conventional explosive laced with radioactive material to cause contamination. Kyiv said accusations it would use such tactics on its own territory are absurd, but that Russia might be planning such actions itself to blame Ukraine. The UN's atomic watchdog has been dispatched to two areas of Ukraine where Putin alleges the bomb is being prepared – at Kyiv's insistence – as President Volodymyr Zelensky and his allies dismiss the claims as fiction. Instead, they said Russia may be preparing the ground to use one of its own nukes as a pretext for escalating the conflict. US President Joe Biden, asked about Putin's assertion he would never use nukes in Ukraine, responded last week: 'Why does he keep talking about it? 'Why is he talking about the ability to use a tactical nuclear weapon? He's been very dangerous in how he's approached this and he should just get out. 'He can end this all, get out of Ukraine.'"
2022-11-02,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11380139/Bidens-gaffe-filled-speech-Calls-Debbie-Wasserman-Schultz-senator-says-son-Beau-died-Iraq.html,"Biden's gaffe-filled speech: President refers to congresswoman as 'senator', claims son Beau died in Iraq and makes bizarre claim he met the ‘inventor’ of insulin – a naturally occurring hormone discovered in 1921","Joe Biden on Tuesday night delivered a remarkably gaffe-filled speech in Florida: mixing up representative and senator, claiming the United States has among the lowest inflation in the world and saying his son Beau died in Iraq. The president was campaigning in three different locations across the state and intended to trumpet his triumphs. Instead, he baffled listeners with a bizarre series of claims. Speaking alongside Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who is hoping to get re-elected in Florida's 23rd district, in greater Miami, Biden mistakenly referred to her as a senator. 'I don't have a greater friend in the United States Senate,' he said. 'And I didn't have a greater friend as vice president, nor as president. 'So Debbie, thank you, kiddo.' In Hallandale Beach, a Miami suburb 20 miles north of downtown, he claimed that the United States has low inflation - and managed to say once again that his son Beau died in Iraq. Beau Biden, who served as Delaware's attorney general and in the Delaware Army National Guard in the Iraq War, died at age 46 in 2015 from brain cancer. He passed away at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The president has long linked his service, and the military's use of burn pits, to Beau's brain cancer diagnosis. 'In my view, I can't prove it yet, he came back with stage 4 glioblastoma. Eighteen months he lived, knowing he was going to die,' Biden said in 2019. Biden previously said that Beau died in Iraq while speaking at Camp Hale in Colorado last month. 'Inflation is a worldwide problem right now because of a war in Iraq and the impact on oil, and what Russia is doing — I mean, excuse me, the war in Ukraine,' said Biden on Tuesday. 'And — I'm thinking of Iraq because that's where my son died. The — because he died. 'But the point is that there — you know, that's why it's up. 'We have the lowest inflation rate of almost any major country in the world. We've done a lot to try to take it under control.' Inflation in the U.S. as measured by the Consumer Price Index is currently at 8.2 percent, for September's data. Among G7 countries, only Italy and the United Kingdom have worse inflation according to the OECD's latest data, from August. The U.S. is at 8.26 percent, with Italy at 8.37 and the U.K. at 8.6 percent. Japan, France, Canada, and Germany are all out-performing the U.S. - in Canada, inflation was 7.1 percent, while in France it was 5.91, and in Japan a mere 3 percent. He added, in a particularly convoluted segment: 'And I'll end this — talk about inflation. 'If you want to raise the cost of living on seniors, go ahead and give free rein to drug companies. Look at what these drug companies have done. 'Republicans in Congress are cheering them on. 'Go ahead and reduce Social Security and Medicare, watch what happens to the cost of living for hardworking Floridians. That's what I call inflation. 'At the end of the month, what you have left, if you have no money, that's inflation. What's — what are you — the things you need, are they going up? They are. They are.' Biden was also mocked online for his claim about insulin, and its pioneers. One of his signature achievements has been to reduce the cost of insulin for diabetics. 'Okay, you know how much it cost to make that insulin drug for diabetes?' Biden asked the crowd. 'It was invented by a man who did not patent it because he wanted it available for everyone. 'I spoke to him, okay? And guess what? It cost 10 bucks to make. Ten bucks to make. 'And if you count packaging and everything, you can maybe get it up to $15. 'Well, guess what? They're not going to have to pay more than $35 a month. They'll still make a significant profit instead of an average of $400 a month.' Canadian doctors Frederick Banting and Charles Best successfully isolated the hormone insulin in July 1921. Banting died in 1941 - the year before Biden was born. Best died in 1978, five years after Biden was elected to the Senate - making a meeting not impossible, but not confirmed. Biden was in Florida to take on the Republicans with just one week to go before the midterm elections. In his speech at a senior center, Biden blasted the GOP for wanting to cut social programs – it's a topic of interest in a state with a large population of retirees. 'I've come to Florida today to talk about two very, very, very important programs,' he said. 'it's gonna affect as many Americans as anything else.' He described Social Security and Medicare as 'under siege by our Republican friends.' Biden finished his speech by saying he hoped that God 'gives some of our Republican friends some enlightenment.' He argued people should have 'peace of mind' when they retire. And he noted how Medicare can now negotiate prescription drug prices. 'Here in Florida, 21% of the people are over the age of 65. It's the second highest of any state in the country,' he noted. He also pointed out under his administration that for, the 'first time can you see again an increase in their Social Security and Medicare' – an announcement met with great applause. 'So checks are going to be up. Medicare premiums are going to be down and look it's a big deal for seniors,' he said. 'Let me say something. I want to point something out. They talk about big spending Democrats. Yeah, I spent a lot of money to do these things, but guess why,' he said. 'We cut the deficit in half,' he said, lowering his voice to a whisper to make his point. The president appeared visibly frustrated with the argument Republicans are making against his stewardship of the economy. Voters have said the economy and inflation are their top concerns - and they give Biden low marks on his handling of both issues. 'Give me a break. I'm so sick and I shouldn't get,' Biden let his voice trail off as he paced on stage. But the crowd cheered and encouraged him on. 'As my granddaughter's used to say, Google, I'm serious,' the president told the crowd. Biden has been hitting Republicans repeatedly for wanting to change the two large government social programs. The president repeatedly has made Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott's policy proposals a boogeyman in the election, calling out the senator by name in his criticism of the GOP. He did so again in Florida on Tuesday. He held up a pamphlet and read aloud Scott's plan that would put Medicare, Social Security and other government programs up for a vote every five years. 'A senator from Florida going after Social Security and Medicaid?,' he said. 'You might even you might not even believe it. Again, word for word. All federal legislation, sunsets means goes away in five years.' 'These programs do something so basic and so important,' Biden said of them. Biden started his remarks by talking about all the assistance his administration has offered the state as it recovers from Hurricane Ian. He said the federal government approved $1.7 billion in federal grants, which led to whoops, applause and cheers from the audience. Biden will be campaigning for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist and Senate hopeful Val Demings in the Sunshine State even as he avoids some of the bigger battleground contests like Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. Ahead of his trip, Biden boarded Air Force One with a copy of Jon Meacham's new book 'And There Was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle'. The biography looks into how Lincoln prioritized his policies and ending slavery over his own future before the 1864 election and during the Civil War. Lincoln's Republican party also performed poorly during the 1862 midterm elections, with the Democrats gaining several seats and ending their majority. Polls suggest Biden could be facing a similar fate with the 2022 midterms with polls suggesting Republicans will decisively take control of the House and have a path to winning a majority in the Senate. 'Lincoln was a politician, but he was a politician who ultimately was driven by conscience,' Meacham told NPR. 'This is my entire argument in the book. If he had solely been a cynical political creature, he would have made radically different decisions at critical points.' Crist is trailing Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking a second term. And Deming is down in the polls against GOP Senator Marco Rubio in a contest that will help decide which party controls the Senate next year. The president, who is battling low approval ratings, is spending his last week on the campaign trail trying to contrast how his Democrats will govern versus Republicans as voters prepare to head to the polls on Nov. 8. He will make his closing argument at stops in New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Maryland over the next seven days."
2022-11-02,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11379879/Putin-ally-praises-Ukrainian-President-Volodymr-Zelensky-strong-confident-leader.html,Putin ally who founded Wagner mercenary group praises Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky as a 'strong and confident leader' who must not be 'underestimated' - in defiance of the Kremlin,"A close ally of Vladimir Putin has praised Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky as a 'strong and confident leader' who must not be 'underestimated'. Yevgeny Prigozhin, dubbed Putin's chef' and the founder of the notorious Wagner mercenary group, also said Zelensky was 'a nice man' - in defiance of the standard Kremlin line. In a statement shared on social media by his catering firm, Mr Prigozhin said: 'Although he is the president of a country hostile to Russia at the moment, Zelensky is a strong, confident, pragmatic and nice guy.' And asked why he was heaping praise on a man that Moscow has largely criticised, belittled and attacked since he came to power in 2019, he added: 'To become stronger, to win, you need to treat the opponent with respect. 'Don’t underestimate him. Always look for flaws in yourself, and see what’s good and important that can be learned from the experience of the enemy.' His remarks are a stark contrast to the characterisation of Zelensky peddled by the Kremlin. When he launched the invasion in February, Putin called on Ukrainian soldiers to oust Zelensky from office, saying it would be easier to deal with generals than the 'gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis' currently in power. Russian state media outlets and social media pages linked to the Kremlin have also pushed baseless claims that Zelensky is a drug addict. In one interview, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: 'He says many things. It depends on what he drinks or what he smokes.' His comments underline a rising public profile and growing confidence in speaking out on sensitive issues around the war in Ukraine in defiance of the Kremlin. It comes as he has made a series of outspoken interventions in recent weeks, joining with Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov in ridiculing the performance of Russia’s generals in Ukraine. Russian political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said it was interesting that Prigozhin was voicing a view far removed from Putin’s - an opinion that others in the ruling elite might not dare to express. She added: 'Prigozhin dared. He thinks he has a right and he thinks it wouldn’t anger Putin.' Stanovaya said Prigozhin was not angling for a formal power role, saying: 'I think that for him it’s more like a ""business project"" that he needs to ""sell"" to Putin to be closer tied to the Kremlin. 'He would avoid any real official responsibility, it’s more comfortable to remain in the in-between space, between the state and non-official status.' The remarks come after Mr Prigozhin last month confirmed for the first time that he founded the notorious Wagner Group. Prigozhin, whose other business provides catering services to the Kremlin, said he founded the mercenary unit during Russia's first Ukraine invasion in 2014. The group has since gained a reputation for doing the Russian military's dirty work, leaving a trail of brutal violence, rapes and war crimes in its wake. It is known to have operated on battlefields from Europe to the Middle East, South America and Africa. 'I cleaned the old weapons myself, sorted out the bulletproof vests myself and found specialists who could help me with this,' Prigozhin said in a statement. 'From that moment, on May 1, 2014, a group of patriots was born, which later came to be called the Wagner Battalion. I am proud that I was able to defend their right to protect the interests of their country.' Wagner largely recruits from the regular Russian military, often taking on those who have been thrown out of its ranks. However, after suffering high casualties fighting in Ukraine, Prigozhin has begun recruiting from prisons in Russia."

Government documents marked 'official sensitive' warn that food and water supplies, transport and communications could all be severely disrupted for up to seven days in a 'reasonable worst-case scenario' in the event of a national power outage. Whitehall officials are stress-testing Programme Yarrow - the secret plan to cope with blackouts which includes prioritising getting food, water and shelter to the young and elderly, as well as those with caring responsibilities - amid an energy crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine. The cross-government plan was first drawn up last year - before Vladimir Putin launched his barbaric invasion of Russia's European neighbour - in a bid to improve planning and resilience in the event of a major fault on the National Grid, The Guardian reported. It is understood that the type of technical fault envisaged under the plans includes an attack by a hostile foreign power on underwater power cables - following attacks against the Nord Stream energy pipelines in the Baltic Sea widely blamed on Moscow - as well as flood damage and thunderstorms. It comes as the Met Office warns of an increased chance of a colder-than-usual winter this year which could put further pressure on gas and electricity supplies. Programme Yarrow prepares for a situation more severe than that outlined by National Grid last month, which warned of three-hour rolling blackouts. The plans envisage that 60 per cent of electricity demand will be met 'between day 2 and day 7' when households and businesses will be given 'intermittent access' to ration supply. Households and businesses will be given 24 hours' notice of a planned outage, and the plan could be published up to a week ahead on a rolling basis. National Grid has warned that there could be blackouts this winter if gas power plants are not able to keep running due to the energy crisis. The electricity systems operator said it is still unlikely but winter could see the first planned blackouts, which the grid calls rota load shedding, since the 1970s. But why might blackouts happen this year - who will be impacted and what can be done to avoid them? Why would a grid ever plan blackouts? Engineers working on the energy grid need to make sure it is ""balanced"" at all times. This means that the amount of electricity being put into the grid by power plants, wind farms and others should match the amount being taken out by households and businesses at any given time. The grid plans for when it thinks demand can be high so it can ask generators to meet that demand. But if there is ever an imbalance where demand is higher than supply or supply is higher than demand, it can cause major breakdowns in the grid. That could cause actual physical damage to the grid that could take days to repair. If the engineers know there will not be enough supply to match demand, sometimes they need to reduce demand by planned outages to avoid major damage. Why might blackouts be necessary this winter? Britain has one of the most reliable power networks in the world and unless cables are cut by storms or other accidents outages are rare. But this winter, gas generators might not be able to get enough gas to keep running. The grid said that if this happens, it still thinks that is ""unlikely"", then it might have to cut power to some households and businesses. Who will be impacted by blackouts and who gets cut off first? If the grid realises that it has to cut off some parts of the country, it will issue a warning to the local and regional distributors saying how much demand needs to be cut. It will be up to these so-called distribution network operators to decide who gets cut off and who does not. But the DNOs have limited controls so most of the time it will be whole areas that are impacted. How can we avoid blackouts? If the blackouts are caused by a lack of supply, then the only way is to reduce demand at particular times. Most demand happens during peak hours of between around 4pm and 7pm when people get home from work, put the kettle on, switch on their ovens and sit down to watch TV. The overall amount of electricity that people use does not have to reduce if they just change their usage to other times of the day. For instance, electric cars could be unplugged during these hours, switching the dishwasher could wait until 9pm and you could put the washing machine on earlier in the day or during the weekend. The grid and energy suppliers will launch a new system in November to pay people if they change the time that they use energy. The Government could also step in to ration peoples' energy use or advise them to use less, similar to a hosepipe ban, but so far it has ruled this out. The 'rota disconnection plan' is designed to cut power evenly across the country, according to documents seen by The Guardian. The power cuts should initially only take place once a day for three hours, although it could take up to an hour to reconnect after that - though the frequency of cuts will depend on the severity of the crisis. And under Programme Yarrow's worst-case scenario, only analogue FM radios would work, with just BBC Radio 2 and 4 broadcasting. One Whitehall source told the paper: 'We need to think about how we can help people in advance. The fact they're talking about it now means they have a real concern it could happen.' A Government spokesperson said: 'As a responsible government, it is right that we plan for all potential scenarios and work with industry to prepare and exercise robust contingency plans. This work is ongoing continuously and is an important strand of our national resilience planning. 'Local and national exercises are a part of this ongoing work and ensure we are able to effectively respond to any of a wide range of scenarios, no matter how unlikely they may be.' Last month the National Grid had warned that Britain faces blackouts this winter if Russia shuts off gas supplies to Europe and a cold winter hits. In what it called an 'unlikely' scenario, the National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) said that households and businesses might face planned three-hour outages to ensure that the grid does not collapse. Planned blackouts hit the UK during the 1970s in response to the miners strikes and the oil crisis. There have also been major unplanned outages in storms, including in 1987 when over 1.5 million people were left in the dark. But the lights will stay on this winter unless the gas-fired power plants that produced 43 per cent of Britain's electricity over the last year cannot get enough gas to continue operating. It is the most dire of three possible scenarios that the ESO laid out on Thursday for how Britain's electricity grid might cope with the worst global energy crisis for decades. In the other two scenarios, the operator hopes that by paying people to charge their electric cars at off-peak times and firing up backup coal plants it can offset the risk of blackouts. The margins between peak demand and power supply are expected to be sufficient and similar to recent years in the ESO's base case scenario for this winter. But in the face of the 'challenging' winter facing European energy supplies following Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the grid operator is also planning for what would happen if there were no imports of electricity from Europe and insufficient gas supplies. To tackle a loss of imports from France, Belgium and the Netherlands, there are two gigawatts of coal-fired power plants on stand-by to fire up if needed to meet demand. The National Grid Gas Transmission separately said that while gas demand will increase this winter, it expects Britain to be able to get enough gas to take it through a Beast from the East scenario or a long, cold winter. People are being encouraged to sign up with their electricity supplier to a scheme which will give them money back on their bills to shift their use of power away from times of high demand to help prevent blackouts. It comes as Britons are being told to brace for blackouts this winter if energy supplies run low - while weather experts warn of the potential for a colder-than-usual winter. UK energy bosses warn short rolling power cuts are a possibility this winter, as Putin's tactical tightening of gas pipelines in Europe starts to bite. The warning comes from John Pettigrew, the boss of the National Grid, who also believes British households will find the upcoming winter 'financially very, very hard'. In one sign of hope, Mr Pettigrew attempted to calm fears the UK could run out of gas and electricity this winter. He said it was the National Grid's 'base case' assumption was that the UK would have enough energy supplies to meet heating and lighting demand this winter. But he added that short rolling power cuts were a possibility. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'There could be energy shortfalls in the UK and we will manage that very carefully.' However he said it was 'not time for people to panic', adding: 'What we're doing is making sure that the infrastructure that we have and the networks are robust and ready for the winter, and I've got thousands of engineers making sure that the network is ready for whatever weather we see over the winter.' Mr Pettigrew said the National Grid was working on a number of emergency plans to protect the UK against an energy shortfall from Europe. Gas supplies had already been disrupted post-Covid lockdowns, as countries battled to resupply for the big restart, leading to a huge increase demand and subsequently prices. And this has been compounded by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with gas supplies from Russia being limited to Europe. Although the UK gets much of its gas from other countries, and gets nearly 40 per cent of its energy from gas, it is still impacted by the disruption to the European energy price market. Mr Pettigrew told the BBC that one emergency option to help power Britain this winter if fuel supplies drop is to restart mothballed coal-fired power stations. The UK is already looking at delaying the closure of part of a coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire due to fears about energy. Mr Pettigrew added: 'The next step would be to pay households and businesses to reduce consumption during peak times, with short rolling regional outages a last resort. 'If we saw that shortfall coming, the most effective way to manage the rest of the network is to ask the distribution companies to reduce demand and they would do that over that rolling period of around 4 to 7pm.' It comes as the Met Office has published its latest three-month forecast - which covers this month, December and January. The Met Office warns that the chance of a colder three month period overall is 'slightly greater than normal' - by around 1.3 times. It means there is a 60 per cent chance of a normal winter, a 25 per cent chance of a cold winter and a 15 per cent chance of a mild winter. The Met Office also warns of a higher possibility of a slightly calmer winter in terms of wind - also by around 1.3 times. A less gusty winter could impact on the ability to fill energy shortfalls with extra wind power capacity. The Met Office's three-month forecast is used for emergency planning. It does not look at day-to-day weather or spells, but at the weather overall for a three-month period. According to the Met Office, its prediction of a higher possibility of a slightly colder winter comes from its tracking of global weather patterns, including El Nina. It says the weather phenomenon this year could bring colder spells, particularly when combined with other long term patterns over the Indian Ocean."
2022-11-01,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11376597/BP-says-profits-DOUBLED-7-1-BILLION-past-three-months.html,BP boasts its profits have more than DOUBLED to £7.1 BILLION over past three months compared to 2021 as global energy supplies face huge strain amid the war in Ukraine... as calls for windfall taxes grow,"BP has today announced a staggering £7.1billion profits in the last three months - as struggling Britons face mounting petrol and energy bills. The British-based oil giant says its profits have more than doubled for July to September compared to 2021, when it made £2.9billion. The huge figure, which comes amid soaring natural gas prices following Covid lockdowns and then Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is also significantly ahead of the £5.3billion expected by market analysts. It comes amid growing calls for stiffer windfall taxes for energy producers, in the face of families bracing for huge gas and electricity bills this winter. Today the energy firm, which is a producer of fuel and natural gas, confirmed it will be hit by the windfall tax on its UK operations this year - unlike rival Shell. BP said it expected to pay out £2.2billion in taxes for its UK North Sea business this year - including £695million relating to the Government's new energy profits levy. The company also said profits were weaker than the previous quarter - after a dip in the average oil price. However this is unlikely garner much sympathy with Britons, who face soaring gas costs and petrol prices still 20p per litre higher than they were at this time last year. Meanwhile, Labour, has today hit out at the figures, saying they provided 'damning evidence of the failure of the Government to levy a proper windfall tax'. Chief executive Bernard Looney said: 'This quarter's results reflect us continuing to perform while transforming. 'We remain focused on helping to solve the energy trilemma - secure, affordable and lower carbon energy. 'We are providing the oil and gas the world needs today - while at the same time investing to accelerate the energy transition. 'Our agreement on Archaea Energy is the most recent step in our strategic transformation of BP.' Struggling Britons are to face more pain at the pumps as the price of diesel continues to skyrocket, sparking fresh fears it could hit an all-time high before Christmas. The average cost of a litre of the fuel at UK forecourts on Monday was an eye-watering 190.12p, according to the RAC Fuel Watch, with one Tesco in Cambridge selling diesel for a whopping 197.9p. It's the first time diesel has topped £1.90 since it hit a crippling record high back in July of 199.05p, leading to warnings by the RAC of an imminent 'national fuel crisis'. The soaring prices come as hard-pressed families continue to battle the cost-of-living crisis, which has seen inflation balloon to a bank-busting 10.1 per cent as food prices continue to spiral due to the war in Ukraine. The latest spike in fuel means fed-up motorists will need to splurge out £104.57 to fill the average 55-litre diesel tank - £23.46 more than this time last year, when the average cost was 147.48p per litre, or £81.11 to fill a tank. RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: 'RAC Fuel Watch data shows the gap between the average price of petrol and diesel now stands at a record 24p a litre. As of Thursday, drivers were paying an average of 166p for unleaded while diesel has climbed to above 190p. BP confirmed today it would give its shareholders a boost by increasing its dividend payment by 10 per cent, and will also spend $2.5billion buying back shares. The energy giant also confirmed it will pay UK windfall taxes this year. The Government launched the energy profits levy windfall tax in May for North Sea oil and gas producers. However, Shell confirmed last week that it does not expect to pay out for the tax this year as firms are able to offset potential tax payments through investment. Today, BP told shareholders it will pay out 2.5billion dollars (£2.2billion) in taxes for its UK North Sea business in 2022, including 800 million dollars (£695 million) of tax related to the energy profits levy. Rival Shell said its adjusted earnings more than doubled to 9.5 billion dollars (£8.2 billion) over its latest quarter as gas prices remained high. Meanwhile, BP said its profits were weaker than the previous quarter, due to falling oil prices. In June, the cost of a barrel of Brent crude oil hovered at around 114 dollars per barrel, but since early July the measure has rarely risen above the 100-dollar line. On Tuesday, a barrel of crude would set a buyer back around 94 dollars (£81). Energy prices are, however, still at elevated levels following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and therefore set to weigh heavily on household budgets over winter. Meanwhile, BP's profit reveal follows big profit announcements from other large oil firms such as Total and Exxon Mobil. Meanwhile, oil giant Saudi Aramco said it had made a profit of $42.4bn over just three months due to higher prices. Following today's profit announcement, environmental group Friends of the Earth called on the Government to widen the windfall tax in response to BP's latest profit haul. Energy campaigner Sana Yusuf said: 'With the economy sinking, energy bills soaring and the climate crisis deepening, Rishi Sunak must surely act on the excessive profits that fossil fuel firms like BP are raking in. 'The case for a bigger, bolder windfall tax is now overwhelming. 'This must address the ridiculous loophole that undermines the levy by enabling companies to pay the bare minimum if they invest in more planet-warming gas and oil projects.' Dr George Dibb, head of the Centre for Economic Justice at the IPPR think tank, said: 'Companies like BP are making huge profits and channelling these straight back to already-wealthy shareholders through share buyback schemes. 'Instead of reducing costs for consumers or investing in renewable energy, these fossil fuel giants are prioritising transfers to shareholders.' Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband said: 'Today's profits at BP are damning evidence of the failure of the Government to levy a proper windfall tax. 'Rishi Sunak should be hanging his head in shame that he has left billions of windfall profits in the pockets of oil and gas companies, while the British people face a cost-of-living crisis.' Meanwhile, Tessa Khan, director of Uplift, added: 'BP’s soaring profits are not because of anything it has done, but because of the surge in gas prices caused by the Ukraine war. 'BP must be laughing all the way to the bank. While oil and gas giants like BP are making these obscene profits, seven million UK households face fuel poverty this winter. 'The government must stop sitting on its hands and claw some of this money back to help families keep the heat on. 'What’s needed is a windfall tax that is fit for purpose, with a higher tax rate, over a longer period.' It comes as already struggling Britons are to face more pain at the pumps as the price of diesel continues to skyrocket, sparking fresh fears it could hit an all-time high before Christmas. The average cost of a litre of the fuel at UK forecourts on Monday was an eye-watering 190.12p, according to the RAC Fuel Watch, with one Tesco in Cambridge selling diesel for a whopping 197.9p. It's the first time diesel has topped £1.90 since it hit a crippling record high back in July of 199.05p, leading to warnings by the RAC of an imminent 'national fuel crisis'. The soaring prices come as hard-pressed families continue to battle the cost-of-living crisis, which has seen inflation balloon to a bank-busting 10.1 per cent as food prices continue to spiral due to the war in Ukraine. The latest spike in fuel means fed-up motorists will need to splurge out £104.57 to fill the average 55-litre diesel tank - £23.46 more than this time last year, when the average cost was 147.48p per litre, or £81.11 to fill a tank. RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: 'RAC Fuel Watch data shows the gap between the average price of petrol and diesel now stands at a record 24p a litre. As of Thursday, drivers were paying an average of 166p for unleaded while diesel has climbed to above 190p. 'Following the announcement from oil producer group OPEC+ early this month that it was cutting production by two million barrels a day, the wholesale price of refined fuel has increased as a result of oil trading well above $90 having previously been below that mark at the end of last month. 'Since OPEC and its allies agreed to reduce oil supply substantially we’ve seen the price of the average price of diesel going up by almost 10p a litre and petrol by nearly 3p. 'Sadly, for diesel drivers, the situation could yet get worse with prices now back above 190p a litre for the first time since the beginning of August. Hopefully the average price record of 199p for a litre of diesel set in late June won’t be surpassed. 'The price hikes have added £5 to a tank of diesel and nearly £2 to a full petrol fill-up. Due to the war in Ukraine and the UK moving away from Russian diesel, the cost of buying in wholesale diesel from other countries has gone up considerably.' Fuel prices have been driven up over the last few months by the war in Ukraine and moves to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian oil. But diesel has seen far steeper hike in prices than unleaded, with the average cost per litre of petrol remaining at 166.17p. Financial expert Robert Alster, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said diesel was soaring ahead of petrol as it was used not just for transport but to power generators, too. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 this morning, Mr Alster warned the combination of the war in Ukraine and soaring living costs would continue to drive up inflation and punish family finances. 'It’s adding all to a general inflationary higher level than we have seen before,' he said. 'Obviously, it’s been caused by the conflict of Russia and Ukraine. But even allowing for that, it’s shortages driven by Covid, supply chain issues, geopolitical issues between the US and China.' The 'workaholic' BP boss who took home £4.5MILLION last year as firm's profits hit £6.9BN: How 'woke' Bernard Looney, 51, grew up on dairy farm, divorced his life coach wife after two years - and once described energy giant as a 'cash machine' By Charlotte McLaughlin for MailOnline The boss of BP is said to be a 'woke' workaholic who last year took home £4.5million in pay. Bernard Looney, who rose through the ranks after joining as a drill engineer in 1991 to become CEO in 2020, could now be in line for an £11.7m pay packet - just as households across the country struggle amid a cost-of-living crisis. Irishman Looney, 51, who once called BP a 'cash machine' is often referred to as a 'company man', and boasts about his 'green credentials', commitment to diversity and humble beginnings on a dairy farm in Kerry. Looney also lists his pronouns as he/him on his social media profile - and is often pictured wearing jeans in online posts. He divorced his wife of two years shortly before he became chief executive. Life coach Jacqueline Hurst has reportedly spoken about their marriage, claiming he used her to get a 'promotion' - and even dumped her via WhatsApp. Mr Looney, who is now based at BP's London headquarters, grew up on a farm in Ashgrove near Kenmare as one of five children. He has explained how tough it was before he became the first of his family to go to University, the Irish Independent reported. He said: 'Only about eight acres out of the 90 we had were actually arable. We had 14 cows and it was pretty much subsistence farming'. Mr Looney would also help out on the farm as 'the gopher, bringing them whichever tool they needed' while his mother encouraged him to get on in life. He added: 'She said if I could read, I could do anything.' While his parents, Mary and Tom Looney, left school when they were 11, he graduated from University College Dublin, which has produced many of Ireland's Prime Ministers. He took his first job at the age of 20 as a BP drilling engineer in the North Sea near Aberdeen. He then was part of the Deep Horizon team in Mexico, which is forever associated with the largest oil spill in 2010 which dumped 210m gallons into the sea. Mr Looney also worked in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico and Vietnam before getting more senior roles and becoming chief executive of BP in February 2020. He announced a net zero ambition by 2050 and a 'new purpose of reimagining energy for people and our planet' on being made the top man at BP. Mr Looney said: 'Two of the most distinctive aspects of the strategy are our plans to reduce BP's oil and gas production by 40% by 2030 and a 10-fold increase in annual spending on low carbon activities.' But this has also brought his detractors who refer to him as the 'woke' evangelist of green initiatives. An industry source suggested to The Sunday Times he was 'playing to the woke group' and said there was 'a degree of disenfranchisement, as you'd expect' among BP's 'older generation'. Mr Looney has also come under fire within BP for his commitment to a 40 per cent cut in oil and gas production to meet environmental commitments. 'That's a hell of a hydrocarbon reduction at a time when the world obviously needs it. No one else has got anything like that projection,' a former senior insider told The Sunday Times. 'He was just a little too ambitious,' he added. 'It's the right direction of travel ... [but] it's the judgment about the pace. My view — and one that's widely shared — is they have been too aggressive.' Another former employee also raised eyebrows at his pledges. 'The question is, will it come off? And will he get the rate of return that he predicted?' He added: 'I wish he'd given himself a bit more wiggle room.' Mr Looney also wants a 10-fold increase in annual spending on low carbon activities. 'Oil is increasingly becoming socially challenged.' Mr Looney said 'I would talk about the people we've hired into BP in the past six months that we would have struggled to hire had we not laid out the [net zero] ambition.' He has also been outspoken on mental health which he feels is his 'great responsibility' and on diversity including LGBT+ inclusion in the workplace. Mr Looney also regularly posts on Instagram where he spoke directly to the public, saying: 'I look forward to sharing what I am up to, who I am meeting and offering a window into the decisions, challenges and opportunities that are ahead.' He said he wanted people to open up about their oil and gas industry concerns. 'I encourage you all to be candid - I consider honest and open discussion crucial,' he wrote. His estranged wife Ms Hurst wrote in her self-published book How To Do You: the Life Changing Art of Mastering Your Thoughts and Taking Control of Your Life about a marriage which The Sunday Times understands refers to Mr Looney. She claims that her husband only married her to get ahead at BP. Ms Hurst, who has been married twice, wrote: 'When my husband ended our marriage suddenly and without warning via a WhatsApp message, I was naturally devastated. 'I learned later that he had only married me because he wanted to get to the next level of seniority in the company he worked for and he had to be seen to be married, in order to be given the promotion. 'Unbelievable, I know, but that was the case. Getting my mind - and thoughts -around what had happened took time.' Her and Mr Looney married in October 2017 and divorced in 2019, three months before he became chief executive. A friend of Mr Looney's told the Sunday Times: 'He was briefly married during a period in which he wasn't promoted. So if he married her to get promoted, that didn't seem to have worked. Maybe he divorced her to get promoted.' BP has seen its profits grow off the back of a global surge in price, in part ramped up by the war in Ukraine and inflation pressures post-Covid. The energy giant also warned that energy prices will continue to soar as the invasion of Ukraine will continue to disrupt Russian supply and cause crude oil and gas prices to stay high over the third quarter. Mr Looney said in 2021: ‘When the market is strong, when oil prices are strong and when gas prices are strong, this is literally a cash machine.’ He took a different tack today when BP delivered cheer to investors, with a 10% rise in the dividend shareholder payout and by ramping up its share buyback plan with another 3.5 billion US dollars (£2.9 billion) due before the end of September. Looney insisted on Tuesday the group was continuing to 'perform while transforming'. He said: 'Our people have continued to work hard throughout the quarter helping to solve the energy trilemma - secure, affordable and lower carbon energy. 'We do this by providing the oil and gas the world needs today - while at the same time, investing to accelerate the energy transition.' The Government is introducing a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies, but it has faced criticism for giving strong incentives to allow companies to invest in oil and gas, while there are no tax incentives in the policy for green investment. He has also dismissed the idea that any tax would change the energy giant's plans. Mr Looney said earlier this year: 'We're backing Britain. It's been our home for over 110 years, and we've been investing in North Sea oil and gas for more than 50 years.' He added: 'Our plans go beyond just infrastructure – they see us supporting the economy and skills and jobs in the communities where we operate. We are all in.' Asked by The Times what investments might be cancelled if there was a windfall tax, Mr Looney said: 'There are none that we wouldn't do.' Britons are being told to brace for blackouts this winter if energy supplies run low - while weather experts warn of the potential for a colder-than-usual winter. UK energy bosses warn short rolling power cuts are a possibility this winter, as Vladimir Putin's tactical tightening of gas pipelines in Europe starts to bite. The warning comes from John Pettigrew, the boss of the National Grid, who also believes British households will find the upcoming winter 'financially very, very hard'. To make matters worse, weather experts at the Met Office are now warning of an increased chance of a colder-than-usual winter this year. This could further up demand on gas and electricity supplies, as Britons turn up the heat to keep their homes warm. In one sign of hope, Mr Pettigrew today attempted to calm fears the UK could run out of gas and electricity this winter. He said it was the National Grid's 'base case' assumption was that the UK would have enough energy supplies to meet heating and lighting demand this winter. But he added that short rolling power cuts were a possibility. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'There could be energy shortfalls in the UK and we will manage that very carefully.' However he said it was 'not time for people to panic', adding: 'What we're doing is making sure that the infrastructure that we have and the networks are robust and ready for the winter, and I've got thousands of engineers making sure that the network is ready for whatever weather we see over the winter.' Mr Pettigrew said the National Grid was working on a number of emergency plans to protect the UK against an energy shortfall from Europe. Gas supplies had already been disrupted post-Covid lockdowns, as countries battled to resupply for the big restart, leading to a huge increase demand and subsequently prices. And this has been compounded by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with gas supplies from Russia being limited to Europe. Although the UK gets much of its gas from other countries, and gets nearly 40 per cent of its energy from gas, it is still impacted by the disruption to the European energy price market. Mr Pettigrew told the BBC that one emergency option to help power Britain this winter if fuel supplies drop is to restart mothballed coal-fired power stations. The UK is already looking at delaying the closure of part of a coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire due to fears about energy. Mr Pettigrew added: 'The next step would be to pay households and businesses to reduce consumption during peak times, with short rolling regional outages a last resort. 'If we saw that shortfall coming, the most effective way to manage the rest of the network is to ask the distribution companies to reduce demand and they would do that over that rolling period of around 4 to 7pm.' It comes as the Met Office has published its latest three-month long forecast - which covers this month, December and January. The Met Office warns that the chance of a colder three month period overall is 'slightly greater than normal' - by around 1.3 times. It means there is a 60 per cent chance of a normal winter, a 25 per cent chance of a cold winter and a 15 per cent chance of a mild winter. The Met Office also warns of a higher possibility of a slightly calmer winter in terms of wind - also by around 1.3 times. A calmer winter in terms of wind could impact on the ability to fill energy shortfalls with extra wind power capacity. The prediction comes from the Met Office's three-month forecast, which is used for emergency planning. The forecast itself does not look at day to day weather or spells, but at the weather overall over three month period. According to the Met Office, its prediction of a higher possibility of a slightly colder winter comes from its tracking of global weather patterns, including El Nina. It says the weather phenomenon this year could bring colder spells, particularly when combined with other long term patterns over the Indian Ocean."

Anatoly Karpov, 71, who was a chess grandmaster in the 1970s before turning to politics, is thought to have been injured in Moscow some time overnight on Saturday - amid claims he 'suffered a fall'. He is now on a neurology ward at the renowned Sklifosovsky Institute and has been placed in a medically induced coma, with allies describing his condition as 'serious'. Karpov is known as a Putin ultra-loyalist but has called for an end to the war in Ukraine 'so that peaceful people will stop dying.' He is just the latest member of Russia's elite to end up dead or seriously hurt since the invasion began. Mystery surrounds exactly when and how Karpov was hurt. Andrey Kovalev, head of the All-Russian Movement of Entrepreneurs, claimed he was attacked and hit over the head as he was leaving Moscow's State Duma building. Kovalev said the politician suffered a fractured neck and head injures when he was battered over the head by unknown assailants and was found unconscious. But Kirill Zangalis, spokesman for the Russian Chess Federation, said reports of a beating were 'fake news'. Karpov's daughter Sofia also denied those claims. Other reports suggested he suffered a 'domestic' incident or had an 'unfortunate fall'. One claimed he was drunk at the time. It is thought the attack happened late on Saturday or early on Sunday, though reports only began emerging yesterday. While Karpov is seen as an ultra-loyalist and supporter of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, he has also publicly called for an end to the war. He told a TV channel in Kazakhstan: 'I wish [the war] would end sooner, so that peaceful people would stop dying.' He added: 'In the end ordinary people are the victims. Ordinary people fight, politicians and generals decide, and ordinary people fight, civilians die. 'I am not even talking about soldiers and officers. No, I could not imagine at all that Russians and Ukrainians would go to war. I have many friends in Ukraine.' His heartfelt 'end the war' plea came in April in an interview with Armanzhan Baytasov, a businessman who publishes Forbes Kazakhstan. Karpov is just the latest in a long line of Russian elites to meet with misfortune following Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. While Putin has cracked down on opposition to the war, it is unclear whether all of the attacks relate directly to that. Some have speculated that elites in Russia's notoriously gangster-ish business world are taking revenge on each other while Putin is distracted with the war. The latest to die was Nikolay Petrunin, 47, dubbed the 'Gas wonderkid', who allegedly died from complications from Covid in mid-October after being in a coma for a month. His businesses built gas pipelines for major Russian energy operators and he had links to Kremlin gas behemoth Gazprom - now starving the West of Russian supplies over the war - and Rosneft. Pavel Pchelnikov, 52, a PR manager for the Russian Railways, was found shot dead at his home in the leafy Kolomenskaya Embankment neighbourhood on September 28. In July, Yuri Voronov, 61, head of a transport and logistics company for a Gazprom-linked company, was found dead in his swimming pool, with a leading friend who is a top criminologist warning of foul play. Two more deaths of Gazprom-linked executives were reported in elite homes near St Petersburg amid suspicions that apparent suicides may have been murders. Alexander Tyulakov, 61, a senior Gazprom financial and security official at deputy general director level, was discovered by his lover the day after war started in Ukraine in February. His neck was in a noose in his £500,000 home. Yet reports say he had been badly beaten shortly before he 'took his own life', leading to speculation he was under intense pressure. In the same elite Leninsky gated housing development in Leningrad region three weeks earlier, Leonid Shulman, 60, head of transport at Gazprom Invest, was found dead with multiple stab wounds in a pool of blood on his bathroom floor. Billionaire Alexander Subbotin, 43, also linked to Kremlin-friendly energy giant Lukoil where he was a top manager, was found dead in May after 'taking advice from shamans'. One theory is that Subbotin - who also owned a shipping company - was poisoned by toad venom triggering a heart attack. In April, wealthy Vladislav Avayev, 51, a former Kremlin official, appeared to have taken his own life after killing his wife Yelena, 47, and daughter, 13. He had high-level links to leading Russian financial institution Gazprombank. Friends have disputed reports that he was jealous after his wife admitted she was pregnant by their driver. There are claims he had access to the financial secrets of the Kremlin elite. Several days later multimillionaire Sergey Protosenya, 55, was found hanged in Spain, after appearing to kill his wife Natalia, 53, and their teenage daughter, Maria, with an axe. He was a former deputy chairman of Novatek, a company also closely linked to the Kremlin. There have also been questions over the death of Putin's point man for developing Russia's vast Arctic resources who 'fell overboard' to his death from a boat sailing off the country's Pacific coast. Ivan Pechorin, 39, had recently attended a major conference hosted by the Kremlin warmonger in Vladivostok. The high-flyer was managing director of Putin's Far East and Arctic Development Corporation. And in another case a mobile phone multi-millionaire and his wife were found stabbed to death, with the official version of events raising questions. Naked Yevgeny Palant, 47, and his wife Olga, 50, both Ukrainian-born, were found with multiple knife wounds by their daughter Polina, 20. Immediate briefing to the media claimed the woman took her own life in a jealous rage after Palant said he was leaving her. Yet this was strongly disputed by the couple's best friend."
2022-11-01,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11376653/Rishi-Sunak-gathers-Cabinet-braces-Britain-YEARS-taxes-austerity.html,"Jeremy Hunt sharpens the axe on spending as Britons face YEARS of higher taxes to plug £50bn hole in public finances: Haggling begins with Defence Secretary Ben Wallace saying army strength should STAY at 76,000 and military must move up 'priority ladder'","Haggling is already under way with ministers tonight as Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt look for spending cuts and higher taxes to fill the 'eye-watering' £50billion black hole in the government finances. The Chancellor is set to meet colleagues this week as they try to thrash out a package ahead of the crucial Autumn Statement on November 17. Mr Sunak told Cabinet this morning that 'difficult decisions' are coming, but stressed the NHS would be 'prioritised' for funding - while making clear that in return the health service will need to accept reform. However, that means other departments are facing even deeper curbs, as spiking inflation erodes the value of their budgets. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told a House of Lords committee this afternoon that he will suggest to the Chancellor that the strength of the army could stay at 76,000 rather than falling to 73,000 as planned. He said the upcoming fiscal event will show 'how fixed' the new premier is on the promise to raise defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP by 2030. He told the International Relations and Defence Committee: 'I'm confident that the argument has been made that defence needs to come back up the priority in investment, the next argument is how much by, and obviously as Defence Secretary, I would like by significant amounts. 'But I also live in the real world and the next two years there is a spending challenge we have to meet. I've got my envelope. 'Inflation is the biggest enemy of me with a capital budget that ranges between £15 to 18 billion a year, roughly. That level of capital, unlike other departments, means that I am particularly vulnerable to inflation and exchange rate pressures. 'So I would like to get through that and then plan into the longer term.' The assessment came after the premier and Mr Hunt concluded that soaking the rich and taking an axe to public spending in the Autumn Statement will not be enough to balance the books. Instead, broad-based tax rises will be needed, with speculation that thresholds will be frozen for longer to drag millions of people deeper into the system by 'stealth'. The government is expected to stick to manifesto pledges not to hike the headline rates of income tax, national insurance or VAT. Meanwhile, public sector workers could face a 2 per cent cap on pay rises next year, far below the expected rate of inflation, as the government seeks to split the fiscal tightening 50-50 between trimming spending and raising revenue. In other developments as the country braces for a punishing few years: Rishi Sunak will look to make savings in the public sector, with a 2 per cent pay rise across the board being mooted for the next financial year. That would represent a real-terms pay cut for teachers, soldiers, police officers and nurses as inflation is forecast to remain at a high of 9.5 per cent next year. This year, a 5 per cent pay rise prompted the threat of strikes across the public sector because the rate was below inflation. A Treasury source said of the Autumn Statement overnight: 'It is going to be rough. The truth is that everybody will need to contribute more in tax if we are to maintain public services. 'After borrowing hundreds of billions of pounds through Covid-19 and implementing massive energy bills support, we won't be able to fill the fiscal black hole through spending cuts alone.' They added that Mr Sunak and Mr Hunt are committed to protecting the most vulnerable in society during the 'difficult period' ahead. 'You will need spending cuts to fill that black hole, but unfortunately you need tax rises too,' an insider said. 'The focus will be towards the upper end of the income scale but the truth is, there are not enough people there – everybody will have to pay more. Everyone will feel the pain.' The warning came as the Resolution Foundation think-tank said Mr Sunak and Mr Hunt face an 'unpalatable menu' when it comes to rebalancing finances. With a deteriorating economic outlook and the legacy of last prime minister Liz Truss's disastrous mini-Budget as a backdrop, it suggests the Government will need to find at least £40billion — likely through a combination of tax rises and spending cuts. The think-tank said the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) could predict a recession next year, with GDP forecasts cut by up to 4 per cent by the end of 2024. Unemployment could also rise by around half a million, the report suggests, with the weaker economic outlook bringing borrowing up by around £20billion a year by 2026-2027. 'The Government has a little over two weeks to finalise its plans to repair its economic credibility and the sustainability of the public finances,' said James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation. 'While the recent focus has been on conditions improving post-Trussonomics, the central picture remains one of a weaker growth, higher borrowing costs and expensive tax cuts that have left a fiscal hole of at least £40billion to fill.' Struggling Britons are to face more pain at the pumps as the price of diesel continues to rocket, sparking fresh fears it could hit an all-time high before Christmas. The average cost of a litre of the fuel at UK forecourts on Monday was an eye-watering 190.12p, according to the RAC Fuel Watch, with one Tesco in Cambridge selling diesel for 197.9p. It's the first time diesel has topped £1.90 since it hit a crippling record high in July of 199.05p, leading to warnings by the RAC of an imminent 'national fuel crisis'. The prices come as hard-pressed families continue to battle the cost of living crisis, which has seen inflation balloon to a bank-busting 10.1 per cent as food prices continue to spiral due to the war in Ukraine. The latest spike in fuel means fed-up motorists will need to splurge £104.57 to fill the average 55-litre diesel tank - £23.46 more than this time last year, when the average cost was 147.48p per litre, or £81.11 to fill a tank. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: 'RAC Fuel Watch data shows the gap between the average price of petrol and diesel now stands at a record 24p a litre. As of Thursday, drivers were paying an average of 166p for unleaded while diesel has climbed to above 190p. 'Following the announcement from oil producer group OPEC+ early this month that it was cutting production by two million barrels a day, the wholesale price of refined fuel has increased as a result of oil trading well above $90 having previously been below that mark at the end of last month. 'Since OPEC and its allies agreed to reduce oil supply substantially we've seen the price of the average price of diesel going up by almost 10p a litre and petrol by nearly 3p. 'Sadly, for diesel drivers, the situation could yet get worse with prices now back above 190p a litre for the first time since the beginning of August. Hopefully the average price record of 199p for a litre of diesel set in late June won't be surpassed. 'The price hikes have added £5 to a tank of diesel and nearly £2 to a full petrol fill-up. Due to the war in Ukraine and the UK moving away from Russian diesel, the cost of buying in wholesale diesel from other countries has gone up considerably.' Fuel prices have been driven up over the last few months by the war in Ukraine and moves to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian oil. But diesel has seen far steeper hike in prices than unleaded, with the average cost per litre of petrol remaining at 166.17p. Financial expert Robert Alster, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said diesel was soaring ahead of petrol as it was used not just for transport but for power generators, too. On BBC Radio 4 this morning, Mr Alster warned the combination of the war in Ukraine and soaring living costs would continue to drive up inflation and punish family finances. 'It's adding all to a general inflationary higher level than we have seen before,' he said. 'Obviously, it's been caused by the conflict of Russia and Ukraine. But even allowing for that, it's shortages driven by Covid, supply chain issues, geopolitical issues between the US and China.' In July, motorists were hit with huge prices at the pumps, with some paying as much as £2 per litre for petrol and diesel. Among the most outrageous was a BP garage on the A1 near Sunderland, which was selling a litre of unleaded and diesel for 202.9p and 204.9p respectively. A Gulf petrol garage in Essex and another forecourt on the M6 in Cumbria were also selling fuel for more than £2-per-litre. Some businesses are already feeling the strain, with freight companies reporting the cost of running one lorry is already up £20,000 on last year, leaving the haulage industry 'in crisis.' One small business owner in Manchester told MailOnline how his fuel costs have surged over the 12 months. Jon Randles, director of Proteger Protect, a stone and render cleaning firm, said: 'As a small business owner filling up my van three times a week and using diesel for my equipment, my weekly fuel costs are now in excess of £600 a week.' The RAC had already warned that 'frightening' petrol prices will exceed an average of 180p per litre in July in what it described as a 'national fuel crisis'. RAC fuel spokesman Mr Williams added: 'The wholesale price of diesel is fast approaching 160p a litre which, when you add 7p retailer margin and 20 per cent VAT, would take the pump price over the £2 mark. 'We strongly urge the Government to take drastic action to help soften the impact for drivers from these never-before-seen pump prices.' Lesley O'Brien, director of Freight Link Europe, told the BBC's Today programme: 'This certainly is a crisis as we've seen fuel prices escalate over the last year by 50 per cent and no sight of a stop, so we absolutely as an industry need to keep on top of this. 'As a country we need to understand we need to support our transport industry which is the infrastructure of the whole economy.' Ms O'Brien said fuel was a third of her business' running costs, adding the cost of running a lorry has risen from around £41,000 to more than £61,000 since last year. She said her company added a fuel surcharge to its bills, to cover fluctuating prices. She added: 'But never before has it been so high. As an example, to run one of my artic vehicles is now costing me £20,000 more per year than in did last year.' AA fuel price spokesman Luke Bosdet said: 'Shock and awe is the only way to describe what has been happening at the pump during the half-term break. 'Little wonder that nearly half of drivers stayed at home for the Jubilee extended bank holiday. 'The forces behind the surge have been oil jumping back above 120 US dollars a barrel for the first time since late March, combined with petrol commodity prices being boosted by summer motoring demand.' Motorists took to social media to blast the surging fuel prices which are only worsening the ongoing cost of living crisis. The crisis has been compounded by Britain's soaring rate of inflation which reached 10.1 per cent in September, up from 9.9 per cent the previous month and matching the 40-year high that it hit in July. The grim figure was driven by a huge 14.5 per cent annual rise in food costs and came despite petrol prices coming down slightly. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the government will 'prioritise help for the most vulnerable' and take action to stabilise the economy, after he dramatically junked Liz Truss's tax-cutting plans. VAT, national insurance and income tax hikes are all understood to be off the table given previous pledges and Conservative Party manifesto commitments, while increasing fuel duty is likely to be seen as too risky in the middle of a cost of living crisis. It means the Treasury is likely to focus on 'stealth' measures such as freezing income tax thresholds for another two years. That would raise as much as £5billion by dragging up to three million workers into higher tax bands. The income tax and national insurance thresholds were expected to be frozen until 2026, with the new plan extending this by at least two more years. It comes after it was revealed that Mr Hunt is looking at a 50:50 split between spending cuts and tax rises in the Autumn Statement, which was due to be delivered yesterday but was delayed so the new PM could get 'under the bonnet' of the plans. By contrast, George Osborne's austerity package after the financial crash was 80 per cent spending cuts and 20 per cent tax rises. The Telegraph reported that Mr Sunak and Mr Hunt have agreed to freeze the thresholds at which people start to pay the different rates of income tax and national insurance for the years ahead. Mr Hunt has already announced £32billion in tax rises as he sought to reassure financial markets that the situation would be brought under control after the sacking of his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng. Insiders at the Treasury said Mr Sunak and Mr Hunt agreed on Monday that while 'those with the broadest shoulders should be asked to bear the greatest burden', taxes would rise for everyone, the Financial Times reported. It is thought that extending a freeze on personal tax allowances could raise around £5billion a year by 2027, the newspaper reported, with 'fiscal drag' possibly pulling people into higher tax brackets due to inflation. Funds could also be raised by Mr Sunak reverting back to his plan to raise national insurance by £13billion. But an ally of the Prime Minister admitted that it would be a political challenge to 'march everyone up a hill again when they've already been marched up and down it once before', they told the newspaper. Tory MPs have voted to raise it and cut it on different occasions. The PM will also look to make savings in the public sector, with a 2 per cent pay rise across the board during the next financial year, The Times reported. This would represent a real-term pay cut for teachers, soldiers, police officers and nurses as inflation is forecast to remain at a high of 9.5 per cent next year. This year, a 5 per cent pay rise prompted the threat of strikes across the public sector because the rate was below inflation. On a visit to a hospital in Croydon last week, the Prime Minister said he would act to 'protect the most vulnerable' as he tightens the nation's belt. But he said the eye-watering package was necessary to bring inflation under control and limit the looming rise in mortgage payments. 'The Chancellor has already said difficult decisions are going to have to be made and I'm going to sit down and work through those with him,' he said. 'But what I want everyone to know is that we need to do these things so that we can get our borrowing and debt back on a sustainable path. 'That's important because it means that we can get a grip of inflation if we do that. It means we can limit as best as possible the increase in interest rates, which is important. 'But as we do that, I want people to be reassured we will always do it with fairness at the heart, we will protect the most vulnerable and ensure that we can continue to grow the economy in the long run.' The Resolution Foundation said ministers will have to squeeze taxpayers and the public sector further because of a 'deteriorating economic outlook' and the legacy of Ms Truss's abandoned growth plans. A recession is likely next year while unemployment could rise by 500,000 and inflation is expected to remain higher for longer, it added. Foundation research director Mr Smith said: 'The central picture remains one of a weaker growth, higher borrowing costs and expensive tax cuts that have left a fiscal hole of at least £40billion to fill. 'History tells us that this will involve cuts to public investment, which are easy to announce but reduce growth in the longer term. 'Further austerity for public services is also likely, but there are limits to how big these can credibly be, as public services are already facing cuts of £22billion thanks to high inflation. 'This reality means that the Autumn Statement is likely to involve tax rises, not just spending cuts.' Among the 'menu' of options open to the Chancellor are cuts to investment spending, a move the Resolution Foundation said could save £10billion but also have a detrimental impact on growth. The think-tank also suggests the Government could try to choose the so-called 'austerity option'. Such a move would require cuts to already-squeezed department budgets. 'With inflation at its highest level for 40 years, Government departments are already seeing their budgets fall in real terms by around £22billion by 2024-25. It is hard to see how the Treasury could credibly save more than £20billion by announcing cuts to day-to-day public service spending,' it said. The Resolution Foundation study suggests the new administration could save £9billion by choosing not to raise benefits and pensions in line with rising prices next year. It said any such move would have a 'huge' impact on those struggling, with a low-income working family with two children losing around £750 and a pensioner £342. One option open to the Prime Minister and Chancellor would be to 'go full circle' on the mini-Budget by reinstating the health and social care levy - a move that would raise £15billion by 2026-27. Around £ billion could also be raised by extending the 'stealth' freezes in income tax thresholds by a further year to 2026-27. The Treasury's warning came as Ms Braverman was fighting for survival on two fronts as she faces a row about overcrowding at the Manston migrant processing centre in Kent and a continuing controversy over security breaches following her use of a personal email address to send official documents. The Home Secretary has come under pressure over the situation at Manston following reports she failed to act on legal advice that migrants were being detained for unlawfully long periods at the site. Mrs Braverman outlined how it costs taxpayers £6.8million a day to fund hotel accommodation for migrants and asylum seekers. As she spoke in the Commons, the Treasury warned that spending cuts will not be enough to raise the billions needed to balance the Government's books. The changes will be included in the Autumn Statement, due on November 17. It will detail spending decisions for the next five years, with changes expected to be introduced at the start of the next financial year. 'Taxpayers will be horrified by talk of bigger bills to come,' John O'Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, told The Telegraph. 'With the tax burden at a 70-year high, Brits are being expected to bear the brunt of a spiralling cost of government crisis. The Chancellor must make significant savings to ease the strain on hard-pressed households.' It comes as spending concerns are raised around the NHS, with Government insiders believing that billions more are needed to clear a backlog caused by Covid-19, the newspaper reported. The fear is that without more money, the waiting lists will continue to lengthen, while inflation creates a shortfall in the existing budget."
2022-11-01,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11379061/Biden-says-son-Beau-died-Iraq.html,Biden AGAIN falsely says his son Beau died in Iraq - but catches himself confusing the Iraq and Ukraine Wars - while discussing the causes of worldwide inflation during Florida speech,"President Joe Biden again said that his son Beau Biden died in Iraq, while catching himself calling the war in Ukraine the Iraq war, while delivering remarks in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on Tuesday. 'Inflation is a worldwide problem right now,' the president said. 'There's a war in Iraq and the impact on oil and what Russia's doing. Excuse me, the war in Ukraine.' 'I'm thinking Iraq, because that's where my son died - because he died,' Biden then explained. Beau Biden, who served as Delaware's attorney general and in the Delaware Army National Guard in the Iraq War, died at age 46 in 2015 from brain cancer at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The president has long linked his service, and the military's use of burn pits, to Beau's brain cancer diagnosis. 'In my view, I can't prove it yet, he came back with stage 4 glioblastoma. Eighteen months he lived, knowing he was going to die,' Biden said in 2019. Biden previously said that Beau died in Iraq while speaking at Camp Hale in Colorado last month. 'Just imagine - I mean it sincerely - I say this as a father of a man who won the Bronze Star, the Conspicuous Service Medal, and lost his life in Iraq. Imagine the courage, the daring, and the genuine sacrifice - genuine sacrifice they all made,' Biden said then. Biden was in Florida to take on the Republicans with just one week to go before the midterm elections. In his speech at a senior center, Biden blasted the GOP for wanting to cut social programs – it's a topic of interest in a state with a large population of retirees. 'I've come to Florida today to talk about two very, very, very important programs,' he said. 'it's gonna affect as many Americans as anything else.' He described Social Security and Medicare as 'under siege by our Republican friends.' Biden finished his speech by saying he hoped that God 'gives some of our Republican friends some enlightenment.' He argued people should have 'peace of mind' when they retire. And he noted how Medicare can now negotiate prescription drug prices. 'Here in Florida, 21% of the people are over the age of 65. It's the second highest of any state in the country,' he noted. He also pointed out under his administration that for, the 'first time can you see again an increase in their Social Security and Medicare' – an announcement met with great applause. 'So checks are going to be up. Medicare premiums are going to be down and look it's a big deal for seniors,' he said. 'Let me say something. I want to point something out. They talk about big spending Democrats. Yeah, I spent a lot of money to do these things, but guess why,' he said. 'We cut the deficit in half,' he said, lowering his voice to a whisper to make his point. The president appeared visibly frustrated with the argument Republicans are making against his stewardship of the economy. Voters have said the economy and inflation are their top concerns - and they give Biden low marks on his handling of both issues. 'Give me a break. I'm so sick and I shouldn't get,' Biden let his voice trail off as he paced on stage. But the crowd cheered and encouraged him on. 'As my granddaughter's used to say, Google, I'm serious,' the president told the crowd. Biden has been hitting Republicans repeatedly for wanting to change the two large government social programs. The president repeatedly has made Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott's policy proposals a boogeyman in the election, calling out the senator by name in his criticism of the GOP. He did so again in Florida on Tuesday. He held up a pamphlet and read aloud Scott's plan that would put Medicare, Social Security and other government programs up for a vote every five years. 'A senator from Florida going after Social Security and Medicaid?,' he said. 'You might even you might not even believe it. Again, word for word. All federal legislation, sunsets means goes away in five years.' 'These programs do something so basic and so important,' Biden said of them. Biden started his remarks by talking about all the assistance his administration has offered the state as it recovers from Hurricane Ian. He said the federal government approved $1.7 billion in federal grants, which led to whoops, applause and cheers from the audience. Biden will be campaigning for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist and Senate hopeful Val Demings in the Sunshine State even as he avoids some of the bigger battleground contests like Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. Ahead of his trip, Biden boarded Air Force One with a copy of Jon Meacham's new book 'And There Was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle'. The biography looks into how Lincoln prioritized his policies and ending slavery over his own future before the 1864 election and during the Civil War. Lincoln's Republican party also performed poorly during the 1862 midterm elections, with the Democrats gaining several seats and ending their majority. Polls suggest Biden could be facing a similar fate with the 2022 midterms with polls suggesting Republicans will decisively take control of the House and have a path to winning a majority in the Senate. 'Lincoln was a politician, but he was a politician who ultimately was driven by conscience,' Meacham told NPR. 'This is my entire argument in the book. If he had solely been a cynical political creature, he would have made radically different decisions at critical points.' Crist is trailing Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking a second term. And Deming is down against GOP Senator Marco Rubio in a contest that will help decide which party controls the Senate next year. The president, who is battling low approval ratings, is spending his last week on the campaign trail trying to contrast how his Democrats will govern versus Republicans as voters prepare to head to the polls on Nov. 8. He will make his closing argument at stops in New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Maryland over the next seven days. He's not the only Democrat hitting the campaign trail. Jill Biden heads to Pennsylvania on Wednesday. Barack Obama, meanwhile, will be in Nevada on Tuesday for Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, who faces a tough re-election campaign and he heads to Arizona on Wednesday to campaign for Senator Mark Kelly. University of North Florida pollster Michael Binder told the Palm Beach Post that Biden's visit might be 'six months too late,' because millions of Florida voters have already cast their ballots in early voting. Election forecasters see Republicans having a strong chance of winning control of the House of Representatives. The Senate is seen as more up for grabs. Winning control of even one chamber of Congress would allow the GOP to stymie Biden's legislative agenda for the next two years. Trump, meanwhile, will hold a rally in Miami on Sunday although he'll be campaigning for Republicans in general. DeSantis, who is rumored to a 2024 presidential contender, is not scheduled to appear with him. Florida has become an increasingly difficult state for Democrats to win. Trump carried it in 2016 and 2020. DeSantis capitalized on anti-covid sentiments to push back against shut down restrictions and signed legislation against vaccine mandates. Biden is looking to drive up voter turn out but is staying away from most of the battleground states. The president hasn't been to Arizona, Nevada or Georgia - three states that helped put in the White House - nor is he expected to. All three states have closely-contested Senate races. The president will join Barack Obama in Philadelphia on Saturday to campaign for gubernatorial candidate Josh Shaprio and Senate contender John Fetterman. With the Senate currently sitting at 50-50 - and Vice President Kamala Harris providing the tie breaking vote - any race could decide which party is in the majority next year."
2022-11-01,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11378825/Saudi-Arabia-puts-forces-high-alert-Iran-threatening-imminent-attack.html,Saudi Arabia puts the US and forces in the Middle East on high alert over Iran threatening an ‘imminent attack on the Kingdom,"U.S. security officials are ‘concerned’ about potential threats from Iran, following a report that Saudi Arabia has shared intelligence of an ‘imminent’ threat from its rival. The U.S. is signaling that the country won’t hesitate to respond if necessary, a White House spokesperson said on Tuesday. ‘We are concerned about the threat picture, and we remain in constant contact through military and intelligence channels with the Saudis,’ said the spokesperson from the National Security Council. ‘We will not hesitate to act in the defense of our interests and partners in the region.’ The official spoke after the Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia has shared intelligence with the United States warning of an imminent attack from Iran on targets in the kingdom. The paper reported that Iran was also planning to step up attacks on Erbil in Northern Iraq, with the attacks meant to distract from turmoil inside Iran amid ongoing domestic protests. The United States has said Iran has supplied Russia with drones for use in its war against Ukraine, prompting Washington to set aside efforts to resurrect the Iran nuclear deal, which then-President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018. Western officials say Iran is planning to send more of the killer drones, CNN reported Tuesday. Saudi Arabia’s warning comes amid deep strains in the relationship with the U.S., which helps ensure security both through its military presence and through multi-billion arms sales of advanced weaponry. President Joe Biden and his administration in recent weeks have been fuming over Saudi-led OPEC+ organization’s decision to cut oil output, which raised fears of a gasoline price spike in the United States. The administration considers the move, which got announced weeks before the elections here, a boon to Russia’s war on Ukraine since Moscow relies on energy exports to pay its bills. Iran’s export of drones to Russia has helped reshape the war, with Russia using the technology, according to US officials, to wreak havoc on Ukrainian domestic infrastructure like water and power plants. Tehran also has been launching missiles and drones at Northern Iraq, with U.S. forces shooting down one missile as it headed toward Erbil. Iran blames activities by Iranian Kurdish separatist groups. Iran continues to crack down in an effort to keep a lid on protests that have raged for weeks. It has charged an estimated 1,000 people in Tehan province for protesting Amini’s death while in policy custody after being arrested by ‘morality police,’ IRNA reported Monday. Trials are set to begin in the coming days, it reported. Tehran has blamed Saudi Arabia for meddling in its own ‘internal affairs’ through Saudi-backed Farsi language news sites providing coverage of the protests."
2022-11-01,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11378767/Brittney-Griners-wife-says-nine-year-sentence-Russian-prison-political.html,Brittney Griner's wife says the WNBA star's nine-year sentence in Russian prison is 'political' in interview on The View - and claims she's in 'complete disbelief' days after the appeal was denied in court,"Brittney Griner's wife Cherelle says the Russian court's decision to deny the WNBA star's appeal has left her in 'complete disbelief' and that the nine-year prison sentence feels 'political.' Cherelle appeared on Tuesday's episode of The View just days after her wife's harsh sentence was upheld in a Russian court. She described her wife's sentence as 'absurd' and 'disproportionate' compared to other crimes and punishments in the country. The Phoenix Mercury star and a two-time Olympic gold medalist was convicted in August on drug possession charges after police said they found vape canisters containing cannabis oil in her luggage at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. Griner is expected to serve out the entirety of her sentence in a penal colony labor camp in Russia, which are known for harsh conditions. 'To see that the totality of the circumstances of who she is as a person was not taken into account when they rendered a decision, it makes me feel like this – at this point – has to be political,' Cherelle told the co-hosts Tuesday. 'It's not her footprint. Her footprint is amazing for Russia. She's paying taxes there,' she continued. 'She's great for Russia.' Griner was not at the Moscow Regional Court hearing but appeared via video link from a penal colony outside the capital where she is held. The nine-year sentence was close to the maximum of 10 years, and Griner's lawyers argued after the conviction that the punishment was excessive. They said in similar cases defendants have received an average sentence of about five years, with about a third of them granted parole. 'I understand being in the field of law that every state, every country has their own rules, but this is just absurd,' Cherelle said. 'The crime and the punishment is disproportionate at its finest ... There are people convicted of murder in Russia who [have] a sentence way less than B.G., and it just makes absolutely no sense to me.' 'That was the complete end of it. There's nothing more to expect from a legal standpoint and all eggs are in basket, you know, for our government and for America to see how important this issue is,' she continued. 'This could happen to anybody and we should be praying that we have a country that recognizes the importance of that and are willing to actually go get our Americans and bring them back home.' Cherelle said she has only spoken to her wife a few times since her imprisonment in February and said that Griner's mental health is suffering. 'It has been really hard trying to adjust how to live every day,' she told the hosts. 'There's nothing more to expect from a legal standpoint,' she said. But added that viewers can support Griner by joining the letter-writing campaign. She said she will hold onto hope that her wife's 'personality can do her a little bit of favor in keeping her safe' inside the Russian labor camp. 'If you met BG, it's impossible not to love her,' she said. At her trial in August, Griner admitted to having the canisters in her luggage but testified she packed them inadvertently in her haste to make her flight and had no criminal intent. Her defense team presented written statements saying she had been prescribed cannabis to treat chronic pain. While upholding the sentence, the court said last week Griner's prison time will be recalculated to reflect what she has already served in pre-trial detention. One day in pre-trial detention will be counted as 1 1/2 days in prison, so she still will have to serve about eight years in prison. Griner's lawyers Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov said in an email that they were 'very disappointed' with the decision because they still believe 'the punishment is excessive and contradicts to the existing court practice.' 'Brittney's biggest fear is that she is not exchanged and will have to serve the whole sentence in Russia,' they said. 'She had hopes for today, as each month, each day away from her family and friends matters to her.' They said they had to discuss with Griner what legal steps they should take next. Griner's arrest in February came at a time of heightened tensions between Moscow and Washington, just days before Russia sent troops into Ukraine. At the time, Griner was returning to play for a Russian team during the WNBA´s offseason. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the decision 'another failure of justice, compounding the injustice of her detention,' adding that 'securing her release is our priority.' President Joe Biden told reporters that his administration is in 'constant contact' with Russian authorities on Griner and other Americans who are detained there. While there has not been progress on bringing her back to the U.S., Biden said, 'We´re not stopping.' Before her conviction, the U.S. State Department declared Griner to be 'wrongfully detained' - a charge that Russia has sharply rejected. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement that Biden 'is willing to go to extraordinary lengths and make tough decisions to bring Americans home.' WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said the decision 'while unfortunate, was not unexpected. ... It is time to bring this case to an end and bring BG home.' The WNBA Players Association said the ruling was 'further verification that BG is not just wrongfully detained -- she is very clearly a hostage.' Because of the growing pressure on the Biden administration to do more to bring Griner home, Blinken took the unusual step of revealing in July that Washington had made a 'substantial proposal' to get Griner home, along with Paul Whelan, an American serving a 16-year sentence in Russia for espionage. WNBA star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner is seen on October 25 during her hearing to appeal her conviction on drug charges Blinken didn't elaborate, but The Associated Press and other news organizations have reported that Washington has offered to exchange Griner and Whelan for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer who is serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S. and once earned the nickname the 'merchant of death.' The White House said it has not yet received a productive response from Russia to the offer. Russian diplomats have refused to comment on the U.S. proposal and urged Washington to discuss the matter in confidential talks, avoiding public statements. But some Russian officials have said a deal is more likely once appeals have been exhausted. In September, Biden met with Cherelle Griner, the player's wife, as well as her agent, Lindsay Colas. Biden also sat down separately with Elizabeth Whelan, Paul Whelan´s sister. The White House said after the meetings that the president stressed to the families his 'continued commitment to working through all available avenues to bring Brittney and Paul home safely.' The U.S. and Russia carried out a prisoner swap in April. Moscow released U.S. Marines veteran Trevor Reed in exchange for the U.S. releasing a Russian pilot, Konstantin Yaroshenko, who was convicted in a drug trafficking conspiracy."
2022-11-01,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11378599/Chinese-Government-hackers-biggest-threat-UKs-cyber-security-official-report-reveals.html,"Chinese Government hackers are the biggest threat to UK’s cyber security, official report reveals","China’s bid for technical supremacy through its army of hackers poses the biggest single threat to Britain’s future cyber security, a report warned yesterday. The head of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) Lindy Cameron said China’s rapid technical development and global espionage threatens our national security. She spoke out as a new taskforce was announced yesterday to protect British democratic institutions from foreign interference by hostile states. Security minister Tom Tugendhat told MPs a new body will look at both physical and online threats to MPs. The development comes after it was revealed last week that Liz Truss’s personal phone was hacked while she was foreign secretary by Moscow’s agents. Yesterday an annual review by the NCSC warned of the ‘acute’ online threat to the UK posed by hostile states including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. Miss Cameron suggested China posed the biggest threat to UK interests. She said: ‘China’s technical development and evolution is likely to be the single biggest factor affecting the UK’s cyber security in the years to come.’ The NCSC report warned: ‘Chinese cyber forces are by far the largest in the world. ‘Since taking power nearly a decade ago, President Xi has overseen extensive reform of China’s intelligence and military apparatus, with a key priority being the fusion of military and civilian cyber capabilities. ‘Since then, China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) has emerged as a prolific and pervasive actor in cyberspace, undertaking a substantial global espionage campaign to meet political, socio-economic, and strategic objectives.’ In April FBI Director Christopher Wray said China has ‘a bigger hacking programme than that of every other major nation combined.’ The annual review by the cyber security organisation, which is part of GCHQ, also pointed to a threat of cyber attacks from Russia if President Putin changes tactics in the war against Ukraine. Prior to the invasion, GCHQ boss Sir Jeremy Fleming and Miss Cameron led roundtables with CEOs of domestic energy, utilities, food, communications, transport and other essential service providers to brief them on the risks of ‘Russian cyber aggression’, although fears of a wave of cyber attacks on Britain proved unfounded. Britain is currently the third most targeted country for cyber attacks, behind only the USA and Ukraine. But the NCSC report warned that Russia could now change tactics: ‘While UK organisations did not experience significant cyber impact resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russia continues to be a persistent and active threat to the UK and its interests, which is why the NCSC continues to advise against complacency. ‘In response to recent setbacks Russia has experienced on the battlefield in Ukraine, they could change their approach in the cyber domain of the conflict.’ The report warned threats posed by hostile states will grow in the future. In the coming years, malicious and disruptive cyber tools will be available to a ‘wider range of state and non-state actors’ due to the development of ‘hackers-for-hire’ offering bespoke services and a ‘growing grey market’ for cyber tools Over the last year, businesses and organisations in the UK reported hundreds of cyber incidents to the NCSC, 63 of which were significant enough to require a national level response. They included 18 ransomware incidents, including attacks on a supplier to NHS 111, and a water utility company, South Staffordshire Water. Later in the Commons, Mr Tugendhat announced yesterday he would be leading a new taskforce to combat threats to Britain’s democratic institutions. He said: ‘The advanced technologies our rivals have spent time and money developing have levelled the field and made us more vulnerable. ‘Britain has been on the front line of the defence of liberty for generations; our agencies, and businesses have faced the reality of this danger for decades. ‘Our Parliament and our politics are now no different, whether it’s ministers or shadow ministers on committee, or when leading a campaign, this is about every party and every member of this House.’"
2022-11-01,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11378495/Boris-says-Putin-crazy-bomb-Ukraine-nuclear-weapons-says-Cop-27.html,"So what ARE you planning, Boris? Ex-PM gives wry smile when asked if he wants a return to No10 - just over a week after pulling out of fighting Rishi Sunak to succeed Liz Truss","Boris Johnson gave a wry smile when asked if he wanted to return to No10 as Prime Minister in an interview. The former premier was speaking to Sky News when he was asked if he would like to return to the top role, and whether he had 'unfinished business'. 'You promised this was going to be about Ukraine,' he said. 'I harbour hopes of continuing to campaign for Ukraine and that is my priority. 'There are various other things that I'm doing but that is of course very dear to my heart.' In the interview, Mr Johnson claimed Russia would be plunged into a 'cryogenic economic freeze' if Vladimir Putin launched a 'crazy' nuclear strike on Ukraine. In a warning to the Russian President about the consequences of escalating his barbaric war, the former prime minister insisted Mr Putin would suffer a 'total disaster'. Mr Johnson told Sky News that Mr Putin would 'immediately tender Russia's resignation from the club of civilised nations' if he used nuclear weapons. He insisted the Russian President would be further isolated among global nations by losing the 'tacit acquiesence' of countries across Africa, South America and Asia, as well as the 'patronage of the Chinese'. The ex-PM also claimed Mr Putin's launching of a nuclear strike would see 'an absolutely hysterical reaction' in Russia itself. Meanwhile, in his first interview since leaving No10, Mr Johnson confirmed he would be attending the Cop-27 climate change summit in Egypt this month. His attendance will increase pressure on current PM Rishi Sunak to reverse his initial decision to snub the Sharm El-Sheikh gathering in order to focus on his economic plans. During the interview with Sky News, Mr Johnson was asked if he has spoken to Rishi Sunak about a 'possible role', with which he said: 'What I can do and what I will want to do is to continue to champion the cause of Ukrainian freedom, of a free sovereign, independent Ukraine. It is a great cause. I think it is a cause that has mobilised a phenomenal level of support across the UK.' When pressed as to whether he would like 'a formal role', Mr Johnson said: 'I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I think, my job is to talk up what I think are the immediate needs of the Ukrainians,' adding that he will 'inevitably' return to the country. Mr Johnson was also asked if he feels 'more appreciated on the world stage than he does domestically'. Responding, he said: 'I have an absolute passionate belief that the war in Ukraine, Putin's act of aggression, is something that we shouldn't accept, we shouldn't tolerate. 'I think that I can continue to campaign for Ukraine out of office and that's what I'm going to do.' During the interview, the former prime minister said a nuclear act would 'immediately tender Russia's resignation from the club of civilised nations' and plunge the country into a 'kind of cryogenic economic freeze'. He added that he suspects it would trigger an 'absolutely hysterical reaction' in Russia itself. It comes as the Defence Secretary has said momentum on the ground remains with Ukraine, with Crimea expected to come within range of Ukrainian artillery by the end of November. There have been suggestions that Moscow could attempt to escalate the conflict, but Mr Johnson said he does not think Mr Putin will resort to using a tactical nuclear weapon. During his time as PM, Mr Johnson put Britain at the forefront of Western efforts in supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia's brutal assault. He even visited Ukrainian capital Kyiv three times as he forged a close bond with the country's President Volodmyr Zelensky. The ex-PM insisted it was not 'credible' for Mr Putin to keep hold of the four further Ukrainian regions the Russian leader has annexed since launching his most recent invasion effort in late February. 'He will lose those,' Mr Johnson added. This sentiment was echoed by Mr Wallace at a meeting of the Lords International Relations and Defence Committee on Tuesday. 'The direction of travel is that I think it is likely that by the end of this month, the northern part of Kherson will be depleted of Russians or the Russians will have left that part, which brings into range parts of Crimea from long-range artillery that the Ukraine held or the HIMARS-type systems,' he said. Reflecting on the start of the war, Mr Johnson told Sky News: 'Some of the defence intelligence people were saying look this is going to be very very one-sided, the Russians are just going to roll through and numerically they're so strong and they're so well-equipped. 'I've been to Ukraine a few times before and I kind of knew that they were going to fight, and you talk to people who've fought in the east in Donbas since 2014 — these are hardened hardened fighters — so I thought it would be much tougher than Putin thought.' When asked if Ukraine is on the verge of victory, he said that it's 'absolutely inevitable that the Ukrainians will eventually win... because this is a war of independence. 'Wars of independence only really end one way and the crucial thing for us all who believe in this cause, believe that the cause of the Ukrainian freedom is all of our cause, we just have to show strategic patience and continue to support them through this winter and beyond.' When asked what victory looks like, the former Prime Minister said: 'I think the exact contours of victory are very much up to the Ukrainians. We can't be more Ukrainian than the Ukrainians, passionately though we may support them, it's up to them, it's up to Volodymyr Zelensky to decide. 'I would have thought that it's going to be very difficult for anything to be acceptable that stops short of a full return of all the areas taken by the Russians since February 24th this year.' Mr Johnson was asked whether there would be a solution with Putin keeping Crimea and all of the annexed areas. 'Well no frankly,' the former PM said. 'I think Crimea is a slightly separate issue, but again, it's for the Ukrainians, it's not for us to decide.' He added: 'I think that Putin disastrously miscalculated and we kind of, in the UK Government, we all read his crackers essay on Ukraine summer last year, and we could see that he fundamentally misunderstood what Ukraine is. 'It was like reading Slobodan Milošević on the subject of Kosovo. Slobo basically thought Kosovo was an integral part of Greater Serbia and the spiritual homeland, the origins of the Serb nation and I think that's how Putin thought about Kievan Rus' and the origins of the Orthodox faith and all the rest of it, and it's a total category error. 'Ukraine is a free, independent European culture with its own identity and its own ambitions and its own destiny, and he made a fundamental mistake and so he's fighting nationalism.' Mr Johnson added that Putin is 'still overwhelmingly supported by the vast bulk of the Russian people'. 'Yes there's a bit of fraying now in the media coverage and I'm not saying it would be easy for him, but there is a world in which he can say to the Russian people: ""Look, we had a special operation, we needed to de-Nazify Ukraine, we needed to make sure that it wasn't a haven for anti-Russian feeling, that the Russian minorities were treated properly, and that the Russian language was protected, and we've achieved that"",' he said. Asked whether he feared whether Mr Putin could use a 'tactical nuclear weapon' as the conflict moves away from him, the ex-PM replied: 'I don't think he will. I think he'd be crazy to do so. 'I think what would happen is he would immediately tender Russia's resignation from the club of civilised nations. It would be a total disaster for his country. 'The current economic punishment that the West has been able to dish out would be massively intensified. 'Russia would be put into a kind of cryogenic economic freeze. 'And I think he would lose a lot of the middle ground of global tacit acquiescence that's he had. 'If you look at sub-Saharan Africa, if you look at Latin America... look at South Asia, there is a lot of willingness to give Putin the benefit of the doubt. 'That will go the minute he does anything like that. He would also crucially lose the patronage of the Chinese. 'Above all, in his own country, I think he would trigger an absolutely hysterical reaction.' He added: 'I think the crucial thing would be about strategic nuclear deterrence, and the logic of it is that you don't talk about it. But clearly there would have to be a response of some kind.' 'There are all sorts of options that I know we've talked about both in NATO and in the P3, the western nuclear powers have talked about. there would clearly have to be a response, but as I say, I think it's very very very unlikely that it'll come to that. 'I think its important that we don't waste too much time on this conversation because this is exactly how Putin wants to frame it, he wants to frame it as a stand off between a nuclear-armed Russia and a nuclear-armed NATO, and that's how he wants to present it — it's not. 'It's about a brutal invasion of an innocent country by conventional means, and what we are providing is the conventional support that will enable the Ukrainians to win.' When asked how dangerous this moment is, Mr Johnson said it was a 'critical moment for the world, and I think it's a pivotal moment, it's a tuning moment'. 'I think the danger is that we will try to compromise and find some sort of deal, some sort of grubby bargain with Putin encouraging the Ukrainians to trade some of their territory, which will only encourage Putin to make further aggression,' he added. 'The prize for holding firm and continuing to support Ukraine is absolutely immense, because for the first time in decades, we'll have shown that we really believe in democracy and freedom and that we're really willing to support it, to support those values in Europe. 'So a Ukrainian victory could be an absolute turning point for the world.' When asked further about the nuclear threat and how much time he spent worrying Putin would use a nuclear weapon, Mr Johnson said that he didn't want the whole debate to be 'framed in those terms', because '[Putin] wants to spook everybody out with this conversation'. Mr Johnson added: 'I was Foreign Secretary in 2016 and one of the first things I did was go to Ukraine and I remember talking to Ukrainians who had been fighting in Donbas and I remember going to see this great wall, with pictures of thousands and thousands of Ukrainian soldiers who've given their lives for the freedom and independence of their country, and I became very sympathetic to their cause. 'I remember standing on that beautiful acropolis in Kyiv and talking about the possibility that Russia might be so insane as to take advantage of the fact that there was no security guarantee to Ukraine, because Ukraine was not given NATO membership and clearly it was a problem, and that is what we now have to fix.' When pressed on how he felt leaving Downing Street and being out of power, Mr Johnson said that the UK has a 'seamless continuity of policy'. He added: 'Rishi I know had an excellent talk the other night with Volodymyr Zelensky and we are going to continue flat out to support Ukraine and to make sure we give them everything they need.' Mr Johnson said that he talked to a friend in Kyiv last night, adding: 'The lights are out, there is no water, they're having to queue for bottled water, because they're getting these missile attacks on their electricity facilities and it's absolutely inhumane. 'What the Ukrainians now need is more anti-aircraft kit, and ideally they need fixed wing aircraft to take out the drones and the missiles.' Asked if he regrets losing the 'influence and power' of Downing Street due to the 'mistakes' he made, Mr Johnson said: 'The most important thing is to focus not on me or my political career or whatever but to focus on what matters.' When pressed as to whether 'turfing out Prime Ministers' is a good idea during the worst crisis 'since the Second World War', Mr Johnson said: 'I think the important thing is for all of us, particularly in the United States, to remain focused on the needs of the Ukrainian people.' He added: 'The UK... we did play an important part particularly in the beginning but actually throughout, in bringing our friends together, in organising, people donating arms. The crucial thing is in North America.' Asked if he let Ukraine down when he resigned as PM, Mr Johnson said: 'I certainly want to do everything I can to help Ukraine and that's always been my commitment, I've said that to Volodymyr irrespective of whether I'm in office, and I think there are ways I can be useful.' Mr Johnson added that his 'old friend Kevin McCarthy' said the other day that there is no blank cheque for Ukraine. 'I think that actually, when you talk to individual Republicans, they see the vital importance of this struggle,' he said. 'If I can be useful in trying to get over to people why I see this as such an absolutely critical test of Western will, then I think that would be a good thing to do, but it's America that is crucial. America has given so much of the military support, so much of the economic support. 'It's a lot to ask of any country, particularly in tough economic times, and America's been fantastic, and the UK's given a lot as well — a huge amount of money, a huge amount of military assistance.' Asked if he saw the British Government persuading Zelenskyy to do a deal, Mr Johnsons said that he would argue 'passionately against that'. 'I don't think that it's realistic, because there is no deal that Zelenskyy can do, and there's no deal that Putin is offering.' Reflecting on Britain's support to Ukraine, Mr Johnson said: 'We've given a huge amount of financial support and I think the decisive thing that we did was to read it early ad to read it right, partially with the anti-tank weapons on the early days.' He said that while there is a practical limit on what the Government can provide, the Conservatives will continue to be 'very generous'. During the interview, Mr Johnson was asked how worried he was that Russia 'hacked' the phone of the foreign secretary and 'potentially got details of dealings with Ukraine', to which Mr Johnson said that 'we never talk about security issues'. Elsewhere in his Sky News interview, Mr Johnson - who spearheaded Britain's hosting of last year's Cop-26 summit in Glasgow - said he had been 'invited by the Egyptians' to Cop-27 and was 'very happy to go'. The confirmation of his attendance will add to pressure on Mr Sunak to also travel to Sharm El-Sheikh. Downing Street yesterday admitted Mr Sunak could perform a U-turn and travel to Egypt this month, despite initially having said the PM would not be attending Cop-27. This had sparked a backlash among climate campaigners, including claims Mr Sunak was abandoning Britain's global leadership on environmental issues. But No10 subsequently revealed the PM's attendance was now 'under review'. This was due to Mr Sunak and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt having made 'substantial progress' on their plans for the Autumn Statement on 17 November, Downing Street said. No 10 had previously defended Mr Sunak's planned absence from Cop-27 by pointing to his desire to focus on 'other pressing domestic commitments', such as the dire state of the public finances. Mr Johnson also gave his backing to Mr Sunak, insisting the PM had 'a massive amount to do'. 'We've got to sort out a huge agenda - that's what's he's getting on with,' he said. Mr Johnson spoke of his 'particular interest' in attending 'Cop-27', adding: 'I was at the Glasgow Cop - although it's become unfashionable to talk about it, was a fantastic global success. 'We did a huge amount of good for the planet, I want to talk a little bit about how I see things and how we see things in the UK.' US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron are among other world leaders expected to attend Cop-27."
2022-11-01,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11377825/Vladimir-Putin-DOES-Parkinsons-pancreatic-cancer-leaked-Kremlin-spy-documents-claim.html,"Vladimir Putin 'DOES have Parkinson's and pancreatic cancer, leaked Kremlin spy documents claim'","Vladimir Putin does have early stage Parkinson's disease and pancreatic cancer, leaked spy documents have alleged in the latest unverified claim about the tyrant's ill health. The Russian leader has been plagued with rumours about his illnesses for months and he has regularly appeared twitching and unsteady in public, sparking hope in Ukraine and the West the despot could soon relinquish power. Claims have been circulating among opposition figures, fuelled by his unexplained absences and his shaky public appearances, that he is battling serious health problems but they have always been rubbished by the Kremlin. But now emails from a Russian intelligence source appear to confirm the 70-year-old has been diagnosed with cancer and Parkinson's, according to The Sun. The leaked documents allegedly read: 'I can confirm he has been diagnosed with early stage Parkinson's disease, but it's already progressing. This fact will be denied in every possible way and hidden. November 2012: Business trips and long-distance flights of the president are canceled, some of Putin's meetings shown by the Kremlin turn out to be 'canned food' March 5 – 15, 2015: Putin does not appear in public, all meetings are 'canned' - in other words pre-recorded events were shown with the pretense they were in real time August 9-16, 2017: The President, with journalists, visits Abkhazia and Sochi, and then for a week the Kremlin publishes only 'canned food' February 2018: In the midst of an election campaign, the president cancels public events. Peskov admits that the head of state 'had a cold' September 13-29, 2021: Putin goes into 'self-isolation', all events are held via video link 'Putin is regularly stuffed with all kinds of heavy steroids and innovative painkilling injections to stop the spread of pancreatic cancer he was recently diagnosed with. 'It not only causes a lot of pain, Putin has a state of puffiness of the face and other side effects - including memory lapses. 'In his close circle, there are rumours that in addition to pancreatic cancer, which is gradually spreading, Putin also has prostate cancer.' The tyrant was recently spotted with apparent track marks from IV treatment on the back of his hand, adding further fuel to the fire. Telegram channel General SVR has long been pushing the claims that Putin is suffering from cancer and Parkinson's. Last week, it reported that the despot's relatives are concerned about coughing fits, constant nausea and a lack of appetite, after he allegedly underwent a medical examination. His circle is worried that his 'thinness and persistent cough' is becoming noticeable and will be seen by elites in Russia as a 'sign of the leader's rapidly deteriorating health'. Despite appearing considerably bloated and puffy in the face, the Russian president has lost 18lb in recent months, said the channel which purports to have sources inside the Kremlin. Ever since Putin ordered his military forces to invade Ukraine on February 24, rumours have been swirling about the state of his health. Rumours have been circling for years that Vladimir Putin is suffering from health problems, and they have intensified since he launched his brutal invasion of Ukraine. Critics and Kremlin sources have indicated he may be suffering from cancer and Parkinson's, supported by footage showing the leader shaking uncontrollably and gripping a table for support. He has also disappeared from the public eye for weeks at a time, with suggestions he is undergoing surgery. Valery Solovey, professor at Moscow State Institute of Foreign Affairs first hinted at Putin's health problems, saying in 2020 he had undergone surgery for cancer. Another unnamed source suggested the operation was on Putin's abdomen. He said: 'One is of a psycho-neurological nature, the other is a cancer problem. 'If anyone is interested in the exact diagnosis, I'm not a doctor, and I have no ethical right to reveal these problems. 'The second diagnosis is a lot, lot more dangerous than the first named diagnosis as Parkinson's does not threaten physical state, but just limits public appearances. 'Based on this information people will be able to make a conclusion about his life horizon, which wouldn't even require specialist medical education.' The Kremlin has consistently denied there is anything wrong with Putin's health. Others have previously noted his 'gunslinger's gait' – a clearly reduced right arm swing compared to his left, giving him a lilting swagger. An asymmetrically reduced arm swing is a classic feature of Parkinson's and can manifest in 'clinically intact subjects with a predisposition to later develop' the disease, according to the British Medical Journal. In February, Putin was seen with a shaking hand as he firmly gripped the side of his chair for support. The clip, which was taken on February 18, just before the onset of his invasion of Ukraine, shows him welcoming fellow strongman Alexander Lukashenko at the Kremlin. He pulls his trembling hand into his body in an attempt to quell the shakes, but then he almost stumbles as he unsteadily walks towards the Belarusian leader. Later, Putin sits on a chair but is unable to remain still, constantly fidgeting and tapping his feet while he grips on to the arm for support. In a meeting with defence minister Sergei Shoigu, Putin's poor posture and his apparently bloated face and neck fuelled the speculation. Video showed Putin speaking to Shoigu whilst gripping the edge of the table with his right hand - so hard that it appears white - and tapping his foot consistently. He has since been seen limping and shaking his hands and legs, further bolstering the rumours. He has been seen uncontrollably shaking, gripping tables and chairs for support, and appeared bloated and ill-at-ease. The president has also frequently disappeared from the public eye for weeks at a time in recent years amid rumours he is undergoing surgery. Over the summer, the Russian president was pictured awkwardly swatting mosquitos from his face with one arm while the other hung limply by his side. Similarly, at a huge Victory Day parade in Moscow in May, the now 70-year-old autocrat appeared to walk with a limp and had a blanket over his lap, while in April he was seen gripping a table in a televised meeting with his defence minister Sergei Shoigu. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also quashed any health rumours about Putin as 'nothing but fakes'. The General SVR channel has long claimed that Putin is suffering from abdominal cancer, Parkinson's disease and a schizoaffective disorder. Its claims cannot be verified but it was among the first to report in advance the shape of Putin's recent mobilisation strategy. The channel is reportedly authored by an exiled Kremlin lieutenant-general, known by the alias Viktor Mikhailovich. Meanwhile in Ukraine today, Russia ordered the evacuation of tens of thousands of civilians in Ukraine, raising fears of a massive escalation of the war. Up to 70,000 residents in the Russian-controlled eastern bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson have been told to flee their homes because of imminent danger. The region's Kremlin-backed leader warned Ukraine is preparing to detonate a 'dirty bomb' or carry out a missile strike on the nearby hydroelectric station to deliberately flood the area. But the dire warnings have raised fears that Russia will carry out those attacks after previous false flag threats. Ukraine says the evacuations represent a war crime because civilians are being forcibly deported from occupied territory. Russia, which claims to have annexed the area, says it is taking civilians to safety because of a threat Ukraine might use unconventional weapons. Russia had previously ordered civilians out of a pocket it controls on the west bank of the river, where Ukrainian forces have been advancing to capture the city of Kherson. But now the order has been extended to the eastern bank due to the latest threats. 'Due to the possibility of the use of prohibited methods of war by the Ukrainian regime, as well as information that Kyiv is preparing a massive missile strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, there is an immediate danger of the Kherson region being flooded,' Vladimir Saldo, Russian-installed head of occupied Kherson province, said in a video message. 'Given the situation, I have decided to expand the evacuation zone by 15 km from the Dnipro,' he said. 'The decision will make it possible to create a layered defence in order to repel Ukrainian attacks and protect civilians.' Kyiv has denied it plans to attack the Kakhovka dam, a 100 ft high, two-mile-long facility and unleash a reservoir the size of the Great Salt Lake across southern Ukraine, flooding towns and villages, several of which Russian forces seized at the start of the war. Ukraine said repeated Russian claims that Ukraine is preparing an attack on the dam, which regulates water supplies to the annexed Crimean peninsula and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, were a sign that Russia itself was considering staging an attack and blaming it on Kyiv and its Western supporters. Moscow has also accused Kyiv of planning to use a so-called 'dirty bomb' to spread radiation, or to blow up a dam to flood towns and villages in Kherson province. Kyiv says accusations it would use such tactics on its own territory are absurd, but that Russia might be planning such actions itself to blame Ukraine. In similar brazen claims today, Moscow accused Britain of coordinating attacks on the Nord Stream gas pipes. Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin's spokesman, said Kremlin intelligence agents 'have data indicating British military specialists were directing and coordinating the attack' which destroyed two gas lines running from Russia to Germany in September. It comes after Kim Dotcom, who ran site Megaupload before he was convicted of fraud, began circulating a conspiracy theory that Liz Truss had texted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately after the attack saying 'it's done'. Kim claimed to have learned of the message from Truss's iCloud, after it was revealed that Russia hacked her phone while she was foreign secretary. Neither Kim nor Peskov have released the evidence they claim to have seen. But the accusation represents a new line of attack from Russia at the US and Britain, which have led support for Ukraine in resisting Putin's invasion. London has rejected the claims. Experts from the United Nations' nuclear power agency inspected two sites in Ukraine on Tuesday that Russia identified in unfounded claims that Ukrainian authorities planned to set off the dirty bombs. International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said the inspections for evidence of a so-called dirty bomb, requested by Kyiv in the wake of the unsubstantiated Russian allegations, would be completed soon. In the wake of battlefield setbacks for Russia in its war in Ukraine, top Russian officials including Putin, made unsubstantiated accusations that Ukraine was manufacturing such an explosive device, which scatters radioactive waste. The Russians, without providing evidence, alleged the Ukrainians planned to make the purported bomb look like Russia's doing. Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, alleged in a letter to Security Council members last week that Ukraine's nuclear research facility and mining company 'received direct orders from Zelensky's regime to develop such a dirty bomb.' Western nations have called Moscow's repeated claim 'transparently false.' Ukrainian authorities dismissed it as an attempt to distract attention from Moscow's own alleged plans to detonate a dirty bomb as a way to justify a further escalation of hostilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said the investigated sites 'are under IAEA safeguards and have been visited regularly by IAEA inspectors,' whose mission is detecting undeclared nuclear activities and materials related to the development of dirty bombs. 'The IAEA inspected one of the two locations a month ago and no undeclared nuclear activities or materials were found there,' the agency said in a statement Monday. The U.N.'s atomic energy watchdog also has had on-site monitors at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Fighting around near Europe's largest nuclear power station has created worries of a possibly catastrophic leak there. The mouth of the wide Dnipro River has also become one of the most consequential frontlines in the war in recent weeks, with Ukrainian forces advancing to expel Russian troops from their only pocket on the west bank. Russia has thousands of troops there and has been trying to reinforce the area. Ukraine's advance has slowed in recent days, with commanders citing weather and tougher terrain. Saldo, the Russian-imposed occupation leader for the province, identified seven towns on the east bank that would now be evacuated, comprising the main populated settlements along that stretch of the river. The European Union accused Moscow on Tuesday of launching a new programme to illegally conscript men in Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014, to fight in its forces. The EU statement said Moscow was disproportionately conscripting members of Crimea's indigenous Tatar minority to fight in its war. Russia, which launched its 'special military operation' in Ukraine in February, has announced it has completed a mobilisation drive ordered in September by President Vladimir Putin, saying it had called up 300,000 reservists and more were not needed. But Putin has not issued a decree ending the mobilisation, raising concern he could restart it without notice. A senior Russian ruling party senator said on Tuesday a decree formally ending the mobilisation was not needed. Thousands of Russian men have fled abroad to escape conscription to a conflict which has killed thousands, displaced millions, shaken the global economy and reopened Cold War-era divisions. Just north of Kherson, Russia fired four missiles into the Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv overnight, demolishing half an apartment building. Reuters saw rescue workers recover the body of an elderly woman from the rubble. As rush hour was under way, passersby walked past a two-storey school, the front of which had been torn off by the force of the blast that left a massive crater. 'This is what the barbarian horde does,' said Irena Siden, 48, the school's deputy director, standing in front of the gutted building as workers began sweeping up the rubble. 'They (the Russians) are the descendants of the barbarian horde. They stole our history and how they are trying to steal our culture.' Russia fired a huge volley of missiles at Ukrainian cities on Monday in what Putin called retaliation for an attack on Russia's Black Sea Fleet at the weekend. Ukraine said it shot most of those missiles down, but some had hit power stations, knocking out electricity and water supplies. Kyiv forces also shot down two Russian attack helicopters in just three minutes in another blow to Putin's botched invasion. Anti-aircraft gunners hit the Ka-52 Alligators in the southern Kherson region yesterday evening, Ukraine's Air Force said. The £12million single-seat attack helicopter is nicknamed the Black Shark and has been described as Russia's 'deadliest helicopter'. Its battlefield management system allows it to share data with other aircraft to coordinate attack operations. It came weeks after Ukrainian troops shot down four Russian helicopters in 18 minutes. Ukraine also blew up a Mi-8 helicopter gunship in Donetsk after a surface-to-air missile picked it out of the sky yesterday. Footage shows the Russian attack helicopter flying low across a field before it is hit by a missile which explodes on impact - but the chopper continues to fly for some time with flames gushing out of its left side. The helicopter begins emitting black smoke and then comes crashing down in a fireball in a field, rolling on to its roof as its rotor breaks off. The images were obtained from the 54th Separate Mechanised Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Monday, along with statement saying that the images were filmed on the 'administrative borders of Luhansk and Donetsk regions'. They added: 'Somehow a Russian helicopter flew in to bring death to Ukrainian families, but the sky is tightly controlled by the glorious soldiers of the anti-aircraft missile division of the 54th Separate Mechanised Brigade. 'The soldiers saw a foreign ""bird"" in the sky and did what had to be done - they ""destroyed the harmful fly"" together with its crew.' They signed off with 'Glory to Ukraine!' Last month Ukraine carried off a similar rampage, downing four helicopters in 18 minutes in the country's south. The helicopters - presumed to be Soviet-era KA-52 models - were taken down by Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units. During his evening address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said the country's forces had shot down 45 of 55 cruise missiles on Monday, and a Ka-52 alligator was downed. 'Today our air forces and everyone involved in protecting the skies did a great job,' said Zelensky. 'Most of the objects that the terrorists identified as targets were saved.' Ukraine claims Russia has now lost about 72,470 personnel, 2,698 tanks, 5,501 armoured combat vehicles, 1,730 artillery units, 383 multiple launch rocket systems, 197 air defence systems, 276 warplanes, 257 helicopters, 1,415 drones, 397 cruise missiles, 16 warships, 4,143 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, and 154 units of special equipment. Russia has claimed that its casualties have been much lower but provides infrequent updates on its latest figures."
2022-11-01,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11377539/Russia-claims-British-PM-texted-Blinken-shortly-Nord-Stream-pipeline-explosion.html,US slams Russia's 'ridiculous' claims with 'no factual basis' that British PM Liz Truss sent a text to Antony Blinken saying 'it's done' after the Nord Stream pipeline explosion,"The State Department slammed Russia's 'baseless' accusation that Britain and the U.S. of conspiring to blow up the Nord Stream gas pipes, claiming former Prime Minister Liz Truss texted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken after the explosion saying 'it's done.' 'Russia’s baseless accusations against the United Kingdom, and before that the United States, are just another attempt to distract from their brutal war against Ukraine,' State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement to DailyMail.com. 'These ridiculous claims have no factual basis. Russia has a long history of spreading disinformation and it is doing so again here.' Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that Kremlin intelligence agents are in possession of data indicating British military specialists 'were directing and coordinating the attack' that destroyed two gas lines running from Russia to Germany in September. Peskov has not released any evidence to back up the claim. The claim comes after Kim Dotcom, who ran website Megaupload before he was convicted of fraud, began circulating the conspiracy that Truss had texted Blinken 'it's done' after the attack. He claims the information came from Truss's iCloud after Russia hacked her phone while she was foreign secretary. Russia's claims appear inconsistent with what is known about Truss's phone hack, which was first reported by the UK Mail on Sunday. According to the paper, the hack was discovered 'over the summer' while Truss was still foreign secretary and in the running to replace Boris Johnson as Prime Minister. The pipe blast did not occur until September 26, more than two weeks after the contest concluded with Truss declared the victor. While the public did not learn about the hack until recently, the Mail on Sunday reports those in government did know about it and decided to hush it up. It seems highly unlikely that Truss would have been allowed to keep using the phone for weeks after the breach was uncovered. Nonetheless, Kim's claim about Truss's iPhone was also picked up and parroted by Maria Zakharova, spokesman for Russia's foreign ministry, who demanded answers. 'Frankly, I don't care who got this information or how,' she said. 'I am interested in London's response to the following question: 'Did British Prime Minister Liz Truss send a message to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the immediate aftermath of the bombing of the Nord Stream pipeline saying ""It's done?""' The State Department could not immediately be reached for comment on the allegations, and the UK government has yet to respond. Western leaders have stopped short of publicly blaming Russia for the attack - which blew two holes in Nord Stream I and II and may have permanently disabled them - but have privately been briefing their suspicions that Putin was behind it. Ukraine came out and publicly claimed Russia was behind the 'terrorist attack' which spiked gas prices. Russia and President Putin have repeatedly denied carrying out attacks on the Nord Stream pipes, pointing the finger of blame at the US. Nord Stream 2 was due to become the main route for Russian gas reaching Europe but was scrapped by Germany when Putin invaded. Nord Stream 1 had been operating for a decade and ferried huge amounts of gas to the continent, which it relied upon for almost 40 per cent of its energy. However, it was barely in use at the time of the explosion after Russia throttled supplies to just 10 per cent capacity - blaming maintenance issues. Nobody is sure exactly how the attack was carried out, but theories include that Russia may have used one of its underwater sabotage submarines to carry it out. Three thousand-foot wide plumes of oil leaked out into the Baltic Sea, causing significant environmental damage."
2022-11-01,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11376421/National-Grid-chief-warns-potential-blackouts-winter-Met-Office-warns-colder-winter.html,Britain braces for blackouts as Met Office warns of much COLDER winter: National Grid chief insists 'it's not time to panic' but admits 'rolling power cuts ARE a possibility' if energy supplies run low,"Britons are being told to brace for blackouts this winter if energy supplies run low - while weather experts warn of the potential for a colder-than-usual winter. UK energy bosses warn short rolling power cuts are a possibility this winter, as Vladimir Putin's tactical tightening of gas pipelines in Europe starts to bite. The warning comes from John Pettigrew, the boss of the National Grid, who also believes British households will find the upcoming winter 'financially very, very hard'. To make matters worse, weather experts at the Met Office are now warning of an increased chance of a colder-than-usual winter this year. This could further up demand on gas and electricity supplies, as Britons turn up the heat to keep their homes warm. In one sign of hope, Mr Pettigrew today attempted to calm fears the UK could run out of gas and electricity this winter. He said it was the National Grid's 'base case' assumption was that the UK would have enough energy supplies to meet heating and lighting demand this winter. But he added that short rolling power cuts were a possibility. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'There could be energy shortfalls in the UK and we will manage that very carefully.' Russia is plotting to strike a key gas pipeline between the UK and Norway to punish Britain over its support for Ukraine and leave households in the cold this winter. Senior military and intelligence sources told the Mail that Moscow could try and sabotage the Langeled pipeline that provides one-fifth of the country’s gas demand. The Kremlin has repeatedly weaponised energy supplies to Europe since it invaded Ukraine, slashing deliveries to the EU in response to sanctions. A series of unexplained leaks to energy connections under the Baltic Sea, including Germany’s controversial Nord Stream projects, are believed to be the work of Russian saboteurs. Any strike on Langeled would be a further squeeze on supplies to the UK and Europe. Sabotage is the next step if they want to escalate by attacking Britain’s critical energy infrastructure because we are so fragile,’ said one NATO source. ‘And it’s no coincidence that Britain has been one of Ukraine’s biggest backers.’ Both the British and Norwegian governments have spoken about a general threat to North Sea energy infrastructure in the past. But officials in Oslo and London have refused to be drawn on specific targets. Another NATO official who works directly on threats to critical infrastructure said the 725-mile-long Langeled pipeline is an ‘obvious target.’ However he said it was 'not time for people to panic', adding: 'What we're doing is making sure that the infrastructure that we have and the networks are robust and ready for the winter, and I've got thousands of engineers making sure that the network is ready for whatever weather we see over the winter.' Mr Pettigrew said the National Grid was working on a number of emergency plans to protect the UK against an energy shortfall from Europe. Gas supplies had already been disrupted post-Covid lockdowns, as countries battled to resupply for the big restart, leading to a huge increase demand and subsequently prices. And this has been compounded by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with gas supplies from Russia being limited to Europe. Although the UK gets much of its gas from other countries, and gets nearly 40 per cent of its energy from gas, it is still impacted by the disruption to the European energy price market. Mr Pettigrew told the BBC that one emergency option to help power Britain this winter if fuel supplies drop is to restart mothballed coal-fired power stations. The UK is already looking at delaying the closure of part of a coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire due to fears about energy. Mr Pettigrew added: 'The next step would be to pay households and businesses to reduce consumption during peak times, with short rolling regional outages a last resort. 'If we saw that shortfall coming, the most effective way to manage the rest of the network is to ask the distribution companies to reduce demand and they would do that over that rolling period of around 4 to 7pm.' It comes as the Met Office has published its latest three-month long forecast - which covers this month, December and January. The Met Office warns that the chance of a colder three month period overall is 'slightly greater than normal' - by around 1.3 times. It means there is a 60 per cent chance of a normal winter, a 25 per cent chance of a cold winter and a 15 per cent chance of a mild winter. The Met Office also warns of a higher possibility of a slightly calmer winter in terms of wind - also by around 1.3 times. A calmer winter in terms of wind could impact on the ability to fill energy shortfalls with extra wind power capacity. The prediction comes from the Met Office's three-month forecast, which is used for emergency planning. The forecast itself does not look at day to day weather or spells, but at the weather overall over three month period. According to the Met Office, its prediction of a higher possibility of a slightly colder winter comes from its tracking of global weather patterns, including El Nina. It says the weather phenomenon this year could bring colder spells, particularly when combined with other long term patterns over the Indian Ocean. Exact times YOUR house would face winter blackouts are REVEALED: Official plans show which set of three-hour electricity cuts each home will face - if Britain's lights go out due to energy crisis By Matt Powell for MailOnline Official Government documents reveal a plan for UK households to have three-hour blackouts at least three times a week if Russian president Vladimir Putin restricts gas supplies to Europe this winter. There have been warnings that Russia, which is accused of sabotaging the Nord Stream pipelines, may cut its gas supply and use the colder months as a weapon against the West over its support for Ukraine. While the UK does not rely on imported gas from Russia, it would be heavily impacted as we import large amounts of electricity and gas from European countries that do. The Electricity Supply Emergency Code (ESEC) allows the Prime Minister to introduce rolling power cuts across the country in an effort to conserve electricity. It comes as National Grid chief John Pettigrew said blackouts could occur on particularly cold nights in January and February if electricity generators did not have enough gas. Here, MailOnline shows you exactly when your household would be affected by power cuts and for how long. The ESEC aims to provide an equal distribution of electricity to customers 'as far as reasonably practicable' in the case of shortages. The document states there are three methods that would be implemented to reduce energy consumption. First you need to find which 'load block' you live in. This should appear on your energy bills as a letter in a square box. Although not every energy company provides this information on bills. It will be between A and U, letters F, I and O are not used. You can find your load block letter on the blackout chart. The chart will show which days three-hour blackouts will occur for you and exactly what times. The first is direct appeals to the public and industry to reduce their electricity demand. The second is placing restrictions on industrial electricity consumption - for example requiring companies to reduce consumption by a certain percentage. The final option is 'rota disconnections', or rolling blackouts for households. Energy in the UK is provided by a number of suppliers that divide their distribution networks into 18 'load blocks' - which work in a similar way to postcodes. Each of these load blocks is assigned a letter between A and U, though the letters F, I and O are not used. You can find which block you live in by looking for a letter, often boxed, on your energy bills. But not every energy provider prints load blocks on bills - if this is the case for you, you can try calling them directly to find out. Knowing your load block letter will allow you to find out when blackouts would affect you. It is based on where you live and how your electricity is supplied - potentially meaning properties close to yours would not experience a blackout at the same time as you. The areas are spread across the country, so customers with the same load block letter across the UK would be affected at the same time. Each day of the week is split into eight three-hour slots, with the first slot of the day starting at 12.30am. The rota is designed to let businesses operate as normally as possible for three days in succession. This means that power cuts are concentrated between Monday and Wednesday or Thursday and Saturday, with Sunday being shared between all blocks. Level 1 The first level of rolling blackouts would hit houses three times a week, four for some load blocks. The distribution is spread so that most cuts are at the start or the end of the week. Level 2 The rota still tries to keep blackouts close together but the number doubles from the previous level, with houses going without power around six times a week. Level 3 The third level increases the number of three-hour powers cuts by three again - meaning households will experience 27 hours a week without any electricity. And here’s what could happen if the power situation gets worse…. Below are more ESEC graphs showing how energy suppliers would have to respond to increasing levels of shortages. There are 18 levels of 'rota disconnections' which each gradually increase the frequency of power cuts - level 9 is the first where houses will spend more time without power than with it. The final graph depicts the extremely unlikely worst-case scenario of a 'total shutdown' where there is no energy supply at all. The document specifies that there are 'protected sites' which would not be affected by rolling blackouts. Hospitals, food manufacturers, oil refineries, some ports, financial services, essential water and sewerage installations, major airports and digital and telecommunication services would not be affected. The document says: 'All protected sites are expected to, as far as is reasonably practicable, reduce load broadly in line with the level of disconnections applied to non-protected sites.' But if energy supply becomes extremely sparse, protected sites may be ordered to reduce their consumption to the minimum load necessary for the avoidance of damage. In the event of electricity supplies being insufficient to meet the needs of all the protected sites, network operators may need to 'exercise discretion' in allocating available electricity supplies. The ESEC says in such cases, priority should be given to the 'maintenance of life' and 'minimising the risk of disasters'. The BBC has reportedly prepared a series of secret scripts to be read out on air in case of blackouts this winter. The scripts would advise the public to use car radios or battery-powered devices to tune into emergency BBC broadcasts via FM frequencies and would seek to keep the public informed in the event of a 'major loss of power', The Guardian reported. One script seen by a Guardian reporter allegedly warns that a blackout could last for up to two days, with hospitals and police placed under 'extreme pressure'. Another says: 'The government has said it's hoped power will be restored in the next 36 to 48 hours.' The texts are said to have been produced as part of the BBC's role in broadcasting vital health and safety communications to the public on behalf of the government in the event of national emergencies. National Grid meanwhile is setting up a scheme that will pay households and companies for reducing their demand during periods of limited supply. A Government spokesman said: 'The UK has a secure and diverse energy system. 'To strengthen this position further, we have put plans in place to secure supply and National Grid, working alongside energy suppliers and [energy watchdog] Ofgem, will launch a voluntary service to reward users who reduce demand at peak times.' But Britons are already preparing for the worst-case scenario by stocking up on portable generators and torches in addition to winter clothing, thermal underwear and candles, according to industry reports. National Grid has warned that there could be blackouts this winter if gas power plants are not able to keep running due to the energy crisis. The electricity systems operator said it is still unlikely but winter could see the first planned blackouts, which the grid calls rota load shedding, since the 1970s. But why might blackouts happen this year - who will be impacted and what can be done to avoid them? Why would a grid ever plan blackouts? Engineers working on the energy grid need to make sure it is 'balanced' at all times. This means that the amount of electricity being put into the grid by power plants, wind farms and others should match the amount being taken out by households and businesses at any given time. The grid plans for when it thinks demand can be high so it can ask generators to meet that demand. But if there is ever an imbalance where demand is higher than supply or supply is higher than demand, it can cause major breakdowns in the grid. That could cause actual physical damage to the grid that could take days to repair. If the engineers know there will not be enough supply to match demand, sometimes they need to reduce demand by planned outages to avoid major damage. Why might blackouts be necessary this winter? Britain has one of the most reliable power networks in the world and unless cables are cut by storms or other accidents outages are rare. But this winter, generators might not be able to get enough gas to keep running. The grid said that if this happens - it still thinks that is 'unlikely' - then it might have to cut power to some households and businesses. Who will be affected by blackouts and who gets cut off first? If the grid realises that it has to cut off some parts of the country, it will issue a warning to the local and regional distributors saying how much demand needs to be cut. It will be up to these so-called distribution network operators (DNO) to decide who gets cut off and who does not. But the DNOs have limited control so most of the time it will be whole areas that are impacted. How can we avoid blackouts? If the blackouts are caused by a lack of supply, then the only way is to reduce demand at particular times. Most demand happens during peak hours of between around 4pm and 7pm when people get home from work, put the kettle on, switch on their ovens and sit down to watch TV. The overall amount of electricity people use does not have to reduce if they just change their usage to other times of the day. For instance, electric cars could be unplugged during these hours, switching the dishwasher could wait until 9pm and you could put the washing machine on earlier in the day or during the weekend. The grid and energy suppliers will launch a new system in November to pay people if they change the time that they use energy. The Government could also step in to ration peoples' energy use or advise them to use less, similar to a hosepipe ban, but so far it has ruled this out."
2022-11-01,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11374411/Missing-ABC-producer-James-Gordon-Meek-seen-public-time-FBI-raid.html,EXCLUSIVE: 'Missing' ABC producer James Gordon Meek is seen for the first time since he went into hiding in April – but refuses to answer questions on mysterious FBI raid on his penthouse that brought his storied career to an abrupt halt,"'Missing' ABC producer James Gordon Meek has emerged from hiding – but refuses to discuss the mysterious FBI raid that brought his storied journalism career to an abrupt halt. Meek, an Emmy winner and celebrated investigative reporter, resigned from the network just hours after heavily-armed agents swooped on his penthouse apartment in Arlington, Virginia in April. DailyMail.com can exclusively reveal that Meek also ducked out of a glittering award ceremony held one week later where he was due to collect a prize for his coverage of Joe Biden's chaotic military withdrawal from Afghanistan. Instead, the 53-year-old news veteran contacted stunned organizers at the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation to tell them he couldn't accept. Meek's pals say he's been AWOL for the past six months after he packed his stuff and moved out of his upscale digs at the six-story Siena Park building in the wake of the raid. 'I sent him a text to ask if he was OK. He said he wasn't able to talk about what was going on, on the advice of his lawyer,' a confused friend told DailyMail.com. 'That's the last I heard from him.' Meek was similarly reluctant to speak when DailyMail.com finally spotted him Thursday at his elderly mom's townhouse in McLean, Virginia, 15 minutes outside Washington, D.C.. The divorced dad-of-two appeared to be keeping a low profile, parking his Chevy SUV several blocks from the property and ignoring questions as he slipped inside via a back door. He was still wearing his typical military-style getup, including an army field jacket with an Afghan flag patch, backpack, aviator shades and a keffiyeh scarf – a nod to Meek's celebrated dispatches from the frontline in Afghanistan. The April 27 swoop sparked fears Meek was being targeted for his trailblazing journalism which has exposed shocking military cover-ups, friendly fire deaths and foiled terror plots. 'Independent observers believe the raid is among the first – and quite possibly, the first – to be carried out on a journalist by the Biden administration,' read a bombshell report in Rolling Stone. The magazine alleged that agents spent ten minutes inside Meek's top-floor pad and found a laptop containing classified information, citing 'sources familiar with the matter' – but friends and former colleagues of the popular, well-regarded reporter say that doesn't add up. They point out that ABC has not made any legal intervention, nor voiced its support for the star correspondent, who is said to have cited 'personal reasons' for abruptly quitting after nine successful years at the alphabet network. 'If he did have anything like that, classified documents or similar materials, that would presumably be for a story he was working on,' said a former colleague. 'This is a guy who has done a lot of good in the world. ABC would be firmly in his corner if it was for legitimate journalism. None of it adds up.' The Department of Justice has not disclosed its reason for targeting Meek but – in an unusual step – Dena Iverson, principal deputy director in the DOJ's Office of Public Affairs, released a statement insisting that agents had acted lawfully. 'While the department cannot speak to any specific case or activity, the Department strictly adheres to the Attorney General's July 2021 memorandum prohibiting the use of compulsory process with regards to members of the news media acting within the scope of newsgathering activities,' she told the Daily Beast. The policy was brought in last year by the Biden administration to prohibit feds from seizing materials from reporters without authorization from the deputy attorney general. The Department of Justice did not respond to multiple emails from DailyMail.com asking for an update on Meek's case. Previous presidents including Trump and Obama had been accused of secretly targeting journalists and their sources. There are, however, several exceptions included in the policy, such as when a journalist is suspected of working for a foreign power or a terror group. Meek built his reputation at the New York Daily News where his five-year investigation forced military brass to admit that Army Private First Class David Sharrett II was shot by his own commanding officer. He served as senior counterterrorism advisor to the chairman of the US House Homeland Security committee before joining Disney-owned ABC in 2013 where his team won an Emmy for their documentary on the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. Meek's recent work includes 3212 Un-Redacted, a feature-length Hulu documentary revealing how the Pentagon covered up a botched 2017 mission in Niger, West Africa, in which four Green Berets were killed by ISIS insurgents. Earlier this year he was announced as the recipient of a World Press Freedom Award at the James W. Foley Freedom awards recognizing his extensive reporting on the Afghan pullout and his efforts to help Afghan allies and their families escape from the Taliban. 'James Gordon Meek is a towering 6'7"", gregarious punk rock art student-turned investigative reporter,' read a promotional profile which has since been scrubbed from the internet. 'James is known for news scoops such as the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and the hostage rescue of an American in Nigeria, as well as his deep dive investigations of friendly fire incidents, military cover-ups and cases of Americans held hostage by terrorist groups and rogue regimes.' There was no reference to Meek however when the award ceremony – named in honor of journalist James Foley who was murdered by ISIS – took place at the National Press Club on May 4. 'The James W. Foley Legacy Foundation had planned to honor James Gordon Meek with its 2022 World Press Freedom Award for his years of foreign correspondence and his efforts to evacuate Afghan special operators and their families after the fall of Afghanistan in August 2021,' a spokeswoman told DailyMail.com. 'Mr. Meek noted he would not be able to accept and we withdrew the honor. The James W. Foley Legacy Foundation has no knowledge of or comment on current reported allegations regarding Mr. Meek.' Around the same time Meek suddenly ended his involvement in a book he was co-writing with Lt. Col. Scott Mann, a retired Green Beret, entitled Operation Pineapple Express: The Incredible Story of a Group of Americans Who Undertook One Last Mission and Honored a Promise in Afghanistan. Meek previewed the book on social media and the first sentence on its jacket read: 'In April, ABC News correspondent James Gordon Meek got an urgent call from a Special Forces operator serving overseas.' When it came out in August Lt. Col. Mann was listed as its sole author and the line had changed to: 'In April, an urgent call was placed from a Special Forces operator serving overseas.' Mann told Rolling Stone: 'He contacted me in the spring, and was really distraught, and told me that he had some serious personal issues going on and that he needed to withdraw from the project. 'As a guy who's a combat veteran who has seen that kind of strain – I don't know what it was – I honored it. And he went on his way, and I continued on the project.' Friends told DailyMail.com there were no outward signs of unrest in Meek's life before he cut them off. They described him as a highly-driven individual but said he was popular, outgoing and widely respected by rivals on the national security beat. He never touched drugs and drank socially, but not to excess, said one. 'There are certain red flags you might look for if someone is going off the rails. One of those might be failing to hold down a job but James had been at ABC for almost a decade' the pal told DailyMail.com. 'He's a good person, he maintained important relationships. It just seemed like James was doing the best work of his life. 'He was finally getting the recognition he deserved. That's why none of this makes sense.' Meek had lived on Columbia Pike, scene of the raid, for the previous decade after divorcing Jessica Lenard, 49, a former US Senate and House staffer with whom he has two girls, aged 15 and 19. Their ten-year marriage ended acrimoniously as Lenard accused her then-spouse of having an extra-marital affair in a 2011 filing. Meek responded by alleging that she was abusive towards him, on one occasion 'punching him in the testicles' and 'striking him repeatedly in the chest with her fists' when he wouldn't agree to a divorce. The split was finalized in November 2012 and Meek continued to have a close relationship with his two daughters, according to friends. Eugene Gorokhov, Meek's attorney, did not respond to a request for comment. In earlier remarks, reported by Rolling Stone, he said: 'Mr Meek is unaware of what allegations anonymous sources are making about his possession of classified documents. 'If such documents exist, as claimed, this would be within the scope of Mr. Meek's long career as an investigative journalist covering government wrongdoing. 'Press inquiries on this issue are troubling for a different reason: they appear to be based on statements from a source inside the government. 'It is highly inappropriate, and illegal, for individuals in the government to leak information about an ongoing investigation.'"
2022-11-01,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11377205/Russia-orders-tens-thousands-civilians-evacuate-Kherson-raising-fears-dirty-bomb.html,"Russia orders tens of thousands civilians to evacuate Kherson, raising fears Putin's men will detonate 'dirty bomb' or blow up dam and flood towns in the region in false flag attack","Russia has ordered the evacuation of tens of thousands of civilians in Ukraine, raising fears of a massive escalation of the war. Up to 70,000 residents in the Russian-controlled eastern bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson have been told to flee their homes because of imminent danger. The region's Kremlin-backed leader warned Ukraine is preparing to detonate a 'dirty bomb' or carry out a missile strike on the nearby hydroelectric station to deliberately flood the area. But the dire warnings have raised fears that Russia will carry out those attacks after previous false flag threats. Ukraine says the evacuations represent a war crime because civilians are being forcibly deported from occupied territory. Russia, which claims to have annexed the area, says it is taking civilians to safety because of a threat Ukraine might use unconventional weapons. Russia had previously ordered civilians out of a pocket it controls on the west bank of the river, where Ukrainian forces have been advancing to capture the city of Kherson. But now the order has been extended to the eastern bank due to the latest threats. 'Due to the possibility of the use of prohibited methods of war by the Ukrainian regime, as well as information that Kyiv is preparing a massive missile strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, there is an immediate danger of the Kherson region being flooded,' Vladimir Saldo, Russian-installed head of occupied Kherson province, said in a video message. 'Given the situation, I have decided to expand the evacuation zone by 15 km from the Dnipro,' he said. 'The decision will make it possible to create a layered defence in order to repel Ukrainian attacks and protect civilians.' Kyiv has denied it plans to attack the Kakhovka dam, a 100 ft high, two-mile-long facility and unleash a reservoir the size of the Great Salt Lake across southern Ukraine, flooding towns and villages, several of which Russian forces seized at the start of the war. Ukraine said repeated Russian claims that Ukraine is preparing an attack on the dam, which regulates water supplies to the annexed Crimean peninsula and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, were a sign that Russia itself was considering staging an attack and blaming it on Kyiv and its Western supporters. Moscow has also accused Kyiv of planning to use a so-called 'dirty bomb' to spread radiation, or to blow up a dam to flood towns and villages in Kherson province. Kyiv says accusations it would use such tactics on its own territory are absurd, but that Russia might be planning such actions itself to blame Ukraine. Experts from the United Nations' nuclear power agency inspected two sites in Ukraine on Tuesday that Russia identified in unfounded claims that Ukrainian authorities planned to set off the dirty bombs. International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said the inspections for evidence of a so-called dirty bomb, requested by Kyiv in the wake of the unsubstantiated Russian allegations, would be completed soon. In the wake of battlefield setbacks for Russia in its war in Ukraine, top Russian officials including Putin, made unsubstantiated accusations that Ukraine was manufacturing such an explosive device, which scatters radioactive waste. The Russians, without providing evidence, alleged the Ukrainians planned to make the purported bomb look like Russia's doing. Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, alleged in a letter to Security Council members last week that Ukraine's nuclear research facility and mining company 'received direct orders from Zelensky's regime to develop such a dirty bomb.' Western nations have called Moscow's repeated claim 'transparently false.' Ukrainian authorities dismissed it as an attempt to distract attention from Moscow's own alleged plans to detonate a dirty bomb as a way to justify a further escalation of hostilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said the investigated sites 'are under IAEA safeguards and have been visited regularly by IAEA inspectors,' whose mission is detecting undeclared nuclear activities and materials related to the development of dirty bombs. 'The IAEA inspected one of the two locations a month ago and no undeclared nuclear activities or materials were found there,' the agency said in a statement Monday. The U.N.'s atomic energy watchdog also has had on-site monitors at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Fighting around near Europe's largest nuclear power station has created worries of a possibly catastrophic leak there. The mouth of the wide Dnipro River has also become one of the most consequential frontlines in the war in recent weeks, with Ukrainian forces advancing to expel Russian troops from their only pocket on the west bank. Russia has thousands of troops there and has been trying to reinforce the area. Ukraine's advance has slowed in recent days, with commanders citing weather and tougher terrain. Saldo, the Russian-imposed occupation leader for the province, identified seven towns on the east bank that would now be evacuated, comprising the main populated settlements along that stretch of the river. The European Union accused Moscow on Tuesday of launching a new programme to illegally conscript men in Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014, to fight in its forces. The EU statement said Moscow was disproportionately conscripting members of Crimea's indigenous Tatar minority to fight in its war. Russia, which launched its 'special military operation' in Ukraine in February, has announced it has completed a mobilisation drive ordered in September by President Vladimir Putin, saying it had called up 300,000 reservists and more were not needed. But Putin has not issued a decree ending the mobilisation, raising concern he could restart it without notice. A senior Russian ruling party senator said on Tuesday a decree formally ending the mobilisation was not needed. Thousands of Russian men have fled abroad to escape conscription to a conflict which has killed thousands, displaced millions, shaken the global economy and reopened Cold War-era divisions. Just north of Kherson, Russia fired four missiles into the Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv overnight, demolishing half an apartment building. Reuters saw rescue workers recover the body of an elderly woman from the rubble. As rush hour was under way, passersby walked past a two-storey school, the front of which had been torn off by the force of the blast that left a massive crater. 'This is what the barbarian horde does,' said Irena Siden, 48, the school's deputy director, standing in front of the gutted building as workers began sweeping up the rubble. 'They (the Russians) are the descendants of the barbarian horde. They stole our history and how they are trying to steal our culture.' Russia fired a huge volley of missiles at Ukrainian cities on Monday in what Putin called retaliation for an attack on Russia's Black Sea Fleet at the weekend. Ukraine said it shot most of those missiles down, but some had hit power stations, knocking out electricity and water supplies. 'That's not all we could have done,' Putin said at a televised news conference. Putin has also suspended cooperation with a U.N.-backed programme to escort cargo ships carrying grain out of the war zone. The three-month-old programme had lifted a de facto Russian blockade of Ukraine, one of the world's biggest grain producers, and averted a global food crisis. Russia's suspension of cooperation had raised international fears that a food crisis could return, but so far Moscow has not restored its blockade, with 12 ships able to depart Ukraine on Monday carrying grain, and three more sailing on Tuesday. Whether those shipments can continue may depend on whether insurers are still willing to underwrite them."
2022-11-01,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11377225/Putin-propagandist-says-watching-Friends-knew-East-West-different-values.html,Putin propagandist says watching Friends was when she knew East and West had different values as she excuses Russia's bloody invasion of Ukraine as a war 'about our right to raise our children to be just like us not them',"A Putin propagandist said watching Friends when she was younger was when she learned there was a 'fundamental divide' between the East and West. Margarita Simonyan, 42, is the editor-in-chief of the RT network, which is funded by the Kremlin and is a mouthpiece for Putin. On Russian television on Sunday, she also excused the invasion of Ukraine as a war 'about our right to raise our children to be just like us not them.' Thirty years ago, Ms Simonyan, currently subject to western sanctions, had studied in America while on a school exchange programme and said she thought the two nationalities were very alike. But she said that she soon realised there were already signs of differences and a divide when she watched Friends. She added: 'Things were just coming to the surface with the first gurgles of this boiling ultra-liberal borscht, they were small then, it was hard to notice them. 'You had to have very good eyesight to notice it in the 1994 TV series Friends, for example, which is probably the most popular American TV series of all time, such a personification of American culture.' Ms Simonyan then spoke of references to homosexuality in the show, talking about the pilot of Friends in which Ross discovered his wife had left him for another woman. Ross had walked into the café looking sad. The 42-year-old added: 'Why did he look confused and sad? Because he discovered his wife left him for a woman. 'All of this is depicted with sympathy - good for her, and too bad for him! It was impossible then to recognise this as blatant propaganda because it was so rare, so fresh, so interesting.' She called the portrayal of homosexuality in the series a 'fundamental divide' with Russian culture. The propagandist said that Russia was using the invasion to wage a war over traditional values in Ukraine. Ms Simonyan added: 'This war is about our right to raise our children to be just like us and not like them. There is a chasm between us and our children and them and their children.' She had also used an appearance on Sunday Evening with Vladimir Solovyov to declare Russians should choose to martyr themselves instead of facing being defeated in the war. Russia is currently ramping up missile strikes and continuing to try and push back in its war against Ukraine. Putin himself had declared that the war was a battle against western interpretations of freedom and tolerance. The West was last week accused by Putin of trying to 'overthrow faith and traditional values' in Russia. He also said the West were promoting 'outright satanism' in a ranting annual speech at the Valdai Club. Despite his speech on traditional values, Russians have become increasingly tolerant of homosexuality. Opinion polls have discovered Putin's views are mainly shared by Russians over 60. Ms Simonyan's words come after another one of Vladimir Putin's leading propagandists apologised and pleaded to keep his job after launching a 'genocidal' diatribe on air in which he called for Ukrainian children to be drowned. Anton Krasovsky, 47, is a star presenter and a director of broadcasting with RT. Putin's pundits regularly advocate decimating Ukraine or laying waste to the West with nuclear weapons across multiple state TV channels. But Krasovsky's savage rant on drowning Ukrainian children caused horror even among his own chiefs. 'Just drown those children, drown them in the Tysyna [River],' he said in recorded TV comments that were not edited. 'You throw them in the river with a strong undercurrent… Shove them right into their huts and burn them.' He was promptly suspended from RT by Ms Simonyan and faces possible criminal action after the head of the Russia's Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin - a former university classmate of Putin's - ordered an investigation into his remarks. Krasovsky issued an apology to anyone he had offended and begged his boss to allow him to come back to work - but he stopped short of retracting the comments. Ms Simonyan - who usually exchanges loving messages and warm praise with Krasovsky - said his TV comments were 'savage and disgusting'. 'Perhaps Anton would explain himself by saying what temporary insanity it was caused by, and how it slipped off his tongue,' she said, adding: 'It is hard to believe Krasovsky truly thinks children should be drowned. 'As of now I am suspending our co-operation, because neither myself, nor the rest of the RT team can allow even a hint of thought that any of us can share such nonsense.' Despite having advocated for a Russian crackdown in Ukraine, Ms Simonyan concluded: 'To the children of Ukraine, as well as to children of Donbas and to all other children, I wish for it all to end as soon as possible, so that they can live peacefully and study in the language they consider to be their mother tongue.' Krasovsky's comments came in response to writer Sergei Lukyanenko's account about how, when he first visited Ukraine in the 1980s, children told him they would live better lives were it not for Moscow occupying their country. Krasovsky went on to declare that all Ukrainians should be killed, and that he would burn them alive in their homes and shoot them. In a short segment of the interview, shared on social media, Krasovsky also laughed at reports that Russian troops raped elderly Ukrainian women during the invasion. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called for a global ban on RT in the wake of the shocking interview. He said on Twitter: 'Governments which still have not banned RT must watch this excerpt. This is what you side with if you allow RT to operate in your countries. 'Aggressive genocide incitement (we will put this person on trial for it), which has nothing to do with freedom of speech. Ban RT worldwide!'"
2022-11-01,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11377157/Russia-claims-Britain-ordinated-Nord-Stream-explosions.html,Kremlin warns of 'further steps' against Britain after claiming UK 'co-ordinated' Nord Stream explosions and Liz Truss 'sent US a message saying 'It's done' shortly after the blast',"Russia is considering what 'further steps' to take after accusing Britain of coordinating attacks on the Nord Stream gas pipes. Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin's spokesman, said Kremlin intelligence agents 'have data indicating British military specialists were directing and coordinating the attack' which destroyed two gas lines running from Russia to Germany in September. 'There is evidence that Britain is involved in sabotage...a terrorist act against vital energy infrastructure,' he told reporters. 'Such actions cannot be put aside. Of course, we will think about further steps. It definitely cannot be left like this.' It comes after Kim Dotcom, who ran site Megaupload before he was convicted of fraud, began circulating a conspiracy theory that Liz Truss had texted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately after the attack saying 'it's done'. Kim claimed to have learned of the message from Truss's iCloud, after it was revealed that Russia hacked her phone while she was foreign secretary. Neither Kim nor Peskov have released the evidence they claim to have seen. But the accusation represents a new line of attack from Russia at the US and Britain, which have led support for Ukraine in resisting Putin's invasion. London has rejected the claims. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman said on Tuesday that London would not be drawn into 'distractions which are part of the Russian playbook'. On Monday, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told the Commons that Russian allegations against the UK were 'increasingly detached from reality'. 'They are designed to distract the Russian people from the reality of Russian failures on the battlefield,' he told MPs. Western leaders have stopped short of publicly blaming Russia for the attack - which blew two holes in each pipeline and may have permanently disabled them - but have been privately briefing their suspicions that the Russian president was behind it. Kim's claim about Truss's iPhone was also picked up and parroted by Russian foreign ministry spokesman Maria Zakharova, who demanded answers. 'Frankly, I don't care who got this information or how,' she said. 'I am interested in London's response to the following question: Did British Prime Minister Liz Truss send a message to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the immediate aftermath of the bombing of the Nord Stream pipeline saying ""It's done?""' Russia's claims appear inconsistent with what is known about Truss's phone hack, which was first reported by the Mail on Sunday. According to the paper, the hack was discovered 'over the summer' while Truss was still Foreign Secretary and in the running to replace Boris Johnson as Prime Minister. The pipe blast did not occur until September 26, more than two weeks after the contest concluded with Truss declared the victor. While the public did not learn about the hack until recently, the Mail on Sunday reports those in government did know about it and decided to hush it up. It therefore seems highly unlikely that Truss would have been allowed to keep using the phone until the time of the blast - especially to send sensitive messages to America's top diplomat. Sources told the Mail on Sunday that the device is now being kept inside a locked safe at at secure government location. Russia and Putin have repeatedly denied carrying out attacks on the Nord Stream pipes, pointing the finger of blame at the US. Nord Stream 2 was due to become the main route for Russian gas reaching Europe but was scrapped by Germany when Putin invaded. Nord Stream 1 had been operating for a decade and ferried huge amounts of gas to the continent, which it relied upon for almost 40 per cent of its energy. But it was barely in use at the time of the explosion after Russia throttled supplies to just 10 per cent capacity - blaming maintenance issues. Nobody is sure exactly how the attack was carried out, but theories include that Russia may have used one of its underwater sabotage submarines. Others suggest some kind of explosive could have been dropped from the surface days or weeks ahead of time and then detonated, or that a drone controlled by a nearby ship or sub could have done it. The area of the blasts - which sits just outside of Swedish and Danish territorial waters - is now cordoned off and Stockholm is leading a probe into what happened. Ukraine shoots down two Russian choppers in three minutes - weeks after blasting four helicopters in 18 minutes - as Putin's forces increase air attacks in bid to reverse defeats in Kherson By Jack Newman for MailOnline Ukraine has shot down two Russian attack helicopters in just three minutes in the latest blow to Putin's botched invasion. Anti-aircraft gunners hit the Ka-52 Alligators in the southern Kherson region yesterday evening, Ukraine's Air Force said. The £12million single-seat attack helicopter is nicknamed the Black Shark and has been described as Russia's 'deadliest helicopter'. Its battlefield management system allows it to share data with other aircraft to coordinate attack operations. It came weeks after Ukrainian troops shot down four Russian helicopters in 18 minutes. Ukraine also blew up a Mi-8 helicopter gunship in Donetsk after a surface-to-air missile picked it out of the sky yesterday. Footage shows the Russian attack helicopter flying low across a field before it is hit by a missile which explodes on impact - but the chopper continues to fly for some time with flames gushing out of its left side. The helicopter begins emitting black smoke and then comes crashing down in a fireball in a field, rolling on to its roof as its rotor breaks off. The images were obtained from the 54th Separate Mechanised Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Monday, along with statement saying that the images were filmed on the 'administrative borders of Luhansk and Donetsk regions'. They added: 'Somehow a Russian helicopter flew in to bring death to Ukrainian families, but the sky is tightly controlled by the glorious soldiers of the anti-aircraft missile division of the 54th Separate Mechanised Brigade. 'The soldiers saw a foreign 'bird' in the sky and did what had to be done - they 'destroyed the harmful fly' together with its crew.' They signed off with 'Glory to Ukraine!' Last month Ukraine carried off a similar rampage, downing four helicopters in 18 minutes in the country's south. The helicopters - presumed to be Soviet-era KA-52 models - were taken down by Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units. During his evening address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said the country's forces had shot down 45 of 55 cruise missiles on Monday, and a Ka-52 alligator was downed. 'Today our air forces and everyone involved in protecting the skies did a great job,' said Zelensky. 'Most of the objects that the terrorists identified as targets were saved.' Ukraine claims Russia has now lost about 72,470 personnel, 2,698 tanks, 5,501 armoured combat vehicles, 1,730 artillery units, 383 multiple launch rocket systems, 197 air defence systems, 276 warplanes, 257 helicopters, 1,415 drones, 397 cruise missiles, 16 warships, 4,143 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, and 154 units of special equipment.

Russia orders tens of thousands civilians to evacuate Kherson, raising fears Putin's men will detonate 'dirty bomb' or blow up dam and flood towns in the region in false flag attack Russia has ordered the evacuation of tens of thousands of civilians in Ukraine, raising fears of a massive escalation of the war.

Desperate truckers reveal they're 'barely getting by' amid rocketing diesel prices that hit $5.312 - as supplier warns 'some cities may run dry for a few days',"Desperate truck drivers have revealed the pressure of skyrocketing fuel prices while suppliers warned that 'some cities may run dry for a few days.' Diesel per gallon jumped close to $2.00 with prices going from $3.634 to $5.312 in the past year. Gas prices however have seen a much needed decrease this week at $3.758 per gallon, however still rose by $0.356 from last year's $3.402. According to the American Trucking Association the trucking industry hauled 72.2 percent of all freight transported into the United States in 2021, equating to 10.93 billion tons. In the same year, the trucking $875.5 billion industry represented 80.8 percent of the nation's freight bill. The Association registered 38.9 million trucks used for business purposes, excluding government and farm, in 2020 representing 24.1 percent of all trucks registered. While in the same year, 44.8 billion gallons of fuel was consumed by those trucks 35.8 billion gallons of diesel fuel typically and 9.0 billion gallons of gasoline. For this reason, truck drivers have voiced their fears telling Fox News rising fuel prices have left them 'working for peanuts.' One driver said: 'Literally it's taking my company 30 or 40 percent of expenses to fuel. Another said: 'Diesel prices right now are very high it's harder for companies to make money with the high prices. 'Plus, the rates have dropped so you're not really making the money you were making before you're barely getting by right now.' According to figures calculated by Indeed the average salary for a truck driver in the United States equates to $71,207 per year. Company team drivers are typically paid $0.48 – $0.75 per mile up to 6,000 miles per week estimating at $3,154 per week. Company solo drivers will see $0.40 - $0.64 per mile up to 3,000 mile per week averaging at about $1,183 per week. While owner operator drivers will see an average of $0.94 - $1.79 per mile up to 3,000 miles per week with an estimated average of $3,163 per week. One driver remarked that they would have to drive further to see any benefit from an average day, because fuel prices have contributed to higher costs to operate. 'We need to drive more than we usually drive which is about 400, 500 miles a day so that we can make a little bit of money. We [now] need to drive like 600 miles,' he said. Every year, about 800,000 drivers leave the profession, according to WCPO while experts said that the rising diesel prices could push more drivers out. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that, as of October 14, the US had only 25 days of reserve diesel supply, a low not seen since 2008. The Biden Administration said it was keeping a close watch on diesel inventories and working to boost supplies following the news that reserves had depleted. A White House official told Fox News that the administration is closely monitoring diesel inventory levels, especially on the East Coast, and that it is in touch with U.S. energy firms regarding the need to build up reserves and drive toward solutions. The official added that the administration has also been in regular communication with East Coast governors for months and has readied tools at its disposal, including the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NEHHOR). Mansfield Energy, the supplier, led by CEO Michael Mansfield, issued the advisory in a bid to make sure that companies are prepared. Businesses which rely on the fuel have been told to take steps to plan for the potential lack of supply which is mostly caused by Russia cutting off imports. This means that businesses are not receiving the high number of petroleum products that they were before the invasion of Ukraine. It has had an impact on refineries as they have had to shift production from gasoline to make some diesel. This means that they may run low on gasoline. The diesel shortage is also caused by high distillate (heating oil and diesel) demand, refinery maintenance and lower refinery capacity. Companies can protect their fuel supplies and lower their risk of being out of commission by issuing emergency fleet cards. These give access to fuel in a trackable way. They can also use a small tank for emergency fuel. Mansfield Energy reassured consumers that fuel stations will mostly find supply and stay running. It added that for this reason, it is unlikely fuel stations will have bags over the pumps and the ongoing main impact is likely to be higher prices for customers. It comes as Biden considers limiting US fuel exports to bring prices down and restore inventories. But this is an idea that is not supported by refiners. They have said that this measure would probably decrease inventory levels. The refiners added that it would reduce domestic refining capacity and put pressure on consumer fuel prices and alienate US allies amid the war in Ukraine."

This means that businesses are not receiving the high number of petroleum products that they were before the invasion of Ukraine. It has had an impact on refineries as they have had to shift production from gasoline to make some diesel. This means that they may run low on gasoline. The diesel shortage is also caused by high distallate (heating oil and diesel) demand, refinery maintenance and lower refinery capacity. High distallate (heating oil and diesel) demand amid low inventories. Refinery maintenance- this happens in the spring and fall and means lower capacity. Capacity has fallen in the past few years because several unprofitable refineries were closed. The primary reason is the cutoff of Russian imports. Prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US was importing nearly 700,000 barrels per day of petroleum and petroleum products. Most of those imports were finished products and refinery inputs that boosted distillate supplies in the U.S. Source: Forbes Mansfield Energy first mentioned the potential diesel shortage last week. The company had questioned if the lack of fuel would be due to 'poor pipeline shipping economies.' And they added that there was also a low supply of reserves with only 25 million barrels in storage at the moment. This is in comparison to the usual 50 million barrels along the East Coast. Mansfield Energy on Monday warned in a press release that prices will surge because of the lack of diesel supply. It added that due to the spike in prices, demand will decrease to the point that it will balance with limited supply. Also, the company said that consumers may be affected by the high prices when they go to fill up their cars. However, they added that there will still be diesel for businesses following a few days of shortages. Mansfield Energy said that the supply chain within the fuel industry is dynamic and that suppliers will work to fill supply gaps. People were told not to panic by the fuel supplier and to only order more when it is needed. The company said that people will have access to fuel by normal means in most areas. In cases where there is not a large storage tank on site, the fleet may be out of commission if the fuel supplier runs out of fuel. Companies can protect their fuel supplies and lower their risk of being out of commission by issuing emergency fleet cards. These give access to fuel in a trackable way. They can also use a small tank for emergency fuel. Mansfield Energy reassured consumers that fuel stations will mostly find supply and stay running.

The refiners added that it would reduce domestic refining capacity and put pressure on consumer fuel prices and alienate US allies amid the war in Ukraine. Last week, Tom Kloza, Global Head of Energy Analysis at OPIS, spoke to USA Today. He said: 'Between now and the end of November, if we don't build inventories, the wolf will be at the door.' 'And it will look like a big ugly wolf if it's a cold winter.'"
2022-11-01,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11375655/More-300-000-sign-trial-save-energy-bills.html,"More than 300,000 sign up for scheme which pays households to cut energy at peak hours to help stave off blackouts","Hundreds of thousands of UK households have agreed to cut back on their energy usage in return for cash amid fears of rolling power cuts this winter. Octopus Energy said 320,000 of its customers (out of 1.4 million who were eligible) had decided to sign up to its 'Saving Sessions' scheme, which was expected to launch on Tuesday. British Gas has also announced it will launch a similar initiative. Both plans fall under the wider 'demand flexibility service' announced earlier this month by the National Grid's Electricity Systems Operator (ESO), which manages supply and demand of energy in the UK. The scheme is set to run from November until March 31 next year. It comes as Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine and his tactical tightening of pipelines in Europe continue to wreak havoc on gas supplies - while weather experts are warning of potentially colder-than-usual temperatures in the coming months. The ESO previously said it expects to pay providers the equivalent of £3 per unit (kWh) saved. However the amount passed onto the average consumer will be decided by each energy firm. Households will be asked to reduce their usage on at least 12 separate occasions during the five-month period. If the entire proposed £3 per kwh rebate is passed on to Britons by their supplier, this could mean around £240 off their bills in total. Octopus, however, said it expects around one to two sessions per week, or 25 in total, with consumers earning up to £100. It said rewards will be paid as 'OctoPoints' which can be redeemed as credit in pounds. Bulb, So Energy and Utility Warehouse will not be taking part in the scheme, reports Moneysavingexpert.com, while E.on, E.on Next and EDF will be, but are unable to provide further details as of yet. In a bid to take stress off the electricity grid, households taking part in the ESO-run scheme could receive payments of up to £20-a-day if they don't use washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers and even games consoles between 4pm and 7pm. It does not cost consumers anything to sign up to the scheme, and they do not get punished if they decide to use electricity during the periods when they are asked to reduce usage. National Grid has warned that there could be blackouts this winter if gas power plants are not able to keep running due to the energy crisis. The electricity systems operator said it is still unlikely but winter could see the first planned blackouts, which the grid calls rota load shedding, since the 1970s. But why might blackouts happen this year - who will be impacted and what can be done to avoid them? Why would a grid ever plan blackouts? Engineers working on the energy grid need to make sure it is 'balanced' at all times. This means that the amount of electricity being put into the grid by power plants, wind farms and others should match the amount being taken out by households and businesses at any given time. The grid plans for when it thinks demand can be high so it can ask generators to meet that demand. But if there is ever an imbalance where demand is higher than supply or supply is higher than demand, it can cause major breakdowns in the grid. That could cause actual physical damage to the grid that could take days to repair. If the engineers know there will not be enough supply to match demand, sometimes they need to reduce demand by planned outages to avoid major damage. Why might blackouts be necessary this winter? Britain has one of the most reliable power networks in the world and unless cables are cut by storms or other accidents outages are rare. But this winter, gas generators might not be able to get enough gas to keep running. The grid said that if this happens, it still thinks that is 'unlikely', then it might have to cut power to some households and businesses. Who will be impacted by blackouts and who gets cut off first? If the grid realises that it has to cut off some parts of the country, it will issue a warning to the local and regional distributors saying how much demand needs to be cut. It will be up to these so-called distribution network operators to decide who gets cut off and who does not. But the DNOs have limited controls so most of the time it will be whole areas that are impacted. How can we avoid blackouts? If the blackouts are caused by a lack of supply, then the only way is to reduce demand at particular times. Most demand happens during peak hours of between around 4pm and 7pm when people get home from work, put the kettle on, switch on their ovens and sit down to watch TV. The overall amount of electricity that people use does not have to reduce if they just change their usage to other times of the day. For instance, electric cars could be unplugged during these hours, switching the dishwasher could wait until 9pm and you could put the washing machine on earlier in the day or during the weekend. The grid and energy suppliers will launch a new system in November to pay people if they change the time that they use energy. The Government could also step in to ration peoples' energy use or advise them to use less, similar to a hosepipe ban, but so far it has ruled this out. The scheme was expected to launch on Tuesday, however, the official launch has not yet been confirmed. It was unclear how many suppliers have signed up to the National Grid scheme, but OVO Energy is launching a separate programme with a similar goal. OVO said on Tuesday that a quarter of its eligible customers have signed up – around 7,000 households. The supplier is reaching out only to households that it thinks will benefit the most from the scheme. 'We're heading into a critical moment for the UK energy sector, and we need a resilient grid to support households through this winter,' said OVO chief executive Raman Bhatia. 'It's testament to our customers' willingness to support new trials and engage with their usage that we've surpassed the target of trialists. 'We hope the results of this trial will give customers a deeper insight into how they can support the wider system, with potential savings to help over winter.' Ovo customers will be rewarded with a flat payment of £20 per month if they commit to the scheme, up to a total of £100. The National Grid's ESO hopes its 'demand flexibility service' scheme could save 2GW of electricity - equivalent to powering one million homes - and will help the see how much energy use can be 'shifted' from peak times to manage supply and demand. They want as many people as possible to take part. But the scheme relies on users having a controversial smart meter, a device which automatically transmits your energy usage to your provider. So far around 29.5 million smart meters have been installed in homes and small businesses around the UK – which means that just under half do not have one. There have been many complaints about the devices, ranging from them logging inaccurate readings that lead to inflated bills to stopping working altogether. The roll out of smart meters has been plagued by an industry-wide supply problem – but hundreds of thousands of households are unable to get one because they live in high-rise flats, old properties with thick walls, or remote regions with poor signal. Some critics have said that it should have been rolled out to all homes, regardless of whether they have a smart meter. Planned blackouts hit the UK during the 1970s in response to the miners strikes and the oil crisis. There have also been major unplanned outages in storms, including in 1987 when over 1.5 million people were left in the dark. But the lights will stay on this winter unless the gas-fired power plants that produced 43 per cent of Britain's electricity over the last year cannot get enough gas to continue operating. It is the most dire of three possible scenarios that the ESO laid out earlier this month for how Britain's electricity grid might cope with the worst global energy crisis for decades. In the other two scenarios, the operator hopes that by paying people to charge their electric cars at off-peak times and firing up backup coal plants it can offset the risk of blackouts. The margins between peak demand and power supply are expected to be sufficient and similar to recent years in the National Grid Electricity System Operator's (ESO) base case scenario for this winter. But in the face of the 'challenging' winter facing European energy supplies following Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the grid operator is also planning for what would happen if there were no imports of electricity from Europe and insufficient gas supplies. To tackle a loss of imports from France, Belgium and the Netherlands, there are two gigawatts of coal-fired power plants on stand-by to fire up if needed to meet demand. The National Grid Gas Transmission separately said that while gas demand will increase this winter, it expects Britain to be able to get enough gas to take it through a Beast from the East scenario or a long, cold winter. It comes as weather experts at the Met Office are now warning of an increased chance of a colder-than-usual winter this year. This could further up demand on gas and electricity supplies, as Britons turn up the heat to keep their homes warm. In one sign of hope, Mr Pettigrew today attempted to calm fears the UK could run out of gas and electricity this winter. He said it was the National Grid's 'base case' assumption was that the UK would have enough energy supplies to meet heating and lighting demand this winter. But he added that short rolling power cuts were a possibility. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'There could be energy shortfalls in the UK and we will manage that very carefully.' Russia is plotting to strike a key gas pipeline between the UK and Norway to punish Britain over its support for Ukraine and leave households in the cold this winter. Senior military and intelligence sources told the Mail that Moscow could try and sabotage the Langeled pipeline that provides one-fifth of the country’s gas demand. The Kremlin has repeatedly weaponised energy supplies to Europe since it invaded Ukraine, slashing deliveries to the EU in response to sanctions. A series of unexplained leaks to energy connections under the Baltic Sea, including Germany’s controversial Nord Stream projects, are believed to be the work of Russian saboteurs. Any strike on Langeled would be a further squeeze on supplies to the UK and Europe. Sabotage is the next step if they want to escalate by attacking Britain’s critical energy infrastructure because we are so fragile,’ said one NATO source. ‘And it’s no coincidence that Britain has been one of Ukraine’s biggest backers.’ Both the British and Norwegian governments have spoken about a general threat to North Sea energy infrastructure in the past. But officials in Oslo and London have refused to be drawn on specific targets. Another NATO official who works directly on threats to critical infrastructure said the 725-mile-long Langeled pipeline is an ‘obvious target.’ However he said it was 'not time for people to panic', adding: 'What we're doing is making sure that the infrastructure that we have and the networks are robust and ready for the winter, and I've got thousands of engineers making sure that the network is ready for whatever weather we see over the winter.' Mr Pettigrew said the National Grid was working on a number of emergency plans to protect the UK against an energy shortfall from Europe. Gas supplies had already been disrupted post-Covid lockdowns, as countries battled to resupply for the big restart, leading to a huge increase demand and subsequently prices. And this has been compounded by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with gas supplies from Russia being limited to Europe. Although the UK gets much of its gas from other countries, and gets nearly 40 per cent of its energy from gas, it is still impacted by the disruption to the European energy price market. Mr Pettigrew told the BBC that one emergency option to help power Britain this winter if fuel supplies drop is to restart mothballed coal-fired power stations. The UK is already looking at delaying the closure of part of a coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire due to fears about energy. Mr Pettigrew added: 'The next step would be to pay households and businesses to reduce consumption during peak times, with short rolling regional outages a last resort. 'If we saw that shortfall coming, the most effective way to manage the rest of the network is to ask the distribution companies to reduce demand and they would do that over that rolling period of around 4 to 7pm.' It comes as the Met Office has published its latest three-month long forecast - which covers this month, December and January. The Met Office warns that the chance of a colder three month period overall is 'slightly greater than normal' - by around 1.3 times. It means there is a 60 per cent chance of a normal winter, a 25 per cent chance of a cold winter and a 15 per cent chance of a mild winter. The Met Office also warns of a higher possibility of a slightly calmer winter in terms of wind - also by around 1.3 times. A calmer winter in terms of wind could impact on the ability to fill energy shortfalls with extra wind power capacity. The prediction comes from the Met Office's three-month forecast, which is used for emergency planning. The forecast itself does not look at day to day weather or spells, but at the weather overall over three month period. According to the Met Office, its prediction of a higher possibility of a slightly colder winter comes from its tracking of global weather patterns, including El Nina. It says the weather phenomenon this year could bring colder spells, particularly when combined with other long term patterns over the Indian Ocean."

On Monday the Russian president called for Kyiv to guarantee the safety of maritime traffic after Moscow suspended its role in a grain shipment deal, alleging Ukraine had misused a safe shipping corridor. 'Ukraine must guarantee that there will be no threat to the safety of civilian vessels,' Putin told a press conference. He accused Kyiv of using the corridor to attack Russia's Crimea fleet, which prompted Moscow to suspend a deal allowing Ukrainian food exports. 'This attack was launched by Ukraine against the Black Sea fleet... They created a danger for our ships and civilian vessels,' Putin said. 'It's a threat to our ships and our civilian vessels,' Putin said, stressing Russia did not withdraw from the deal but 'suspended' involvement. Yesterday a massive barrage of cruise missile and drone strikes hit critical infrastructure in Kyiv, Kharkiv and other Ukrainian cities early, knocking out water and power supplies in retaliation for the attack in Crimea. Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's power plants and other key infrastructure as the war enters its ninth month, forcing rolling power cuts. 'The Kremlin is taking revenge for military failures on peaceful people who are left without electricity and heat before the winter,' Kyiv regional governor Oleksii Kuleba said. Putin confirmed that Monday's bombardment was meant to retaliate for what he said was Saturday's unsuccessful Ukrainian aerial and underwater drone attack on Russia's Sevastopol-based fleet on the Russian-annexed Crimea Peninsula. 'Partly, yes. But it's not all we could have done,' Mr Putin responded, regarding retaliation, at a press conference in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi. In July, Russia and Ukraine signed a deal brokered by Turkey and the United Nations to unlock critical grain from Ukraine needed to avert a global food crisis caused by the conflict. The agreement established a safe corridor through which vessels could travel to Istanbul for inspections. It had already allowed more than 9.5million tons of Ukrainian grain to be exported and was due to be renewed on November 19. The Russian and Turkish foreign ministers, Sergei Lavrov and Mevlut Cavusoglu, raised the issue in a telephone call on Monday, according to Moscow. 'Mr Lavrov stressed the need to ensure that Ukraine guarantees that it will not use Ukraine's humanitarian corridor and ports for agricultural exports to conduct military operations against Russia,' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. 'Only under these conditions can we discuss the resumption of movement along the security corridor,' he added. Putin claimed Ukrainian drones had travelled to their targets through an internationally-agreed zone meant to ensure the safety of ships exporting grain from Ukrainian ports. The threat from such a trajectory endangered Russian ships patrolling the zone as well as the grain ships themselves, Mr Putin said, justifying his country's suspension of its participation in the deal that enabled the exports. Russia's Defence Ministry said its forces carried out 'strikes with long-range, high-precision air- and sea-based weapons against the military command and energy systems of Ukraine'. 'The goals of the strikes were achieved. All designated targets were hit,' the ministry said. Meanwhile, 12 ships with grain left Ukrainian ports on Monday despite a Russian threat to reimpose a blockade that threatened hunger across the world, Ukraine's Ministry of Infrastructure said. But the grain transport was thrown into doubt after Russia's Defence Ministry said in a statement late on Monday that 'traffic along the security corridor defined by the Black Sea Initiative has been suspended' over allegations that Ukraine has been using the zone to strike Russian forces. In Monday's ground attacks, Ukraine's air force said it shot down 44 of more than 50 cruise missiles that Russia launched. Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal said Russian missiles and drones hit 10 Ukrainian regions and damaged 18 sites, mostly energy facilities. Hundreds of localities were left without power, he said on Facebook. Thirteen people were wounded, Ukrainian Police Chief Ihor Klymenko said. Loud explosions were heard across the Ukrainian capital as residents prepared for work. The emergency services sent out text messages warning about the threat of a missile attack, and air raid sirens wailed for three hours. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said 80 per cent of consumers in the city of three million were left without water because of damage to a power facility. By Monday evening, workers had reduced the percentage to 40 per cent and the number of apartments without electricity from 350,000 to 270,000. To cut power consumption, Kyiv authorities extended intervals between underground trains and replaced electric trolleybuses and trams with buses, Mr Klitschko said. Across Kyiv, hundreds lined up, often for more than an hour, to pump water by hand from wells to fill plastic bottles and cans. 'It is really inconvenient,' one 34-year-old resident, who agreed to provide only his first name, Denis, said as he collected water. 'But the truth is, it's not a problem. The problem is we have a war.' Smoke rose from the left bank of the Dnieper River in Kyiv, either from a missile strike or where Ukrainian forces shot it down. Reporters saw soldiers inspecting a crater and debris from where a missile landed on the outskirts of Kyiv. The missiles flew fast and low and sounded like bombs exploding, according to witnesses. 'It was scary,' said Oleksandr Ryabtsev, 28, who was on his way to work. 'I raised my head and it was flying there. You could see this cruise missile. I didn't even go to work. I went home.' Prime Minister Shmyhal said that in the Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv regions, emergency power shutdowns were underway. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, two strikes hit critical infrastructure facilities, according to authorities. Critical infrastructure sites were also hit in the Cherkasy region south-east of Kyiv. In the Kirovohrad region of central Ukraine, an energy facility was hit. The United Nations on Monday said no ships involved in a UN-brokered Ukraine grain export deal were transiting a Black Sea maritime humanitarian corridor on the night of October 29, when Russia says its vessels in Crimea were attacked. Russia has accused Ukraine of using air and maritime drones to target vessels in the Bay of Sevastopol early on Saturday and suggested one of the drones may have been launched from a civilian vessel chartered to export food from Ukrainian ports. Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied it was behind the attack but says Russia's navy is a legitimate military target. Responding to Russia's accusation about possible misuse of cargo ships, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths told the UN Security Council on Monday: 'None were in the corridor on the night of the 29th of October when the reported attacks took place, and no vessel reported an incident over the weekend.' In Vinnytsia, remnants of a missile that was shot down landed on civilian buildings, causing damage but no casualties, according to regional governor Serhii Borzov. Power was cut to parts of Ukraine's train network, the Ukrainian Railways reported. Ukraine has denied responsibility for Saturday's Black Sea Fleet attack, saying Russia mishandled its own weapons, but Moscow still announced it was retaliating by halting its participation in the grain deal. Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar urged his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, in a phone call on Monday to 'reconsider' Moscow's suspension. According to a statement, Mr Akar hailed the deal as an example of how problems can be solved through 'co-operation and dialogue' and argued it is a 'completely humanitarian activity' that should be kept separate from the conflict. At the United Nations in New York, Martin Griffiths, who leads the UN team facilitating the deal, told the Security Council that Monday's ship movements and inspections were undertaken as emergency measures. The United Nations trade chief, Rebeca Grynspan warned the council that uncertainty over the deal and high global fertiliser prices may turn today's crisis over the affordability of food into 'tomorrow's crisis of availability and a crisis of huge proportions'. She said the agreements enabled wheat exports from Russia to triple between July and September and wheat exports from Ukraine to more than quadruple, lowering food prices. It comes as Ukrainian forces have been making gains across Russian-occupied areas, with fighting intensifying in the country's east and in the southern city of Kherson. And in yet another example of Putin's forces' incompetence, video shows panic-stricken Russian soldiers fleeing a Ukrainian attack on an armoured vehicle - only for it to flip over and fling the troops into the air. Footage, apparently from Kherson, shows Russian soldiers running towards an armoured vehicle as Ukrainian missiles rain down on them. The soldiers scramble on top of the armoured vehicle and are seen smiling as they speed off down a road away from the attack. But the vehicle then veers to the right and into a ditch, causing the troopers- no longer smiling - to scream in fear. The driver quickly steers to the left, but the speeding vehicle flips over - flinging the troops on to the road below them. The video then cuts out. It comes as as Russia tries to round up as many men as possible and quickly push them to the front lines, regardless of skill, training and equipment. The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in its latest intelligence briefing that Russia has deployed several thousand newly mobilised reservists to the front line in Ukraine - but in many cases they are 'poorly equipped'. 'In September, Russian officers were concerned that some recently mobilised reservists were arriving in Ukraine without weapons,' the MoD said in its Monday morning briefing. For those Russian soldiers who are turning up with weapons, they are often being issued AKM rifles, which fires 7.62 mm ammunition. This is different to the ammunition required in the rifles issued to Russia's regular combat units. 'The integration of reservists with contract soldiers and combat veterans in Ukraine will mean Russian logisticians will have to push two types of small arms ammunition to front line positions, rather than one,' the MoD added. It continued: 'This will likely further complicate Russia's already strained logistics systems.' Since Putin announced the mobilisation of 300,000 Russians on September 21, independent media, human rights activists and those called up have painted a bleak picture of a haphazard and chaotic effort to call up reservists. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov last week acknowledged persisting problems with equipment for the draftees, but 'vigorous measures taken to rectify the situation are already yielding the first positive results'. He said regional authorities are involved in providing 'the missing gear,' and now deputy prime minister Denis Manturov 'is personally responsible for this' in a coordination council Putin has created. Russian media reported multiple deaths of reservists in Ukraine, with their relatives telling news outlets that they had received very little training. When asked by a reporter why several reservists had died in Ukraine only three weeks after being called up, Putin confirmed that training could last as few as 10 days and as many as 25. Military analyst Pavel Luzin said Russia is not able to train hundreds of thousands of men. 'The army was not ready for mobilisation. It never prepared for it,' he said. Putin has promised to finish the call-up drive by November, when the regular autumn draft is scheduled. Military experts and rights groups say enlistment offices and training camps can't process both at the same time, warning that mobilisation may resume months later. As of mid-October, 222,000 reservists have been recruited, Putin said. Whether it will be possible to enlist another 80,000 in the remaining two weeks is unclear. To try to broaden the pool, the Russian parliament on Wednesday lifted a ban on mobilising men who have been convicted of a grave criminal offense and who have released from prison but whose convictions are still on the books. It comes as Nato member Norway will raise its military readiness, its prime minister said today, pointing to ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine as cause for greater caution. 'The military will as of tomorrow raise its preparedness in Norway,' Jonas Gahr Store, whose nation shares a land border with Russia in the Arctic circle, told reporters. 'We currently have no reason to believe that Russia wants to involve Norway or any other country directly in the war, but the war in Ukraine means it is necessary for all Nato countries to be increasingly on their guard', he added. Norway has overtaken Russia as Europe's main natural gas supplier following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The Scandinavian country has already raised security around its strategic sites after mysterious drone flights were observed near its offshore oil and gas platforms and the suspected sabotage of Nord Stream's Baltic Sea pipelines. Following Monday's strikes on cities across Ukraine, Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of President Volodymyr Zelensky, vowed that the attacks on civilian facilities would not weaken Ukraine's resistance. 'We will persevere, and generations of Russians will pay a high price for their disgrace,' Yermak said. The attacks occurred just before Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and many top members of his government, including the foreign, defense and interior ministers, arrived in Kyiv in the latest show of support from European leaders for Ukraine. 'The Ukrainians are fighting not only for their country but also for the whole of Europe. Our support must continue,' Fiala tweeted from Kyiv. Smoke was seen rising from the left bank of the Dnieper River in Kyiv, either from a missile strike or where it was shot down by Ukrainian forces. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, two strikes hit critical infrastructure facilities, according to authorities, and the subway ceased operating. The Lviv region in western Ukraine was also targeted but the missiles were shot down, Lviv governor Maksym Kozytskyy said. Meanwhile, 12 ships loaded with grain still left Ukraine's ports on Monday despite Russia withdrawing from the pact granting them safe passage through the Black Sea. Tracking data showed the vessels departing ports around Odesa, in southern Ukraine, and heading out across a stretch of heavily-mined sea towards the Bosphorus Strait and onwards to the Mediterranean Sea. Turkey and the United Nations said teams had inspected the vessels and were watching over them. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country was determined to press forward with the grain deal, which has allowed more than nine million tons of grain to be exported from Ukraine. 'The suspension of the agreement affects all humanity. We remind the parties concerned to reconsider their decisions,' said Turkish defence minister Mr Akar said. 'Those in need were already urgently awaiting the grains. The situation will only get worse.' Meanwhile, a Ukrainian great-grandmother has described how a Russian soldier raped and beat her until dawn after he burst into her home. Lyudmila, 75, detailed how the Russian soldier punched her so hard that he broke her nose and knocked out two of her teeth before he beat her with his rifle. The great-grandmother said the soldier, who was in his 60s, threw her on to the sofa and strangled her before he maimed her after he broke into her home in the village of Myroliubivka, near Kherson. Lyudmila, her voice cracking with emotion, said the soldier then ripped off her clothes and raped her. She still has the scars from where the rapist cut her stomach. 'The deep ones still haven't healed,' Lyudmila told Radio 4's Today programme. Lyudmila's horrific ordeal - and the testimonies of hundreds of other Ukrainian women - shows how Russian soldiers have used rape as a weapon of war in the eight months since the invasion began. The 75-year-old, detailing the hours of abuse at the hands of the Russian soldier, said: 'One night, I heard a very loud knock at my window. I saw a soldier there. 'When I opened the door, he immediately punched me in the face, knocked out two of my teeth and broke my nose. I was covered with blood.' Lyudmila, who later fled her home with her family, continued: 'He started beating me in the chest with his rifle butt. He pulled my hair, threw me on to the sofa and began to strangle me. 'Then he began to undress me and after, he raped me.' The great-grandmother added: 'He cut my stomach. Until now, I have scars on my stomach. The deep ones still haven't healed.' The soldier beat Lyudmila for hours and sprayed the room with bullets. He left at dawn. Recalling what she was thinking as she endured the hours of abuse, Lyudmila said: 'I said goodbye to my children, my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren. 'I never thought I would stay alive. Putin and the Russians will never be forgiven. There will be no forgiveness.'"
2022-10-31,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11375195/Spending-cuts-not-eye-watering-black-hole-Budget-feel-pain.html,Rishi Sunak prepares sweeping tax rises for years to come for EVERYBODY: PM and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt agree to fill 'eye-watering' £50billion black hole through tax increases AND spending cuts as Treasury insiders warn 'It's going to be rough',"Rishi Sunak is preparing sweeping tax rises for years to come for every household in the country, as the PM and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt agree to fill 'eye-watering' £50billion black hole through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. Mr Sunak and Mr Hunt agreed yesterday it was 'inevitable' that all taxpayers will face a higher burden in the coming years. Their grim assessment came after they decided that soaking the rich and taking an axe to public spending will not be enough to balance the books and protect services, with an estimated £50 billion to be found. A Treasury source said last night: 'It is going to be rough. The truth is that everybody will need to contribute more in tax if we are to maintain public services. 'After borrowing hundreds of billions of pounds through Covid-19 and implementing massive energy bills support, we won't be able to fill the fiscal black hole through spending cuts alone.' They added that Mr Sunak and Mr Hunt are committed to protecting the most vulnerable in society during the 'difficult period' ahead. The new Prime Minister and Chancellor, preparing for the crucial Budget on November 17, agreed last week that major cuts must be made to Whitehall departments, signalling a return to the austerity era of a decade ago. But in another summit yesterday morning, they concluded that tax rises will also be needed across the board. The Prime Minister will look to make savings in the public sector, with a two per cent pay rise across the board during the next financial year, The Times reported. This would represent a real-term pay cut for teachers, soldiers, police officers and nurses as inflation is forecast to remain at a high of 9.5 per cent next year. This year, a five per cent pay rise prompted the threat of strikes across the public sector because the rate was below inflation. 'You will need spending cuts to fill that black hole, but unfortunately you need tax rises too,' an insider said. 'The focus will be towards the upper end of the income scale but the truth is, there are not enough people there – everybody will have to pay more. Everyone will feel the pain.' The warning came as the Resolution Foundation think tank said Mr Sunak and Mr Hunt face an 'unpalatable menu' when it comes to rebalancing the nation's finances. With a deteriorating economic outlook and the legacy of last prime minister Liz Truss's disastrous mini-budget as a backdrop, it suggests the Government will need to find at least £40 billion — likely through a combination of tax rises and spending cuts. The think tank said the Office for Budget Responsibility could predict a recession next year, with GDP forecasts cut by up to four per cent by the end of 2024. Unemployment could also rise by around half a million, the report suggests, with the weaker economic outlook bringing borrowing up by around £20 billion a year by 2026-2027. 'The Government has a little over two weeks to finalise its plans to repair its economic credibility and the sustainability of the public finances,' said James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation. 'While the recent focus has been on conditions improving post-Trussonomics, the central picture remains one of a weaker growth, higher borrowing costs and expensive tax cuts that have left a fiscal hole of at least £40 billion to fill.' Struggling Britons are to face more pain at the pumps as the price of diesel continues to skyrocket, sparking fresh fears it could hit an all-time high before Christmas. The average cost of a litre of the fuel at UK forecourts on Monday was an eye-watering 190.12p, according to the RAC Fuel Watch, with one Tesco in Cambridge selling diesel for a whopping 197.9p. It's the first time diesel has topped £1.90 since it hit a crippling record high back in July of 199.05p, leading to warnings by the RAC of an imminent 'national fuel crisis'. The soaring prices come as hard-pressed families continue to battle the cost-of-living crisis, which has seen inflation balloon to a bank-busting 10.1 per cent as food prices continue to spiral due to the war in Ukraine. The latest spike in fuel means fed-up motorists will need to splurge out £104.57 to fill the average 55-litre diesel tank - £23.46 more than this time last year, when the average cost was 147.48p per litre, or £81.11 to fill a tank. RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: 'RAC Fuel Watch data shows the gap between the average price of petrol and diesel now stands at a record 24p a litre. As of Thursday, drivers were paying an average of 166p for unleaded while diesel has climbed to above 190p. 'Following the announcement from oil producer group OPEC+ early this month that it was cutting production by two million barrels a day, the wholesale price of refined fuel has increased as a result of oil trading well above $90 having previously been below that mark at the end of last month. 'Since OPEC and its allies agreed to reduce oil supply substantially we’ve seen the price of the average price of diesel going up by almost 10p a litre and petrol by nearly 3p. 'Sadly, for diesel drivers, the situation could yet get worse with prices now back above 190p a litre for the first time since the beginning of August. Hopefully the average price record of 199p for a litre of diesel set in late June won’t be surpassed. 'The price hikes have added £5 to a tank of diesel and nearly £2 to a full petrol fill-up. Due to the war in Ukraine and the UK moving away from Russian diesel, the cost of buying in wholesale diesel from other countries has gone up considerably.' Fuel prices have been driven up over the last few months by the war in Ukraine and moves to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian oil. But diesel has seen far steeper hike in prices than unleaded, with the average cost per litre of petrol remaining at 166.17p. Financial expert Robert Alster, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said diesel was soaring ahead of petrol as it was used not just for transport but to power generators, too. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 this morning, Mr Alster warned the combination of the war in Ukraine and soaring living costs would continue to drive up inflation and punish family finances. 'It’s adding all to a general inflationary higher level than we have seen before,' he said. 'Obviously, it’s been caused by the conflict of Russia and Ukraine. But even allowing for that, it’s shortages driven by Covid, supply chain issues, geopolitical issues between the US and China.' In July, motorists were hit with huge prices at the pumps, with some paying as much as £2 per litre for petrol and diesel. Among the most outrageous was a BP garage on the A1 near Sunderland, which was selling a litre of unleaded and diesel for 202.9p and 204.9p respectively. A Gulf petrol garage in Essex and another forecourt on the M6 in Cumbria were also selling fuel for more than £2-per-litre. Some businesses are already feeling the strain, with freight companies reporting that the cost of running one lorry is already up £20,000 on last year, leaving the haulage industry 'in crisis.' One small business owner in Manchester told MailOnline how his fuel costs have surged over the 12 months. Jon Randles, director of Proteger Protect, a stone and render cleaning firm, said: 'As a small business owner filling up my van three times a week and using diesel for my equipment, my weekly fuel costs are now in excess of £600 a week.' The RAC had already warned that 'frightening' petrol prices will exceed an average of 180p per litre in July in what it described as a 'national fuel crisis'. RAC fuel spokesman Mr Williams added: 'The wholesale price of diesel is fast approaching 160p a litre which, when you add 7p retailer margin and 20 per cent VAT, would take the pump price over the £2 mark. 'We strongly urge the Government to take drastic action to help soften the impact for drivers from these never-before-seen pump prices.' Lesley O'Brien, director of Freight Link Europe, told the BBC's Today programme: 'This certainly is a crisis as we've seen fuel prices escalate over the last year by 50 per cent and no sight of a stop, so we absolutely as an industry need to keep on top of this. 'As a country we need to understand we need to support our transport industry which is the infrastructure of the whole economy.' Ms O'Brien said fuel was a third of her business' running costs, adding that the cost of running a lorry has increased from around £41,000 to more than £61,000 since last year. She said her company added a fuel surcharge to its bills, to cover fluctuating prices. She added: 'But never before has it been so high,' she said. 'As an example, to run one of my artic vehicles is now costing me £20,000 more per year than in did last year.' AA fuel price spokesman Luke Bosdet said: 'Shock and awe is the only way to describe what has been happening at the pump during the half-term break. 'Little wonder that nearly half of drivers stayed at home for the Jubilee extended bank holiday. 'The forces behind the surge have been oil jumping back above 120 US dollars a barrel for the first time since late March, combined with petrol commodity prices being boosted by summer motoring demand.' Motorists took to social media to blast the surging fuel prices which are only worsening the ongoing cost of living crisis. The crisis has been compounded by Britain's soaring rate of inflation which reached 10.1 per cent in September, up from 9.9 per cent the previous month and matching the 40-year high that it hit in July. The grim figure was driven by a huge 14.5 per cent annual rise in food costs and came despite petrol prices coming down slightly. It is more than eight percentage points higher than the Bank of England's target and will pressurise the Monetary Policy Committee to hike interest rates when it meets in a fortnight. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the government will 'prioritise help for the most vulnerable' and take action to stabilise the economy, after he dramatically junked Liz Truss's tax-cutting plans. VAT, national insurance and income tax hikes are all understood to be off the table given previous pledges and Conservative Party manifesto commitments, while increasing fuel duty is likely to be seen as too risky in the middle of a cost of living crisis. It means the Treasury is likely to focus on 'stealth' measures such as freezing income tax thresholds for another two years. That would raise as much as £5 billion by dragging up to three million workers into higher tax bands. The income tax and national insurance thresholds were expected to be frozen until 2026, with the new plan extending this by at least two more years. It comes after it was revealed that Mr Hunt is looking at a 50:50 split between spending cuts and tax rises in the Autumn Statement, which was due to be delivered yesterday but was delayed so the new PM could get 'under the bonnet' of the plans. By contrast, George Osborne's austerity package after the financial crash was 80 per cent spending cuts and 20 per cent tax rises. The Telegraph reported that Mr Sunak and Mr Hunt have agreed to freeze the thresholds at which people start to pay the different rates of income tax and national insurance for the years ahead. Mr Hunt has already announced £32billion in tax rises as he sought to reassure the financial markets that the situation would be brought under control following the sacking of his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng. Insiders at the Treasury said that Mr Sunak and Mr Hunt agreed on Monday that while 'those with the broadest shoulders should be asked to bear the greatest burden', taxes would rise for everyone, the Financial Times reported. It is thought that extending a freeze on personal tax allowances could raise around £5 billion a year by 2027, the newspaper reported, with 'fiscal drag' possibly pulling people into higher tax brackets due to inflation. Funds could also be raised by Mr Sunak reverting back to his plan to raise National Insurance by £13 billion. However an ally of the Prime Minister admitted that it would be a political challenge to 'march everyone up a hill again when they've already been marched up and down it once before', the told the newspaper. Tory MPs have voted to raise it and cut it on different occasions. The PM will also look to make savings in the public sector, with a two per cent pay rise across the board during the next financial year, The Times reported. This would represent a real-term pay cut for teachers, soldiers, police officers and nurses as inflation is forecast to remain at a high of 9.5 per cent next year. This year, a five per cent pay rise prompted the threat of strikes across the public sector because the rate was below inflation. Speaking on a visit to a hospital in Croydon last week, the Prime Minister said he would act to 'protect the most vulnerable' as he tightens the nation's belt. But he said the eye-watering package was necessary to bring inflation under control and limit the looming rise in mortgage payments. 'The Chancellor has already said difficult decisions are going to have to be made and I'm going to sit down and work through those with him,' he said. 'But what I want everyone to know is that we need to do these things so that we can get our borrowing and debt back on a sustainable path. That's important because it means that we can get a grip of inflation if we do that. It means we can limit as best as possible the increase in interest rates, which is important. 'But as we do that, I want people to be reassured we will always do it with fairness at the heart, we will protect the most vulnerable and ensure that we can continue to grow the economy in the long run.' The Resolution Foundation think-tank said ministers will have to squeeze taxpayers and the public sector further because of a 'deteriorating economic outlook' and the legacy of Liz Truss's abandoned growth plans. A recession is likely next year while unemployment could rise by 500,000 and inflation is expected to remain higher for longer, it added. Foundation research director Mr Smith said: 'The central picture remains one of a weaker growth, higher borrowing costs and expensive tax cuts that have left a fiscal hole of at least £40 billion to fill. 'History tells us that this will involve cuts to public investment, which are easy to announce but reduce growth in the longer term. 'Further austerity for public services is also likely, but there are limits to how big these can credibly be, as public services are already facing cuts of £22 billion thanks to high inflation. 'This reality means that the Autumn Statement is likely to involve tax rises, not just spending cuts.' Among the 'menu' of options open to the Chancellor are cuts to investment spending, a move the Resolution Foundation said could save £10 billion but also have a detrimental impact on growth. The think tank also suggests the Government could try to choose the so-called 'austerity option'. Such a move would require cuts to already-squeezed department budgets. 'With inflation at its highest level for 40 years, Government departments are already seeing their budgets fall in real terms by around £22 billion by 2024-25. It is hard to see how the Treasury could credibly save more than £20 billion by announcing cuts to day-to-day public service spending,' the think tank said. The Resolution Foundation study suggests the new administration could save £9 billion by choosing not to raise benefits and pensions in line with rising prices next year. It said any such move would have a 'huge' impact on those struggling, with a low-income working family with two children losing around £750 and a pensioner £342. One option open to the Prime Minister and Chancellor would be to 'go full circle' on the mini-budget by reinstating the health and social care levy - a move that would raise £15 billion by 2026-27. Around £2 billion could also be raised by extending the 'stealth' freezes in income tax thresholds by a further year to 2026-27. The Treasury's warning came as Suella Braverman was fighting for survival on two fronts as she faces a row about overcrowding at the Manston migrant processing centre in Kent, and is contending with a continuing controversy over security breaches following her use of a personal email address to send official documents. The Home Secretary has come under pressure over the situation at Manston following reports she failed to act on legal advice that migrants were being detained for unlawfully long periods at the site. Mrs Braverman outlined how it costs taxpayers £6.8million a day to fund hotel accommodation for migrants and asylum seekers. As she spoke in the Commons, the Treasury warned that spending cuts will not be enough to raise the billions needed to balance the Government's books. The changes will be included in the Autumn Statement, due to be released on November 17. It will detail spending decisions for the next five years, with changes expected to be introduced at the start of the next financial year. 'Taxpayers will be horrified by talk of bigger bills to come,' chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, John O'Connell, told The Telegraph. 'With the tax burden at a 70-year high, Brits are being expected to bear the brunt of a spiralling cost of government crisis. The Chancellor must make significant savings to ease the strain on hard-pressed households.' It comes as spending concerns are raised around the NHS, with Government insiders believing that billions more are needed to clear a backlog caused by Covid-19, the paper reported. The fear is that without more money, the waiting lists will continue to lengthen, while inflation creates a shortfall in the existing budget."

'Drunk' conscripts batter each other unconscious in huge brawl at training barracks in extraordinary leaked footage revealing Russian army chaos","Vladimir Putin's conscripts have been filmed drunkenly battering each other in an alcohol-fuelled brawl at a training barracks ahead of their deployment to the battlefields of Ukraine. An extraordinary leaked video shows the 'drunk' soldiers punching each other, with some ending up unconscious on the floor during the fight at the barracks in Yurga, Siberia. The video shows Putin's army intelligence and military police dragging the unconscious troops, who are from the 74th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, along the street and away from the bloody brawl. The footage tallies with reports of low morale and drunkenness among Russian recruits and speaks to wider problems faced by Putin's military - poor command, discipline and organisation - that have plagued its war effort so far. A man, likely a Russian soldier, filming the brawl from a building overlooking the chaos, said: 'Mobilised men are fighting crowd on crowd. Look… they are even dragging some of them to the fields. 'Some are jumping over here across a fence. This is a really tough fight. Those who pass out are dragged away.' He added: 'They are beating each other really, really hard. They are just crushing the guys. Some needs assistance, help.' But the man then realised that military intelligence and police are involved, seeking to break up the fight. Some of the new recruits involved in the fight were held on the ground by the military police with their hands tied behind their backs. He said: 'These guys are from intelligence. They are knocking down [the mobilised soldiers]. 'They are taking some of them away to the parade ground. 'Some of the [mobilised) are getting taped. This is what they are doing to the drunks.' Separate footage shows how other 'drunk' conscripts from Putin's mobilisation drive are held in an iron cage. The soldiers - intended for Ukraine - are billeted at Kazan Expo International Exhibition Centre, normally a modern venue for congress and exhibition events. Colonel Vyacheslav Epifantsev refused to comment on why mobilised soldiers were held in the cage. But media reported it was for those who took to drink ahead of their posting to the frontline. There are complaints among Russian soldiers of equipment shortages, poor living conditions and scant training for new recruits. Since Putin announced the mobilization of 300,000 Russians on September 21, independent media, human rights activists and those called up have painted a bleak picture of a haphazard and chaotic effort to round up as many men as possible and push them quickly to the front lines, regardless of skill, training and equipment. Conscription protests have been harshly put down, and tens of thousands of men fled Russia to neighbouring countries to avoid being pressed into service. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday acknowledged persisting problems with equipment for the draftees, but 'vigorous measures taken to rectify the situation are already yielding the first positive results.' He said regional authorities are involved in providing 'the missing gear,' and now Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov 'is personally responsible for this' in a coordination council Putin has created. Russian media reported multiple deaths of reservists in Ukraine, with their relatives telling news outlets that they had received very little training. When asked by a reporter why several reservists had died in Ukraine only three weeks after being called up, Putin confirmed that training could last as few as 10 days and as many as 25. Military analyst Pavel Luzin said Russia isn't able to train hundreds of thousands of men. 'The army was not ready for mobilization. It never prepared for it,' he said. Putin has promised to finish the mobilization drive by November, when the regular fall draft is scheduled. Military experts and rights groups say enlistment offices and training camps can't process both at the same time, warning that the call-up may resume months later. As of mid-October, 222,000 reservists have been recruited, Putin said. Whether it will be possible to enlist another 80,000 in the remaining two weeks is unclear. To try to broaden the pool, the Russian parliament on Wednesday lifted a ban on mobilizing men who have been convicted of a grave criminal offense and who have been released from prison but whose convictions are still on the books."
2022-10-31,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11374077/Moscow-accuses-British-spies-trying-recruit-Russian-diplomats.html,Russia accuses British spies of trying to 'recruit' the military attache of Moscow's embassy in the Netherlands,"Moscow has summoned the Dutch ambassador to 'protest strongly' against the efforts of British spies to 'recruit' Russian diplomats in the Netherlands, Russia's foreign ministry said today. Ambassador Gilles Beschoor Plug was called in to hear the protest from the Kremlin, which claimed representatives of the British intelligence services 'made an attempt to recruit the military attache of Russia's embassy in The Hague on October 20'. 'Such provocative actions are unacceptable... and hinder the normal operation of Russian establishments abroad,' it added. The ministry also accused Western secret services of attempting several similar 'provocations' against Russian diplomats over recent years in the Netherlands. MailOnline has contacted the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) for comment. It comes just one week after Norway's security services arrested a man at the University of Tromsø who they believed was a Russian spy. NATO member Norway will raise its military readiness, its prime minister said on Monday, pointing to ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine as cause for greater caution. 'The military will as of tomorrow raise its preparedness in Norway', Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, whose nation shares a land border with Russia in the Arctic circle, told reporters. 'We currently have no reason to believe that Russia wants to involve Norway or any other country directly in the war, but the war in Ukraine means it is necessary for all NATO countries to be increasingly on their guard', he added. Norway has overtaken Russia as Europe's main natural gas supplier following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The Scandinavian country has already raised security around its strategic sites after mysterious drone flights were observed near its offshore oil and gas platforms and the suspected sabotage of Nord Stream's Baltic Sea pipelines. Russia's foreign ministry cited numerous examples of incidences in which Western powers allegedly attempted to entice Russian diplomats into sharing sensitive information. Representatives of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) made an approach 'in a park' in December 2018 to a Russian diplomat with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the ministry charged. The following December, CIA agents tried at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport to 'encourage' an attache from Russia's embassy to 'cooperate', the statement said. Moscow accused authorities in the Netherlands of being complicit in 'these illegitimate acts'. It listed another case in April when 'members of Dutch special services tried to recruit three Russian diplomats who had earlier been declared personae non gratae,' ahead of their expulsion. In July 2020, in The Hague, 'surveillance equipment was discovered in the car of a (Russian) embassy diplomat, according to the statement. Russia urged 'Dutch authorities to refrain from these hostile acts which lead to a subsequent degradation in bilateral relations'. The Hague should take 'comprehensive measures to prevent such incidents in the future', it said. Russia's military offensive in Ukraine has led to a wave of international condemnation and sanctions backed by the expulsion of hundreds of Russian diplomats from Western nations, some accused of spying. Moscow has responded by sending home dozens of Western diplomats. The Kremlin's protest against alleged attempts by Western powers to recruit its diplomats follows the arrest of a suspected Russian spy in the Arctic town of Tromsø by Norwegian police. The man, who worked as a researcher at the University of Tromsø, had posed as a Brazilian citizen but police believe his real identity to be Russian. The man, who went by the name of José Assis Giammaria but whose real name is believed to be Mikhail Mikhushin, represents a 'threat to fundamental national interests' and should be expelled from Norway, deputy Norwegian police security service (PST) chief Hedvig Moe said, describing him as an 'illegal agent'. An illegal agent is an intelligence operative without official government links who assumes a covert persona, often using a real, dead person's identity. 'Typically illegal agents are talent scouts recruiting agents for later, and preparing the ground for other spies to do traditional intelligence work,' said Moe. The accused man's lawyer did not return a request for comment. The suspect was involved in a research group that worked with Norwegian government agencies on 'hybrid threats' linked to 'Arctic Norway', Moe said. The arrest was made possible with the collaboration of 'several' international security services, declining to say from which countries. 'It is a long-term project to have an illegal agent,' said Moe. It costs a lot of money. Major state actors only use them and it is known Russia has used them in the past.'"

Ukrainian forces have been making gains across Russian-occupied areas, with fighting intensifying in the country's east and in the southern city of Kherson. In a blow to Putin's invasion, 950 Russian soldiers were killed on Sunday, pushing the Russian death toll up to at least 71,200, Kyiv has claimed. And in yet another example of his forces' incompetence, video shows panic-stricken Russian soldiers fleeing a Ukrainian attack on an armoured vehicle - only for it to flip over and fling the troops into the air. Footage, apparently from Kherson, shows Russian soldiers running towards an armoured vehicle as Ukrainian missiles rain down on them. The soldiers scramble on top of the armoured vehicle and are seen smiling as they speed off down a road away from the attack. But the vehicle then veers to the right and into a ditch, causing the troopers- no longer smiling - to scream in fear. The driver quickly steers to the left, but the speeding vehicle flips over - flinging the troops on to the road below them. The video then cuts out. It comes as as Russia tries to round up as many men as possible and quickly push them to the front lines, regardless of skill, training and equipment. The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in its latest intelligence briefing that Russia has deployed several thousand newly mobilised reservists to the front line in Ukraine - but in many cases they are 'poorly equipped'. 'In September, Russian officers were concerned that some recently mobilised reservists were arriving in Ukraine without weapons,' the MoD said in its Monday morning briefing. For those Russian soldiers who are turning up with weapons, they are often being issued AKM rifles, which fires 7.62 mm ammunition. This is different to the ammunition required in the rifles issued to Russia's regular combat units. 'The integration of reservists with contract soldiers and combat veterans in Ukraine will mean Russian logisticians will have to push two types of small arms ammunition to front line positions, rather than one,' the MoD added. It continued: 'This will likely further complicate Russia's already strained logistics systems.' Since Putin announced the mobilisation of 300,000 Russians on September 21, independent media, human rights activists and those called up have painted a bleak picture of a haphazard and chaotic effort to call up reservists. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov last week acknowledged persisting problems with equipment for the draftees, but 'vigorous measures taken to rectify the situation are already yielding the first positive results'. He said regional authorities are involved in providing 'the missing gear,' and now deputy prime minister Denis Manturov 'is personally responsible for this' in a coordination council Putin has created.

Putin has promised to finish the call-up drive by November, when the regular autumn draft is scheduled. Military experts and rights groups say enlistment offices and training camps can't process both at the same time, warning that mobilisation may resume months later. As of mid-October, 222,000 reservists have been recruited, Putin said. Whether it will be possible to enlist another 80,000 in the remaining two weeks is unclear. To try to broaden the pool, the Russian parliament on Wednesday lifted a ban on mobilising men who have been convicted of a grave criminal offense and who have been released from prison but whose convictions are still on the books. It comes as NATO member Norway will raise its military readiness, its prime minister said today, pointing to ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine as cause for greater caution. 'The military will as of tomorrow raise its preparedness in Norway', Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, whose nation shares a land border with Russia in the Arctic circle, told reporters. 'We currently have no reason to believe that Russia wants to involve Norway or any other country directly in the war, but the war in Ukraine means it is necessary for all NATO countries to be increasingly on their guard', he added. Norway has overtaken Russia as Europe's main natural gas supplier following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The Scandinavian country has already raised security around its strategic sites after mysterious drone flights were observed near its offshore oil and gas platforms and the suspected sabotage of Nord Stream's Baltic Sea pipelines. Meanwhile in Ukraine, a massive barrage of Russian strikes hit critical infrastructure in Kyiv, Kharkiv and other cities on Monday morning, knocking out water and power supplies in apparent retaliation for what Moscow alleged was a Ukrainian attack on its Black Sea Fleet over the weekend. Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's power plants and other key infrastructure as the war enters its ninth month. Large parts of Ukraine are already experiencing rolling power cuts as a result. Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces carried out 'strikes with long-range high-precision air and sea-based weapons against the military command and energy systems of Ukraine'. 'The goals of the strikes were achieved. All designated targets were hit,' the ministry said in a statement. Ukraine's air force said it shot down 44 of more than 50 cruise missiles that were launched by Russia. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Russian missiles and drones hit 10 Ukrainian regions and damaged 18 objects, mostly energy facilities. Hundreds of localities in seven Ukrainian regions were left without power, he said in a Facebook post, adding that 'the consequences could have been much worse' if the Ukrainian forces hadn't shot down most of the Russian missiles. Thirteen people were wounded as a result of morning attacks, the head of National Police Ihor Klymenko said on national television. Loud explosions were heard across the Ukrainian capital in the early morning as residents prepared to go to work. The emergency services sent out text message warnings about the threat of a missile attack, and air raid sirens wailed for three hours during the morning commute time. 'The Kremlin is taking revenge for military failures on peaceful people who are left without electricity and heat before the winter,' Kyiv regional governor Oleksii Kuleba said. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said 80 per cent of consumers in the city of three million people were left without water supplies because of the damage to a power facility. Local authorities were working on restoring the supplies as soon as possible, Klitschko said, telling Kyiv residents in the meantime to 'stock up on water from the nearest pump rooms and points of sale.' Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of President Volodymyr Zelensky, vowed that the attacks on civilian facilities would not weaken Ukraine's resistance. 'We will persevere, and generations of Russians will pay a high price for their disgrace,' Yermak said. The attacks occurred just before Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and many top members of his government, including the foreign, defense and interior ministers, arrived in Kyiv in the latest show of support from European leaders for Ukraine. 'The Ukrainians are fighting not only for their country but also for the whole of Europe. Our support must continue,' Fiala tweeted from Kyiv. Smoke was seen rising from the left bank of the Dnieper River in Kyiv, either from a missile strike or where it was shot down by Ukrainian forces. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, two strikes hit critical infrastructure facilities, according to authorities, and the subway ceased operating. The Lviv region in western Ukraine was also targeted, but the missiles were shot down, Lviv governor Maksym Kozytskyy said. The attack comes two days after Russia accused Ukraine of a drone attack against Russia's Black Sea Fleet off the coast of the annexed Crimean Peninsula. Ukraine has denied the attack, saying that Russia mishandled its own weapons, but Moscow still announced halting its participation in a UN and Turkey-brokered deal to allow safe passage of ships carrying grain from Ukraine. But 12 ships loaded with grain still left Ukraine's ports this morning despite Russia withdrawing from the pact granting them safe passage through the Black Sea. Tracking data showed the vessels departing ports around Odesa, in southern Ukraine, and heading out across a stretch of heavily-mined sea towards the Bosphorus Strait and onwards to the Mediterranean Sea. Turkey and the United Nations said teams had inspected the vessels and were watching over them after Russia withdrew from a pact allowing grain shipments out of Ukraine and said it could 'no longer guarantee' their safety. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country was determined to press forward with the grain deal, which has allowed more than nine million tons of grain to be exported from Ukraine. Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said he would speak by phone with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu later on Monday to ensure the deal continues. 'The suspension of the agreement affects all humanity. We remind the parties concerned to reconsider their decisions,' Akar said. 'Those in need were already urgently awaiting the grains. The situation will only get worse.' Meanwhile, a Ukrainian great-grandmother has described how a Russian soldier raped and beat her until dawn after he burst into her home. Lyudmila, 75, detailed how the Russian soldier punched her so hard that he broke her nose and knocked out two of her teeth before he beat her with his rifle. The great-grandmother said the soldier, who was in his 60s, threw her on to the sofa and strangled her before he maimed her after he broke into her home in the village of Myroliubivka, near Kherson. Lyudmila, her voice cracking with emotion, said the soldier then ripped off her clothes and raped her. She still has the scars from where the rapist cut her stomach. 'The deep ones still haven't healed,' Lyudmila told Radio 4's Today programme. Lyudmila's horrific ordeal - and the testimonies of hundreds of other Ukrainian women - shows how Russian soldiers have used rape as a weapon of war in the eight months since the invasion began. The 75-year-old, detailing the hours of abuse at the hands of the Russian soldier, said: 'One night, I heard a very loud knock at my window. I saw a soldier there. 'When I opened the door, he immediately punched me in the face, knocked out two of my teeth and broke my nose. I was covered with blood.' Lyudmila, who later fled her home with her family, continued: 'He started beating me in the chest with his rifle butt. He pulled my hair, threw me on to the sofa and began to strangle me. 'Then he began to undress me and after, he raped me.' The great-grandmother added: 'He cut my stomach. Until now, I have scars on my stomach. The deep ones still haven't healed.' The soldier beat Lyudmila for hours and sprayed the room with bullets. He left at dawn. Recalling what she was thinking as she endured the hours of abuse, Lyudmila said: 'I said goodbye to my children, my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren. 'I never thought I would stay alive. Putin and the Russians will never be forgiven. There will be no forgiveness.'"

'The military will as of tomorrow raise its preparedness in Norway', Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, whose nation shares a land border with Russia in the Arctic circle, told reporters. 'We currently have no reason to believe that Russia wants to involve Norway or any other country directly in the war, but the war in Ukraine means it is necessary for all NATO countries to be increasingly on their guard', he added. Norway has overtaken Russia as Europe's main natural gas supplier following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The Scandinavian country has already raised security around its strategic sites after mysterious drone flights were observed near its offshore oil and gas platforms and the suspected sabotage of Nord Stream's Baltic Sea pipelines. In recent weeks, several Russians have been arrested in Norway for illegally flying drones in its airspace or violating photo restrictions in restricted areas. Last week, Norway's counter-intelligence service also announced the arrest of a man suspected of being a Russian undercover agent, who according to experts could be a senior officer from the GRU military intelligence service. 'I must stress that nothing has happened in the last day or days that has prompted us to raise our preparedness now. It is an evolution over time which has led us to take this step', Store said. Missile debris landed in the northern Moldovan village of Naslavcea on Monday morning after a Russian fusillade was intercepted by air defences in neighbouring Ukraine, Moldova's Interior Ministry said. No one was reported hurt but the windows of several residential homes were shattered in Naslavcea, which lies on the border with Ukraine, the ministry said in a statement. The Russian strike had targeted a Ukrainian dam on the Nistru river that runs through Ukraine and Moldova, Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu tweeted. 'Attacks on water infrastructure and ensuing stress on the river could put the entire region in danger of floods,' he said, condemning Russian aggression against Ukraine 'in the strongest possible terms'. Russia fired dozens of missiles at Ukraine on Monday, Ukrainian officials said. The Moldovan Defence Ministry said its radars had not detected any illegal flights in its air space and that the debris from the missile had not been picked up because of the size of the shrapnel. Defence Minister Bjorn Arild Gram meanwhile said the increased military preparedness would include measures related to logistics, communications security and security at military installations. Amid rising tensions between Russia and the West, Norway has already boosted its military budget and intelligence efforts in Northern Norway, where it shares a 123-mile border with Russia. The move to boost military readiness comes after a fresh wave of brutal Russian attacks early this morning left Ukraine's capital without water and suffering power cuts this morning. Vitaliy Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, said 80 per cent of his city was cut off from water and 350,000 homes had no power after Russian cruise missiles hit key infrastructure sites - with witnesses reporting five explosions. Kharkiv, Dnipro, Cherkasy and Zaporizhzhia were also hit - causing power cuts. More than 50 cruise missiles were fired by Russian strategic bombers with 44 of the projectiles shot down, Kyiv's commanders said. It comes two days after Russia's Black Sea fleet was damaged by explosive-laden drones in an attack blamed on Ukraine. Kyiv regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba also said one person was wounded and a number of houses were damaged in this morning's attack. In Kharkiv, two strikes hit critical infrastructure facilities, according to the authorities, and the subway stopped working. Officials also warned about possible power outages in the city of Zaporizhzhia from the strikes there. Critical infrastructure objects were also hit in the Cherkasy region, and explosions were reported in other regions. In Vinnytsia, a missile that was shot down landed on civilian buildings, resulting in damage but no casualties, according to regional governor Serhiy Borzov. Parts of the country's rail network were also cut off from power, Ukrainian Railways reported. Russia has been targeting civilian infrastructure, including electricity and water supplies, in an apparent attempt to freeze Ukrainians in their homes as winter hits. Facing setbacks on the battlefield, Moscow seems to be targeting civilians to break their will to continue the war. Such attacks are war crimes, under international law. It comes after a weekend in which Russia blamed Ukraine for a drone attack on its Black Sea fleet. Moscow has since withdrawn its support for ships taking grain out of Ukraine's ports and into world markets, saying it could 'no longer guarantee their safety'."
2022-10-31,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11373591/Biden-lost-temper-Zelensky-told-appreciative-June-phone-call.html,"Biden lost his temper with Zelensky and told him to 'be more appreciative' when he asked for more than the $1billion in aid the US had given Ukraine during a June phone call, report claims","President Joe Biden lost his temper with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and told him to be more appreciative of the billions in military aid the U.S. had given Ukraine in a testy phone call in June, a new report claims. A new NBC report says that Biden had 'barely finished telling Zelensky he's greenlighted another $1 billion in military assistance when Zelenskyy started listing all the additional help he needed and wasn't getting.' Biden then reportedly lost it, according to sources familiar with the call. Raising his voice, he told Zelensky the Americans had been quite generous and his administration and the military were working hard for Ukraine. He told the Ukrainian leader he show a little more appreciation. The aid was publicly announced an Zelensky released a statement thanking the U.S. for the package. The Biden-Zelensky relationship has only improved since then, according to people familiar, and there have been subsequent phone calls and aid packages. But the frustration is indicative of Biden's awareness that public support for dumping billions into a war across the globe could begin to wane. U.S. aid to Ukraine has surpassed $65 billion, around $15 billion of that in military aid coming from the Pentagon. Republicans have already warned they won't be offering a 'blank check' to Ukraine, as GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy put it. Earlier this month Biden expressed concerns that if Republicans took back Congress aid money would dry up. Biden and the less isolationist members of both parties have already discussed ramming through as much as $50 billion in Ukraine funding to an omnibus spending bill that they'd pass before a new Congress is sworn-in in January. 'These guys don't get it. It's a lot bigger than Ukraine. It's Eastern Europe. It's NATO. It's really serious, serious consequential outcomes,' Biden said earlier this month of Republicans who want to turn off the spigot of aid dollars. As of Monday morning Ukraine's capital has been left largely without water and suffering power cuts this morning after Russia unleashed another missile barrage on major cities. Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, said 80 per cent of his city has been left without water and 350,000 homes have no power after Russian cruise missiles hit key infrastructure sites - with witnesses reporting five explosions. Kharkiv, in the north, Dnipro and Cherkasy, in central Ukraine, and the southern city of Zaporizhzhia were also hit - causing power cuts. More than 50 cruise missiles were fired by Russian strategic bombers with 44 of the projectiles shot down, Kyiv's commanders said. It comes two days after Russia's Black Sea fleet was damaged by explosive-laden drones in an attack blamed on Ukraine.

2022-10-31,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11372705/Britons-face-pain-pumps-experts-fear-price-diesel-hit-record-2-litre-soon.html,Britons face more pain at the pumps as experts fear price of diesel could hit record £2-A-LITRE before Christmas with average cost now hitting 190.12p,"Struggling Britons are to face more pain at the pumps as the price of diesel continues to skyrocket, sparking fresh fears it could hit an all-time high before Christmas. Can you not afford to fuel your car anymore? Is the price of diesel crippling your finances? Email tom.cotterill@mailonline.co.uk The average cost of a litre of the fuel at UK forecourts on Monday was an eye-watering 190.12p, according to the RAC Fuel Watch, with one Tesco in Cambridge selling diesel for a whopping 197.9p. It's the first time diesel has topped £1.90 since it hit a crippling record high back in July of 199.05p, leading to warnings by the RAC of an imminent 'national fuel crisis'. The soaring prices come as hard-pressed families continue to battle the cost-of-living crisis, which has seen inflation balloon to a bank-busting 10.1 per cent as food prices continue to spiral due to the war in Ukraine. The latest spike in fuel means fed-up motorists will need to splurge out £104.57 to fill the average 55-litre diesel tank - £23.46 more than this time last year, when the average cost was 147.48p per litre, or £81.11 to fill a tank. RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: 'RAC Fuel Watch data shows the gap between the average price of petrol and diesel now stands at a record 24p a litre. As of Thursday, drivers were paying an average of 166p for unleaded while diesel has climbed to above 190p. 'Following the announcement from oil producer group OPEC+ early this month that it was cutting production by two million barrels a day, the wholesale price of refined fuel has increased as a result of oil trading well above $90 having previously been below that mark at the end of last month. 'Since OPEC and its allies agreed to reduce oil supply substantially we’ve seen the price of the average price of diesel going up by almost 10p a litre and petrol by nearly 3p. 'Sadly, for diesel drivers, the situation could yet get worse with prices now back above 190p a litre for the first time since the beginning of August. Hopefully the average price record of 199p for a litre of diesel set in late June won’t be surpassed. 'The price hikes have added £5 to a tank of diesel and nearly £2 to a full petrol fill-up. Due to the war in Ukraine and the UK moving away from Russian diesel, the cost of buying in wholesale diesel from other countries has gone up considerably.' Fuel prices have been driven up over the last few months by the war in Ukraine and moves to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian oil. But diesel has seen far steeper hike in prices than unleaded, with the average cost per litre of petrol remaining at 166.17p. Financial expert Robert Alster, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said diesel was soaring ahead of petrol as it was used not just for transport but to power generators, too. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 this morning, Mr Alster warned the combination of the war in Ukraine and soaring living costs would continue to drive up inflation and punish family finances. 'It’s adding all to a general inflationary higher level than we have seen before,' he said. 'Obviously, it’s been caused by the conflict of Russia and Ukraine. But even allowing for that, it’s shortages driven by Covid, supply chain issues, geopolitical issues between the US and China.' In July, motorists were hit with huge prices at the pumps, with some paying as much as £2 per litre for petrol and diesel. Among the most outrageous was a BP garage on the A1 near Sunderland, which was selling a litre of unleaded and diesel for 202.9p and 204.9p respectively. A Gulf petrol garage in Essex and another forecourt on the M6 in Cumbria were also selling fuel for more than £2-per-litre. Some businesses are already feeling the strain, with freight companies reporting that the cost of running one lorry is already up £20,000 on last year, leaving the haulage industry 'in crisis.' One small business owner in Manchester told MailOnline how his fuel costs have surged over the 12 months. Jon Randles, director of Proteger Protect, a stone and render cleaning firm, said: 'As a small business owner filling up my van three times a week and using diesel for my equipment, my weekly fuel costs are now in excess of £600 a week.' The RAC had already warned that 'frightening' petrol prices will exceed an average of 180p per litre in July in what it described as a 'national fuel crisis'. RAC fuel spokesman Mr Williams added: 'The wholesale price of diesel is fast approaching 160p a litre which, when you add 7p retailer margin and 20 per cent VAT, would take the pump price over the £2 mark. 'We strongly urge the Government to take drastic action to help soften the impact for drivers from these never-before-seen pump prices.' Lesley O'Brien, director of Freight Link Europe, told the BBC's Today programme: 'This certainly is a crisis as we've seen fuel prices escalate over the last year by 50 per cent and no sight of a stop, so we absolutely as an industry need to keep on top of this. 'As a country we need to understand we need to support our transport industry which is the infrastructure of the whole economy.' Ms O'Brien said fuel was a third of her business' running costs, adding that the cost of running a lorry has increased from around £41,000 to more than £61,000 since last year. She said her company added a fuel surcharge to its bills, to cover fluctuating prices. She added: 'But never before has it been so high,' she said. 'As an example, to run one of my artic vehicles is now costing me £20,000 more per year than in did last year.' AA fuel price spokesman Luke Bosdet said: 'Shock and awe is the only way to describe what has been happening at the pump during the half-term break. 'Little wonder that nearly half of drivers stayed at home for the Jubilee extended bank holiday. 'The forces behind the surge have been oil jumping back above 120 US dollars a barrel for the first time since late March, combined with petrol commodity prices being boosted by summer motoring demand.' Motorists took to social media today to blast the surging fuel prices which are only worsening the ongoing cost of living crisis. The crisis has been compounded by Britain's soaring rate of inflation. which reached 10.1 per cent in September, up from 9.9 per cent the previous month and matching the 40-year high that it hit in July. The grim figure was driven by a huge 14.5 per cent annual rise in food costs and came despite petrol prices coming down slightly. It is more than eight percentage points higher than the Bank of England's target and will pressurise the Monetary Policy Committee to hike interest rates when it meets in a fortnight. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the government will 'prioritise help for the most vulnerable' and take action to stabilise the economy, after he dramatically junked Liz Truss's tax-cutting plans. But ministers are facing fury after it emerged they could scrap the triple lock on pensions as part of a desperate £40billion squeeze on spending. The rule increases in line with the highest out of the September inflation rate, earnings or 2.5 per cent. Only lifting pensions in line with earnings from April would mean the elderly getting £434 less a year, saving the Treasury around £4.5billion. Benefits are also typically increased in line with the September inflation figure, with the government also looking at cutting spending by downgrading that to earnings. Meanwhile. in Ukraine, the Russian blockade of grain exports continues to impact the cost of food. Twelve ships loaded with grain left Ukraine's ports this morning despite Russia withdrawing from a pact granting them safe passage through the Black Sea. Tracking data showed the vessels departing ports around Odesa, in southern Ukraine, and heading out across a stretch of heavily-mined sea towards the Bosphorus Strait and onwards to the Mediterranean Sea. Turkey and the United Nations said teams had inspected the vessels and were watching over them after Russia withdrew from a pact allowing grain shipments out of Ukraine and said it could 'no longer guarantee' their safety. It came after a fleet of drones attacked Russia's Black Sea fleet on Saturday in an attack which it said targeted warships involved in protecting the grain convoys. The Kremlin blamed Ukraine for the strikes. 'Civilian cargo ships can never be a military target or held hostage. The food must flow,' tweeted Amir M. Abdulla, UN coordinator for the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed on Monday that his country will continue to provide security to the ships - which contain vital food for developing countries, many in the Middle East. The last time there were widespread food shortages in the region, it helped to spark the Arab Spring which caused widespread unrest and millions of refugees to flee to Turkey. 'Even if Russia behaves hesitantly because it didn't receive the same benefits, we will continue decisively our efforts to serve humanity,' Erdogan said in a speech. The UN and Turkey say they plan to inspect a total of 40 vessels scheduled to depart on Monday. Hundreds of thousands of tons of wheat booked for delivery to Africa and the Middle East are at risk following Russia's withdrawal, while Ukrainian corn exports to Europe will get knocked lower, two Singapore-based traders said. 'If I have to replace a vessel which was due to come from Ukraine, what are the options? Not much really,' said one Singapore-based grain trader who supplies wheat to buyers in Asia and the Middle East.'"

Recalling what she was thinking as she endured the hours of abuse, Lyudmila said: 'I said goodbye to my children, my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren. 'I never thought I would stay alive. Putin and the Russians will never be forgiven. There will be no forgiveness.' Since Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine began, Russian troops have raped scores of women and girls - leading some to consider suicide. A horrifying and damning UN report earlier this month detailed how Russian soldiers gang-raped a 22-year-old Ukrainian mother, sexually abused her husband and made the couple have sex in front of them before raping their four-year-old daughter. The heart-wrenching report revealed how Russian troops, while occupying a village in the Chernihiv region, also raped an 83-year-old woman in her house in front of her physically disabled husband. In many cases, the Russian troops would shoot dead the women's husbands - or threaten to do so - as soon as they tried to defend their wives and stop them from being raped. Rape has historically been used as a weapon of war - in Bosnia in 1992, Rwanda in 1994 and Darfur in 2003 to name but a few instances. Russian soldiers have also been known to use rape as a weapon of war in the past. The Soviet Red Army soldiers raped an estimated two million German women after the fall of Hitler's Third Reich at the end of the Second World War. The true scale of wartime rape - and now in Ukraine - will continue to remain unknown as many women remain silent about their experiences for fear of being stigmatised. Systematic mass rape campaigns use forced impregnation as a tool to ethnically cleanse a nation and psychologically traumatise generations of people. The children born as a result of this wartime rape are often stigmatised themselves as they become a 'living reminder of the conflict', academics say. Russia invaded Ukraine in February as Putin ordered what was supposed to be a days-long 'special military operation' to topple the government. But he now finds himself bogged down in an eight-month long war that looks set to continue for months longer at least, and suffering huge losses. Ukrainian resistance has proved fiercer than almost all observers expected, and has been spurred on by atrocities that Russian troops have committed in occupied areas. In April, after Putin's men withdrew from areas around the capital Kyiv, mass graves with bodies of hundreds of civilians were uncovered. Survivors of the occupation told how Russian soldiers hunted down anyone suspected of working with the government or military to interrogate and torture - some were ultimately killed. Others told how soldiers came to their homes, beat or raped them, stole, and then fled as Ukraine's forces advanced. Kyiv argues Moscow is fighting a genocidal war aimed at wiping out their national identity by murdering innocents, deporting people into Russia and systemic rapes. Putin denies that his armed forces are deliberately targeting civilians."

It came after a fleet of drones attacked Russia's Black Sea fleet on Saturday in an attack which it said targeted warships involved in protecting the grain convoys. The Kremlin blamed Ukraine for the strikes. A British veteran now serving with the Ukrainian armed forces has been praised for his bravery after Russia missiles blew up a training base. Dan Ridley, 27, a former private in The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment, told how five Russian S-300 missiles struck the base at the weekend. Mr Ridley told The Sun how he and six other Britons were training Ukrainian troops at the base when it was struck. Despite the terrifying ordeal, nobody was injured and Mr Ridley has vowed to keep on working in Ukraine. That earned him the praise of President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said that 'neither rain nor even missiles get in the way' of the training drills. 'Civilian cargo ships can never be a military target or held hostage. The food must flow,' tweeted Amir M. Abdulla, UN coordinator for the Black Sea Grain Initiative.

'If I have to replace a vessel which was due to come from Ukraine, what are the options? Not much really,' said one Singapore-based grain trader who supplies wheat to buyers in Asia and the Middle East. Chicago wheat futures on Monday jumped more than 5 per cent and corn rose over 2 per cent from the fears over supplies. Earlier this year global wheat prices jumped to an all-time high and corn hit a ten-year top as Russia's invasion fuelled a rally set off by adverse weather and Covid supply disruptions. Australia, a key wheat supplier to Asia, is unlikely to be able to fill any supply gap, with shipping slots booked right up to February, traders said. Shares in Australia's GrainCorp - which posted a five-fold jump in H1 profit due to supply constraints arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict - rose more than 7 per cent. No ships moved through the established maritime humanitarian corridor on Sunday. But the United Nations, Turkey and Ukraine pressed ahead and agreed on a transit plan for Monday for 16 vessels to move forward, despite the withdrawal of Russia. 'We have to see how the situation unfolds. It is not clear if Ukraine will continue to ship grains and what happens to Russian exports,' said the Singapore-based grains trader. Asian buyers booking Ukrainian wheat cargoes include Indonesia, the world's second-largest importer of the grain, although the region typically relies on Australia and North America. In recent deals, Indonesian millers bought four cargoes or around 200,000 tons of Ukrainian wheat for November shipment, in deals signed over the last few weeks, traders said. Some Vietnamese feed mills that bought Ukrainian wheat are also likely to suffer. Last week, a government agency in Pakistan bought about 385,000 tons of wheat in a tender likely to be sourced from Russia and Ukraine. 'We are not sure if Russia will continue to export wheat or it will be safe for vessels carrying Russian wheat to ship from the Black Sea even as Ukrainian exports remain blocked,' said a second Singapore-based trader at an international company. Ukraine's corn exports to Europe booked for November are likely to be hit as well. 'As far as Europe is concerned, corn is a bigger issue than wheat as we are getting into peak season for Ukrainian corn in November,' said the second trader. Russia's decision is expected to support world vegetable oil prices as it threatens Ukraine's sunflower oil exports to key destinations, including top edible oil importer India. Malaysian palm oil futures jumped more than 4 per cent on Monday. Under the UN-brokered grains deal, a Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) made up of UN, Turkish, Russian and Ukrainian officials agrees on the movement of ships and inspects the vessels. More than 9.5million tons of corn, wheat, sunflower products, barley, rapeseed and soy have been exported from the Black Sea since July. Although global agricultural commodity prices have come off record highs in recent months, local retail food prices remain high and now face further upside. 'Typically, it takes about two months for higher grain prices to filter through the supply chain and impact consumers at the retail level,' said a Sydney-based analyst. 'But food processors do not have much forward coverage, so it is likely to be a lot quicker.'"

Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, said 80 per cent of his city has been left without water and 350,000 homes have no power after Russian cruise missiles hit key infrastructure sites - with witnesses reporting five explosions. Kharkiv, in the north, Dnipro and Cherkasy, in central Ukraine, and the southern city of Zaporizhzhia were also hit - causing power cuts. More than 50 cruise missiles were fired by Russian strategic bombers with 44 of the projectiles shot down, Kyiv's commanders said. It comes two days after Russia's Black Sea fleet was damaged by explosive-laden drones in an attack blamed on Ukraine. Kyiv regional governor Oleksii Kuleba also said one person was wounded and a number of houses were damaged in this morning's attack. In Kharkiv, two strikes hit critical infrastructure facilities, according to the authorities, and the subway stopped working. Officials also warned about possible power outages in the city of Zaporizhzhia from the strikes there. Critical infrastructure objects were also hit in the Cherkasy region, and explosions were reported in other regions. In the Kirovohrad region of central Ukraine, an energy facility was struck, according to local authorities. In Vinnytsia, a missile that was shot down landed on civilian buildings, resulting in damage but no casualties, according to regional governor Serhii Borzov. Parts of the country's rail network were also cut off from power, Ukrainian Railways reported. Russia has been targeting civilian infrastructure, including electricity and water supplies, in an apparent attempt to freeze Ukrainians in their homes as winter hits. Facing setbacks on the battlefield, Moscow seems to be targeting civilians to break their will to continue the war. Such attacks are war crimes, under international law. It comes after a weekend in which Russia blamed Ukraine for a drone attack on its Black Sea fleet. Moscow has since withdrawn its support for ships taking grain out of Ukraine's ports and into world markets, saying it could 'no longer guarantee their safety'. Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, added: 'Another batch of Russian missiles hits Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. 'Instead of fighting on the battlefield, Russia fights civilians. 'Don’t justify these attacks by calling them a ""response"". Russia does this because it still has the missiles and the will to kill Ukrainians.' Russia said Saturday's attack, at the Crimean port of Sevastopol, involved nine drones which damaged one warship. Footage released over the weekend appeared to give a drone's-eye-view of the attack - closing in on a warship as a helicopter attempted to blow the drone up. Another piece of black-and-white footage seemed to reveal the moment a ship was struck, with an explosion lighting up the night sky. Moscow claimed all of the ships targeted were involved in the mission to allow grain ships to navigate the heavily-mined waters of the Black Sea and transport food to global markets, where it is used to feed some of the world's poorest. As a result, the Kremlin said it was withdrawing support for the mission. However, Kyiv - with support from Turkey - plans to push ahead with fresh shipments today amid fears the vessels could come under attack."
2022-10-31,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11374399/Biden-considering-imposing-windfall-tax-energy-companys-profits.html,Biden says oil company profits are 'outrageous' and a 'windfall' from the Ukraine War: President says 'enough is enough' and execs should be paying higher taxes if they don't reduce prices at the pump,"President Joe Biden railed against Big Oil's exorbitant profits as he called on Congress to impose a 'windfall tax' on energy companies in a speech Monday. 'Oil companies' record profits today are not because they're doing something new or innovative,' Biden said in remarks at the White House. 'Their profits are a windfall of war. The windfall from the brutal conflict is ravaging Ukraine and hurting tens of millions of people around the globe.' Biden announced that he would work with Congress on a tax targeted at what he deems 'excess' profits, but did not lay out the details. 'Every company is entitled to a fair return for the work they do or innovation they generate. But I mean profits so high it's hard to believe,' the president quipped. Last week Exxon Mobil broke records with its profits in the third quarter, raking in $19.66 billion in net income - nearly triple its Q3 profits of last year - and Chevron had $11.23 billion in profits, almost reaching the record profits it attained in the prior quarter. Biden said that if oil companies had been making the 'average profits' they've been making from refining oil over the last 20 years gas prices would be an average of 50 percent lower right now. 'If they were investing their profits and historic rates in their US operations, then America would be producing more oil today. The prices would be down even further. But rather than increasing our investments in America, or giving Americans a break, their excess profits are going back to their shareholders, buying back their stocks and the executive pays are gonna skyrocket and give me a break -- enough is enough,' Biden said. The president is seeking to combat high gas prices eight days before the midterm election that will decide if Democrats remain in control of Congress, as stubborn inflation figures have been weighing on their poll numbers. Biden has tried making both oil companies and Russian President Vladimir Putin the boogeyman as he tries to bring down prices at the pump. He's blamed Putin's invasion of the Ukraine but he's also attacked Big Oil for not releasing enough crude and for its record profit margin. 'Oil companies made billions in profits this quarter,' Biden tweeted on Saturday. 'They're using these record profits to pay out their wealthy shareholders instead of investing in production and lowering costs for Americans. It's unacceptable. It's time for these companies to bring down prices at the pump.' High prices at the pump have exacerbated inflation and hurt Biden's approval rating. Voters give him low marks for his handling of the economy. Congress would have to approve any additional taxes on the energy producers - which would be a tall order in the current Congress where Democrats have narrow control of the House and Senate, and even less likely should Republicans retake one or both chambers on Nov. 8. 'President Biden loves to raise taxes. He and Senate Democrats have worked purposely for months to increase energy costs,' Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., ranking member on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a disapproving statement on the proposal. 'President Biden should follow the law and hold required American oil and gas lease sales. He should issue a robust five-year plan. That's the right way to unleash American energy production and lower prices for American families.' United Kingdom lawmakers in July imposed a 25 percent windfall tax on oil and gas producers in the British North Sea that was expected to raise 5 billion pounds ($5.95 billion) in one year to help people struggling with soaring energy bills. Biden has been attacking oil executives' profits for months and last week Exxon CEO Darren Woods pushed back against the president's assertions that executives were hoarding profits. 'There has been discussion in the US about our industry returning some of our profits directly to the American people,' Darren Woods said on the company's third quarter earnings call, according to Bloomberg News. 'That's exactly what we're doing in the form of our quarterly dividend.' The White House responded through Biden's official Twitter account. 'Can't believe I have to say this but giving profits to shareholders is not the same as bringing prices down for American families,' the tweet said. Americans have struggled with painfully high gasoline prices in recent months, paying more than $4.80 on average for a gallon of regular at the beginning of July, according to AAA. They've since fallen to $3.76 on average nationally, but the White House says they should be lower, given declines in global oil prices over the same period. Biden has been critical of energy companies profits since at least June, when he complained publicly that 'Exxon made more money than God this year.' Biden has already released an unprecedented 180 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve he pushes the industry to ramp up production. Last Friday Biden said that six of the largest oil companies made '$70 billion in profit' last quarter. 'I'm going to keep harping on it. They talk about me picking on them, they ain't seen nothing yet. I mean it. It outrages me.'"
2022-10-30,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11370303/Gove-insists-UK-robust-protocols-claims-Liz-Trusss-phone-hacked.html,Michael Gove insists UK has 'robust protocols' on cyber security after claims Liz Truss's personal phone was hacked by Kremlin agents - with fears top secret negotiations and private messages were compromised,"Michael Gove insisted the UK has 'robust protocols' on cyber security today amid claims Liz Truss's personal mobile phone was hacked by agents suspected of working for the Kremlin. The Cabinet minister said such issues were taken 'incredibly seriously' as he was grilled on the extraordinary revelations in the Mail on Sunday. Cyber-spies are believed to have gained access to top-secret exchanges with key international partners as well as private conversations with her leading political ally, Kwasi Kwarteng. One source told the newspaper the phone was so heavily compromised that it has now been placed in a locked safe inside a secure Government location. The hack was discovered during the summer's Tory leadership campaign, when Ms Truss was Foreign Secretary, but the details were suppressed by Boris Johnson, who was Prime Minister at the time, and the Cabinet Secretary, Simon Case. The messages which fell into foreign hands are believed to have included criticisms Ms Truss and her future Chancellor Mr Kwarteng made of Mr Johnson, leading to the potential risk of blackmail. Sources said that up to a year's worth of messages were downloaded. They are also thought to have included highly sensitive discussions with senior international foreign ministers about the war in Ukraine, including detailed discussions about arms shipments. Mr Gove, who made a return to Cabinet this week as Levelling Up Secretary, told Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme: 'I don't know the full details of what security breach, if any, took place. 'What I do know is that the Government has very robust protocols in place in order to make sure that individuals are protected, but also that Government security and national security are protected as well.' Asked about reports the alleged breach was covered up by the Cabinet Secretary, Mr Gove said: 'I'm sure that Liz both as foreign secretary and as prime minister will have followed the advice that she was given by the intelligence and security communities. 'I think all of us have to be sensitive, particularly those of us in Government, to the fact that the more that we talk in detail about these things, the more that we risk giving information to people who wish this country and its citizens harm. 'We do take security issues incredibly seriously. That's why, again, I have to be cautious in responding to the point that you understandably made about Liz's phone.' A former head of the British Army said the security breach shows 'ill discipline'. Lord Dannatt told Times Radio: 'Our leaders must be sufficiently disciplined to only communicate through authorised means which themselves are encrypted and are secure. 'We've seen it with Suella Braverman, apparently sending messages that she shouldn't have done on a personal email, and now we get it with Liz Truss. 'This, frankly, is not good enough, if these people aspire to be in senior positions, positions of leadership, they've got to be disciplined, they've got to follow the rules, or, frankly, we'll put other people in their place.' Asked if political leaders should be using certain messaging services, he added: 'If you want to communicate government business, use an encrypted handheld device, use a secure telephone line, use a secure means of communication. 'People in senior positions have got access to these secure means of communicating and they should use them, not doing so is ill discipline and, frankly, reflects very poorly on their judgment.' The astonishing incident, disclosed by security sources, shed light on the mystery of why Ms Truss was forced to change the mobile number she had used for over a decade shortly before becoming Prime Minister. The move caused anxiety among Cabinet Ministers and advisers who were suddenly unable to contact her. A source with knowledge of the incident said yesterday that the security breach 'caused absolute pandemonium – Boris was told immediately, and it was agreed with the Cabinet Secretary that there should be a total news blackout. 'It is not a great look for the intelligence services if the Foreign Secretary's phone can be so easily plundered for embarrassing personal messages by agents presumed to be working for Vladimir Putin's Russia.' Allies of Ms Truss said she was worried that if news of the hack leaked, it could derail her chance of claiming the Premiership, adding that she 'had trouble sleeping' until Mr Case imposed a news blackout. Former Conservative Party leader and leading Russia critic Iain Duncan Smith said: 'This is what we're up against. Russia does this all the time. This is their sole purpose – their way to get back at us. We are all far too casual about our phones in general. Ministers should be much more careful and should not be using their personal phones for anything. I assume my private phone is being hacked.' Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'This is extremely serious – it shows the severity of the threats from countries that would do us harm and why cyber-security needs to be taken so seriously by everyone in Government. We need to know that the Government recognises the gravity of this.' A Government spokesman said last night: 'We do not comment on individuals' security arrangements. The Government has robust systems in place to protect against cyber threats. That includes regular security briefings for Ministers, and advice on protecting their personal data.' Security expert Professor Antony Glees said he was 'gobsmacked' by The Mail on Sunday's revelations, adding: 'What has happened here is absolutely appalling and is indicative of a Government that was extremely lax when it came to matters of national security. 'We have Ministers using their private phones to conduct Government business over WhatsApp and their personal email, and this has to stop immediately. It is totally irresponsible. It is absolutely terrifying. 'What is doubly horrifying is Boris Johnson knew this had happened but chose not to communicate it. And I fear that Liz Truss may not be alone in having her phone compromised. 'The obvious suspects are Russia, China, North Korea and Iran who would have huge interest in knowing what the Foreign Secretary is communicating. The number one suspect, however, would be Russia.' The security services have grown increasingly concerned about the threat posed by hackers working for hostile countries with mobile phones regarded as the 'soft underbelly' of the modern state. An Israeli system called Pegasus, which gains access to phones without the owner knowing, was allegedly used by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to hack Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The spyware can be launched on phones with a text message, which does not even have to be opened, just received. It then runs secretly in the background, gaining access to everything on the device and tracking its movements. Former senior military intelligence officer Philip Ingram said: 'Ms Truss's phone will be in a secure Government location, which means a secure cage where the device can be forensically examined by experts but without the hackers knowing.' Another security source said: 'It takes a while to track who is behind attacks like these, but Russia tends to top the list.' Ms Truss took an uncompromising approach to Putin during her time as Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister while the UK has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine. The Mail on Sunday also reveals today that during the final days of her Premiership, Ms Truss became fixated by the weather forecast in case Russia deployed a nuclear device in or near Ukraine – as she was concerned about a possible radioactive cloud heading for the UK. 'Liz was obsessed with the prevailing wind,' said a source. The Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this month that Ms Truss's mobile phone number – the one that can now be revealed to have been hacked – was for sale on the internet, along with those of 25 Cabinet Ministers, for just £6.49. Russia's embassy in London was approached for comment."
2022-10-30,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11369671/Jim-Chalmers-cost-living-Treasurer-unsure-grocery-electricity-petrol-bill-shock-end.html,"The one question Jim Chalmers can't answer as Aussies face skyrocketing electricity, petrol and grocery bills just weeks out from Christmas","Australians are facing some of their worst bill shock ever with electricity prices skyrocketing, the war in Ukraine driving petrol prices up and inflation surging to 7.3 per cent in the year to September. Inflation is rising at its fastest pace since 1990 with another price shock on the way as Westpac predicts yet another 0.5 percentage point rise on Tuesday. With the rising cost of living firmly on his mind, Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers put on a charm offensive on Sunday morning when he appeared on ABC's Insiders. But there was one question Mr Chalmers could not answer - exactly when Australians may get some relief from skyrocketing bills. If Westpac's forecast of a 0.5 percentage point rise on Melbourne Cup Day proves accurate, it would take the interest rate to a 10-year high of 3.1 per cent. A borrower with a typical $600,000 loan would see their monthly repayments climb by another $181 to $3,236. Mr Chalmers talked around the issue on Sunday, saying the government was 'always recalibrating our expectations for electricity price rises'. 'We had a choice to make, to be upfront about what's happening in these energy markets or not, we chose to be upfront,' he said. 'We think it's crucial we do that so we examine, shine a light on the important work that now needs to happen and part of that work is investing in new sources of cleaner and cheaper renewable energy.' Mr Chamlers told Insiders host David Speers that the government was 'making progress every day'. 'We are working quite hard on this challenge not just since the budget but before it as well,' he said. But Speers pressed him on when there would be a solution to higher prices. 'I'm not going to give you a date today, David, but I can indicate to your viewers that it's obviously a high priority for us,' Mr Chalmers replied. 'It is a bigger and bigger part of the inflation challenge that we confront more broadly and government will work as hard as we can to get an outcome here as soon as we can.' Mr Chalmers was then asked when energy prices would specifically start to come down. 'We tried to be up front about the composition of this inflation challenge and the fact that because of the war in Ukraine electricity prices and gas prices will become a bigger part, a bigger component of this inflation challenge,' he said. WESTPAC: A 0.5 percentage point increase in November with cash rate peaking at 3.85 per cent in March ANZ: A 0.25 percentage point increase in November (outside chance of a 0.5 percentage point rise) with cash rate peaking at 3.85 per cent in May COMMONWEALTH: A 0.25 percentage point increase in November with cash rate peaking at 3.1 per cent in December NAB: A 0.25 percentage point increase in November (outside chance of a 0.5 percentage point rise) with cash rate peaking at 3.6 per cent in March Mr Chalmers said natural disasters, such as flooding, were also pushing up the cost of living. 'This is what we are expecting... the 20 per cent (rise in energy bills) number is already flowing. It's actually partly a consequence of the rises that (former energy minister) Angus Taylor hid during the election campaign,' he said. 'So we need that perspective too. We expect (a) 20 per cent (rise), then (a) 30 per cent (rise).' Speers interrupted Mr Chalmers to say 'we heard about this during the week, when will prices come down?' Mr Chalmers' response was unlikely to have calmed the nerves of Australians wondering how much they may be able to save before Christmas. 'We have provided the near term forecast, the 20 per cent and the 30 per cent (rise). That covers this year and next year,' he said. 'Obviously as we invest more in cheaper and cleaner forms of energy, obviously depending on what regulatory interventions we can sensibly make in the near term, that will have an impact. 'But I think most importantly for families and for Australians and for Australian industry we do expect prices to rise this year and next year.' The Insiders host then put it to Mr Chalmers that he didn't know when prices would come down. 'Well, we know that they will moderate in time and we know that we give ourselves the best chance to do that by investing in new sources of cleaner and cheaper energy, which is the government's priority,' Mr Chalmers replied. $500,000: Up $151 to $2,697 from $2,546 $600,000: Up $181 to $3,236 from $3,055 $700,000: Up $211 to $3,775 from $3,564 $800,000: Up $242 to $4,315 from $4,073 $900,000: Up $272 to $4,854 from $4,582 $1,000,000: Up $302 to $5,393 from $5,091 Monthly loan repayment increases based on a variable mortgage rate rising by 0.5 percentage points to 5.04 per cent from 4.54 per cent to reflect the Reserve Bank of Australia cash rate increasing to 3.1 per cent from 2.6 per cent"
2022-10-30,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11371165/Female-military-pilots-graduated-amid-Ukraine-invasion-join-Russian-air-force.html,Putin's 'angels of death': Female military pilots who graduated amid Ukraine invasion join Russian air force,"Vladimir Putin has unleashed his 'angels of deaths' - newly graduated women military pilots now in the Russian air force. The pilots were seen at a weekend passing out parade in Krasnodar after they had qualified from Serov Higher Military Aviation School. The newly mobilised women are trained in using strategic nuclear bomber and transport planes. Putin's defence minister Sergei Shoigu said the female pilots were 'gloriously' continuing a tradition. He said: 'You are a reference point and an example for those girls who will follow you.' 'All these girls will soon get married and go to 'serve' on maternity leave,' stormed one critic. Joseph Stalin allowed women to fly and fight throughout the Second World War - with 23 becoming Heroes of the USSR. This year Mr Shoigu selected one female applicant Anna Shcherbakova, from Perm, who had initially been refused. She was among 400 pilots, 16 of them female, to graduate. The first women air force pilots to qualify since the Second World War were seen throwing petals and coins in the air in their passing out parade. In 2017 when they rebottled for their five year course Colonel Oleg Pchela told the female applicants: 'Girls are usually very romantic. 'They have good motivation that will allow them to learn how to fly our military airplanes and to perform the tasks of their commanders. 'It is a highly responsible job to become a military pilot. It is a hard occupation, it demands high moral values too.'"
2022-10-30,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11371611/Suspected-Kremlin-hack-Liz-Trusss-mobile-sparks-security-clampdown.html,Ministers ordered by spy chiefs to stop using their mobile phones after suspected Kremlin hack on Liz Truss sparks security clampdown,"Spy chiefs have ordered ministers to stop using their personal phones to conduct government business following a suspected Kremlin hack on Liz Truss’s mobile. A Whitehall source said all ministers involved in national security would be expected to attend fresh training with the security services this week ‘to ensure everyone is aware how this material should be handled’. Ministers will be warned they should never use their personal mobile phones to conduct Government business as they are likely to be the target of hostile states such as Russia, China, North Korea and Iran. Pauline Neville-Jones, former chairman of Britain’s joint intelligence committee, yesterday said she was ‘not at all tolerant of the notion that it’s OK for ministers to use private mobile phones’. The warnings follow astonishing revelations in yesterday’s Mail on Sunday that Miss Truss’s personal mobile was spied on by hackers thought to be working for Moscow while she was foreign secretary. The hack was discovered during the Tory leadership contest in the summer, but a news blackout was ordered by Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case. Even MPs and officials with top level security clearance were kept in the dark. Miss Truss is said to have been so worried about the potential damage to her leadership bid that she ‘had trouble sleeping’ until the news was suppressed. Messages dating back up to a year are thought to have been downloaded, including highly sensitive discussions with fellow foreign ministers about issues such as arms shipments to Ukraine. Hacked messages are said to have included private criticisms of Mr Johnson by Miss Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, potentially opening them up to blackmail attempts at a time when they were both senior ministers in his government. Parliamentary sources yesterday said the shocking incident was now likely to be investigated by the Intelligence and Security Committee, which oversees the work of the security services. One source on the committee said: ‘On the face of it, it looks extremely serious. The protocols around using secure lines have been in place for years – why on earth was the foreign secretary using her personal mobile? Frankly, it beggars belief.’ Baroness Neville-Jones, a former security minister, told Times Radio it was ‘extremely unhealthy’ for ministers to be conducting official business through private channels, particularly when using personal phones that are ‘vulnerable’ to hacking. ‘It’s common sense to know that your mobile is potentially vulnerable, and it is the rule that you don’t use it,’ she said. ‘This is what got Hillary Clinton into trouble.’ Former Army chief Lord Dannatt said the hacking incident suggested ‘ill discipline’ among ministers – and said it added to concerns about the forwarding of sensitive information by Home Secretary Suella Braverman, for which she resigned this month before being reinstated by Rishi Sunak. He said the behaviour was ‘not good enough’. ‘If you want to communicate government business, use an encrypted handheld device, use a secure telephone line, use a secure means of communication,’ he said. ‘People in senior positions have got access to these secure means of communicating and they should use them. Not doing so is ill discipline and, frankly, reflects very poorly on their judgment.’ Michael Gove did not dispute the report that Miss Truss’s phone had been hacked, saying the Mail on Sunday was ‘a trusted newspaper, so I don’t want in any way to cast doubt on its report’. But the Levelling Up Secretary said ministers were told to take cybersecurity ‘incredibly seriously’, and that the Government had ‘very robust protocols in place’ to prevent hacking. However, one security source said some ministers did not like using ‘clunky’ Government-issued encrypted mobiles. Another added: ‘Properly encrypted mobiles are available but they are less convenient, so not so popular.’ Sir Richard Dearlove, former head of MI6, said senior government ministers were ‘obvious targets’ for the security services of hostile powers. He told BBC Radio 4’s The World This Weekend show that ‘the likelihood’ was that Miss Truss’s phone had been targeted by Russia, which he said had ‘significant capabilities’ for hacking. Professor Alan Woodward, cyber security specialist at the University of Surrey, said Miss Truss’s phone was most likely infected with spyware, which would have posted details of all her messages back to the hackers. Commentary by Professor Anthony Glees The implications are horrifying. We now know a foreign power hacked the personal mobile phone of the talkative Liz Truss. The severity of this security breach can hardly be overstated. As a former prime minister, ex-foreign secretary and ex-international trade secretary, Miss Truss was the chief custodian of our national security secrets and the recipient of invaluable MI6 intelligence. We need an immediate judicial inquiry, led by a High Court judge, to establish how this happened, who was responsible and precisely what information was compromised. Truss was in charge of delivering national security: The most sacred duty of any government. We are deeply – and rightly – involved in a major war in our neighbourhood, as the European leader of a western coalition against Russian aggression in Ukraine. Our closest allies’ trust in us will have been greatly threatened by this fiasco. I believe Boris Johnson, who was prime minister at the time, should not have suppressed the news, although it is possible there were sound security reasons why this had to be done. If the media had been able to report the story, Liz Truss would have had no choice but to resign. It goes without saying that her ambitions to lead the country would have been over. The most likely culprits are the Russians – though we also cannot discount China, Iran, North Korea or, conceivably, Israel, which has invested vast sums into electronic surveillance. Analysts at GCHQ are trying to work out who hacked her, and how much damage has been done. I suspect the Kremlin, not just because Britain – and especially under Boris – has been such an influential ally to Ukraine, but because of the way Liz Truss was treated in Moscow last February, when she met Russian foreign secretary Sergey Lavrov. The rudeness and disdain shown to her during that visit might have stemmed from the fact that Lavrov perhaps knew almost as much about Truss as she knew herself. It’s almost impossible to overestimate how much private information, and how many government secrets, might have been betrayed. The hackers could read her emails and WhatsApp messages and listen to her phone calls, of course. But the latest surveillance software is far more sophisticated than that. Even when a phone is switched off, a spy operator can switch it back on again and activate the microphone. This enables the phone to be used as a listening device. It is conceivable that the camera was used, too. Certainly, the phone’s GPS device would have transmitted her location at all times – a chilling threat to her personal security. Cabinet ministers are not supposed to take their personal phones into No10, the Foreign Office or other sensitive zones. We don’t know if Liz Truss complied with this rule – another reason why a judicial inquiry is imperative. We do know she routinely used her personal phone instead of her government-issued device, which has much more robust anti-hacking protection. Now we need to find out the true cost of this behaviour.

From London to Wigan, partygoers in all different kinds of outfits headed out on Saturday night to celebrate the spooky season, and made the most of the extra hour. Leeds saw the streets packed with youngsters dressed in weird and wonderful costumes, from ghosts and pumpkins to The Spice Girls and the Scooby-Doo gang as many took part in the city's renowned pub crawl - the Otley Run. In the capital, many gathered for the second MCM London Comic Con event, with fans being seen on the underground dressed as Luke Skywalker and as cats. Across the country police officers have increased their presence in an attempt to crackdown on anti-social behaviour over the Halloween weekend. Cities up and down the country remained relatively calm, after two years of Halloween celebrations dampened by the Covid-19 pandemic. As the night drew to a close in Newcastle, however, things started to get rowdier with partygoers seen falling over in the street and lying on the damp pavement. Elsewhere in the world Halloween celebrations have continued, including in war-torn Ukraine. Despite the ongoing invasion from Russia and the 11pm to 5am curfew in place, partygoers still headed out to celebrate in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. People were seen partying at the HVLV night club dressed in a range of outfits outside the club and on the dance floor."

Ukraine's exports were halted after Russia suspended its participation in a landmark agreement that allowed the vital shipments via the Black Sea, blaming 'drone attacks' on its ships in Crimea. Ukraine - one of the world's largest exporters of grain - dubbed Russia's claims a 'false pretext' while President Biden condemned the move as 'purely outrageous' and Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Moscow was 'weaponising food'. The July deal to unlock grain exports signed between Russia and Ukraine and brokered by Turkey and the UN, is critical to easing the global food crisis caused by the conflict. The agreement had already allowed more than nine million tonnes of Ukrainian grain to be exported and was due to be renewed on November 19. The blockade places further pressure on the already escalating price of wheat products across Europe. In the UK, nearly all bread and pasta items have risen in inflation by double digits, with some up by as much as 63.6 per cent. Latest figures from the Grocery Price Index show Hovis wholemeal thick bread rose from £1.05 per loaf in October last year to £1.41 (34.3 per cent) this month, while Sainsbury's toastie thick white bread increased from 55p to 80p (45.5 per cent) and Village Bakery went from 49p to 69p (40.8 per cent). Last month, it emerged the price of staples such as milk, butter, cheese, meat and bread increased by up to 42 per cent in September - the highest rates since 1980. Millions are now routinely paying 20p more for two pints of milk, 30p more for a packet of pasta, 30p more for six free range eggs and 40p more for a block of mature cheddar than they did 12 months ago. Inflation figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show there is not a single type of food or drink that has not gone up in price since last year as energy bills also soar. And the increases are not confined to groceries, with the cost of other goods and services also going up during one of the worst cost of living crises in decades. According to the ONS the amount parents are paying for their children's shoes has risen by 11.5%, the cost of a woman's haircut has increased by 6.1% and women's clothing has increased in cost by 8.4%, while household materials have gone up by 14.1%. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said: 'After last month's small fall, headline inflation returned to its high seen earlier in the summer. 'The rise was driven by further increases across food, which saw its largest annual rise in over 40 years, while hotel prices also increased after falling this time last year. 'These rises were partially offset by continuing falls in the costs of petrol, with airline prices falling by more than usual for this time of year and second-hand car prices also rising less steeply than the large increases seen last year. 'While still at a historically high rate, the costs facing businesses are beginning to rise more slowly, with crude oil prices actually falling in September.' Mr Hunt said: 'I understand that families across the country are struggling with rising prices and higher energy bills. This Government will prioritise help for the most vulnerable while delivering wider economic stability and driving long-term growth that will help everyone. 'We have acted decisively to protect households and businesses from significant rises in their energy bills this winter, with the Government's energy price guarantee holding down peak inflation.' The UK's inflation rate reached 10.1 per cent last month, hitting another 40-year high, while technology firm Yapily reported a surge in people using financial tools to top up their income as household budgets are squeezed. More than a third of consumers started using credit cards for the first time in the past year, while 27 per cent had turned to ""buy now pay later"" services and 18 per cent had dipped into an overdraft. Businesses are also showing signs of shifting spending and money management behaviour, the research found, with three quarters turning to financial tools like business cards and loans to manage cash flow over the last year. Yapily said that many of the money tools are powered by open banking - meaning that people can choose to access their financial information in one place, such as different savings accounts or bills. But the fintech company - which counts American Express and Intuit Quickbooks among the clients using its platform - suggested that there is not enough awareness of how the infrastructure can help people save money and access more affordable credit. Stefano Vaccino, chief executive and founder of Yapily, said: ""Our research proves that businesses and consumers are seeking new ways to ease the burden of the cost-of-living crisis. ""At the same time, open banking is helping people access better and fairer financial services when they need it most. ""But until it is more widely understood and implemented, open banking's power to cushion the blow of this inflationary pinch will remain out of reach for the masses."""
2022-10-29,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11368779/Ukraines-military-chief-claims-Putin-using-THREE-body-doubles-plastic-surgery.html,Now Ukraine's military chief claims Vladimir Putin is using THREE body doubles who have had cosmetic surgery,"Vladimir Putin is using at least three body doubles who have had plastic surgery to look like him, claims Ukraine's intelligence chief who speculates they are being used to cover up his loss of control in the Kremlin. Major General Kyrylo Budanov, head of military intelligence, says the Ukraine government is so perplexed by Russia's disastrous invasion strategy, it wonders if Putin is still taking the key decisions. He says 'no matter how bad' Putin was in the past, 'he was not an idiot', but goes on to argue that Russia's war 'does not follow any logic'. Budanov adds: 'The big question is whether the real Putin still exists?' The extraordinary suggestion, amid repeated rumours about Putin's health, came in an exclusive interview with the man seen as Moscow's Public Enemy No 1 after a series of devastating attacks on Russian interests. Budanov says they had detected Putin doubles in the past standing in for him on 'special occasions', but it is 'usual practice' now. 'We know specifically about three people that keep appearing, but how many there are, we don't know,' he says. 'They all had plastic surgery to look alike. 'The one thing that gives them away is their height. It's visible in videos and pictures. Also gesturing, body language and earlobes, since they are unique for every person.' Budanov refuses to be drawn on whether Putin has disappeared, through illness or after a power struggle. He reveals the Kremlin is running out of guided missiles and believes that if Ukraine recaptures the southern city of Kherson, it could have dramatic consequences for the Russian regime. He says 'change is inevitable' in Moscow, arguing that the arrival of a new political order in Russia is in the interests of 'the whole civilised world' and calling on Britain to do everything 'to speed up the events that will happen anyway'. 'We are very grateful for the assistance your government is providing,' says Budanov. 'We hope the UK will not only continue political, economic and military support but increase it. We are in acute need of air defence systems.' He admits that Ukraine's leaders would have discussions over whether to continue pushing their forces over the Russian border. 'This decision will be made by the head of the state when we get all our land back,' he says. Budanov is an ex-special forces operative who was appointed head of military intelligence two years ago, aged just 34 – then promoted shortly before the war to oversee all intelligence. He has been wounded several times in action. Russian media has linked him with undercover operations in Crimea, along with another officer who later died in a car bombing, while it was reported in Ukraine that he was targeted in an assassination attempt in 2019. Last week, a leading Russian analyst praised Budanov's effectiveness and called for his elimination. 'Yes, they officially call me Public Enemy No 1,' he laughs. We met in a darkened room after I was driven to the location by a senior woman officer. There was a German machine gun on the floor and two knives on his desk, alongside a chess board and a book on Mossad, the Israeli spy agency. First, we discussed the future of the war, which he predicts will end next year. When I ask if fighting might conclude by the summer he replies, 'I really hope so.' His reputation rose before the war as the only top Ukraine figure to publicly back UK and US intelligence warnings that Putin was planning a full-scale invasion as his troops massed on the border. Now Budanov sees Ukraine's recapture of Crimea as a 'personal' mission, since as a child he spent summers in Sevastopol, the port Russia was allowed to retain after Ukraine's independence as the base for its Black Sea Fleet. He is adamant the peninsula, illegally annexed by Putin in 2014, will be recaptured and is scathing about those 'stupidly' arguing Ukraine should not provoke Russia for fear of escalating the war. What about the risk of nuclear weapons? 'It's scaremongering,' he says. 'Nuclear weapons are not weapons – they are the means of deterrence. And Russia knows perfectly well it cannot use them. 'If you study when they started to threaten with them, you'll see clear correlation: when everything goes bad for them, they start screaming, 'We can use nuclear weapons.' ' Budanov is the man Russia blamed for the blast this month on the bridge to Crimea, a key supply route for Putin's forces in south Ukraine. Budanov declines to comment on that or earlier attacks on military targets in Crimea, but adds: 'What goes around, comes around. We are at war with the Russian Federation. We are using all means to cause its defeat.' He says Putin's recent annexation of Kherson, claiming it as part of Russia as Ukrainian forces advance on the city, underlines questions over his mental wellbeing. 'It looks ridiculous,' he says. 'They are grandiosely annexing it in Moscow despite knowing they are going to lose it. So my question is: Is Putin well? And is it really Putin? Maybe it is even someone else.' There have been previous allegations that Putin may have had cosmetic surgery along with recent rumours he is battling serious illness, even cancer. In July, a Ukrainian intelligence official claimed Putin may have sent a body double in his place for a visit to Iran. It has been suspected former Kremlin leaders such as Josef Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev also used body doubles as decoys. Budanov believes Ukraine's anticipated liberation of Kherson will provoke major questions in Russia: 'How did it happen that Ukraine – a place they have no respect for and never believed to be even a country to take seriously – is taking territories from the Russian Federation? This situation, we believe, would have serious consequences for opinion within the society.' He admits Ukraine has operatives undercover in Russia. 'Yes, of course we have,' he says, adding that 'the majority of our activity is targeting the Chechen republic'.Chechnya, which tried to break free from Russia after the Soviet Union's collapse, only to be crushed by Moscow in two savage wars, is led by a brutal ally of Putin's. Last week, Kyiv's parliament recognised Chechnya as an occupied territory. Budanov is convinced that not only will Ukraine win this war, but Putin will be forced from power so this conflict will change the future shape of Russia. He says the faster Ukraine restores its borders to how they were in 1991, 'the faster Russia is going to rebuild. It will be a different country with a different leadership with different borders'. I asked a final question on behalf of a Ukrainian friend: who was his favourite 007? 'Sean Connery,' he replies instantly. I suggest he might be Ukraine's modern version. 'Thank you,' he says, smiling – although any future film would not be called From Russia With Love. Additional reporting: Kate Baklitskaya"
2022-10-29,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11369041/The-final-days-ex-premiers-doomed-regime-filled-fears-nuclear-fallout.html,"Liz Truss's Putin radiation terror: Ex-PM spent final days in No10 'obsessing' with wind charts and weather forecasts as her fears grew that fallout would hit UK if Putin uses nukes in Ukraine, new look inside her doomed tenure reveals","When Liz Truss was told, during the dying days of her mayfly Premiership, that the security services were picking up intelligence that Vladimir Putin might use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine it sent a chill down her spine. The Prime Minister was still adjusting to getting used to a new mobile phone number, for the first time in over a decade, as a result of a hack suspected to have been backed or orchestrated by the Kremlin, potentially giving Putin access to information about Western support for President Volodymyr Zelensky's regime. In particular, Ms Truss was told that Putin might explode a weapon in the air above the Black Sea, which would show the West what he was capable of without triggering a full-scale nuclear war. As with the Chernobyl accident in 1986, the radiation could pose a threat to Europe if it blew in this direction: as a result, colleagues say Ms Truss became fixated with the weather forecast. A source said: 'Liz was obsessed with the prevailing wind, watching the forecasts to see if she needed to trigger a Protect and Survive plan.' Protect and Survive was a public information campaign on civil defence between 1974 and 1980 which advised the public on how to protect themselves during a nuclear attack. It detailed the warning signs when an attack was imminent and advised on what to do immediately after an attack, describing the effects of nuclear fall-out and how to plan for survival. The intelligence officials warned Putin might 'go nuclear' after Ukranian forces blew up the road bridge connecting Russia and Crimea, something Putin had said would 'cross a red line' and prompt 'judgment day'. He also said in a televised speech that if Western forces endangered the 'integrity' of Russian territory then 'we will certainly use all the means at our disposal', adding: 'This is not a bluff.' President Zelensky was also told by his intelligence agencies that there was a 'very high' risk Russia might use tactical nuclear weapons. The source added: 'Liz was terrified that news about her phone being hacked would come out because it looked almost symbolic of national weakness. Then, as her government was collapsing, she had to worry about nuclear clouds as well. 'We found her watching the weather forecasts with unusual interest'. Radiation-detecting equipment is scattered across Europe as an early-warning system in the event of an accident or the deliberate use of a nuclear weapon, while cloud-mapping experts share information between countries about radiation direction. The Mail on Sunday can separately reveal that the Home Office is working with police to bolster the UK's 'radiological and nuclear detection equipment'. A Home Office tender contract, published two weeks ago, seeks an 'information system for operational planning, alerting, reporting and managing' nuclear threats. The contract is focused on 'inland detection' against possible terrorist attacks using radiological or nuclear materials. Officials want to understand the latest technology for detecting radiation levels, including 'isotope identification and dose rates'. It is understood the development is not in response to the war in Ukraine and was funded by a Spending Review commitment in November 2020. Yesterday Russia accused the UK of being involved in a Ukranian drone attack on Russia's Black Sea fleet in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, which the Ministry of Defence said was an example of Russia 'peddling false claims on an epic scale'. Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Russian-installed governor of the city, said Russia's navy had repelled the latest attack – the 'most massive' since February – and said that all drones had been shot down. At least one vessel sustained minor damage, Russia said. It accused British navy specialists of helping Ukraine prepare the attack and said the same unit was 'involved in plotting, organising and implementation of the terrorist attack in the Baltic on September 26 to blow up the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines'. The MoD said: 'To detract from their disastrous handling of the invasion, the Russian ministry of defence is resorting to peddling false claims on an epic scale. This invented story says more about arguments inside the Russian government than about the West.' A UK Government spokesperson said: 'We have robust systems in place to protect against cyber threats. That includes regular security briefings for ministers.' MARK ALMOND: A chilling reminder that no one's safe from the goons in Moscow and Beijing By Mark Almond for the Mail On Sunday Britain's electronic spy agency, GCHQ, has enjoyed an unrivalled reputation as the pioneer of code-breaking since the days of Alan Turing in the Second World War. It remained at the cutting edge of intercepting the communications of our adversaries right through the Cold War, and does the same remarkable job today. But Britain's success in hacking other world leaders' plotting must not blind us to the skills of our rivals, or their ruthless targeting of our own institutions and those who run them. It is a point made painfully clear by the revelation that Liz Truss – a former Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister – has had her phone hacked and it is believed her private information may have been taken by the Russians. Moscow has long sought to steal our secrets. Now we are in a proxy war over Ukraine, its efforts have intensified. Vladimir Putin's spymasters are targeting Whitehall just as much as Kyiv. Finding out what our leaders are discussing and what information they share with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is a key goal. And it might seem less immediate, but we are also in a proxy war with China. This is a state that we know to be adept at stealing military and commercial information – and which is determined to spread its malignant tentacles around the globe. How much of Putin's information will be passed to China's President Xi, without whose tacit support, there could have been no invasion of Ukraine? For both of these antagonists, the battleground is digital, and both have invested in spooks who specialise in artificial intelligence. Armies of well-trained hackers are at work. Bunkers have been filled with the fastest computers scrolling through the whole world's electronic data to snatch key information out of zillions of gigabytes, scrutinising the entire digi-universe to pick out vulnerabilities.Careless WhatsApping costs lives, or reputations at the very least. Putin has long been an expert in using 'kompromat' to discredit his domestic rivals with any juicy scandal his agents might uncover through bugged phone calls and illicitly obtained video. Maybe the very success of GCHQ has made our own leaders complacent. But the theft of Ms Truss's data should shake up the rest of us as well. We have been sleeping. How many of us truly pay attention to digital security? It is a time-consuming bore. But it matters. The truth is, nothing digital is hack-proof. Nothing at all. Putin knows this very well, which is why he is personally reluctant to use a laptop or mobile phone. It is time for voters and politicians alike to acknowledge that our faith in the breakneck progress of artificial intelligence is naive. So far from making us safer, it is threatening our security. Then there is the human factor. Would we be surprised if ambitious politicians were the sort of people to assume that tedious security rules are for the lower ranks? I, for one, would not. As the Russians themselves say: 'The fish rots from the head down.'"
2022-10-29,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11369019/More-Britains-foreign-aid-budget-spent-home-poorer-countries.html,"More of Britain’s foreign aid budget is being spent at home than in poorer countries, report says: Large portion going towards housing for refugees, mainly from Ukraine","The UK is now spending more of its international development budget at home than in poor developing countries, development experts have said. That is because a large proportion of the pot is being spent on housing refugees, mainly from Ukraine, according to the Centre for Global Development (CGD). Rishi Sunak was criticised for slashing the foreign aid budget from 0.7 per cent to 0.5 per cent of national income when he was chancellor, as well as setting a precedent for letting the Home Office and other departments use the pot, and stretching the rules on what can be counted as aid. The UK aid budget is around £11 billion, with some £4 billion going to multilateral institutions including the World Bank. Of the remaining £7 billion, which is administered by the UK directly, more than half will be spent domestically this year, including some £3 billion on housing refugees, according to CGD's analysis. While the UK is allowed to count refugee-hosting costs as official development assistance (ODA) under internationally agreed rules, it is one of only a few countries – and the only one in the G7 – to fund all the costs of Ukrainian refugees from its existing aid budget, the Washington and London-based think tank said. The UK is now spending more of its international development budget at home than in poor developing countries, development experts have said (Clive Gee/PA) Ranil Dissanayake, policy fellow at CGD, told iNews: 'The development budget – the pot of money we put aside to help the world's poorest people – is being squeezed from every angle. 'Not only was it slashed by almost a third, Rishi Sunak then set a precedent as chancellor for letting other departments claim whatever they could back from this pot. 'Saying we spend 0.5 per cent of our national income on aid is becoming meaningless, when such a huge proportion of this pot is being spent domestically, rather than on helping people facing enormous hardship across the world.' One of the key Tory MPs who rebelled against Mr Sunak's aid budget cuts last year, Andrew Mitchell, has now been appointed by the Prime Minister as development minister in the Foreign Office. The appointment was seen as significant as Mr Mitchell, a former international development secretary, could increase pressure on Mr Sunak to honour his pledge to return to 0.7 per cent international aid spending by 2024-25. However, the Prime Minister is considering freezing the budget for an extra two years – saving £4 billion a year – as he eyes ways to plug a multi-billion pound fiscal black hole, the Telegraph reported. Mr Mitchell 'focused strongly on results for the poor, and value for money – at the moment, the way budgets are handled they deliver neither,' according to Stefan Dercon, professor of economic policy at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government. He tweeted on Wednesday: 'Aid is now only 0.3 per cent of GNI (gross national income) once we account for all asylum/refugee costs and other spending programmes for Ukraine inside the UK. That is now less than it was before 1997.' He blamed the Home Office's '(poor) management of accommodation costs in the UK' and predicted 'more cuts to humanitarian spending for African and Asian crises, and less for those things the UK built a reputation for doing well.' A spokesperson at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: 'Across government, there are significant pressures on the 0.5% ODA budget due to the costs of accepting refugees from Afghanistan and Ukraine as well as wider migration challenges. Obviously how many refugees arrive in any particular period is not certain, so there is not a fixed cost. 'We remain one of the largest global aid donors, spending more than £11 billion in aid in 2021, and UK aid has recently gone towards those in need in the Horn of Africa and Pakistan.'"
2022-10-29,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11368619/Liz-Trusss-personal-phone-hacked-Putins-spies-secret-details-negotiations.html,MAIL ON SUNDAY EXCLUSIVE: Liz Truss's personal phone that was hacked by Kremlin agents was so compromised it was locked away in a 'secure location' as experts fear top secret negotiations and private messages may have been leaked,"Liz Truss's personal mobile phone was hacked by agents suspected of working for the Kremlin, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The cyber-spies are believed to have gained access to top-secret exchanges with key international partners as well as private conversations with her leading political ally, Kwasi Kwarteng. One source said that the phone was so heavily compromised that it has now been placed in a locked safe inside a secure Government location. The hack was discovered during the summer’s Tory leadership campaign, when Ms Truss was Foreign Secretary, but the details were suppressed by Boris Johnson, who was Prime Minister at the time, and the Cabinet Secretary, Simon Case. It is understood that messages which fell into foreign hands included criticisms Ms Truss and her future Chancellor Mr Kwarteng made of Mr Johnson, leading to the potential risk of blackmail. Sources said that up to a year’s worth of messages were downloaded. They are also believed to have included highly sensitive discussions with senior international foreign ministers about the war in Ukraine, including detailed discussions about arms shipments. The astonishing incident, disclosed by security sources, solves the mystery of why Ms Truss was forced to change the mobile number she had used for over a decade shortly before becoming Prime Minister. The move caused anxiety among Cabinet Ministers and advisers who were suddenly unable to contact her. A source with knowledge of the incident said yesterday that the security breach ‘caused absolute pandemonium – Boris was told immediately, and it was agreed with the Cabinet Secretary that there should be a total news blackout. ‘It is not a great look for the intelligence services if the Foreign Secretary’s phone can be so easily plundered for embarrassing personal messages by agents presumed to be working for Vladimir Putin’s Russia.’ Allies of Ms Truss said she was worried that if news of the hack leaked, it could derail her chance of claiming the Premiership, adding that she ‘had trouble sleeping’ until Mr Case imposed a news blackout. Former Conservative Party leader and leading Russia critic Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘This is what we’re up against. Russia does this all the time. This is their sole purpose – their way to get back at us. We are all far too casual about our phones in general. Ministers should be much more careful and should not be using their personal phones for anything. I assume my private phone is being hacked.’ Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘This is extremely serious – it shows the severity of the threats from countries that would do us harm and why cyber-security needs to be taken so seriously by everyone in Government. We need to know that the Government recognises the gravity of this.’ A Government spokesman said last night: ‘We do not comment on individuals’ security arrangements. The Government has robust systems in place to protect against cyber threats. That includes regular security briefings for Ministers, and advice on protecting their personal data.’ Security expert Professor Antony Glees said he was ‘gobsmacked’ by The Mail on Sunday’s revelations, adding: ‘What has happened here is absolutely appalling and is indicative of a Government that was extremely lax when it came to matters of national security. ‘We have Ministers using their private phones to conduct Government business over WhatsApp and their personal email, and this has to stop immediately. It is totally irresponsible. It is absolutely terrifying. ‘What is doubly horrifying is Boris Johnson knew this had happened but chose not to communicate it. And I fear that Liz Truss may not be alone in having her phone compromised. ‘The obvious suspects are Russia, China, North Korea and Iran who would have huge interest in knowing what the Foreign Secretary is communicating. The number one suspect, however, would be Russia.’ The security services have grown increasingly concerned about the threat posed by hackers working for hostile countries with mobile phones regarded as the ‘soft underbelly’ of the modern state. An Israeli system called Pegasus, which gains access to phones without the owner knowing, was allegedly used by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to hack Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The spyware can be launched on phones with a text message, which does not even have to be opened, just received. It then runs secretly in the background, gaining access to everything on the device and tracking its movements. Former senior military intelligence officer Philip Ingram said: ‘Ms Truss’s phone will be in a secure Government location, which means a secure cage where the device can be forensically examined by experts but without the hackers knowing.’ Another security source said: ‘It takes a while to track who is behind attacks like these, but Russia tends to top the list.’ Ms Truss took an uncompromising approach to Putin during her time as Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister while the UK has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine. The Mail on Sunday also reveals today that during the final days of her Premiership, Ms Truss became fixated by the weather forecast in case Russia deployed a nuclear device in or near Ukraine – as she was concerned about a possible radioactive cloud heading for the UK. ‘Liz was obsessed with the prevailing wind,’ said a source. The Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this month that Ms Truss’s mobile phone number – the one that can now be revealed to have been hacked – was for sale on the internet, along with those of 25 Cabinet Ministers, for just £6.49. Russia’s embassy in London was approached for comment."

Although Russia's defence ministry did not provide any evidence for the claim, it said representatives of a 'unit of the British Navy took part in the planning, provision and implementation of a terrorist attack in the Baltic Sea on September 26 that blew up the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines'. The British Ministry of Defence has described it as an 'invented story' which 'says more about arguments going on inside the Russian government than it does about the West'. In a statement the Government department added: 'To detract from their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale.' Moscow also alleged that British troops were involved in a drone attack on their Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol today, which Russia claims involved nine drones and damaged one warship. A spokesperson for the Russian defence ministry said: 'At 4.20am today, the Kyiv regime carried out a terrorist attack on Black Sea Fleet ships and civilian vessels. 'Preparation for the terrorist act and training of military personnel of the Ukrainian 73rd Special Operations Centre Marine Unit was carried out under the guidance of British specialists who were in the city of Ochakiv, Mykolaiv region, Ukraine.' He warned: 'It should be stressed that the Black Sea Fleet vessels that suffered the terrorist attack are involved in ensuring the security of the grain corridor as part of the international initiative to export agricultural products from Ukrainian ports.' Russia has said Western countries have not allowed it to take part in international investigations of the explosions of the Nord Stream pipelines in September. Instead, it has for weeks hinted that its security services have a different version of what caused the September explosions, while some Western countries have called it sabotage and pointed the finger at Russia. Both Swedish and Danish authorities have been investigating four holes in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines. While the leaks were in international waters, two of them were in the Danish exclusive economic zone and two of them in the Swedish. The pipelines, which connect Russia to Germany, have been at the centre of geopolitical tensions as Russia cut gas supplies to Europe in suspected retaliation against Western sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Although the pipelines were not in operation, they contained gas before falling victim to the apparent sabotage. Fingers have been pointed at Russia, whose state-owned energy company Gazprom is the main owner of the pipelines. The Kremlin, however, has called such allegations 'stupid', previously blaming the United States for the damage and now making claims about the UK's involvement. In videos published by Swedish newspaper Expressen last week, a massive tear and twisted metal can be seen on the pipeline, 80 metres down under the ocean. Through the gloom, a deep trench can be seen in the seabed where the gas pipeline used to be, before the explosions. According to the newspaper, the videos show how over 165 feet of the pipeline is either missing or buried under the seabed, and long tears can be observed on the seabed leading up to the burst pipe. 'It is only an extreme force that can bend metal that thick in the way we are seeing,' Trond Larsen, drone operator with the Norwegian company Blueye Robotics, told Expressen. Larsen, who piloted the submersible drone which captured the video, also said you could also see 'a very large impact on the seabed around the pipe.' Expressen said the explosions measured 2.3 on the Richter scale."

The top Ukrainian official said there were 'active discussions' going on inside Russia about how Putin could be deposed as the country's ruling class grow frustrated with his invasion of Ukraine and he appears increasingly weak. Russian forces are currently fleeing parts of eastern Ukraine as Ukrainian forces continue their huge counteroffensive, with a focus on recapturing the city of Kherson. Ukrainian soldiers have openly mocked Putin as they regain territory his forces took early in the war. A fake gravestone for the Russian leader has even been put up in the Donetsk region as his army continues to suffer setbacks. There have also been fears about Russia's occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been damaged by missile attacks. Major General Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine's head of intelligence, said he believed Kherson could be retaken by the end of November. Around 40,000 Russian troops are regrouping around the region, with some of the 'most trained and most capable Russian units' involved, according to Maj Gen Budanov. He added a counteroffensive to recapture Crimea, annexed by Putin in 2014, could come next year as Ukraine continues to gain ground from Russia. In an interview with The War Zone, the spy chief also said pushing Russian forces back to Ukraine's 1991 borders - the year it won its independence - would create 'a good opportunity to end the war.' He even claimed this could happen as early as next year. Maj Gen Budanov added Putin was likely to be toppled by the war he started when he invaded Ukraine in February this year. He said: 'It's unlikely that he survives it. And currently, there's active discussions happening in Russia about who'd be there to replace him.' The intelligence boss also said the sustained attack by Russia on Ukraine's energy infrastructure was damagin but not 'critical'. He also refused to confirm or deny whether Ukraine had been behind the devastating attack on the Kerch bridge - the only bridge between Russia and Crimea which is vital for Russian supply lines. Fears have grown in recent weeks about Putin's willingness to use nuclear weapons after months of armageddon-mongering by Russian propagandists. Russia has also claimed Ukraine is planning on using a chemical weapon on its own soil - widely denounced by the international community as a baseless claim and a false flag operation to lay the groundwork for Russia to use WMD. Massive explosions hit key naval port Sevastopol in Crimea that Russia says is being targeted in major Ukraine drone assault By Arthur Parashar and Will Stewart for MailOnline Massive explosions have been seen hitting a key naval port in annexed Crimea that Russia claim was targeted in a major Ukrainian drone assault. Russian Black Sea warships were reportedly having to fight the attack off in Sevastopol, the largest city in Crimea which was annexed from Ukraine in 2014. According to Ukrainian sources, several of the Russian ships from the fleet were blown up. Local media are reporting that rescuers this morning are still attempting to put out a fire on one of the ships. Residents claimed that the huge explosions 'shook' their homes and windows while black smoke was seen rising from the docks area. Dramatic footage purportedly showed a Moscow attack helicopter destroying an 'underwater drone' in Omega Bay. The video showed the helicopter hovering above the object in the water before it bursts into flames with smoke billowing out of it. The underwater object thought to be a drone was said to be tailing a warship before it was reportedly destroyed by the Russian helicopter. Missiles were fired from the helicopter which also unleashed volleys of machine gun fire. Mikhail Razvozhayev, Russian governor of Sevastopol, said there was no damage to city infrastructure. 'Black Sea Fleet ships are fighting off a drone attack in Sevastopol Bay.' he said. 'No damage has been reported in the city. The situation is under control. All response services are at the ready.' A student dormitory at an art college near the port saw 'one windowpane burst' but 'no harm was done', he added. Russian sources claimed its air defenced deployed from naval warships were forced to repel a sustained Ukrainian attack that started at 4.30am and lasted for at least five hours. The Kremlin has also blamed a US Global Hawk (RQ-4B) which 'flew from Italy' for flying over the Black Sea and monitoring Russian responses to the concerted Ukrainian onslaught. All passenger ferry services were suspended in the strategic port which is the HQ of Putin's Black Sea Fleet. It marks what could be the most audacious attack so far by Ukraine on Russian naval assets in Sevastopol. Earlier this week, Razvozhayev said that a drone had attacked a thermal power station near Sevastopol. Meanwhile, the Russian fleet stationed in the port had also been attacked by a drone in July. So far, attempts to verify Razvozhayev's claims that no damage has been done have been unsuccessful. The Russian statesman begged locals not to post footage of the attacks, claiming that it could aid the Kyiv regime. 'A big request is not to write what-where-how much you saw and heard,' he posted. 'And do not upload videos. It should be clear to everyone that such data is very necessary for the UkroNazis in order to understand how the defence of our city is arranged.' However, this did not fail to prevent residents reporting the explosions that unfolded in the middle of the nights. One resident reported: 'Woke up at 4 a.m. to a massive explosion. Thank goodness it's [our] air defences. 'Our ships in Sevastopol Bay were repelling a drone attack. 'It was a fun night, even very fun.' Another stated: 'Woke up to an explosion at 5:30am. Followed some time later by three more…'. A third added: 'Ten minutes ago three explosions sounded, and shook the house…' Meanwhile, another comment said: 'Woke up this morning to explosions. 'Never heard anything like that before. It thundered so hard that the windows shook in the flat.' The attack comes as Russia appears to have largely given up attacking Ukraine and has been forced on to the defensive after Putin's military got mauled by Kyiv's armies. Severely undermanned and poorly trained Russian units have stopped advancing across most of the front line in the last six weeks, British intelligence said yesterday. Ukrainian forces advance in both the north and south of the country - pushing east from Kharkiv into Luhansk and advancing towards Kherson. In Kherson, companies of soldiers which should consist of 100 men were fighting with just six to eight troops each, Ministry of Defence analysts added. While Putin is attempting to bolster these units with conscripted troops, Russia is unlikely to be able to resume its offensive in the near future. Earlier this week, it had appeared that Russia was preparing to withdraw from Kherson city but Ukraine now believes Putin is actually reinforcing it. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's military intelligence service, said earlier this week that Russia has been evacuating civilians but is moving military reinforcements into urban areas, preparing defences, and plans to fight for the city. He added that the evacuation and talk of a retreat by Russia's top commander may have been an effort to lure Ukraine into a costly urban battle."

The Ministry of Defence today accused the Russian president of fabricating the story to 'detract from the disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine', adding that the Kremlin is 'peddling false claims of an epic scale' after massive explosions rocked a key Crimean port. The attacks saw Russia end the 'grain corridor' in retaliation after claiming that the ships that were targeted by Ukraine forces were involved in the deal to allow grain exports. But Russia's decision to end the deal comes amid fears that Putin has been searching for an excuse to pull out and plunge third world countries into famine as part of his efforts to put pressure on Western countries to waver in their support of Ukraine. The country has also recently criticised the deal, saying its own grain exports have suffered due to Western sanctions. Reacting to Russia's accusations, the MoD today said: 'To detract from their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale. This invented story, says more about arguments going on inside the Russian Government than it does about the west.' The Turkey and UN-brokered deal to unlock grain exports signed between Russia and Ukraine in July is critical to easing the global food crisis caused by the conflict. The agreement had already allowed more than nine million tonnes of Ukrainian grain to be exported and was due to be renewed on November 19. In an earlier statement, Russia'a defence ministry said: 'In light of the terrorist act carried out by the Kyiv regime with the participation of British experts against ships of the Black Sea fleet and civilian vessels involved in the security of grain corridors, Russia suspends its participation in the implementation of the agreement on the export of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports.' The Kremlin has now requested a UN Security Council meeting on Monday following the attack. Meanwhile, Russia's decision to suspend its participation in the grain agreement was today described by US President as outrageous. And Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky questioned how Russia can be a member of the G20 if it is 'deliberately trying to provoke starvation'. In a video address, he accused the Kremlin of trying to create an artificial famine in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. He also called the move 'predictable', adding that Moscow has been 'blockading' ships carrying grain since September. Currently, he said, 176 vessels are backed up at sea, carrying more than two million tons of food. The European Union is supporting UN-led efforts to keep the Ukraine grain deal alive, a spokesperson said on Saturday. Nabila Massrali, spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy at the European Commission, said: We stress that all parties must refrain from any unilateral action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative which is a critical humanitarian effort that is clearly having a positive impact on access to food for millions of people around the world.' Sevastopol in Moscow-annexed Crimea, which has been targeted several times in recent months, serves as the headquarters for the fleet and a logistical hub for operations in Ukraine. Furious Moscow forces alleged British 'specialists', whom they said were based in the southern Ukrainian city of Ochakiv, had helped prepare and train Kyiv to carry out the strike. In a further singling out of the UK - which Moscow sees as one of the most unfriendly Western countries - Russia said the same British unit was involved in explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines last month. A claim refuted by British officials. Extraordinary footage has emerged showing Russian troops on board firing wildly at the drone as it races towards what is believed to be the Admiral Makarov frigate, which replaced the Moskva as the Black Sea Fleet's flagship. The underwater Ukrainian drone can be seen racing through the key naval port of Sevastopol - the largest city in Crimea - while panicking Russian troops on ships and helicopters attempt to destroy it. The exhilarating footage taken from a camera within the drone shows the underwater weapon riding through the waves and dodging bullets which can be seen penetrating the surface. A helicopter can then be seen racing into shot as desperate Russians attempt to respond before it continues to fire at the maritime drone. The underwater drones have been previously speculated as being involved in the explosion of the Kerch bridge in Crimea on October 8 - the day after Vladimir Putin's birthday. In response to the bridge blast, Putin unleashed a barrage of missile strikes across Ukraine, striking civilian centres. Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Moscow-installed governor of Sevastopol, said the drone attack was the 'most massive' the peninsula had seen. The city's services were on 'alert', but he claimed no 'civilian infrastructure' had been damaged. City authorities said that the harbour was 'temporarily' closed to boats and ferries and urged people ""not to panic"". Attacks on Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, have increased in recent weeks, as Kyiv presses a counter-offensive in the south to retake territory held by Moscow for months. Moscow-installed authorities in Kherson, just north of Crimea, have vowed to turn the city into a fortress, preparing for an inevitable assault. On Thursday, Razvozhayev said a thermal power station had been attacked in Balaklava, in the Sevastopol area. He claimed there was only minor damage and no casualties. It comes on a day which has seen Russia seek revenge for a drone attack that hit Sevastopol in the early hours of the morning. Russian Black Sea warships were forced to fight Kyiv forces in an attack that Russian Ministry of Defence branded a 'terrorist attack'. Moscow claimed that they destroyed nine aerial drones and seven maritime drones. Mikhail Razvozhayev, Russian governor of Sevastopol, said the attack in the early hours of the morning caused no damage to city infrastructure but later the Ministry of Defence conceded that at least one vessel sustained minor damage. Although Ukraine has not confirmed these attacks, Kyiv sources claim that several of the Russian ships from the fleet were blown up, including the frigate Admiral Makarov. Before Russia halted the grain deal, the Ministry had threatened on Telegram: 'It should be emphasised that the ships of the Black Sea Fleet that were subjected to the terrorist attack are involved in ensuring the security of the 'grain corridor' as part of an international initiative to export agricultural products from Ukrainian ports.' Britain strongly rebutted claims they were involved, saying 'the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale.' The British defence ministry said that this 'invented story says more about arguments going on inside the Russian Government than it does about the West'. Earlier today Razvozhayev said: 'Black Sea Fleet ships are fighting off a drone attack in Sevastopol Bay.' he said. 'No damage has been reported in the city. The situation is under control. All response services are at the ready.' A student dormitory at an art college near the port saw 'one windowpane burst' but 'no harm was done', he added.

2022-10-29,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11367289/Kyiv-Mayor-Vitali-Klitschko-appeals-West-send-blankets-Ukraine-winter.html,Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko appeals to the West to send blankets to Ukraine before winter with capital’s grid operating in ‘emergency mode’ after Russian strikes on power stations,"The mayor of Kyiv has pleaded with the West to send blankets and generators to Ukraine to get them through the winter. Vital Klitschko, 51, said that his country has been left desperate due to numerous attacks on power plants and the capital's grid is operating in 'emergency mode.' Although Mr Klitschko has bought some generators and has got 1,000 mobile heating points in Kyiv, organised with the help of his team, fears are still growing as the weather gets colder and Russia continues to attack key infrastructure. He said yesterday on Telegram: 'Due to a significant shortage of electricity, from 20% to 50%, - the city's energy supply system is operating in emergency mode. In the same post, Klitschko confirmed reports from the regional governor and Ukrenergo, the state energy company, that Kyiv and the surrounding region will see rolling blackouts in the coming days. Klitschko expressed hope that Ukrenergo employees would restore the flow of electricity to its usual level 'in two to three weeks, barring circumstances beyond their control.' Ukraine has been struggling with outages and worrying about the system surviving the winter due to Russian attacks on power stations and the wider grid over the last two weeks. It has left 40 per cent of energy infrastructure in Ukraine seriously damaged. Speaking to the Telegraph, Mr Klitshcko banged his fists on the table and said: 'We are doing everything we can do to save the lives of our people and to protect them. 'But this winter will definitely be a huge challenge for us.' Without blankets, he said, people in the country would freeze to death. Vitali had also announced on Ukrainian television that new air defense equipment had arrived in the capital, and expressed hope that it would help protect its energy infrastructure after weeks of targeted Russian airstrikes. He said: 'The military have assured me (during a recent meeting) that new air defense equipment has arrived in the capital and our sky will be safer,' 'We hope that there will be no more attacks and provocations with kamikaze drones and missiles,' Klitschko added, in a reference to Iranian-made Shahed exploding drones spotted repeatedly over Ukrainian cities. The strikes on power stations and the wider grid are a change in tactics which Mr Klitschko says has occurred due to the Russian president's need to claim a minor victory in his war. The newest commander of the Kremlin's invasion, General Sergei Surovikin, had coordinated the drone and missile attacks. Residents in Kyiv were told that due to the strikes, there would be a 'sharp deterioration' in the region's electricity supplies. Electricity is currently one of the only methods that Ukrainians have to heat their homes, as many are living in war-ravaged buildings that do not have gas and windows. And it has become apparent that the freezing weather is turning into a new weapon for Putin, in the hope that residents will be so cold they will obey him. It comes as temperatures are expected to sink to as low as -20C in some areas of Ukraine in the coming days. Mr Klitschko said that he is grateful for the support of Western countries but added that aid that has been given has been too slow to come. He made the remarks after receiving a fire engine and two ambulances from a German charitable foundation. He also pleaded for blankets, winter clothes and generators as well as heavy weaponry and air-defence systems. The Kyiv mayor said that the clothing and blankets are essential for Ukrainians as the winter comes. He made the move into politics after being a heavyweight boxing star for more than a decade. Along with brother Wladimir, he is a popular personality in Ukraine. And he has been asking for support for the whole of Ukraine with Wladimir's help. Vitali was on a list of targets for Russian assassins when the war first began to rumble in Ukraine. But he is unconcerned about the threat and has continued to lobby for support and travel the world in order to get weaponry for his country. He said that the country will never have enough weapons deliveries and added that enough is enough when the war is over. Vitali said that he was sad to say that if it was possible, then Ukrainians should stay away from the country over the winter, as there is a risk of a humanitarian issue. He spoke of the violence against civilians in other suburbs of Ukraine and said that he believes Putin's lack of success in the Donbas has led him to target citizens head on. Describing Putin as a liar, he said that the so-called war is actually genocide. Vitali has won huge popularity for staying in Ukraine."

Severely undermanned and poorly trained Russian units have stopped advancing across most of the front line in the last six weeks, British intelligence said today. In Kherson, companies of soldiers which should consist of 100 men were fighting with just six to eight troops each, Ministry of Defence analysts added. While Putin is attempting to bolster these units with conscripted troops, Russia is unlikely to be able to resume its offensive in the near future.

Earlier this week, it had appeared that Russia was preparing to withdraw from Kherson city but Ukraine now believes Putin is actually reinforcing it. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's military intelligence service, said earlier this week that Russia has been evacuating civilians but is moving military reinforcements into urban areas, preparing defences, and plans to fight for the city. He added that the evacuation and talk of a retreat by Russia's top commander may have been an effort to lure Ukraine into a costly urban battle. In its Friday update, British intelligence wrote: 'Russia has likely augmented some of its units [in Kherson] with mobilised reservists. However, this is from an extremely low level of manning. 'In September, Russian officers described companies in the Kherson sector as consisting of between six and eight men each. Companies should deploy with around 100 personnel. 'In the last six weeks there has been a clear move from Russian ground forces to transition to a long-term, defensive posture on most areas of the front line in Ukraine. 'This is likely due to a more realistic assessment that the severely undermanned, poorly trained force in Ukraine is currently only capable of defensive operations. 'Even if Russia succeeds in consolidating long-term defensive lines in Ukraine, its operational design will remain vulnerable. 'To regain the initiative, it will need to regenerate higher quality, mobile forces which are capable of dynamically countering Ukrainian breakthroughs and conducting their own large-scale offensive operations.' The war in Ukraine is now grinding into its ninth month with Kyiv on the front foot and Putin nowhere near achieving his aims. Though the official purpose of the invasion remains the 'liberation' of the eastern Donbas region, according to Putin, in reality his troops have stopped advancing almost everywhere besides the town of Bakhmut, in Donetsk. Meanwhile they are being pushed back in the northern Kharkiv region and southern region of Kherson – the latter of which Putin has declared to be part of Russia. That has sparked fears he could resort to nukes, after he said he would use 'all available means' to defend the territory. It comes after Moscow alleged that Ukraine is preparing to detonate a so-called 'dirty bomb' on its territory, meaning a conventional explosive laced with radioactive material to cause contamination. The UN's atomic watchdog has now been dispatched to two areas of Ukraine where Putin alleges the bomb is being prepared – at Kyiv's insistence – as President Volodymyr Zelensky and his allies dismiss the claims as fiction. Instead, they say Russia may be preparing the ground to use one of its own nukes as a pretext for escalating the conflict. US President Joe Biden, asked about Putin's assertion he would never use nukes in Ukraine, responded last night: 'Why does he keep talking about it? 'Why is he talking about the ability to use a tactical nuclear weapon? He's been very dangerous in how he's approached this and he should just get out. 'He can end this all, get out of Ukraine.'"

Nina Khrushcheva, who is a professor of international relations at New York's The New School, said the dictator's 'grandiose rhetoric' about a 'new world order' suggests he is contemplating a global confrontation. Ms Khrushcheva, who is currently in Russia, also warned that the public are stockpiling radiation pills and 'preparing for something disastrous' because nobody knowns what Putin might do next. Last night in Moscow the Kremlin leader was asked to reassure an audience at think-tank the Valdai Discussion Club that the world is not on the verge of nuclear annihilation – and chose to respond with a long pause. When host Fyodor Lukyanov pointed out that his silence was 'alarming', a smirking Putin responded: 'I did that on purpose so you would be on your guard. The effect has been achieved.' Putin used his annual speech to the Valdai Club to lay out his foreign policy agenda, proclaiming that Western world order is crumbling and that the time has come to establish a 'multipolar world order' in which Moscow gets a bigger say. Blaming western leaders for fanning the flames of war in Ukraine and Taiwan, Putin also accused them of sparking an energy crisis and strangling global food markets – all things that he has been criticised for. The president also spoke at length about nuclear weapons, having threatened the West several times with an atomic strike – sparking fears he may also use one in Ukraine. The Russian despot denied he has any plans to use one on his neighbour, saying there is 'no political or military justification' for doing so. But he also referred back to Russia's nuclear doctrine which allows them to be used in the event the country is threatened which – at least according to the Kremlin – now includes occupied parts of Ukraine. Mr Lukyanov pointed out that today is the 60th anniversary of the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis – which was resolved when Mr Khrushchev chose to withdraw Soviet nukes from Cuba. Putin was asked whether he could imagine taking Mr Khrushchev's position if the crisis were to repeat itself, and replied: 'No way.' Asked to clarify whether that means there will be no nuclear standoff, or whether he would have refused to back down, Putin responded only: 'I cannot imagine myself in the role of Khrushchev.' Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Nina Khrushcheva said Putin 'clearly doesn't think in the same terms' as her great-grandfather. 'When Khrushchev was ousted one of the allegations was he took rockets away from Cuba and after that the Soviet Union looked weak. 'Khrushchev said: ""What, I was supposed to start a world war?"" 'Putin clearly doesn't think in those terms. He thinks ""it is our way and the way I decide it is going to be and we're not going to back off"". 'I'm not going to put words in his mouth – he didn't say ""otherwise it will be a world war"" – but it does seem... that he may be ready to have a war instead of adjusting his political behaviour.' Questioned about the current atmosphere in Russia, where she is working, Ms Khrushcheva said there is a 'palpable' sense of paranoia about what Putin will do. 'Society is getting more desperate,' she said. 'It is frozen in despair – not even fear, despair – we don't know what is going to happen [or] what tomorrow brings. 'The last month of nuclear conversation... there is a story [that sales of radiation pills] went up 70 per cent. People are preparing for something disastrous.' Fears of nuclear escalation have been building as the war in Ukraine grinds into its ninth month with Kyiv on the front foot and Putin nowhere near achieving his aims. Though the official purpose of the invasion remains the 'liberation' of the eastern Donbas region, according to Putin, in reality his troops have stopped advancing almost everywhere besides the town of Bakhmut, in Donetsk.

2022-10-28,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11364741/Army-risks-running-low-anti-tank-weapons-emerges-UK-replace-missiles-sent-Kyiv.html,Army risks running low on anti-tank weapons as it emerges HALF of Britain's stockpile of missiles which were donated to Ukraine STILL have not been replaced,"Britain and its Nato allies 'need to tool up' and restock its dwindling supply of anti-tank weapons after thousands of missiles were sent to the front lines in Ukraine, a minister has said. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey this week admitted that Nato stockpiles of deadly weapons had been 'insufficient' as the alliance continues to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin's invading military. It comes amid fears the British Army faces running out of next-generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAW) missiles after it emerged ministers have not green-lit plans to replace thousands of weapons donated to Ukraine. 'It’s very obvious, the stockpiles that were being held across Nato – even in the US – were insufficient given realistically how long it would take for manufacturing to come in,' former Army Major Mr Heappey admitted during a speech at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London. ‘You can see all across the alliance people realising that it is time to retool up and be in the business, as an alliance, of being able to overwhelm militarily.' The lethal NLAW, made in Belfast, have proven critical in the success of Ukraine's fierce resistance against Russian invaders, destroying hundreds of tanks. Defence sources have said that close to 7,000 NLAW missiles could have been sent to Ukraine - which is about half of Britain's total stockpile. Alec Shelbrooke, the former defence procurement minister who was in charge of buying all the UK's military kit until he was sacked by Rishi Sunak on Wednesday, admitted last week that a deal still had not been agreed to replace the weapons. In response to a written question from John Healey, the Shadow Defence Secretary, Shelbrooke said the MoD was 'on schedule to place contracts'. 'We continue to equip Ukraine with vital supplies, such as NLAWs,' said Mr Shelbroke, who has since been replaced by Alex Chalk. 'We are replacing equipment and munitions from UK stocks and are on schedule to place contracts to replenish NLAW stocks.' A handful of British soldiers have been busy training the Ukrainian Army how to use the NLAWs, with 30 UK troops understood to have flown to Yavoriv in the west of Ukraine a month before Russia invaded. Military sources have reportedly claimed the Ministry of Defence had knocked 'months off' its procurement timelines in a bid to resupply its stock of missiles. Francis Tusa, a defence analyst, said the NLAW's success in Ukraine meant it was a 'no brainer' for the MoD to restock its missile supplies. 'We shipped them out so quickly and it arguably changed the course of the war because the Ukrainians were able to take out armoured columns with no effort at all,' he told The Times. 'These things take time to be produced. Why there has been any delay, I just cannot fathom.' But Labour's Shadow Defence Secretary warned that the Government had to act urgently to fill the void left in its supply of anti-tank missiles. 'This failing military procurement system needs fixing,' Mr Healey said in a statement to MailOnline. 'The NLAW anti-tank missiles have been vital to Ukraine. This is day 244 of Putin’s war, yet there’s still no MoD contract signed and still no production to restock for Ukraine and for our own Army. 'More broadly, ministers must move away from ad-hoc announcements of weapons and set out a long-term plan of support for Ukraine, alongside allies, to make sure Putin’s illegal invasion ends in failure.' During his speech at RUSI, Mr Heappey warned that Britain had 'inescapably returned to a requirement for conventional hard-power deterrence'. The minister said the nation - and Nato's - defence and manufacturing powerhouses were not equipped to replace vast stocks of weaponry used on the front lines, rapidly. 'The industrial capacity simply does not exist to replace those things at anything like the pace that would be required,' Mr Heappey told journalists and defence experts. He said the MoD would face 'profound challenges' if it came to sourcing more military tech during a time of 'total war'. But the minister insisted that the UK could not rely on bringing old kit and vehicles - like obsolete tanks - back into service to fill a void in supplies. He said Britain could not 'kid itself' into thinking that if the Army 'dusted down' all its out-of-service kit, like the Challenger 1 or Chieftain tanks, which are 'currently gate guards' at military camps across the UK it would have a fresh stock of 200 extra vehicles to rely upon. 'That’s nonsense, we would be defeated in a blink,' he said. The MoD insisted the UK had 'enough' weapons systems to 'defend our national security' while 'fulfilling' its commitments to Nato and Ukraine. A spokesman added the MoD was 'actively engaged' with industry to 'ensure' it could equip Ukraine with 'vital military support, while replacing at pace, all the equipment and munitions' donated from UK stocks to Kyiv.

Fanis Ishmuratov perished aged 26 in the year 2000 in the first military tragedy of the Kremlin leader's long years in power. He is believed to have been alive after the nuclear submarine exploded and sank in the Barents Sea. However, bungled rescue attempts meant that ultimately there were no survivors among the 118 crew. Now, the midshipman's son Danis, 25, has been killed serving in the Russian army in Ukraine, joining the unknown tens of thousands sent to their death by Putin. The circumstances as to how and where he was killed in the war are not known. The tragedy means the submariner's widow Faima, 46, lost both her husband and only son to military tragedies under the despotic Russian president. Danis recently spoke about how he decided to join the armed services, but also said he wanted to know how his father had died - calling for the official veil of secrecy over the Kursk tragedy to be lifted. 'I dream of becoming an officer, raising many children, at least seven,' the tragic young soldier told Kommersant newspaper, before his death. 'I want to be a father of many children. To have a house, a sauna, children, so my mother will be happy with grandchildren.' He told how he wanted to be a submariner like his father who he idolised but did not remember because he was too young in August 2000. 'I decided to start with the ground forces in order to gain experience,' he said. 'I am considering serving in the Navy in the future and want my children to continue the military dynasty.' He demanded answers into how his father had died - something Putin has always refused. 'I know that there was an investigation into the causes of the accident, but I don't know where the case materials are located. 'As far as I know, my mother and father's parents did not see these documents. 'I think the Kursk case is a military secret and the documents are classified. But I hope we will find out the truth, sooner or later.' Putin vetoed a British offer to help rescue the crew. At the time he was accused of cruelty and incompetence, replying to a question of what happened to the Kursk by shrugging and saying: 'It sank.' 'I would like to know the truth, I would like to know what exactly happened there,' said Danis in August. 'It is important for me to know why my father died. 'After all, later they found a letter [on one of the crew] from which it became known that some submariners were alive, and my father was among them. 'They were the last who died.' Some 23 are believed to have survived the powerful explosions that killed the rest of the crew. 'My mother did not interfere in any way with my decision to go to the army, despite the fact that I was an only child, and she even supported me, saying: ""Continue the service of your father."" 'You can say that my father is an idol for me. But I don't compare myself to my father. I think it's too early to compare. 'In 2018, my grandfather made a monument to my father - the monument located at the very entrance to the village of Meryasovo, where my father was born.' Fanis was a technician on the Kursk submarine. He was posthumously awarded an Order of Courage. Similar secrecy has been thrown over the loss of the Moskva, flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, which was sunk in April. The Ukrainians say it was hit by their missiles, but the Kremlin has refused to confirm this, or reveal how many sailors were lost among a crew which included hundreds of conscripts."
2022-10-28,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11363551/Pro-Russian-official-admits-Putins-forces-looted-remains-18th-century-prince.html,Putin's forces have looted the BODY of 18th century prince Grigory Potemkin from cathedral in Ukraine: Pro-Russian official claims they are 'protecting' remains of a national hero,"The remains of an 18th century prince were taken from a cathedral in Ukraine, along with other historic artefacts, a pro-Russian official has admitted. Forces have claimed that they took the monument to Grigory Potemkin, a Russian war hero, and a bag containing his skull and bones from St Catherine's Cathedral in Kherson in order to 'protect' the remains. His remains, including carefully numbered bones, had been in a black bag in his coffin. Vladimir Saldo, the so-called head of the Kremlin-backed administration in Russian-held Kherson, said: 'We transported to the left bank the remains of the holy prince that were in St. Catherine's Cathedral. 'We transported Potemkin himself. These were my decisions because these are my powers, my duties and responsibilities.' Saldo made the extraordinary admission that pro-Russian officials were stealing cultural and historical artefacts in an interview with Crimea 24, a Putin mouthpiece. Mr Saldo, a Ukrainian politician who betrayed his own country at the start of the war, said he had taken the decision to move monuments, statues, and artefacts away from the city. 'All relics will return to their place because our cause is just. We do not want anything else than to live a peaceful life,' he said. Prince Grigory Aleksandrovich Potyomkin-Tavricheski, was a Russian military leader, statesman, nobleman, and favourite of Catherine the Great. He died during negotiations over the Treaty of Jassy (now Iași), which ended a war with the Ottoman Empire that he had overseen. Potemkin was born into a family of middle-income noble landowners. He first attracted Catherine's favour for helping in her 1762 coup, then distinguished himself as a military commander in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774). He became Catherine's lover. After their passion cooled, he remained her lifelong friend and favored statesman. He had the titles of Holy Roman Empire of Prince of the Russian Empire among many others. Potemkin was both a Grand Admiral and the head of all of Russia's land and irregular forces. His achievements include the peaceful annexation of the Crimea (1783) and the successful second Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792). In 1775, Potemkin became the governor-general of Russia's new southern provinces. An absolute ruler, he worked to colonize the wild steppes, controversially dealing firmly with the Cossacks who lived there. He founded the towns of Kherson, Nikolayev, Sevastopol, and Ekaterinoslav. Ports in the region became bases for his new Black Sea Fleet. His rule in the south is associated with the, probably mythical, 'Potemkin village', a ruse involving the construction of painted façades to mimic real villages, full of happy, well-fed people, for visiting officials to see. Potemkin was known for his love of women, gambling and material wealth. He oversaw the construction of many historically significant buildings, including the Tauride Palace in St. Petersburg. His name features in Battleship Potemkin, a 1925 Soviet silent drama film produced by Mosfilm. Directed and co-written by Sergei Eisenstein, it presents a dramatization of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against its officers. In 1958, the film was voted number 1 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo. Battleship Potemkin is considered one of the greatest films of all time. In the most recent Sight and Sound critics' poll in 2012, it was voted the eleventh-greatest film of all time, and it placed in the top 10 in all previous editions. His remarks alluded to the fierce fighting that is set to engulf the southern region over the next weeks as Ukraine looks to retake the territory seized by Russia in March. Potemkin was an 18th-century commander who wanted to build a New Russia for his lover, Catherine the Great, and annexed Crimea in 1783. He also founded the cities of Odesa and Kherson in what is now southern Ukraine. Vladimir Putin is known to be a huge admirer of the military leader and often invokes his vision of restoring a lost Russian empire. The Russian despot's puppet politicians in southern Ukraine last night said they had evacuated an additional 70,000 people from the area. Kyiv says that number includes some of its own citizens who have forcibly deported to Russia. The looming battle for Kherson city at the mouth of the Dnipro River will determine whether Ukraine can loosen Russia's grip on the south. The Russian-appointed Kherson regional government said it has moved to the river's left bank in expectation of increased fighting between both Ukraine and the occupying forces. Gen. Oleksii Gromov, the chief of the main operational department of the Ukrainian military's general staff, said Russia may have staged explosions at residential buildings in the city of Kherson before retreating. He said that the Russian goal was 'to inflict a critical damage to the infrastructure of the areas being reclaimed by Ukraine.' As Ukrainian forces advance on the right bank, hundreds of civilians have already been sent across the Dnieper River. Several other statues and monuments have been taken from their plinths in the city centre of Kherson. This included a monument to Potemkin which was erected in 2003. The empty plinths were seen in footage taken in Kherson over the weekend. The removal of Potemkin's remains led to one historian reacting on Twitter. Simon Sebag Montefiore said: 'So what will Putin do w the stolen body of Serenissimus Prince Potemkin of Taurida? 'Tho Potemkin wld have loathed Putin's primitive cruel nationalism, I predict a plangent imperial TV extravaganza when Putin will bury Potemkin in a flashy new Moscow tomb and promote his war.' But a Russian-appointed official, Kirill Stremousov, downplayed any threat of a ground invasion of Kherson. He said: 'We are saving the heritage – not from Nazis entering the city, but from shelling which has got so chaotic lately that it can hit anything these days, from museums to schools and hospitals.' Elsewhere, Ukraine's president was sceptical that Russian forces were going to retreat from Kherson. Speaking to Corriere Della Sera, Zelensky said: 'I don't see Russians running away from Kherson. 'This is a ruse. I'm not at liberty to disclose everything, but this is a ruse to get us to move our troops from other hotspots to here.' It comes as Ukrainian police said that Russian troops have moved into residential buildings in several towns. This includes Kherson, which is awash with vacant buildings after the area was evacuated. In recent days, it has also been claimed that Russian forces have forcibly removed least 2,000 people and taken them to Crimea, according to Ukrainian intelligence officials. Many of the evacuees were children who the unnamed official said were taken away from their families by force, in what they called an 'abduction.'"
2022-10-28,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11363615/Were-going-win-case-Biden-confident-student-loan-debt-relief-plan-passed.html,'We're going to win that case': Biden declares he's confident his student loan debt relief plan will be passed - despite six Republican-led states launching legal challenges to block it,"President Joe Biden on Thursday said he expects to overcome the legal challenges to his plan for student loan debt relief - claiming checks will be sent out before mid November. The president was asked during a NewsNation interview about the scheme, which on Friday was blocked by a federal judge in St Louis, Missouri. 'We're going to win that case,' Biden said. 'I think in the next two weeks you're going to see those checks going out.' The Missouri federal court said they needed more time to rule on an emergency request by six Republican-led states to block the policy. The plan, announced in August, was designed for people who had taken out loans to pay for college. Friday's decision delays distribution of up to $20,000 in debt relief for more than 40 million eligible borrowers. About 22 million people have already applied for debt relief since the application opened on October 14. On Friday night, the White House urged people to continue applying, despite the ruling. 'Tonight's temporary order does not prevent borrowers from applying for student debt relief at studentaid.gov – and we encourage eligible borrowers to join the nearly 22 million Americans whose information the Department of Education already has,' the administration said in a statement. 'It also does not prevent us from reviewing these applications and preparing them for transmission to loan servicers. 'It is also important to note that the order does not reverse the trial court's dismissal of the case, or suggest that the case has merit. 'It merely prevents debt from being discharged until the court makes a decision.' The White House said they 'will continue to move full speed ahead in our preparations in compliance with this order.' They added: 'The Administration will continue to fight Republican officials suing to block our efforts to provide relief to working families.' The states which challenged included Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina. Before the Missouri court's decision was announced, Biden spoke about the scheme at Delaware State University, a historically black university where the majority of students receive federal Pell Grants. The president highlighted the ease of the application, which doesn't require users to upload any forms or to create an account. President Joe Biden announced his relief plan for federal student loan borrowers, which includes: - $10,000 forgiveness for borrowers earning $125,000 individually or $250,000 jointly - $20,000 forgiveness for Pell Grant recipients earning $125,000 individually or $250,000 jointly - Aims to cap undergrad loan payments at five percent of their monthly income - Graduate program and Parent Plus loans are eligible - Student loan repayment pause was extended for the last time until December 31, 2022 'Folks, it takes less than five minutes,' Biden said. He said the 'vast majority' of applicants are able to submit for relief from their phones. It's unclear what the appeals court decision means for the 22 million borrowers who already applied for the relief. The Biden administration had promised not to clear any debt before October 23 as it battled the legal challenges, but the soonest it was expected to begin erasing debt was mid-November. Biden blasted Republicans who have criticized his relief program, saying 'their outrage is wrong and it´s hypocritical.' He added: 'I don't want to hear it from MAGA Republican officials' who had millions of debt and pandemic relief loans forgiven. He singled out politicians including Representatives Vern Buchanan and Marjorie Taylor Greene, who received loan forgiveness, and Senator Ted Cruz, who called some beneficiaries of student loans 'slackers.' Asked Biden last week: 'Who the hell do they think they are?' During Thursday's NewsNation interview, Biden said that Russian President Vladimir Putin's angry rhetoric over nuclear weapons and threats to the world suggested he was preparing to use weapons of mass destruction. For weeks, U.S. officials have said they have not seen evidence that Russia has changed its nuclear posture despite fears that it could be preparing for one last desperate push in Ukraine. But in the interview, Biden was asked whether he believed Putin when he said earlier that he had no intention of using chemical or nuclear weapons in Ukraine. 'I think if he has no intention, why does he keep talking about it?' he told News Nation after a long pause. 'Why is he talking about the ability to use a tactical nuclear weapon? He's been very dangerous in how he's approached this and he should just get out. 'He can end this all, get out of Ukraine.'"

Joe Biden says he fears Vladimir Putin WILL put his nuclear threats into action after Russian leader delivered deluded rant to the world","President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin's angry rhetoric over nuclear weapons and threats to the world suggested he was preparing to use weapons of mass destruction. For weeks, U.S. officials have said they have not seen evidence that Russia has changed its nuclear posture despite fears that it could be preparing for one last desperate push in Ukraine. But in an interview, Biden was asked whether he believed Putin when he said earlier that he had no intention of using chemical or nuclear weapons in Ukraine. 'I think if he has no intention, why does he keep talking about it?' he told News Nation after a long pause. 'Why is he talking about the ability to use a tactical nuclear weapon? He's been very dangerous in how he's approached this and he should just get out. 'He can end this all, get out of Ukraine.' Biden has got ahead of his administration on the issue before. Earlier this month he used the word 'Armageddon' to illustrate the dangers that could unleashed if Putin detonated tactical nuclear weapons. 'He's not joking when he talks about potential use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons because his military is — you might say — significantly underperforming,' he said then. This time he was responding to Putin's calls for a 'new world order' in a major foreign policy speech in Moscow. The Russian leader, laying out his warped view of global politics, accused westerners of 'fanning the flames' of war in both Ukraine and Taiwan (where fears are growing of a Chinese invasion), of sparking a global energy crisis and of causing a food crisis - all allegations that have been levelled at him. Putin warned the world has entered its most dangerous period since the Second World War and a 'new world order' must emerge in which Russia gets a bigger say. 'The West is no longer able to dictate its will to the humankind but still tries to do it, and the majority of nations no longer want to tolerate it,' he said. 'Dominion of the world is what West has decided to stake in this game. It is a dangerous, deadly and dirty game.' Putin said that Moscow has no intention to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, despite issuing repeated warnings in the past that he was prepared to use all available means to defend Russia, including its vast nuclear arsenal. 'We see no need for that,' Putin said at the conference of international foreign policy experts. 'There is no point in that, neither political nor military.' The Russian leader insisted for weeks before the invasion that he did not intend to attack Ukraine, before ordering his troops across the border on February 24. While at points Putin sounded as if he was offering an olive branch - saying Russia 'is not an enemy of the West' and 'only wants the right to develop' - he made it clear that any talks on his 'new order' would have to be on Moscow's terms. The West, he said, had repeatedly rejected Moscow's plans for peace laid out before the war in Ukraine - such as the withdrawal of all NATO troops from ex-Soviet states, against the wishes of their governments - and had instead chosen conflict. He claimed that he had told the West: 'Let's be friends, have dialogue and strengthen trust and peace.' 'We were completely sincere,' he added. 'What did we get in response? A 'no' on every possible area of cooperation.' In fact, the US and NATO had both sent letters to Russia laying out possible grounds for cooperation before Putin invaded Ukraine, which Moscow rejected. Russia isn't the enemy of the West but will continue to oppose the diktat of Western neo-liberal elites, he said, accusing them of trying to subdue Moscow. 'Their goal is to make Russia more vulnerable and turn it into an instrument for fulfilling their geopolitical tasks, they have failed to achieve it and they will never succeed,' Putin said. The Russian president reaffirmed his long-held claim that Russians and Ukrainians are part of a single people and again denigrated Ukraine as an 'artificial state,' which received historic Russian lands from Communist rulers during the Soviet times. By David Averre and Chris Pleasance for MailOnline Vladimir Putin today referred to former British Prime Minister Liz Truss as 'crazy' amid sweeping accusations that Western powers are engaged in 'nuclear blackmail of Russia'. In a ranting speech in Moscow, the Russian president said Truss must have been 'a bit out of it' and he claimed to have 'never said anything proactively about possible use of nuclear weapons by Russia'. 'We have only hinted in response to statements made by western leaders,' he insisted, pointing out that Russian military doctrine dictates nuclear weapons should only be deployed in 'self-defence'. Truss previously labelled Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons against the West as 'sabre-rattling' when she spoke at the UN General Assembly in September. Alongside his criticism of Truss, Putin asserted Kyiv has the technology to create and potentially detonate a 'dirty bomb' in Ukraine. He also refuted claims that Russian forces were attacking the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - located in territory controlled by Russia in southern Ukraine. The Russian leader, laying out his warped view of global politics, went on to accused westerners of 'fanning the flames' of war in Ukraine and Taiwan, of sparking a global energy crisis and of causing a food crisis - in effect regurgitating the same allegations levelled at him by much of the international community. Putin warned the world has entered its most dangerous period since the Second World War and a 'new world order' must emerge in which Russia gets a bigger say, declaring that the 'age of western domination is over'. 'Dominion of the world is what West has decided to stake in this game. It is a dangerous, deadly and dirty game,' he added. The Russian president also stated that his country is 'ready for talks' on Ukraine. Speaking about the conflict, Putin said he thinks 'all the time' about the casualties Russia has suffered in the conflict, but insisted he was left with no choice but to attack and that Russia would have paid a higher price if it had not acted. He denied underestimating Ukraine's ability to fight back and insisted that his 'special military operation' has proceeded as planned. The Russian leader said: 'About our country, you know, of course, we have costs, most notably regards losses in the special military operation. I think about it all the time. There are also economic losses, but there are enormous gains. And ultimately, and I want to emphasize, ultimately, all that is happening now will undoubtedly benefit Russia and its future. Why? Because it's connected to strengthening our sovereignty.' Putin also acknowledged the challenges posed by Western sanctions, but argued that Russia has proven resilient to foreign pressure and become more united. The speech is just the latest in a string of ranting addresses that Putin has given since launching his war, laying out his historical grievances, distorted view of current events, and his vision for the future. He has repeatedly talked of creating a 'multipolar world order' in which Western capitals, including Washington, would have to kowtow to Moscow and Beijing. Accusing the West of trying to 'cancel' Russia and its history, he has presented the conflict in Ukraine as an existential struggle for what he presents as 'Russian values'. Kyiv argues the Russian invasion is a genocidal mission to both rewrite history - including the fall of the Soviet Union, which Putin called a 'catastrophe' - and to ensure Ukraine cannot draw closer to the West. In his speech, Putin accused NATO of 'starting to seize the territories of Ukraine long ago' and insisted he was forced to invade to protect people. He also said on Thursday that hard-line Ukrainian nationalists were willing to 'fight until the last Ukrainian' in the conflict with Russia. Putin said Ukraine had suffered heavy losses in the eight-month conflict and criticised Ukrainian 'hardline patriots' and 'banderites,' a tag Russian officials and commentators often use to describe Ukrainian fighters who they say are neo-Nazis and fascists, for being willing to sacrifice their fellow fighters. Amid fears that Putin's war could go nuclear, he today denied having any intentions of using the weapons in Ukraine. But he described the conflict there as part of alleged efforts by the West to secure its global domination, which he insisted are doomed to fail. Speaking at a conference of international foreign policy experts, Putin said it's pointless for Russia to strike Ukraine with nuclear weapons. 'We see no need for that,' Putin said. 'There is no point in that, neither political, nor military.' Putin said an earlier warning of his readiness to use 'all means available to protect Russia' didn't amount to nuclear saber-rattling but was merely a response to Western statements about their possible use of nuclear weapons. He particularly mentioned Liz Truss saying in August that she would be ready to use nuclear weapons if she became Britain's prime minister, a remark which he said worried the Kremlin. 'What were we supposed to think?' Putin said. 'We saw that as a coordinated position, an attempt to blackmail us.' Without offering evidence, the Russian leader repeated Moscow's unproven allegation that Ukraine was plotting a false flag attack involving a radioactive dirty bomb it would try to pin on Russia. Ukraine has strongly rejected the claim, and its Western allies have dismissed it as 'transparently false.' Ukraine argued Russia might be making the unfounded allegation to serve as a cover for its own possible plot to detonate a dirty bomb. Putin said he personally ordered Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to call his foreign counterparts to tell them about the purported plot. He maintained that Russia knows the Ukrainian facilities working on the project. Putin claimed, still without citing any proof, that Kyiv's plan was to rig a missile with radioactive waste and to characterize its explosion as a Russian nuclear strike in an effort to isolate Russia in the global arena. He mocked the allegations by Ukraine and the West that Russia was firing on the territory of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine as 'ravings.' Russian troops have occupied the plant, Europe's largest, since the early days of the conflict and Moscow has accused Ukraine of continuously shelling it. Also in his speech, speaking about Saudi Arabia, he said that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman should be respected and that Russia was set on boosting relations with them. It comes amid tensions between Saudi Arabia and the US after the OPEC+, chaired by Saudi Arabia, voted to reduce oil output by around 2 million barrels per day on October 5. The United States' has criticised Prince Mohammed and the OPEC+ oil alliance for agreeing to cut oil production, a move seen as a boost to Russia's attempts to protect its economy in the face of Western sanctions. Putin also used today's address to state that the price of oil is 'not that important', after the US were forced to scale back a plan to impose a cap. Putin also today said that Russia's relations with China were at an 'unprecedented level' as he called China's President Xi Jinping a 'close friend.' Moscow and Beijing signed a no-limits partnership just days before Russia launched its 'special military operation' in Ukraine in February, and Russia has sought to forge closer political and economic ties with China in the face of Western sanctions. China's foreign minister Wang Yi today reiterated Bejing's backing of Russia, despite western criticism over the war. Wang said in a call with his counterpart Sergei Lavrov, according to state broadcaster CCTV: 'China will also firmly support the Russian side, under the leadership of President (Vladimir) Putin, to unite and lead the Russian people to overcome difficulties and eliminate disturbances,' 'China is willing to deepen contacts with the Russian side at all levels,' Wang said. Putin today also said in his speech that the United States was wrong to destroy its relations with China over Taiwan. He said Russia recognises Taiwan as part of the People's Republic of China and said visits by U.S. officials, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - who Putin referred to as 'grandma' - to Taiwan were a provocation. The Russian leader also said that the United States will have to replenish its oil reserves as they release them now. He also rubbished the allegation that Russia blew up Nord Stream in the Baltic Sea, referring to it as 'crazy'. Danish police have said powerful explosions caused ruptures to the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 undersea pipelines, potentially putting them permanently out of use. Putin previously said the West blew up the pipelines, while European leaders have accused Russia of sabotage. The Russian leader claimed that one of the two pipelines is working but that Europe 'does not want to use it.' The Russian president used his long speech to also declare that the country will let its partners in Asia to develop energy producing assets. Speaking of South Korea's decision to supply weapons to Ukraine, he said that it would 'destroy our relations.' He also launched into a rant against 'cancel culture', accusing the West of trying to erase diversity and stamp out whatever it cannot tolerate. 'Those who formulate [global] rules believe others don't have right to unique path,' he told listeners. 'It is no coincidence that West wants their view accepted as universal, and they insist through their politics of everyone must be accepting these values.' He also criticised European leaders in his speech, claiming that the crisis in the area has been caused by them. Putin added that Russia is not an enemy of Europeans and 'never had any malicious intentions towards Europe.' In his address, he also took aim at France for publishing contents of a phone call he had with President Emmanuel Macron days before Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February. Putin said the release showed that his conversations with the French leader were being listened in on. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly hit out at Vladimir Putin after the Russian president gave a speech on Thursday. 'Putin's message today to the Russian people is unclear, untrue and unedifying,' he tweeted. 'What is crystal clear, is our message to the world: 'Aggressors must not be able to invade their neighbours with impunity. 'We will resolutely support Ukraine in its fight for freedom and democracy.' Meanwhile, the White House said after Putin's speech that his address 'was not that new' and does not indicate a change in strategic goals. Since the beginning of the war, Putin has passed sweeping censorship laws and jailed anyone who criticses him. Russia is now into its ninth month of the Ukraine war and has so-far failed to achieve any of Putin's war aims, which included the overthrow of the government and the 'liberation' of the Donbas region. Having fought Russia to a standstill across almost the entire country, Ukraine is now recapturing territory from Putin's troops. Thousands of square miles of land in the north and south have been returned to Ukrainian control in recent weeks, with the city of Kherson now within reach. Kyiv has vowed that it will not stop fighting until all of its land - including areas annexed by Putin in 2014 - has been liberated. In order to stop the rot, Putin has been forced to mobilise 300,000 reservists into the army and call on allies such as Iran to supply additional weapons. He has also annexed the Ukrainian territory Russia currently occupies to the mainland, and threatened to use nukes to protect it. However, that has failed to stop the Ukrainian advanced and has done nothing to weaken Western resolve to supply arms and money to Kyiv."
2022-10-28,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11366733/Experts-fear-Russia-plotting-sabotage-Norway-UK-gas-pipeline-leaving-households-freezing.html,Could the Kremlin target Britain's gas supply? Experts fear Russia 'is plotting to sabotage Norway-UK pipeline' in a move that could leave households freezing this winter,"Russia is plotting to strike a key gas pipeline between the UK and Norway to punish Britain over its support for Ukraine and leave households in the cold this winter. Senior military and intelligence sources told the Mail that Moscow could try and sabotage the Langeled pipeline that provides one-fifth of the country’s gas demand. The Kremlin has repeatedly weaponised energy supplies to Europe since it invaded Ukraine, slashing deliveries to the EU in response to sanctions. A series of unexplained leaks to energy connections under the Baltic Sea, including Germany’s controversial Nord Stream projects, are believed to be the work of Russian saboteurs. Any strike on Langeled would be a further squeeze on supplies to the UK and Europe. ‘Sabotage is the next step if they want to escalate by attacking Britain’s critical energy infrastructure because we are so fragile,’ said one NATO source. ‘And it’s no coincidence that Britain has been one of Ukraine’s biggest backers.’ Both the British and Norwegian governments have spoken about a general threat to North Sea energy infrastructure in the past. But officials in Oslo and London have refused to be drawn on specific targets. Another NATO official who works directly on threats to critical infrastructure said the 725-mile-long Langeled pipeline is an ‘obvious target.’ ‘That is because Norway has become such a vital gas link for the UK and Europe,’ the official said. A senior Norwegian official told the Mail that Oslo believes the Kremlin is eyeing the pipeline ‘to break the cohesion amongst Ukraine’s Western allies and disrupt the flow of gas.’ Running for 725-miles, Langeled is one of the world's longest underwater gas pipelines. It carries gas from the Ormen Lange field in the Norwegian Sea. It runs from from the processing plant at Nyhamna on the mid-Norwegian coast to Easington gas terminal on the Yorkshire coast. It is operated by Norwegian provider Gassco and provides up to a fifth of Britain's natural gas supply. ‘When people start maybe freezing and the flow of energy stops, people will turn around and say just let Putin have whatever he wants and get the gas to come back on,’ the source said. They added the Kremlin’s tactic of striking gas pipelines across Europe is designed to ‘just draw (military) resources away from other things.’ And a senior EU diplomat said: ‘The Norwegians are really worried about what the Russians are up to.’ Publicly, Western governments have stopped short of pointing the finger directly at Vladimir Putin when talking about possible sabotage. But Fatih Birol, the head of the UN’s International Energy Agency, has said it is ‘very obvious’ who was behind the damage. Britain has dispatched the Royal Navy’s HMS Somerset to patrol the area while Norway has sent one of its four frigates. Both vessels were sent to the North Sea after the alleged attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines, two key gas links to Europe which are run by Russian state energy giant Gazprom. Marine surveillance jets based at RAF Lossiemouth have since been deployed to keep an eye on oil and gas assets there alongside their counterparts from the Norwegian air force. Unidentified drones have also started appearing in the skies above key energy installations. Norwegian police have arrested seven Russian nationals after they were caught with drone-flying equipment over the past month. One of them was Andrey Yakunin, the 47-year-old son of Vladimir Yakunin, a former president of Russian Railways and a close ally of Putin who was sanctioned after the 2014 occupation of Crimea. Russians have been banned from operating drones in Norway since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Norway is now Europe’s largest gas supplier, after the Kremlin-backed firm cut back on deliveries to the continent. ‘The value of Norwegian gas to Europe has never been higher,’ said Ståle Ulriksen, a researcher at the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy. ‘As a strategic target for sabotage, Norwegian gas pipelines are probably the highest value target in Europe,’ he added. Gassco, the state-owned Norwegian operator of Langeled, has been on its highest state of security alert since last month. On Thursday, it announced that it has increased the number of inspections of its pipelines after the recent alleged sabotage attacks in the Baltic Sea that are being investigated by Swedish and Danish authorities. ‘We are following the authorities’ threat assessment,’ a Gassco spokeswoman said. Last night a Ministry of Defence spokesman refused to rule out that Langeled is a possible target for Kremlin-backed saboteurs. ‘We constantly observe our areas of UK responsibility and interest. This includes protecting critical infrastructure such as underwater cables,’ the spokesman said. PST, the Norwegian domestic intelligence service, failed to respond to the Mail’s request for comment."

Speaking at a conference in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, the financial titans painted a bleak picture of what lies ahead. David Solomon of Goldman Sachs said he expects economic conditions to 'tighten meaningfully from here,' and predicted that the Fed would continue raising interest rates until they reached 4.5-4.75 percent, before pausing to reassess. At present, the Fed's rate - is the interest rate at which banks and credit unions borrow from and lend to each other - is 3-3.25 percent. Many economists believe that the Fed will go for its fourth consecutive 75 basis point interest rate hike at its next meeting, scheduled for November 2, in a bid to slow down the economy and reduce inflation. The Consumer Price Index for September put inflation at 8.2 percent. Solomon told the Future Initiative Investment conference in Riyadh that the Fed could go even further, given the strong job market. The unemployment rate in September fell to 3.5 percent, tied for the lowest since late-1969. 'If they don't see real changes — labor is still very, very tight, they are obviously just playing with the demand side by tightening — but if they don't see real changes in behavior, my guess is they will go further,' he said. 'And I think generally when you find yourself in an economic scenario like this where inflation is embedded, it is very hard to get out of it without a real economic slowdown.' He added: 'The US is most likely going to have a recession.' The 60-year-old said that he felt there was an 'unwinding' of 40 years of policies, which were marked by low interest rates and cheap borrowing.. 'We're now in the process of unwinding a multidecade period, and there are consequences to that,' he said. 'There aren't easy answers. There's no silver bullet.' Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase - the largest bank in the U.S. - struck a similarly gloomy tone. He agreed that the Fed would likely continue hiking rates aggressively, before pausing to allow their moves to be felt, and said the impact would be considerable. 'American consumers, eventually the excess money they have is running out,' he said. 'That will probably happen sometime mid-year next year, and then we will know more about what is going on with oil and gas prices and that kind of thing, so we will find out.' Dimon added, however, that he was more concerned about 'geopolitics' than he was about the financial clouds brewing. 'There's very good news right now in the United States - people see it, consumers, business still spending, still have lots of money, fiscal stimulus. 'But there is a lot of stuff on the horizon which is bad, and could - not necessarily, but could - put the United States in a recession. 'That's not the most important thing, for what we think about. We'll manage right through that. 'I would worry much more about the geopolitics of the world today.' Asked by moderator Richard Quest of CNN, who was chairing the 10-person panel, what he meant by geopolitical threat, Dimon replied: 'I think the most important thing is Russia-Ukraine, America-China; the relationships of the Western World. 'That would have me much more concerned than if it's a mild or slightly severe recession.'"
2022-10-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11359299/Elon-Musk-mocks-New-York-Times-boon-world-conflicts-papers-hit-job-him.html,"'They're a new, chaotic actor in global politics': Elon Musk mocks New York Times for being a 'boon' in world conflicts - after paper's hit job on him for being a 'geopolitical chaos agent'","While Elon Musk continues to navigate his $44billion potential takeover of Twitter, he's still got time for settling scores on the social media behemoth after calling out the New York Times Wednesday. Musk, who changed his Twitter profile's location to 'Twitter HQ' and his biography to 'Chief Twit,' is two days from of a court-ordered deadline to complete the $44 billion takeover. However, while using the app on Wednesday, he chose to criticize a Times hit piece on Musk's involvement in foreign affairs. The paper called Musk a 'geopolitical chaos agent' for his suggestions about ending the war in Ukraine, the protests in Iran and the situation between China and Taiwan. Musk tweeted their words back at them: 'The New York Times has emerged as a new, chaotic actor in global politics. The paper’s interventions in some of the world’s most combustible conflicts have sometimes been a boon, but their messaging has also caused problems.' The billionaire Tesla CEO then cracked a joke at the 'anonymous sources' the Times used to make their case, saying: 'According to unnamed sources close to the matter who wish to remain anonymous,' before using the crying laughing emoji. About a half hour after his original tweet, he became more serious: 'A beautiful thing about Twitter is how it empowers citizen journalism - people are able to disseminate news without an establishment bias.' He was then asked how he felt about local news coverage and suggested it was 'closer to citizen journalism' and that it 'should get way more prominence on Twitter.' The piece criticizes Musk's attempt to suggest a peace plan between the Ukrainians and the Russians that has offended Ukrainian officials. They cited his attempts in Aspen to propose Russia annexing some Ukrainian land in exchange for peace. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine were heavily critical of the idea, even as they continue to rely on Musk's Starlink to maintain wartime internet access. The Times also criticized Musk's attempts to get Starlink running in Iran, which were described as muddled and allowed what they described as 'hackers believed to have links' to the Iranian government to run a phishing campaign. Amir Rashidi, an Iranian digital rights expert, called it 'irresponsible' and added 'It was just someone who wanted to jump up to say, ‘I’m doing something good,’ without understanding what the consequences would be.' Finally, they hammered at Musk's suggestion of easing tensions between China and Taiwan by giving the Chinese some control over Ukraine, which a Taiwanese legislator suggested may lead to a multi-national boycott of Tesla. It comes a day after Musk made a vow in a video conference call with bankers, who are helping fund the deal, that he would close the takeover deal before the end of the week. Twitter's stock price has soared in recent weeks and closed at $53.35 on Wednesday - close to the $54.20-a-share first offered by Musk for the firm in April. Musk, 51, looked happy and healthy as he strutted in to what's believed to be his newest purchase. He recently lost 20 pounds as a result of an intermittent fasting diet. Led by Morgan Stanley, the banks have finished putting together the final credit agreement and are in the process of signing the documentation, marking one of the last steps in providing $13 billion towards the deal. But the imminent deal comes amid a gloomy report which found Twitter has suffered an 'absolute decline' in users since the pandemic, with 'heavy tweeters' making up less than 10 percent of accounts. Banks have started to send $13 billion in cash backing Musk's takeover of Twitter in a sign that the deal is on track to close by the end of the week, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Once final closing conditions are met, the funds will be made available for Musk to execute the transaction by the Friday deadline, the report added."
2022-10-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11358955/They-driving-people-deaths-Zelensky-condemns-Putins-commanders-crazy-orders.html,'They are driving people to their deaths': Zelensky condemns the 'craziness' of Putin's commanders ordering Russian soldiers to repeatedly attack key towns in east Ukraine,"Vladimir Putin's commanders are 'driving troops to their deaths' by ordering them to repeatedly attack heavily fortified towns in east Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said last night. Ukrainian troops are coming under repeated attacks near two key towns in the eastern Donbas region and are 'heroically' holding out under heavy artillery fire, he said, describing the tactics deployed by Putin's army leaders as 'crazy'. It is the latest in Putin's illegal war in Ukraine which saw him annex four regions, including the two that make up the Donbas (Luhansk and Donetsk), only for Kyiv's forces to launch counter-offences which have seen major gains in recent weeks. Giving his typical evening video address to his nation, Zelensky said there would soon be good news from the front, but gave no details. It is thought Ukraine is in the process of another major offensive against Russian troops, as details of exact battle-lines and positions remain under wraps. But the most severe fighting is taking place near Avdiivka, outside Donetsk, and Bakhmut, further to the northeast, he said. During the address, President Zelensky described Russia's approach: 'This is where the craziness of the Russian command is most evident. 'Day after day, for months, they are driving people to their deaths there, concentrating the highest level of artillery strikes,' he said. 'All of our soldiers who are defending their positions in these areas in Donetsk region are heroes.' His words come as Putin continues to make increasingly threatening statements and propaganda, most recently presiding over a nuclear test launch on Wednesday. Russian forces have repeatedly tried to seize the city of Bakhmut in an effort to stall the Ukrainian advance. It is strategically important as it sits on a main road leading to the Ukrainian-held cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Ukrainian advisor Oleksiy Arestovych said on Tuesday that on one particular day, the Russians had attacked Bakhmut eight times before lunch and been pushed back every time. Zelensky did not mention what was happening near the southern city of Kherson, a city thought to be targeted by the country's forces imminently. It is currently held by pro-Moscow forces. Ukrainian troops say they expect a tough fight there. 'Generally, we are strengthening our positions all over the frontline, reducing the invaders' capabilities, destroying their logistics, and preparing good news for Ukraine,' Zelensky added. Separately, Russian-installed authorities in Shakhtarsk, just to the east of Donetsk, said Ukrainian shelling had set ablaze fuel tanks at the town's railway station. Ukrainian forces, some equipped with artillery supplied by the United States and other allies, have methodically shelled Russian fuel and ammunition bases and railway lines. Zelensky also said that in the latest prisoner exchange between the two sides, 10 Ukrainians had been freed. 'We continue to do everything possible to free our people from Russian captivity. 'Today we can finally announce the release of ten more Ukrainians. Our team engaged in the exchange process [and] is working without a break. 'And I want to emphasize once again that any of our military units on the front line can accelerate the exchange process by taking hostages. 'The more Russian servicemen we have in our exchange fund, the faster we will get Ukrainians back home from Russia.' Meanwhile Vladimir Putin watched on today as Russia simulated a 'massive nuclear strike' with terrifying practice launches of ballistic and cruise missiles. The despot remotely observed the annual exercise, called 'Grom' or 'Thunder', which uses test launches to put Moscow's nuclear forces through their paces in a show of force to the West. Defence minister Sergei Shoigu reported to Putin that the drills were intended to simulate a retaliatory 'massive nuclear strike' by Russia. The drills involved the test-firing of a Yars land-based intercontinental ballistic missile from the northern Plesetsk launch site and the launch of a Sineva ICBM by a Russian nuclear submarine in the Barents Sea, just ten miles away from the shores of NATO member Norway. As part of the exercise, Tu-95 strategic bombers also launched cruise missiles at practice targets. Footage shows a large nuclear submarine in the water during the simulation that featured multiple drills. The manoeuvres followed Putin's most recent warning about his readiness to use 'all means available' to fend off attacks on Russia's territory in a reference to the country's nuclear arsenals. The Kremlin said that all tasks set for the exercise were fulfilled and all the missiles that were test-fired reached their designated targets. Such drills involving land, sea and air components have taken place on an annual basis to train the country's nuclear forces and demonstrate their readiness. The Biden administration said on Tuesday that Russia gave notice it intended to stage routine drills of its nuclear capabilities. The Pentagon and US State Department said Russia had complied with the terms of the last US-Russia arms control agreement in notifying Washington of the upcoming tests. The Russian exercise comes amid Moscow's warnings of a purported Ukrainian plot to detonate a radioactive device commonly known as a 'dirty bomb' in a false flag attack to blame Russia. Ukraine and its allies strongly reject the allegation, and today NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: 'This is absurd. Allies reject this blatantly false accusation, and Russia must not use false pretexts to escalate the war further.' NATO's Stoltenberg underlined that the 30-nation military organisation 'will not be intimidated or deterred from supporting Ukraine's right to self-defence for as long as it takes.' Russia targeted more than 40 villages around Ukraine over the past day, Ukrainian officials said Wednesday, killing at least two people and sustaining the terror that forces people into air raid shelters each night. Russian forces launched five rockets, 30 air strikes and more than 100 multiple-launch rocket system attacks on Ukrainian targets, the Ukrainian armed forces general staff said."

Ksenia Sobchak, 40, is understood to have boarded a flight to Lithuania via Belarus shortly before agents arrived at Moscow’s Vnukovo-3 airport to arrest her. Putin has longstanding ties to her family and she is long rumoured to be his goddaughter. Her father, Anatoli Sobchak, was Putin's law professor and mentor who handed him his first foothold in politics as Deputy Mayor of St Petersburg. Sobchak has known Putin since she was a child, and he attended her baptism. But he is now poised to brand her a 'foreign agent' as part of a crackdown against dissent in Russia. It is not yet clear what remarks she allegedly made that have angered Kremlin officials and led to the raid of her property. It comes three after Sobchak was hit with a separate criminal investigation that could see her jailed for three years allegedly over 'spreading falsehoods about government agencies' on a media channel. The head of the shadowy Public Committee for the Detection of Foreign Intervention, Aleksandr Ionov, said a check was underway into whether Sobchak was funded from abroad. Her online media outlet Ostorozhno Novosti is also under investigation. 'If foreign funding is found, Sobchak will become a foreign agent', said Ionov. But Sobchak has claimed the probe is to put pressure on her and her media outlets. Despite Putin's ties with her family, she has strongly opposed his authoritarian policies in recent years. She said: 'Our commercial director Kirill Sukhanov is detained, as they said, for ""blackmail"". This is simply delirium, it is laughable, nonsense.' 'Kirill is a businessman and our advertising person. Myself and our entire team see this as yet more oppression against the media in the country. They have got nothing to dig on us, which infuriates them. They constantly detain our journalists. Now they have got Kirill, and are making a case against him. The lawyer is in touch with him. We are following the case.' Other Sobchak staff are being interrogated, it was reported. Such were Putin's ties to the family, he smuggled Mr Sobchak out of Russia to get medical treatment in the west when his patron was wanted for alleged corruption. He was later photographed at Mr Sobchak's funeral alongside Ksenia and her mother Lyudmila Narusova, a Russian senator in 2000. She has voted against war-linked legislation in the Russian parliament and accused his state TV of 'shameless lies' over the conflict. Ksenia - one of Russia’s best known faces - came fourth in the 2018 presidential election in Russia, widely seen as heavily rigged in Putin’s favour. Despite criticising Putin, she held a personal meeting with the Russian leader before announcing she would oppose him in the poll. Ksenia was earlier a popular reality TV host and posed for Playboy. She is understood to be subject of a probe regarding an article covering the 'public dissemination of deliberately false information about the execution of its authority by a government agency' - a new law enacted after the start of the war with Ukraine with a punishment of up to three years in jail. Authorities say that Sergey Chemezov, CEO of Rostec Corporation, had written a statement alleging 'extortion' against Sobchak and others. On the basis of this Kirill Sukhanov and former Russian Tatler editor Arian Romanovsky were detained. They reportedly face investigation under laws which could lead to jail sentences of between seven and 15 years."
2022-10-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11359071/Boris-Johnson-considering-founding-organisation-help-support-Ukraine.html,"Boris Johnson 'is considering founding organisation to help support Ukraine': Former PM looks to kick-start his international career and has already picked out Westminster office, report claims","Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is reportedly considering setting up a charitable fund to raise money for war-torn Ukraine as he tries to boost his image on the global stage. Following his departure from No10, Mr Johnson is rumoured to be planning a global career while still sitting in the House of Commons for his constituents in Uxbridge. A source close to the former PM told the Telegraph last night that he will set up a 'marshal plan for Ukraine', raising 'loads of money' from private donors. Although he does not hold an official role in government, the former PM was appointed to the head of a committee which supports the nation at the Conservative Party Conference last month. The source added: 'Boris does not need an official role to campaign on Ukraine. He is going to plough his own furrow on this regardless.' The former PM, who was ultimately brought down by Partygate and allegations he appointed former Chris Pincher as a whip despite being aware of allegations of sexual harassment, visited Ukraine on multiple occasions and appeared to have a good relationship with President Zelensky. Visits to Ukraine were organised at short notice and in secret to avoid security risks while Johnson was in office. Zelensky often praised the UK for its staunch support after Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine in February. After one visit, Mr Johnson even had a street named after him, and he has since been appointed chair of the Conservative Friends of Ukraine organisation. He is understood to be considering how to help the country rebuild after the conflict ends, as well as launch himself as a quasi-advocate for Ukraine during a visit to the US next month. There are some fears within the UK that the upcoming US midterm elections could lead to an easing in political steps over the war from President Biden to avoid alienating supporters. Mr Johnson is expected to make a speech in Washington about Ukraine's plight and is also expected to meet senators to make the case for continued US support in the war against Russia. Upon beginning his new role as Prime Minister on Tuesday, Rishi Sunak praised Mr Johnson's work and said he hopes he will continue his pursuits on the global stage. The PM was praised by Zelensky on Tuesday evening after the pair had an 'excellent' conversation about the situation. The President wrote on Twitter: 'In an excellent conversation with Rishi Sunak we agreed to write a new chapter in Ukrainian-British relations but the story is the same - full support in the face of Russian aggression. 'I appreciate PM's first call to Ukraine. And always grateful for the support of the British people.' On August 24, less than two weeks before he ceased to be the PM, Mr Johnson visited Kyiv for the third time since the country was invaded. He called on the international community to stay the course in Ukraine, as it continues to valiantly defend its sovereignty six months on from Putin's brutal and illegal invasion. He announced a broader package of support, including high-tech drones, and said: 'For the past six months, the United Kingdom has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine, supporting this sovereign country to defend itself from this barbaric and illegal invader. 'Today's package of support will give the brave and resilient Ukrainian Armed Forces another boost in capability, allowing them to continue to push back Russian forces and fight for their freedom. 'What happens in Ukraine matters to us all, which is why I am here today to deliver the message that the United Kingdom is with you and will be with you for the days and months ahead, and you can and will win.' Mr Johnson set up the Office of Boris Johnson to run his affairs earlier this month. It is expected to be part-funded by an annual allowance of public money to support the work of former prime ministers, currently around £115,000 per year. The private limited company will not undertake commercial work."

Mr Hewitt has helped set up HOP, Humanitarian Online Payments, an organisation which travels into the heart of Ukraine from the UK, bringing a convoy of Ukrainians made up of up to nine vehicles out of the warzone. He has co-founded the organisation with Eton-alumnus Mikey Stewart Richardson, son of the late Brigadier Peter Stewart-Richardson, who founded the Afghan Mother and Child Rescue in the early 1990s. Mr Hewitt had a five-year affair with Princess Diana when he was a young Household Cavalry officer, from 1986 to 1991. This was confirmed by the Princess of Wales during the now-infamous Panorama interview with disgraced journalist Martin Bashir. In recent years Mr Hewitt has suffered both a heart attack and a stroke - but this has not stopped him rescuing beleaguered Ukrainians and taking them to safety. 'He's doing something useful,' a source close to Mr Hewitt told the Daily Mail. On their website, Mr Hewitt and Mr Stewart-Richardson describe the operation as a 'not-for-profit' that takes Ukrainian families to safe locations in the UK or EU. 'We visit all parts of Ukraine, including the areas close to the front line, to find, help and assist in collecting the young, old and infirm Ukrainians who wish to flee Putin. The pair adds: 'It's essential work and we're humbled to play a small part in the incredible story of the charity, Operation SafeDrop.' They have partnered with Operation SafeDrop to assist in evacuations, a charity which has been operating in Poland and Ukraine since March. Mr Hewitt declined to comment on the revelations, but has reportedly made two 'very successful' rescue trips. 'He's finding the missions very fulfilling,' a friend told the Daily Mail, adding that a third 'is planned very shortly'. Mr Stewart-Richardson wrote on Facebook, shortly after the fund was set up in April, condemning Putin's 'evil' war. He wrote: 'I can't understand why Putin's Russia is trying to take over Ukraine - Putin obviously thought it would be a walk in the park but he has seriously miscalculated. 'The Ukrainian army has forced the Russians out of the Kyiv sector but what the Ukrainians then found was a catalog of rape, torture, summary executions and the most heinous war crimes. 'When I saw how this evil man, Putin, wages war, my mind was immediately made up to help the Ukrainians in any way that I could.' Leaving the Army in 1994, Mr Hewitt sparked controversy after collaborating with Anna Pasternak, author of Princess In Love, reputedly being paid £300,000 for sharing details of their affair. Less than a decade later, he said he was willing to sell Diana's letters, hoping to raise £10 million. But accusations of betraying Diana followed and the letters remain unsold. Last year the Daily Mail revealed that Mr Hewitt was living with his mother in her two-bedroom flat in Devon."
2022-10-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11362179/Pentagon-DEFENDS-plans-cut-U-S-nuclear-capabilities-despite-Putins-threats.html,Pentagon DEFENDS plans to cut U.S. nuclear capabilities - despite Putin's threats: Defense secretary insists there's no need for a new sea-launched missile - and again insists there's no indication Russia will use a dirty bomb in Ukraine,"Eight months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and with China stepping up its nuclear, space and cyberforce capabilities, on Thursday the Pentagon defended its decision to scrap development of a new sea-launched cruise missile. The decision to cancel the submarine-launched cruise missile comes even though senior military figures wanted it to continue. And at the same time the Pentagon also confirmed it was retiring the B83-1 gravity bomb - 80 to 100 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War Two. It comes against a backdrop of the war in Ukraine and concerns that Vladimir Putin could be about to use a tactical nuclear weapon or a dirty bomb. Details were included in the Biden administration's nuclear posture review, which was published in its National Defense Strategy on Thursday. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin defended the decision when he was quizzed by reporters at a briefing whether that sent a message of weakness to the likes of Russia's Vladimir Putin. 'Our inventory of nuclear weapons is significant,' he said. 'And so, we determined as we looked at our inventory that we did not need that capability. 'We have a lot of capability in our nuclear inventory, and I don't think this sends any message to Putin. He understands what our capability is.' In 2018, the Trump administration decided to develop a new nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile, driven in part by the growing threat from Russia. It was intended as a low-yield (around 10 kilotons, tactical weapon that would reassure allies of American protection. It was also seen as a way to counter Russian violation of other arms treaties - a US negotiating chip to bring Moscow back in line. However, earlier this year it was dropped from the administration's 2023 budget funding request. The decision was interpreted as a way for President Joe Biden to scale back the U.S. arsenal without sacrificing the strategic elements of the 'triad' of ground, air and sea-launched weapons. But Biden's most senior officer, Gen. Mark Milley, said he would have favour keeping it because Biden 'deserves to have multiple options to deal with national security situations.' Republicans also expressed support for the program, which could set up a battle with the Biden administration if they take control of Congress in next month's midterms. The new strategy also signaled that Department of Defense is canceling the B83-1 gravity bomb, which was first developed in the 1970s and has been superseded by the new B61-12. The 80-page document is a declassified version of a classified report that has circulated for months on Capitol Hill. Austin was also asked about Putin's claims that Ukraine was preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own soil or fears that he could use a battlefield nuclear weapon. 'We have not seen anything to indicate that Putin has made a decision to use a dirty bomb, nor have we seen any indications that the Ukrainians are planning such a thing,' he said. Ukraine, he added, had said they had no plans to use such a weapon. 'It's important to make sure that we're talking to adversaries and allies alike and making sure that that we're tamping down dangerous talk,' he said. And he said the nuclear maneuvers in Russia did not appear to be cover for launching a strike in Ukraine. 'It's something we continue to watch and we haven't seen anything to cause us to believe at this point that that is some kind of cover activity,' he said. An official, who briefed journalists ahead of the report's release, said its strategy reflected that the U.S. now faced the twin threats of nuclear-armed Russia and China. The last strategy, released under President Donald Trump in 2018, marked a shift from countering extremists to one that had to prepare for war with a major power. China 'presents the most consequential and systemic challenge, while Russia poses acute threats - both to vital US national interests abroad and to the homeland,' the unclassified version of the National Defense Strategy said."
2022-10-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11361893/White-House-tears-Russia-using-photos-Slovenian-smoke-detectors-dirty-bomb-proof.html,Biden administration tears into Russia for using photos of Slovenian smoke detectors to suggest they have 'proof' Ukraine can make a dirty bomb,"A White House official is calling out Russia for 'ridiculous' disinformation after it pushed out an image purporting to show the threat of a Ukrainian 'dirty bomb' that was actually an old picture of Slovenian fire extinguishers. The U.S. and allies, as well as the Ukrainians, are closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine after Russia has raised repeatedly warnings that the Ukrainians would set off a 'dirty bomb' in their own country. White House national security spokesman John Kirby has warned it has echoes of the kind of 'false flag' operations Russia is known for – where the Kremlin puts out information about the specter of a threat to justify its own plans. In this case, Russia's ministry of foreign affairs released stock images of nuclear reactors and storage facilities to bolster its claims about the supposed Ukrainian dirty bomb threat. 'Russia shared an image of dirty bomb material as “proof” of its false claims. Only -wait for it- the photo, taken in 2010, is apparently of a pile of Slovenian smoke detectors,' National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson tweeted Thursday. 'Russian disinfo: ridiculous, unsurprising… made with horrifying intent & devastating repercussions.' She linked to tweets by the official account of the Slovenian Government, which were the basis for the statement. That account states that the photo used by Russia's Foreign Ministry is an 'ARAO photo from 2010' – a reference to the Slovenian Radioactive Waste Management Agency. It quotes the agency's director, Sandi Virsek, saying 'Radioactive waste in Slovenia is stored safely and is under supervision. It is not used for making of any dirty bombs.' The image was used for 'professional presentations for the general and interested public as an explanatory material. The photo shows smoke detectors that are subject to general use,' the account explained. Smoke detectors do contain a radioactive source, but 'not any of the radioactive sources' Russia listed in a table that accompanied the image. It got used without the agency's knowledge, the government said. Russia's initial tweet claimed that 'according to initial information at hand, two organizations of Ukraine have been ! directly ordered to create the so-called #dirtybomb,' without providing evidence. A table listed the radioactive decay periods of Cobalt-60, Strontium-90, Uranium-235 and other elements. Russia cited alleged Ukrainian threats and claimed Nazi influence in Ukraine to justify its February invasion of the neighboring country, calling the war a 'special military operation.' U.S. officials fear Russia itself could set off a dirty bomb, which uses a conventional explosive device to spread nuclear material over a wide area. Asked about the 'dirty bomb' threat at the White House Wednesday, Kirby responded: 'It is a common Russian play for them to blame others for what they are doing themselves or about to do themselves, which is why we took it very seriously when the Russian defense minister called the Secretary of Defense and said that they had information that the Ukrainians were fixing to use a dirty bomb.' Then, he added: 'It's a false allegation. That's not true. The Ukrainians have nothing like that in mind. They have no intention to do that. So that's that's why we take it seriously,' he said."

Their exploits were captured by a documentary-maker who gave his name only as Vasiliy, who is also Russian, who said he wanted to show that not all of his countrymen support Putin's war. 'I think people are generally supportive of what is going on, and they see this as a great struggle between Russia and the collective West', he said. 'The Russian government wants people to believe that everyone is supporting the war. But it's not true, it doesn't work like that. 'I wanted to give a voice to the people opposing the war that Putin started, who are opposing the repressions that are going on within the country.' Sasha - full name Alexandra - was arrested early during Putin's war for copying an online trend of placing fake price tags in supermarkets featuring anti-war slogans. One of them included a message telling Russians about the March bombing of a theatre in Mariupol where civilians were hiding, killing an estimated 400 people. Sonia, her partner, explained: 'The official line is that this did not happen so it is considered a fake statement against the Russian army and therefore a criminal offence (punishable by up to 15 years in jail). 'I remember well the day Sasha was arrested. She was informed against by a pensioner. Using CCTV they monitored her and tracked her to a friend's house.' Despite repeated attempts to get her released on bail, Sasha has remained behind bars since. In September, she was charged and now faces a lengthy jail sentence. Another activist, Natalia, lived in the UK for 10 years until 2021 when she decided to return to Russia to be near her family - just months before the war broke out. Though Russia has cracked down on news from outside the country and spoon-feeds its population propaganda via state TV channels, Natalia has kept in touch with the outside world using a British SIM card she brought with her. Natalia also uses it to post TikTok videos documenting how the war is being presented to Russians while trying to cut through lies being peddled by the state. Though her posts can get more than half a million views each, she has so-far managed to avoid being caught by police - though she did have a 'Z' war symbol scrawled on the wall outside her house. Despite the implicit threat, she vowed: 'I would rather put myself in danger than just being quiet about it.' Olga and Elena are both journalists and mothers from the Baikal region of Siberia, who founded a magazine called 'People of Baikal' two years before the war. As Putin launched his invasion, they both knew that a crackdown on independent media would inevitably follow - which would mean their magazine being either censored or shut down. But they both decided on the first day of the war to continue publishing uncensored 'whatever the cost' and began covering protest movements. Soon, coffins began arriving back home and it became quickly apparent that Russia was not being truthful about the number of troops it was losing - so the pair switched focus to document those being killed in their region. They now publish an online database which contains more than 400 names of soldiers from Baikal who have died fighting. The pair also track down the relatives of those who have died to find out why they went to war and how they were treated. In the film, they speak to relatives of one young soldier - Yura - who was killed in Mariupol back in March. His family claim he ran off to join the militia of the Donetsk People's Republic in March 2021 because a criminal conviction prevented him joining the regular army. They say he was supposed to return in March this year, but all troops were prevented from going as the war got underway in late February. Yura, his commander and one other comrade were killed by falling masonry as they tried to storm the city - where they stayed buried for 'a long time' until their comrades finally dug them out. The squad had to pay for a car to transport Yura's body home, where his family had to pick up the costs for his funeral. As a member of a militia, he does not qualify for state payments issued to families of regular soldiers who die. But their work has come at a price. The pair were taken in for questioning by police and subjected to intense interrogation. While they were not arrested, they have moved to get their families out of Russia to protect them and their own future in the country is uncertain. Meanwhile documentary-maker Vasiliy has also been forced to flee in order to avoid Putin's order to press 300,000 reservists into the military. Natalia, meanwhile, says her own future in Russia is in doubt following the death of her father from cancer. Her mother has been completely swallowed by Russian propaganda supporting the war, meaning she has few reasons to stay - and fears for her safety.

2022-10-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11361865/Putin-calls-Liz-Truss-CRAZY-says-engaged-nuclear-blackmail-Russia.html,Putin calls Liz Truss 'CRAZY' and says she engaged in 'nuclear blackmail' with Russia,"Vladimir Putin today referred to former British Prime Minister Liz Truss as 'crazy' amid sweeping accusations that Western powers are engaged in 'nuclear blackmail of Russia'. In a ranting speech in Moscow, the Russian president said Truss must have been 'a bit out of it' and he claimed to have 'never said anything proactively about possible use of nuclear weapons by Russia'. 'We have only hinted in response to statements made by western leaders,' he insisted, pointing out that Russian military doctrine dictates nuclear weapons should only be deployed in 'self-defence'. Truss previously labelled Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons against the West as 'sabre-rattling' when she spoke at the UN General Assembly in September. Alongside his criticism of Truss, Putin asserted Kyiv has the technology to create and potentially detonate a 'dirty bomb' in Ukraine. He also refuted claims that Russian forces were attacking the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - located in territory controlled by Russia in southern Ukraine. The Russian leader, laying out his warped view of global politics, went on to accused westerners of 'fanning the flames' of war in Ukraine and Taiwan, of sparking a global energy crisis and of causing a food crisis - in effect regurgitating the same allegations levelled at him by much of the international community. Putin warned the world has entered its most dangerous period since the Second World War and a 'new world order' must emerge in which Russia gets a bigger say, declaring that the 'age of western domination is over'. 'Dominion of the world is what West has decided to stake in this game. It is a dangerous, deadly and dirty game,' he added. While at points Putin sounded as if he was offering an olive branch - saying Russia 'is not an enemy of the West' and 'only wants the right to develop' - he made it clear that any talks on his 'new order' would have to be on Moscow's terms. The West, he added, had repeatedly rejected Moscow's plans for peace laid out before the war in Ukraine - such as the withdrawal of all NATO troops from ex-Soviet states, against the wishes of their governments - and accused it of war-mongering. He claimed that he had told the West: 'Let's be friends, have dialogue and strengthen trust and peace.' 'We were completely sincere,' he added. 'What did we get in response? A 'no' on every possible area of cooperation.' In fact, the US and NATO had both sent letters to Russia laying out possible grounds for cooperation before Putin invaded Ukraine, which Moscow rejected. 'Russia is not an enemy of the West,' he insisted, but will continue to oppose neo-liberal elites and their world-view. Russia will never accept Western countries telling it what to do, and the longer the West take to realise this the higher the price will be, he added. The speech is just the latest in a string of ranting addresses that Putin has given since launching his war, laying out his historical grievances, distorted view of current events, and his vision for the future. He has repeatedly talked of creating a 'multipolar world order' in which Western capitals, including Washington, would have to kowtow to Moscow and Beijing. Accusing the West of trying to 'cancel' Russia and its history, he has presented the conflict in Ukraine as an existential struggle for what he presents as 'Russian values'. Kyiv argues the Russian invasion is a genocidal mission to both rewrite history - including the fall of the Soviet Union, which Putin called a 'catastrophe' - and to ensure Ukraine cannot draw closer to the West. In his speech, Putin accused NATO of 'starting to seize the territories of Ukraine long ago' and insisted he was forced to invade to protect people. Russia is now into it ninth month of the Ukraine war and has so-far failed to achieve any of Putin's war aims, which included the overthrow of the government and the 'liberation' of the Donbas region. Having fought Russia to a standstill across almost the entire country, Ukraine is now recapturing territory from Putin's troops. Thousands of square miles of land in the north and south have been returned to Ukrainian control in recent weeks, with the city of Kherson now within reach. Kyiv has vowed that it will not stop fighting until all of its land - including areas annexed by Putin in 2014 - has been liberated. In order to stop the rot, Putin has been forced to mobilise 300,000 reservists into the army and call on allies such as Iran to supply additional weapons. He has also annexed the Ukrainian territory Russia currently occupies to the mainland, and threatened to use nukes to protect it. However, that has failed to stop the Ukrainian advanced and has done nothing to weaken Western resolve to supply arms and money to Kyiv."
2022-10-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11361499/Russia-setting-second-line-troops-line-SHOOT-fleeing-combat.html,Russia 'is setting up second line of troops behind the front line to SHOOT anyone fleeing combat' according to 'intercepted phone call' released by Ukraine,"Russia is reportedly setting up a second line of troops behind the front line to shoot down any Russian soldiers fleeing combat, according to what Ukraine's intelligence services claim is an intercepted phone call. The five-minute audio clip, released by Ukraine's intelligence agency, appears to capture the internal rifts between Vladimir Putin's men during their invasion of Ukraine, with some apparently being forced to shoot dead any deserters. In the audio, described by Ukraine as an intercepted phone call between a Russian soldier and his wife, the man describes how his commander has ordered him to 'wipe out' any Russian troops who flee from the front line. The Russian soldier said that new recruits, many of whom are prisoners, are on the front line and his unit has been positioned on a second line to shoot anyone who tries to run away. In the apparently intercepted phone call, the Russian soldier tells his wife: 'They moved us back to the second line, there's shooting somewhere ahead of us, but we're back for now in the trenches. 'They brought the inmates here from prison but they led them somewhere on the front. And we're sitting here as a retreat-blocking detachment.' He added: 'If someone runs back, we snuff them out.' His wife responds: 'What a nightmare.' The Russian soldier continued: 'That's how we have it set up. We sit on the second line, guarding the first. Behind us, there's another line. 'If you go that way, you also won't make it. So it's impossible to run away. We shoot our own. 'If someone goes that way, you need to wipe them out.' It is not clear where the Russian soldier is based, but he described harsh living conditions where he struggled to find food or stay warm. There are complaints among Russian soldiers of equipment shortages, poor living conditions and scant training for new recruits. Since Putin announced the mobilization of 300,000 Russians on September 21, independent media, human rights activists and those called up have painted a bleak picture of a haphazard and chaotic effort to round up as many men as possible and push them quickly to the front lines, regardless of skill, training and equipment. Conscription protests have been harshly put down, and tens of thousands of men fled Russia to neighbouring countries to avoid being pressed into service. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday acknowledged persisting problems with equipment for the draftees, but 'vigorous measures taken to rectify the situation are already yielding the first positive results.' He said regional authorities are involved in providing 'the missing gear,' and now Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov 'is personally responsible for this' in a coordination council Putin has created. Russian media reported multiple deaths of reservists in Ukraine, with their relatives telling news outlets that they had received very little training. When asked by a reporter why several reservists had died in Ukraine only three weeks after being called up, Putin confirmed that training could last as few as 10 days and as many as 25. Military analyst Pavel Luzin said Russia isn't able to train hundreds of thousands of men. 'The army was not ready for mobilization. It never prepared for it,' he said. Putin has promised to finish the mobilization drive by November, when the regular fall draft is scheduled. Military experts and rights groups say enlistment offices and training camps can't process both at the same time, warning that the call-up may resume months later. As of mid-October, 222,000 reservists have been recruited, Putin said. Whether it will be possible to enlist another 80,000 in the remaining two weeks is unclear. To try to broaden the pool, the Russian parliament on Wednesday lifted a ban on mobilizing men who have been convicted of a grave criminal offense and who have been released from prison but whose convictions are still on the books."
2022-10-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11361567/Putin-accuses-West-fueling-war-Ukraine-destabilising-world-latest-rant.html,"Putin's deluded rant to the world: War-mongerer says 'western domination is over', calls for a 'new world order' and warns we have entered the most dangerous decade since WW2","Vladimir Putin has declared the 'age of western domination is over' and called for a 'new world order' in a major foreign policy speech in Moscow, in which he also downplayed the 'need' for Russia to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine after months of Armageddon scare-mongering from Kremlin mouthpieces. The Russian leader, laying out his warped view of global politics, accused westerners of 'fanning the flames' of war in both Ukraine and Taiwan (where fears are growing of a Chinese invasion), of sparking a global energy crisis and of causing a food crisis - all allegations that have been levelled at him. Putin warned the world has entered its most dangerous period since the Second World War and a 'new world order' must emerge in which Russia gets a bigger say. 'The West is no longer able to dictate its will to the humankind but still tries to do it, and the majority of nations no longer want to tolerate it,' he said. 'Dominion of the world is what West has decided to stake in this game. It is a dangerous, deadly and dirty game.' Putin said that Moscow has no intention to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, despite issuing repeated warnings in the past that he was prepared to use all available means to defend Russia, including its vast nuclear arsenal. 'We see no need for that,' Putin said at the conference of international foreign policy experts. 'There is no point in that, neither political nor military.' The Russian leader insisted for weeks before the invasion that he did not intend to attack Ukraine, before ordering his troops across the border on February 24. While at points Putin sounded as if he was offering an olive branch - saying Russia 'is not an enemy of the West' and 'only wants the right to develop' - he made it clear that any talks on his 'new order' would have to be on Moscow's terms. The West, he said, had repeatedly rejected Moscow's plans for peace laid out before the war in Ukraine - such as the withdrawal of all NATO troops from ex-Soviet states, against the wishes of their governments - and had instead chosen conflict. He claimed that he had told the West: 'Let's be friends, have dialogue and strengthen trust and peace.' 'We were completely sincere,' he added. 'What did we get in response? A 'no' on every possible area of cooperation.' In fact, the US and NATO had both sent letters to Russia laying out possible grounds for cooperation before Putin invaded Ukraine, which Moscow rejected. Russia isn't the enemy of the West but will continue to oppose the diktat of Western neo-liberal elites, he said, accusing them of trying to subdue Moscow. 'Their goal is to make Russia more vulnerable and turn it into an instrument for fulfilling their geopolitical tasks, they have failed to achieve it and they will never succeed,' Putin said. The Russian president reaffirmed his long-held claim that Russians and Ukrainians are part of a single people and again denigrated Ukraine as an 'artificial state,' which received historic Russian lands from Communist rulers during the Soviet times. By David Averre and Chris Pleasance for MailOnline Vladimir Putin today referred to former British Prime Minister Liz Truss as 'crazy' amid sweeping accusations that Western powers are engaged in 'nuclear blackmail of Russia'. In a ranting speech in Moscow, the Russian president said Truss must have been 'a bit out of it' and he claimed to have 'never said anything proactively about possible use of nuclear weapons by Russia'. 'We have only hinted in response to statements made by western leaders,' he insisted, pointing out that Russian military doctrine dictates nuclear weapons should only be deployed in 'self-defence'.

Putin warned the world has entered its most dangerous period since the Second World War and a 'new world order' must emerge in which Russia gets a bigger say, declaring that the 'age of western domination is over'. 'Dominion of the world is what West has decided to stake in this game. It is a dangerous, deadly and dirty game,' he added. The Russian president also stated that his country is 'ready for talks' on Ukraine. Speaking about the conflict, Putin said he thinks 'all the time' about the casualties Russia has suffered in the conflict, but insisted he was left with no choice but to attack and that Russia would have paid a higher price if it had not acted. He denied underestimating Ukraine's ability to fight back and insisted that his 'special military operation' has proceeded as planned. The Russian leader said: 'About our country, you know, of course, we have costs, most notably regards losses in the special military operation. I think about it all the time. There are also economic losses, but there are enormous gains. And ultimately, and I want to emphasize, ultimately, all that is happening now will undoubtedly benefit Russia and its future. Why? Because it's connected to strengthening our sovereignty.' Putin also acknowledged the challenges posed by Western sanctions, but argued that Russia has proven resilient to foreign pressure and become more united. The speech is just the latest in a string of ranting addresses that Putin has given since launching his war, laying out his historical grievances, distorted view of current events, and his vision for the future. He has repeatedly talked of creating a 'multipolar world order' in which Western capitals, including Washington, would have to kowtow to Moscow and Beijing. Accusing the West of trying to 'cancel' Russia and its history, he has presented the conflict in Ukraine as an existential struggle for what he presents as 'Russian values'. Kyiv argues the Russian invasion is a genocidal mission to both rewrite history - including the fall of the Soviet Union, which Putin called a 'catastrophe' - and to ensure Ukraine cannot draw closer to the West. In his speech, Putin accused NATO of 'starting to seize the territories of Ukraine long ago' and insisted he was forced to invade to protect people. He also said on Thursday that hard-line Ukrainian nationalists were willing to 'fight until the last Ukrainian' in the conflict with Russia. Putin said Ukraine had suffered heavy losses in the eight-month conflict and criticised Ukrainian 'hardline patriots' and 'banderites,' a tag Russian officials and commentators often use to describe Ukrainian fighters who they say are neo-Nazis and fascists, for being willing to sacrifice their fellow fighters. Amid fears that Putin's war could go nuclear, he today denied having any intentions of using the weapons in Ukraine. But he described the conflict there as part of alleged efforts by the West to secure its global domination, which he insisted are doomed to fail. Speaking at a conference of international foreign policy experts, Putin said it's pointless for Russia to strike Ukraine with nuclear weapons. 'We see no need for that,' Putin said. 'There is no point in that, neither political, nor military.' Putin said an earlier warning of his readiness to use 'all means available to protect Russia' didn't amount to nuclear saber-rattling but was merely a response to Western statements about their possible use of nuclear weapons. He particularly mentioned Liz Truss saying in August that she would be ready to use nuclear weapons if she became Britain's prime minister, a remark which he said worried the Kremlin. 'What were we supposed to think?' Putin said. 'We saw that as a coordinated position, an attempt to blackmail us.' Without offering evidence, the Russian leader repeated Moscow's unproven allegation that Ukraine was plotting a false flag attack involving a radioactive dirty bomb it would try to pin on Russia. Ukraine has strongly rejected the claim, and its Western allies have dismissed it as 'transparently false.' Ukraine argued Russia might be making the unfounded allegation to serve as a cover for its own possible plot to detonate a dirty bomb. Putin said he personally ordered Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to call his foreign counterparts to tell them about the purported plot. He maintained that Russia knows the Ukrainian facilities working on the project. Putin claimed, still without citing any proof, that Kyiv's plan was to rig a missile with radioactive waste and to characterize its explosion as a Russian nuclear strike in an effort to isolate Russia in the global arena. He mocked the allegations by Ukraine and the West that Russia was firing on the territory of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine as 'ravings.' Russian troops have occupied the plant, Europe's largest, since the early days of the conflict and Moscow has accused Ukraine of continuously shelling it. Also in his speech, speaking about Saudi Arabia, he said that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman should be respected and that Russia was set on boosting relations with them. It comes amid tensions between Saudi Arabia and the US after the OPEC+, chaired by Saudi Arabia, voted to reduce oil output by around 2 million barrels per day on October 5. The United States' has criticised Prince Mohammed and the OPEC+ oil alliance for agreeing to cut oil production, a move seen as a boost to Russia's attempts to protect its economy in the face of Western sanctions. Putin also used today's address to state that the price of oil is 'not that important', after the US were forced to scale back a plan to impose a cap. Putin also today said that Russia's relations with China were at an 'unprecedented level' as he called China's President Xi Jinping a 'close friend.' Moscow and Beijing signed a no-limits partnership just days before Russia launched its 'special military operation' in Ukraine in February, and Russia has sought to forge closer political and economic ties with China in the face of Western sanctions. China's foreign minister Wang Yi today reiterated Bejing's backing of Russia, despite western criticism over the war. Wang said in a call with his counterpart Sergei Lavrov, according to state broadcaster CCTV: 'China will also firmly support the Russian side, under the leadership of President (Vladimir) Putin, to unite and lead the Russian people to overcome difficulties and eliminate disturbances,' 'China is willing to deepen contacts with the Russian side at all levels,' Wang said. Putin today also said in his speech that the United States was wrong to destroy its relations with China over Taiwan. He said Russia recognises Taiwan as part of the People's Republic of China and said visits by U.S. officials, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - who Putin referred to as 'grandma' - to Taiwan were a provocation. The Russian leader also said that the United States will have to replenish its oil reserves as they release them now. He also rubbished the allegation that Russia blew up Nord Stream in the Baltic Sea, referring to it as 'crazy'. Danish police have said powerful explosions caused ruptures to the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 undersea pipelines, potentially putting them permanently out of use. Putin previously said the West blew up the pipelines, while European leaders have accused Russia of sabotage. The Russian leader claimed that one of the two pipelines is working but that Europe 'does not want to use it.' The Russian president used his long speech to also declare that the country will let its partners in Asia to develop energy producing assets. Speaking of South Korea's decision to supply weapons to Ukraine, he said that it would 'destroy our relations.' He also launched into a rant against 'cancel culture', accusing the West of trying to erase diversity and stamp out whatever it cannot tolerate. 'Those who formulate [global] rules believe others don't have right to unique path,' he told listeners. 'It is no coincidence that West wants their view accepted as universal, and they insist through their politics of everyone must be accepting these values.' He also criticised European leaders in his speech, claiming that the crisis in the area has been caused by them. Putin added that Russia is not an enemy of Europeans and 'never had any malicious intentions towards Europe.' In his address, he also took aim at France for publishing contents of a phone call he had with President Emmanuel Macron days before Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February. Putin said the release showed that his conversations with the French leader were being listened in on. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly hit out at Vladimir Putin after the Russian president gave a speech on Thursday. 'Putin's message today to the Russian people is unclear, untrue and unedifying,' he tweeted. 'What is crystal clear, is our message to the world: 'Aggressors must not be able to invade their neighbours with impunity. 'We will resolutely support Ukraine in its fight for freedom and democracy.' Meanwhile, the White House said after Putin's speech that his address 'was not that new' and does not indicate a change in strategic goals. Since the beginning of the war, Putin has passed sweeping censorship laws and jailed anyone who criticses him. Russia is now into its ninth month of the Ukraine war and has so-far failed to achieve any of Putin's war aims, which included the overthrow of the government and the 'liberation' of the Donbas region. Having fought Russia to a standstill across almost the entire country, Ukraine is now recapturing territory from Putin's troops.

2022-10-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11361275/US-brings-forward-plan-update-nukes-Europe-amid-threat-Russia.html,US brings forward plan to update its nukes in Europe: Gravity bombs due to arrive next year will be delivered in December as Russia raises nuclear war fears,"New American nuclear bombs due to arrive in Europe next year will actually arrive this year amid fears Putin could use one of his own atomic weapons over Ukraine. B61-12 air-dropped gravity bombs, an updated version of America's main nuclear bomb, will be delivered to European allies this December instead of spring 2023, according to a diplomatic cable seen by Politico. The new bomb, which is supposed to be more accurate than its predecessor, will be distributed to storage sites across the continent with older versions removed. The move comes amid nuclear sabre-rattling by Putin who has repeatedly threatened to use Russia's atomic arsenal against the West over the war in Ukraine. The new delivery was discussed at a meeting of NATO defence ministers in Europe a fortnight ago which was reported back to the Pentagon and State Department in a cable, which then leaked to journalists. As well as discussing bombs, the cable reveals NATO allies are concerned about the possibility that Putin will go nuclear and want to present a united front against him. It says: 'Given the rising volume and scale of Russia’s nuclear rhetoric, a subset of allies requested continued consultations at NATO to ensure continued readiness and consistent messaging.' The cable adds that 15 allies were concerned that NATO 'must not give in to Putin’s nuclear blackmail'. Politico said the contents of the cable had been confirmed by two sources, but Brigadier General Patrick Ryder - spokesman for the Pentagon - denied the timeline had been sped up. Modernising B-61 bombs had been underway for a long time, the general said, and 'it is in no way linked to current events in Ukraine and was not sped up in any way.' Just three NATO allies - the US, UK and France - possess nukes, but the warheads and weapons used to deploy them are scattered throughout the alliance. The alliance mostly maintains strategic nuclear weapons - doomsday devices meant to wipe out entire cities or countries - as a deterrent to being attacked. However, NATO does also have a smaller stockpile of so-called 'tactical' nuclear weapons that are designed to be used in battle for tactical gain. Russia, meanwhile, claims to have the world's largest nuclear stockpile of 6,500 warheads that includes a mixture of strategic and tactical. Just yesterday, Putin oversaw a huge nuclear drill - 'Grom' or 'Thunder' - involving the test-launch of weapons including the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile designed to carry some of its largest warheads. Also taking part in the drills were Russia's nuclear submarine fleet, which carry sorter-range missiles, and nuclear bombers. Russian state propagandists said the drills were a rehearsal for destroying the UK and US, though stressed that would only happen if Russia were attacked first. NATO is also holding nuclear drills - dubbed Steadfast Noon - which involve fighter jets, bombers and refueling planes flying above the UK, Belgium and North Sea. The exercise began last week and is due to last until Sunday with 14 of NATO's 30 member-states taking part. Around 60 aircraft including fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear warheads joined the drill, with surveillance and refuelling planes conducting training flights. U.S. long-range B-52 bombers also took part after flying in from Minot Air Base in North Dakota. NATO decided to press ahead with the drill despite the war in Ukraine, will alliance head Jens Stoltenberg saying it would send 'a very wrong signal' to Putin if they backed down. The Russian despot has now threatened the West several times with his own nuclear arsenal over the Ukraine war, which his troops are slowly losing. In his most-recent atomic rant, he falsely accused NATO of plotting to attack Russia and said anyone threatening him with nukes could become a target themselves. 'I'm not bluffing,' he added."
2022-10-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11358923/Britain-axed-air-defence-missiles-helped-Ukraine-just-months-invasion.html,Britain axed air defence missiles that could have helped Ukraine in war with Russia just months before invasion,"Britain junked an arsenal of air defence systems just before the invasion of Ukraine that could have helped thwart Russian attacks, the Daily Mail can reveal. Ministry of Defence sources said that all of the Army’s Rapier surface-to-air missile units were destroyed last year after nearly five decades in service. Rapier batteries were notably deployed across London in 2012 to combat security threats during the Olympics. ‘They were scrapped in October 2021. There are none working that could ever be sent to Ukraine now,’ an MoD source said. Officials believed the ageing technology – an earlier model was used in the Falklands – was becoming hard to maintain. But a veteran of the Royal Artillery, who declined to be named, said: ‘It was a very good piece of kit that would have been useful for the Ukrainians.’ Britain had 14 Rapier missile systems in place before ‘disposing’ of them, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank. Rapier was due to be retired as the Armed Forces had signed a £323million deal in April 2017 to acquire the more advanced Sky Sabre technology. The disposal of the Rapier missiles came as Moscow was massing its forces on Ukraine’s borders. The decision will raise eyebrows in Kyiv, where officials have been begging for unused air defence systems as Putin continues to attack the country. Kyiv-based security expert James Rushton said: ‘It looks like a short-sighted decision to destroy these potentially valuable air defence systems.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘Bolstering Ukraine’s air defences remains a priority for the UK military.’"

Images showed loyal supporters of Iran's government burning the Union Jack and LGBT flags in the streets outside the embassy as they condemned 'Iranian opposition television stations broadcasting from London'. Some cards held by the protesters read 'death to England' while others even called for a united Ireland, arguing that Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland should merge to become a sovereign state and chastising Britain's perceived interference in foreign affairs. It comes as Iranian security forces shot dead a Kurdish man during the nationwide protests over Mahsa Amini's death in the western city of Mahabad on Thursday, the Hengaw Organisation for Human Rights said. 'A young Kurdish man was killed by direct fire from Iranian security forces,' Hengaw, a Norway-based group, said on Twitter. 'This young man was shot in the forehead.' Hengaw said government forces had opened fire on people in the Gomrok neighbourhood of Mahabad after one of the city's police stations was surrounded, while footage circulating on Twitter appeared to show the Mahabad governor's office billowing smoke after being set on fire by rioters. Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian of Kurdish origin, died on September 16, three days after her arrest in Tehran by the notorious morality police for allegedly breaching the Islamic dress code for women. Anger flared at her funeral last month and quickly sparked the biggest wave of protests to rock the Islamic republic in almost three years. Protesters massed in their thousands in Mahsa Amini's hometown yesterday to mark 40 days since her death, prompting security forces to fire rounds and tear gas at the crowd. Young women have led the charge in daily protests that have endured for more than a month, burning their hijab headscarves and confronting security forces. Russia is training Iran how to crack down on protests using years of experience brutally crushing all opposition to Putin, the White House has warned. John Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council, said Wednesday it is 'a fact' that Tehran is getting expertise from Moscow in how to suppress demonstrations. He issued the warning the same day that huge crowds took to the streets across Iran demanding the end of the regime following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini - beaten to death in police custody for refusing to wear a hijab. It is just the latest sign of a growing alliance between pariah states Russian and Iran, after Tehran began selling Moscow suicide drones to use against Ukraine. Kirby, speaking at the White House, said: 'We know that [Russia] may be considering some sort of support... we'll watch where this goes. We see signs that [Russia] may be considering the ability to help train Iranians on cracking down on protesters.' Karine Jean-Pierre, White House press secretary, added: ' We are concerned that Moscow may be advising Tehran on best practices. 'Iran & Russia are growing closer the more isolated they become. 'Our message to Iran is very very clear. Stop killing your people & stop sending weapons to Russia to kill Ukrainians.' Protests in Iran have now being going on for 40 days after Mahsa - a young Iranian-Kurd - died in police custody after being arrested for failing to wear a hijab. 'Death to the dictator,' mourners chanted at the Aichi cemetery outside Saqez, before many were seen heading to the governor's office in the city centre yesterday. Iran's semi-official ISNA news agency confirmed clashes took place between security forces and people taking part in the protests in Saqez. 'A limited number of those present at Mahsa Amini's memorial clashed with police forces on the outskirts of Saqez and were dispersed. Following the scattered clashes, internet in Saqez was cut off due to security considerations,' the agency reported, adding about 10,000 people had gathered. Thousands more seen making their way in cars, on motorbikes and on foot along a highway, through fields and even across a river, in videos widely shared online by activists and rights groups. Noisily clapping, shouting and honking car horns, mourners packed the highway linking Saqez to the cemetery five miles away, in images reportedly verified by Hengaw. 'This year is the year of blood, Seyed Ali will be toppled,' a group of them chanted in a video verified by AFP, referring to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 'Kurdistan, Kurdistan, the graveyard of fascists,' others were heard singing in another video shared by activists on Twitter. Hengaw said strikes were underway in Saqez as well as Divandarreh, Marivan, Kamyaran and Sanandaj, and in Javanrud and Ravansar in the western province of Kermanshah. The Norway-based rights group said Iranian football stars Ali Daei and Hamed Lak had travelled to Saqez 'to take part in the 40th day' service. They had been staying at the Kurd Hotel but were 'taken to the government guesthouse... under guard by the security forces', it said. Daei has previously run into trouble with authorities over his online support for the Amini protests. Kurdistan governor Esmail Zarei-Kousha said the situation in Saqez was calm and dismissed as 'completely false' reports that roads into the city had been shut. 'The enemy and its media... are trying to use the 40-day anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death as a pretext to cause new tensions but fortunately the situation in the province is completely stable,' he said, quoted by state news agency IRNA. Hengaw said most of Saqez was 'empty' as so many people had left the city to join the ceremony to commemorate Amini. The social media channel 1500tasvir, which chronicles rights violations by Iran's security forces, said fresh protests flared elsewhere including at universities in Tehran, Mashhad in Iran's northeast, and Ahvaz in the southwest. Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights said the security forces' crackdown on the Amini protests has claimed the lives of at least 141 demonstrators, in a death toll established on Tuesday. Amnesty International says the 'unrelenting brutal crackdown' has killed at least 23 children, while IHR said at least 29 children have been slain. More than five weeks after Amini's death, the demonstrations show no signs of ending. They have been fuelled by public outrage over the crackdown that has claimed the lives of other young women and girls. Iran's Forensic Organisation said in a report this month that Amini's death 'was not caused by blows to the head and vital organs and limbs of the body'. But lawyers acting for her family have rejected the findings and called for a re-examination of her death by another commission. Iran announced sanctions Wednesday targeting individuals and media outlets in the European Union, in retaliation for the bloc's punitive measures imposed last week on the morality police and other officials over the crackdown. The Iranian regime is running out of prison space to house protesters after almost six weeks of riots, sources speaking with MailOnline have said. Iranian police have been forced to release protesters back on to the street after running out of places to house them, with country-wide demonstrations leaving the Islamic republic thin on resources, according to Iranian residents. Several demonstrators recently detained by Iranian police were immediately released, MailOnline understands. According to a document prepared for Ali Khamenei, the regime's supreme leader and seen by Iranian opposition forces, the Iranian regime arrested 20,445 protesters in the first two weeks of protests. The report said that 42 percent of those arrested are under the age 20, with many of its members making up the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK). For the first time, the head of the judiciary in Iran has said the regime is willing to hold talks with protesters. 'Many of IR officials are calling for talks, this has never happened before,' said Moeen, an Iranian resident who recently fled the country for Pakistan, speaking to MailOnline on the condition that his real name would not be used. At the meeting of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary on the 18th of October, according to Hamshahri Online, the Head of the Judiciary Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i said: 'I am at their service for anyone who has any doubts, questions, criticisms or objections. It is my authority to talk to them.'"
2022-10-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11360033/Russian-nuclear-drills-rehearsal-destroying-UK-US.html,"Britain and the US would be obliterated by 'massive nuclear strikes' rehearsed yesterday under Putin's watchful eye, it's revealed as Russia warns it could attack the West's commercial satellites","Huge Russian nuclear drills watched over by Vladimir Putin were a rehearsal for wiping Britain and America off the map, a state media stooge declared last night. Colonel Igor Korotchenko, editor-in-chief of Russia's National Defence magazine, said yesterday's missile, submarine and bomber drills were to demonstrate his country's ability to carry out an overwhelming retaliatory strike if it were ever to come under attack using nukes. Mr Korotchenko made it clear who the drills were aimed at, telling state TV: 'Who could launch a first nuclear strike on Russia? The US and the UK. I don't know if [French President] Macron is someone who would join this adventure... It is very important that we have shown who our main enemies are and what awaits them.' If the strike were carried out for real, Mr Korotchenko boasted, Britain would be submerged beneath the Atlantic Ocean and instead of the United States there would be a new naval strait named after Joseph Stalin. 'There is no compromise,' he added. 'The signal has been sent [to the US and UK]. This [should make them] sober up and clear their minds. This is not nuclear blackmail. This is what we would really do [if] we get hit.' And adding to tensions, Russia today warned that it could attack the West's commercial satellites in 'retaliation' to the US and its allies using them to aid Ukraine's war effort. Konstantin Vorontsov, deputy director of the Russian foreign ministry's department for non-proliferation and arms control, told the United Nations that use the use of Western satellites to help Ukraine was 'an extremely dangerous trend'. 'Quasi-civilian infrastructure may be a legitimate target for a retaliatory strike,' Vorontsov told the United Nations First Committee, adding that the West's use of such satellites to support Ukraine was 'provocative'. 'We are talking about the involvement of components of civilian space infrastructure, including commercial, by the United States and its allies in armed conflicts,' Vorontsov was quoted as saying at the United Nations. Vorontsov did not mention any specific satellite companies though Elon Musk said earlier this month that his rocket company SpaceX would continue to fund its Starlink internet service in Ukraine, citing the need for 'good deeds.' Vladimir Putin watched over yesterday's drills – a yearly preparedness exercise dubbed 'Grom' or 'Thunder' – from Russia's nuclear command centre. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said they were designed to rehearse a 'massive strike'. The drills involved the test-firing of a Yars land-based intercontinental ballistic missile from the northern Plesetsk spaceport and the launch of a Sineva ICBM by a Russian nuclear submarine in the Barents Sea, just ten miles away from the shores of Nato member Norway. As part of the exercise, Tu-95 strategic bombers also launched cruise missiles at practice targets. Footage shows a large nuclear submarine in the water during the test. The large team were filmed making preparations for the simulation nuclear strikes and following launch protocol as they took part in the annual exercise. Clips also showed them flicking switches, running up stairs, speaking to each other on radios and monitoring the missiles before they were fired. As the test began, the Russian Sineva was seen soaring through the air from the water and disappearing into the clouds. Meanwhile the Yars later shot into the air after switches were flicked and a sound indicated that it was about to go off. After it was launched, a huge ball of flames engulfed the sky and left a cloud of smoke in its wake as a loud bang was also heard. The drills were monitored remotely by Putin, who also spoke to some of his military chiefs afterwards. The manoeuvres followed Putin's warning about his readiness to use 'all means available' to fend off attacks on Russia's territory in a reference to the country's nuclear arsenals. The Kremlin said that all tasks set for the exercise were fulfilled and all the missiles that were test-fired reached their designated targets. Such drills involving land, sea and air components have taken place on an annual basis to train the country's nuclear forces and demonstrate their readiness. The Biden administration said on Tuesday that Russia gave notice it intended to stage routine tests of its nuclear capabilities. The Pentagon and US State Department said Russia had complied with the terms of the last US-Russia arms control agreement in notifying Washington of the upcoming tests. It comes amid Moscow's warnings of a purported Ukrainian plot to detonate a radioactive device commonly known as a 'dirty bomb' in a false flag attack to blame Russia. Ukraine and its allies strongly reject the allegation, and yesterday Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: 'This is absurd. Allies reject this blatantly false accusation, and Russia must not use false pretexts to escalate the war further.' Mr Stoltenberg underlined that the 30-nation military organisation 'will not be intimidated or deterred from supporting Ukraine's right to self-defence for as long as it takes.' Putin told a meeting of intelligence officials from the CIS group of ex-Soviet countries that the West was 'pumping' Ukraine with heavy weapons, adding: 'There are also plans to use a so-called 'dirty bomb' for provocations.' Shoigu today called his counterparts from India and China to convey Moscow's concern about the purported Ukrainian plan. He voiced Moscow's concern about 'possible Ukrainian provocations involving a 'dirty bomb'' in the calls with his Indian counterpart, Rajnath Singh, and China's Wei Fenghe, according to the Russian Defence Ministry. The conversations followed Shoigu's calls with British, French, Turkish and US counterparts on Sunday in which he made the same claim. Britain, France, and the United States rejected it as 'transparently false.' Poland's government said it is preparing for the Kremlin's potential use of nuclear or chemical weapons after its warnings on Ukraine. Sejm member Marcin Ociepa told Polish state broadcaster TVP1 the government believes Putin 'may reach for nuclear or chemical weapons' because his country's forces are struggling in Ukraine and that Poland 'must be prepared for all scenarios.' Polish president Andrzej Duda, prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki, national security ministers and leaders of Poland's armed forces met on Tuesday to discuss aid for Ukraine and the course of the war, including Russia's nuclear threats. The head of Poland's National Security Bureau, Jacek Siewiera, said after the meeting that the leaders discussed the risks and consequences associated with the use of any type of nuclear weapons in light of the changing characteristics of the war as well as the approaching winter. Despite the Western dismissal of the Russian claims, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted that 'we have the information that there is an ongoing preparation in Ukraine for such a terror attack'. 'We will continue to energetically inform the global community about what we know to persuade it to take action to prevent such irresponsible action by the regime in Kyiv,' Peskov told reporters. Moscow also took its accusation to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, voicing its concerns during a closed-door meeting. Russia has not made public the evidence that it asserts it has, but says it has prepared its troops to work under conditions of nuclear contamination. Its deputy UN ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, told reporters after the Council meeting that it had passed intelligence information to Western counterparts with the 'necessary level of clearance'. Britain's Deputy UN Ambassador, James Kariuki, called the allegations 'pure Russian misinformation of the kind we've seen many times before'. Russia targeted more than 40 villages around Ukraine over the past day, Ukrainian officials said yesterday, killing at least two people and sustaining the terror that forces people into air raid shelters each night. Russian forces launched five rockets, 30 air strikes and more than 100 multiple-launch rocket system attacks on Ukrainian targets, the Ukrainian armed forces general staff said. A Ukrainian official reported that a Russian strike hit a gas station in the city of Dnipro, killing two people, including a pregnant woman. The governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Valentyn Reznichenko, said four of the wounded were hospitalised. Mykolaiv, a southern port city near the war's frontline, is among the places where residents have lined up to receive rations of bread and canned food as increases in food prices and losses of income add to the war-time burdens of low-income households in Ukraine. Several buildings and neighborhoods were struck in Mykolaiv on Tuesday, though it was still unclear if there were any casualties, according to local authorities. Missiles continued early yesterday morning. The sole food distribution point in Mykolaiv allows each person to receive free bread once every three days. Many must walk long distances to collect the essential food items for their family."
2022-10-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11360141/Shells-profits-soar-8-2billion-just-three-months-doubling-period-year.html,Shell's profits soar to £8.2billion in just three months - more than double the amount for the same period last year,"Shell has today announced profits of nearly £8.2bn ($9.5bn) between July and September, more than double what it made during the same period the year before. The oil giant continued to benefit from high gas prices, driven by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But profits were down compared with what Shell had earned between April and June when it made £9.9bn ($11.5bn), as the price of oil slowly began to fall. The war in Ukraine has seen energy prices skyrocket across Europe, contributing to a cost-of-living crisis in the UK, with millions of Britons facing a difficult winter. Announcing the results, chief executive Ben van Beurden said: 'We are delivering robust results at a time of ongoing volatility in the global energy market. Shell is now nine months into what promises to be the company's most profitable year ever, barring an unlikely major collapse in oil and gas prices over the next two months. The business was already benefiting from a global economy that had reopened after the pandemic and was desperate for energy to fuel its growth. Then Vladimir Putin waged an unprovoked war in Ukraine in February, pushing European gas prices to all-time highs and the price of oil soared internationally. Rishi Sunak has faced calls today to expand the windfall tax on fossil fuel giants following the announcement. Climate activists and opposition MPs are urging the Prime Minister to go further on his windfall tax as oil and gas giants see profits soar over Russia's war in Ukraine. Downing Street said 'nothing is off the table' ahead of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's autumn budget on November 17. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband said Shell's profits are 'further proof that we need a proper windfall tax to make the energy companies pay their fair share'. 'Rishi Sunak's existing plans are a pale imitation of Labour's windfall tax and would see billions of pounds of taxpayer money go back into the pockets of oil and gas giants through ludicrous tax breaks,' he said. 'It tells you everything you need to know about whose side this Conservative Government is on that they refuse to back Labour's proper windfall tax whilst working people, families, and pensioners suffer.' Shell has avoided paying extra windfall tax despite making record profits so far this year because it is investing heavily in the North Sea. The oil giant said that it does not expect to pay any extra tax this year despite the Government's decision in May to put a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers. Finance boss Sinead Gorman said Shell had done enough over recent months to avoid the levy - which encouraged tax relief in exchange for investment. 'Heavy capex (capital expenditure) has meant that we haven't had extra tax coming through in this quarter yet,' she said. 'I do expect to see that extra tax to happen quite early in the first quarter of 2023, but we'll see what plays out with prices as well.' She added: 'We simply are investing more heavily than we have, and therefore we don't have profits which we can be taxed against.' Shell reported nearly £8.2bn ($9.5bn) profit in the third quarter, more than double what it made during the same period the year before. Windfall tax was introduced in May to rein in the astronomical profits of the oil and gas companies. Some say it has not gone far enough. Shell boss Ben van Beurden said it was up to Government to decide whether the tax had succeeded. 'In principle a tax system that incentivises people, rather than just taxes people, is a good design, whether it meets all the requirements of what a Government needs is for the Government to decide,' he said. On Thursday, Nadhim Zahawi did not rule out an additional windfall tax, but added it was important that companies still invest in the UK. The Tory Party chairman said he would not 'preempt any decisions' ahead of the Autumn Statement next month. The energy crisis led then-chancellor Rishi Sunak in May to introduce a windfall tax on oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea. He announced the 25% surcharge on extraordinary profits to help pay for a package of support for households struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. His plans are due to lapse at the end of 2025 or sooner if oil and gas prices return to 'historically more normal levels', as Vladimir Putin's invasion pushes up prices. But that has not stopped Shell from handing billions of dollars to its shareholders this year. On Thursday it announced plans to return a further £3.5bn ($4bn) to shareholders by buying back shares over the next three months, and said it will also increase the dividend by 15 per cent. It takes the total payout to Shell shareholders to £22.4bn ($26bn) so far this year. Mr van Beurden said: 'We continue to strengthen Shell's portfolio through disciplined investment and transform the company for a low-carbon future. 'At the same time we are working closely with governments and customers to address their short- and long-term energy needs.' Greenpeace yesterday called for a 'proper tax' on the energy giant's profits, which it said could help insulate thousands of homes. 'While Shell continues to bank billions, how many more households need to be forced into fuel poverty before the Government wakes up? 'The only way to address the interlocking cost of living, energy security and climate crises is a street-by-street rollout of home insulation combined with a massive lift in ambition for renewable energy,' the campaign group's UK senior climate adviser, Charlie Kronick, said. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: 'The Conservative Government's refusal to properly tax these eye-watering profits is an insult to families struggling to pay their energy bills. 'Even the CEO of Shell has admitted that oil and gas companies should be taxed more to help protect vulnerable households.' Asked on LBC radio on Frida about an extended windfall tax, Tory party chairman Nadhim Zahawi said that 'absolutely the Chancellor and the Prime Minister will look at every decision'. But he warned against creating 'a tax system that disincentivises investment'. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'I am not going to get into tax measures ahead of a fiscal event. 'It is accurate to say, as we made clear, no options are off the table given the economic circumstances. But clearly that is for the autumn statement.' Mr Sunak does not believe the current levy has been hindering investment, the spokesman said. Banks have also been enjoying bumper profits as they benefit from rising interest rates. Downing Street did not rule out a windfall tax on them either, with the spokesman saying: 'I haven't asked the Prime Minister directly but broadly speaking hypothetical tax measures are for a fiscal event.' The chief executive of Shell has said he regrets not acting earlier to reduce his company's environmental damage as he prepares to step down after nearly a decade in charge. Ben van Beurden said that he should have acted in 2015 on data coming out of the Groningen gas field in the Netherlands. 'There's a few regrets, Mr Ben van Beurden told reporters. 'Not in the sense that I made the wrong decisions, but more often that I made them perhaps - with the benefit of hindsight - a little bit too late,' he said after Shell made the second-highest quarterly profits on record. 'I wish that some of the things that we had as emerging insights in 2015 I had acted on earlier rather than waiting until 2017 to act on them,' he said. Shell and its partner Exxon reduced their production from the Dutch oil field in the 2010s, but it took a long time for them to recognise the danger caused by the earthquakes that it caused. Van Beurden also spoke of points of pride, including lowering Shell's own emissions by around one-third during his time in charge. He also said that one-third of the top 100 staff at Shell are now women, compared with 17 per cent when he joined. 'That might be another point of pride, the fact that we have been, and are still the leading company when it comes to carbon management in the industry,' he said. But Mr van Beurden said that he had not acted soon enough on Shell's controversial drilling in the Arctic. After spending around seven billion dollars (£6 billion) drilling off the coast of Alaska the company pulled out in 2015, citing high costs and poor results from drilling. Mr van Beurden said: 'Another thing I think is a regret is the Arctic. In the end, we went out of it, but with the benefit of hindsight I look back on it and think: Couldn't I have done that earlier and faster? 'So a mix of pride and regret - but I suppose that's always the case after nine years.'"
2022-10-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11359909/The-moment-Putins-goddaughter-flees-foot-West-avoid-arrest.html,"The moment 'Putin's goddaughter, 40, flees on foot to the West to avoid arrest': CCTV 'shows TV star covering her face as she crosses Lithuanian border' hours after police raided her home","New footage appears to show the moment Vladimir Putin's rumoured goddaughter fled to the West on foot to avoid arrest - hours after police raided her mansion. TV star and opposition politician Ksenia Sobchak, 40, who has been critical of Putin, is apparently seen crossing the Belarusian border into Lithuania, a member of NATO, at the Vidzy frontier point 106 miles north of Minsk, according to reports. CCTV appears to show Sobcak, accompanied by an unknown man, covering her face and wearing a cap as she crosses the border, reports RIA Novosti news agency. The extraordinary video was apparently leaked from Belarusian border cameras - and Lithuania today confirmed that Sobchak had entered the Baltic state using an Israeli passport. Sobchak, who has known Putin since she was a child, fled Russia for Belarus before entering Lithuania hours after Russian investigators raided her luxury home in a prestigious Moscow suburb. Police said that the search on her home was part of a probe into alleged wrongdoing by her media director, Kirill Sukhanov, who was arrested on charges of extortion. Sobchak on Tuesday rejected the accusations against Sukhanov as 'ravings and nonsense' and described his arrest as part of the authorities' efforts to stifle independent media. The CCTV from the Belarusian border reportedly shows a man carrying Sobchak's bag and at one point, he appears to look back to see if they are being followed. At one point the man appears to warn Sobhak to lower her head to avoid being seen by the cameras. The footage apparently shows Sobhak going through Belarus passport control at 13.32 local time on Wednesday and telling a border control officer that she is heading to Lithuania. Sobchak is then seen being accompanied by two uniformed men as she carries her own bag to the actual frontier. The video was leaked, likely with official sanction, to a Telegram channel called Three Sisters with less than 2,000 subscribers. It has links to the security apparatus of Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko. Lithuania's Director of the State Security Department (VSD) Darius Jauniškis confirmed that Sobcak had entered Lithuania. He told radio station Zhinyu Radijas that she had Israeli citizenship and could enter without a visa and remain for 90 days without a visa. 'So far we do not have intelligence information that she may pose a threat to the Lithuanian state,' he said. 'If there was such information, of course, certain measures would be taken.' Earlier in the war Sobchak had travelled to Israel and back to Russia but at the time denied reports that she had been issued with an Israeli passport. Lithuania normally now blocks entry to Russian citizens due to Putin's war. In the CCTV footage, which appears to show Sobchak crossing the Belarusian border into Lithuania, the Belarus authorities made no visible attempts to stop her leaving. This is despite Sobchak, according to Russian sources, wanted as a suspect in connection with a criminal probe in Moscow involving her business associate, an investigation she believes to be politically-motivated but which could have landed her in jail for up to 15 years. Separately, Russian political scientist Sergei Markov claimed that a 'high-ranking official' had tipped off Sobchak that she faced arrest. This led to her fleeing Russia, he said. The timing of the Russian state media announcement that she had left Belarus for Lithuania was only 36 minutes after she had apparently been cleared for exit by the Belarus border guard. This may indicate that Putin had given her tacit permission to flee to the West rather than see his 'goddaughter' held in detention like his other political foes. Sobchak reportedly bought tickets to both Turkey and Dubai to 'confuse' state investigators seeking her arrest. Then she travelled to Belarus by car and left for the West in a 'smart operational escape plan in order to avoid arrest' using her Israeli passport. A socialite-turned-politician, Sobchak was once called the Paris Hilton of Moscow. She was a popular reality TV presenter and once posed for Playboy. She hosted the Russian version of Big Brother and went on to stand as a liberal candidate against Putin in the 2018 presidential election - rigged in Putin's favour - when she came fourth. One of Russia's best known faces, she now runs independent media outlets which have angered Putin's officials. Putin has known her since her childhood and he attended her baptism in the Orthodox Church, leading to rumours he is her godfather. Her father, Anatoly Sobchak, was Putin's law professor and mentor who later gave the KGB spy his first foothold in politics as his deputy when he served as mayor of St Petersburg. Later Putin even smuggled Ksenia's father out of Russia for medical treatment in the West at a time when his patron was accused by foes of corruption. Putin was later pictured at the former mayor's funeral in 2000, alongside Ksenia, and her mother Lyudmila Narusova, now a Russian senator who opposes the war in Ukraine. Narusova has voted against war-linked legislation in the Russian parliament and accused his state TV of 'shameless lies' over the conflict. Despite criticising Putin, Ksenia held a private meeting with the Russian leader before announcing she would oppose him in the poll. This led to claims that she was conspiring with him to give a cloak of respectability to a rigged election. The close family links have not saved Ksenia Sobchak from harassment by Putin's police. She fled dramatically from Russia via Belarus hours after police staged searches at her luxury country home near Moscow. This was linked to a murky criminal investigation which saw the arrest on Tuesday of her commercial director Kirill Sukhanov, and a former Russian Tatler editor, Arian Romanovsky, on blackmail allegations. Sobchak was named as a suspect in the same case, namely 'extortion to obtain property on a particularly large scale'. Footage showed the men - who face sentences of up to 15 years - in court. Had she not fled, Sobchak would also have been brought to court on the same accusation. Police were reported as seeking to detain Sobchak at a VIP Moscow airport when it was announced she had reached the West by land. The alleged victim of the 'blackmail' was Sergey Chemezov, CEO of Rostec Corporation, a close KGB colleague of Putin's in the Cold War who has remained close ever since. Sobchak had dismissed Sukhanov's detention as 'simply delirium', adding: 'It is laughable, nonsense.' The moves were 'more oppression' against her and the Russian media. She said her outlets were 'the last free media office in Russia', which Putin's regime had decided to 'shut'. 'They have got nothing to dig on us, which infuriates them,' she said of Putin's authorities. When details of the criminal case emerged, pro-Putin propagandist Sergei Mardan said it was a warning for her to flee. 'The land is burning under Sobchak and the best way out would be to change her country of residence, and at the same time citizenship,' he posted. 'Perhaps the detention of Kirill Sukhanov and the searches at Sobchak's place are a subtle hint 'from above' about the undesirability of her further stay on the territory of Russia.' Political scientist Sergei Markov said: 'If you are ready to arrest for a trifle, for simple extortion, for money, even the daughter of President Putin's beloved teacher and mentor, who everyone forgave for many years, then there are no untouchables now.' The exit of Sobchak, who was both loved and loathed, led to trolling on social media, accusing her of abandoning her motherland. She had earlier denied claims she had secret Israeli citizenship, and insisted she would not quit Russia. In the footage she appeared to use a Russian passport as she left Belarus. She has previously said: 'I am Russian, I am a citizen of Russia. 'I do not emigrate anywhere, I have no other citizenships.' There is no passport control between 'union state' Russia and Belarus, which means the Vidzy crossing acted as her exit point from Russia. Belarus has been used as a transit point by some escapees from Putin's mobilisation in recent weeks."
2022-10-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11359969/Russia-training-Iran-crush-protests-White-House-warns.html,"Russia is training Iranian regime thugs its methods of crushing protests and dissent in return for supplying killer drones in Ukraine, White House warns","Russia is training Iran how to crack down on protests using years of experience brutally crushing all opposition to Putin, the White House has warned. John Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council, said Wednesday it is 'a fact' that Tehran is getting expertise from Moscow in how to suppress demonstrations. He issued the warning the same day that huge crowds took to the streets across Iran demanding the end of the regime following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini - beaten to death in police custody for refusing to wear a hijab. It is just the latest sign of a growing alliance between pariah states Russian and Iran, after Tehran began selling Moscow suicide drones to use against Ukraine. Kirby, speaking at the White House, said: 'We know that [Russia] may be considering some sort of support... we'll watch where this goes. We see signs that [Russia] may be considering the ability to help train Iranians on cracking down on protesters.' Karine Jean-Pierre, White House press secretary, added: ' We are concerned that Moscow may be advising Tehran on best practices. 'Iran & Russia are growing closer the more isolated they become. 'Our message to Iran is very very clear. Stop killing your people & stop sending weapons to Russia to kill Ukrainians.' Protests in Iran have now being going on for 40 days after Mahsa - a young Iranian-Kurd - died in police custody after being arrested for failing to wear a hijab. Iran claims she died of multiple organ failure linked to 'underlying diseases', but her family say she was beaten to death by the regime's brutal morality police. Her death drew people on to the streets where calls for justice have mingled with demands for an end to the country's Islamist regime. At least 13 people died Wednesday in a gun attack at the Aichi cemetery outside the city of Saqez, Iran's semi-official IRNA news agency said, blaming Sunni terrorists. But there were also reports circulating of clashes between demonstrators and security forces. Witnesses and opposition groups say the demonstrations are the largest and most volatile that the Iranian regime has faced in its four-decade rule. A broad alliance of opposition groups - including ethnic minorities, pro-democracy activists, and ordinary people who see no future for the country - are demanding an end to the repressive rule of the Ayatollah and his mullahs. While there is little consensus about what exactly should come next for Iran, general demands include greater personal freedoms and better economic prospects. Though the marches have remained largely peaceful, regime security have been accused of unleashing bloody reprisals that have left hundreds dead with thousands more detained. Impartial data is impossible to obtain thanks in large part to an internet blackout across Iran, but the People's Mujahedeen - one of the opposition groups - claims to have verified more than 250 deaths. But they believe the true toll may be double that figure. Meanwhile Russia has turned to Iran for support in its war on Ukraine after Putin's army was fought to a standstill on the battlefield. Moscow is now trying to hold on to the territory it has already gained and appears to be focusing on terrorising Ukraine's citizens into accepting a peace deal. Airstrikes over the past several weeks have focused on hitting Ukraine's major cities and power network, causing rolling blackouts and depriving people of heating just as winter sets in. But, with large parts of its missile stockpile used up, Russia has been forced to buy Shahed-136 suicide drones from Iran to use in the strikes. The slow-moving drones are packed with explosives and use a two-stroke motor to fly to their targets before the engine cuts out, causing them to plunge from the sky. Ukraine claims to have shot down the majority of drones launched at them so far, but some have made it through air defences - destroying around a third of the country's power plants and killing dozens of civilians."
2022-10-27,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11361027/house-republicans-biden-strategic-oil-reserves.html,Republicans launch an investigation into Biden's 'misuse' of emergency oil reserves to lower gas prices after talk of ban on fuel exports after Saudi rejected call to delay OPEC deal,"Republicans on the House Oversight Committee have accused President Joe Biden of improperly tapping into the nation's strategic petroleum reserve to soften the blow of Saudi Arabia-led OPEC+'s decision to dramatically cut its oil production. The president announced the release of 15 million oil barrels earlier this month, just weeks before the November midterm elections where his party stands to lose the majority in one or both houses of Congress. In a letter sent to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on Wednesday, Rep. James Comer (R-KY) and Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) are demanding the Biden administration answer for the 180 million barrels released from the strategic reserve since the springtime, according to the letter obtained by DailyMail.com Biden has used the strategy to ease high gas prices, which reached a $5 per gallon average nationwide peak in June, despite warnings from lawmakers across the aisle that the reserves are only meant to be used in the event of an emergency. 'We are concerned that the president may soon impose an oil and gas export ban that will result in even higher gas prices, supply chain issues, global market upheaval, and reduced energy security for the US and our allies,' the letter stated. It was sent after a New York Times report revealed that US officials had made a backroom deal with the Saudis to boost oil production through the year, only to be left stunned and frustrated when the Kingdom turned its back on the secret arrangement. While a blow to the US, the move is also seen as a boost for Russia and its illegal invasion of Ukraine. The deal was reportedly struck before Biden's controversial trip to Saudi Arabia, which happened despite his criticizing the Middle Eastern state for its abysmal human rights record. The White House maintains the trip was not about oil, but Biden's critics hammered him for the appearance of pleading with the Saudis for help lowering energy costs at home rather than tapping into the US's own fossil fuel resources. Prices at the pump are falling as of Thursday, giving Democrats a sigh of relief with the election less than two weeks away. But politicians don't control gas prices, nor is it clear yet if voters will be forgiving after months of rising costs at break-neck pace. On Thursday the average cost of a gallon of gas was $3.76, less than a penny lower than Wednesday's price and slightly higher than it was at this time last month. Comer and Mace asked for Granholm to turn over any relevant communications to discussions about the strategic petroleum reserves within the department and within the White House. While having little actionable power in the minority, the initiation of Oversight Republicans' probe is another indication of the broad scrutiny that GOP lawmakers are aiming to give to the Biden administration next year if they make big gains in the midterms. Both Comer and Mace are in safe Republican districts, so it's highly likely they will continue their effort next year. The pair have raised multiple alarm bells over the White House's alleged sale of oil from the US's emergency stocks to a Chinese-backed company called Unipec America. Regulations mandate that the Energy Department sell the oil releases to the highest bidder regardless of whether they are foreign or domestic. They reiterated those concerns when Biden announced the additional release of 15 million barrels earlier this month. 'In order to ensure the American people that the Biden Administration is properly managing the sale of critical assets from the SPR and not supporting Russia by providing oil to China, we request a briefing and documents related to this matter,' the statement read."
2022-10-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11355721/Ramzan-Kadyrov-declares-Ukraine-Big-Jihad-urges-fight-against-Satanists.html,Putin's warlord Ramzan Kadyrov declares Ukraine war 'the Big Jihad' and urges Muslims to rise up and fight 'demons' as Russia's security council calls for the country to be 'de-Satanized',"Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov has declared the war in Ukraine to be 'the Big Jihad' while urging Russian Muslims to rise up and fight 'demons' and the forces of 'Satanic democracy'. Kadyrov, one of Putin's most hardline supporters, ranted against gay people, the transgender, and Western liberals online - saying they have overrun Ukraine, want to destroy Russia, and it is the duty of patriots to take up arms against them. 'They want to break our Motherland into pieces, humiliate, trample in the dirt and, in the end, defile our faith and culture so that we don't have any identity and not a single family value,' he said. 'I see degradation and Satanism in this. 'And I'd rather fight it in the bud than let this abomination envelop our Motherland.' His language was then adopted by the Russian Security Council which last night proclaimed that hundreds of Satanist sects are now spreading across Ukraine and that the country must be 'completely de-Satanzied'. It marks a shift in tone from earlier in the war, when Moscow declared it was fighting against fascists and wanted Ukraine to be 'de-Nazified'. Now, at least according to the Kremlin, they are fighting the Devil. Kadyrov raged: 'I swear with the Almighty's name, this is the Big Jihad which we must all take part in. 'And we will not stop. We will be killing them wherever they are. No matter who is helping them, America or Europe. There is nothing to worry about. 'They don't have as much means and forces, they will run out soon. Our ancestors during World War Two had even less. 'They didn't have enough to eat, but they won, because they had spirit and belief.' Kadyrov also promised that anyone signing up to fight in Ukraine would get to kill 'shaitans', an Islamic word meaning 'evil spirit' or 'demon'. He added: 'I do not understand those who love the Fatherland only in words. Honestly, I don't understand. I don't understand those who don't see the obvious. '[The West] want to break our Motherland into pieces, humiliate, trample in the dirt and, in the end, defile our faith and culture so that we don't have any identity and not a single family value. I use the word ""Satanism"" for a reason… 'In the West, Satanism is openly acting against Russia. Satanic democracy is when the rights of atheists are protected, but believers are offended. 'Or when traditional couples are deprived of children who are transferred to same-sex families. Intentionally same-sex, not by chance. 'In Europe they have swallowed it. They consider it modern, civilised. The more liberated ""below the belt"" topic, the better for them. 'And I see degradation and Satanism in this. And I'd rather fight it in the bud than let this abomination envelop our Motherland here. 'Today the state and the president [Putin] need us.' Kadyrov is a Putin stooge appointed to rule over Chechnya with an iron fist after Vladimir crushed an uprising there as one of his first acts as president. He has typically been loyal to his paymaster, but as the war in Ukraine has lurched from disaster to disaster he has become more openly critical. Though he has not attacked Putin directly, Kadyrov has railed against Russia's commanders and insisted he could have achieved victory by now. Another Putin loyalist who has turned critical in recent weeks is Vladimir Solovyov, a state TV propagandist, who last night called for Ukraine's second-largest city to be wiped 'off the face of the f***ing earth.' Kharkiv - a major hub for Russia diaspora before the war broke out - is 'obviously Ukraine's main logistic and supply centre', according to Solovyov. 'Wipe it off the face of the f***ing earth if we have to,' he said. 'Warn the civilians, tell them ""You've got 24 hours, 48 hours [to leave]""… After that we begin to destroy the city block by block. 'The same goes for the threat [to] Kherson. Where's the threat coming from. Mykolaiv? Then destroy Mykolaiv. It's simple and clear.' Talk of 'de-Satanizing' Ukraine comes after Putin himself railed against the forces of evil he claimed were arrayed against him during a speech annexing occupied regions of the country to Russia. Hew said: 'Do we want to have, here, in our country, in Russia, instead of mom and dad, to be a ""parent number one"", ""number two"", ""number three"". 'Do we really want perversions that lead to degradation and extinction to be imposed on children in our schools from the primary grades? 'To be drummed into them that there are supposedly other genders besides women and men, and to be offered a gender reassignment operation? 'Do we want all this for our country and our children? For us, all this is unacceptable, we have a different, our own future... 'Such a complete denial of man, the overthrow of faith and traditional values, the suppression of freedom acquires the features of a 'reverse religion' - outright Satanism.' Putin's rhetoric has become increasingly unhinged as he loses the war in Ukraine. What was supposed to be a days-long invasion to re-take control of the country - mirroring his 2014 annexation of Crimea - has turned into an eight-month war. Russia's army has been given a mauling at the hands of Ukraine, which is increasingly being armed with state-of-the-art Western weaponry. Putin's forces have virtually stopped advancing having achieved none of his war aims, and are instead struggling to hold on to the territory they already hold. To help, Vladimir has been forced to conscript 300,000 men into the military to plug holes on the frontline and has declared martial law across occupied Ukraine and in border regions of Russia. But Ukraine continues to advance. Troops are currently pushing east into Luhansk province from Kharkiv - which was almost-totally recaptured last month - and south towards Kherson. Sergei Surovikin, Putin's top man in Ukraine, has floated the possibility of a retreat from the southern city which is also the capital of a province Putin annexed. President Zelensky has vowed to continue fighting until all Ukrainian territory is back under Kyiv's control."
2022-10-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11355779/South-Africa-REFUSES-seize-Putin-allys-superyacht.html,"South Africa REFUSES to seize Putin ally’s superyacht, saying the country has ‘no reason’ to comply with Western sanctions","The South African government has refused to seize a superyacht belonging to a sanctioned Russian oligarch attempting to dock in Cape Town, with a government spokesperson adding the country has 'no reason' to comply with Western sanctions. The $500million superyacht belongs to Alexey Mordashov, a 57-year-old billionaire named in the Pandora Papers, who owns the Russian mining companies Nordgold and Severstal. With a net worth of $13.2billion, Forbes ranked Mordashov as the 51st richest person in the world last year, but Western sanctions have sent the oligarch sinking in world wealth rankings as of this year. 'South Africa has no legal obligation to abide by sanctions imposed by the US and EU,' said Vincent Magwenya, spokesman for South Africa's president. 'We have no reason to prevent their entry into South Africa. 'South Africa’s obligations with respect to sanctions relate only to those that are specifically adopted by the United Nations. Currently, there are no UN-imposed sanctions on the particular individual.' Members of the African National Congress party, which governs South Africa, were observers in sham referendums held in regions of Ukraine last month as a pretext for annexing occupied territory in the east of the country. The ANC has strong historical ties to the former Soviet Union, which trained and supported its forces during South Africa's apartheid era. But Geordin Hill-Lewis, the mayor of Cape Town, doesn't want his city to become a safe harbour for Russians fleeing sanctions from the West. He said South Africa has a 'moral duty to protest unjust war,' according to The Times. Hill-Lewis, part of the opposition Democratic Alliance party, has urged the government to block the superyacht from docking, posting on Twitter that there should be 'no place' for 'enablers of Putin's war'. Cyril Ramaphosa, the sitting president of South Africa, blamed Nato's expansion as the reason for instability in Ukraine. Ramaphosa was forced to deny allegations last month that he illegally held around £3.46million in cash at his game ranch. The former head of South Africa's national spy agency made a criminal complaint to police, accusing Ramaphosa of money laundering and other offenses. His foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, complained of Western 'bullying' over the superyacht issue in August during a visit from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Superyacht Nord, which has two helipads, mini-submarines, 20 en suite staterooms, and costs £200,000 a day to run, was seen leaving the Far East Russian port Vladivostok on October 6 after arriving there from the Seychelles. It's arriving in South Africa after taking a trip to Hong Kong following sanctions, after the oligarch appears to have spent some time in the picturesque Seychelles onboard his yacht. Mordashov has lost around £10billion since the start of this year due to western sanctions against him and his business interests. The Italian police seized one of his smaller vessels, the 215ft Lady M, in March. Putin's own £100million superyacht, recently renamed Killer Whale, was spotted earlier in the month off the coast of Estonia — it narrowly escaped seizure when the war broke out in February. More than a dozen yachts owned by Russia's wealthy elite, worth a combined £2billion, have been seized by Western authorities since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Many yachts have fled to Turkey, which has not severed ties with Russia and continues to trade with Putin's regime. South Africa in 2009 refused entry to the Dalai Lama, where he was scheduled to attend the 14th world summit of Nobel peace laureates, in a move that was widely criticised at home. It was the third time in five years the Dalai Lama was refused a South African visa."
2022-10-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11355821/Conor-Kennedy-talked-way-fighting-Ukraine-war-despite-having-no-combat-experience.html,"Conor Kennedy, 28, 'talked his way' into fighting as a volunteer in the Ukraine war despite having no combat experience because he 'feels Putin is a gangster and a bully' his father RFK Jr reveals","Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has revealed that his son Conor Kennedy 'talked his way' into enlisting for the war in Ukraine despite having no military experience. Conor Kennedy, who is also the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, secretly enlisted to join the war in Ukraine because he felt Vladimir Putin is a 'gangster' and a 'bully', his father said. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Conor's father, appeared on The Megyn Kelly Show on Tuesday to speak about his son joining the fight in Ukraine. He revealed that he and his wife had no idea that Conor was joining the war effort, and that there was only one person on the ground in Ukraine who knew who Conor was. RFK Jr. said Conor's reason for wanting to fight in the war was because his son 'does not like Putin, he does not like bullies' and he doesn't support Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 'He felt that he shouldn't be arguing about it ... unless he was willing to have skin in the game and take his own risk,' RFK Jr. said of his son's choice to go to the war zone. 'He didn't have any military experience and kind of talked his way into the unit,' his father told Kelly. 'He's been in firefights, in mainly nighttime, and a lot of artillery fights with the Russians.' Conor wanted to fight anonymously in the war. His father told Kelly that he only told one American that he was going to Ukraine to fight, and only one person in Ukraine knew his real identity. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. explained to Kelly: 'He had a job for a law firm, a really good law firm in Los Angeles, and I was looking forward to him living with me for the summer.' But after asking Conor more about his plans, he said his son told him: 'I'm not going. I want to talk to you. I don't want you to ask me what I'm doing.' 'I was like, 'Um…,'' RFJ Jr. explained. 'He said, 'I will explain it to you at some point, but I do not want you to ask me now, and if you could just respect that it would mean a lot to me.' So I did.' Understandably, Robert Kennedy and his wife, actress Cheryl Hines began to investigate Conor's whereabouts after not hearing from him. The parents then stumbled upon his credit card bills. 'The last one we saw was in Poland and then there was one in Ukraine and then they just stopped,' he remembered. 'He didn't tell anyone where he was going or what he was doing.' Conor had joined the International Legion which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had set up in February to ask foreigners to help fight Russia. Robert Kennedy also revealed to Kelly that his son was now back home in the US. 'He came back a couple of days ago. I flew out to the East Coast to meet him and I heard about what he done,' Kennedy said. 'I'm very glad I didn't know what he was up to.' The 28-year-old previously wrote on his Instagram page about his decision to join the war effort: 'Like many people, I was deeply moved by what I saw happening in Ukraine over the past year. 'I wanted to help. When I heard about Ukraine's International Legion, I knew I was going, and I went to the embassy to enlist the next day.' The grandson of RFK added: 'I told one person here where I was, and I told one person there my real name. I didn't want my family or friends to worry, and I didn't want to be treated differently there.'"
2022-10-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11354871/Jeremy-Hunts-budget-delayed-month-Rishi-Sunak-time-mull-options.html,Jeremy Hunt's Halloween budget 'could be delayed until next month to give Rishi Sunak time to mull the options as he tried to plug £40bn public finance hole',"Jeremy Hunt's Halloween budget could be delayed until next month in order to give Rishi Sunak time to fill a hole of £40billion in the country's finances. The new Prime Minister is expected to meet finance minister Jeremy Hunt on Wednesday to discuss his proposals to increase taxes and squeeze public spending, The Times reported. The statement could also be delayed by a couple of days so it is presented before November 3, when the Bank of England is set to announce its plans for further interest rate hikes. It could even be pushed back again and turned into a full budget, the newspaper added. This comes after former PM Liz Truss's spokeswoman said last week that her successor would decide whether to proceed with a fiscal plan scheduled for October 31. Hunt reversed Truss's economic growth plan on October 17 after several weeks of turmoil in UK politics and markets and she resigned a few days later. Sunak, who became Britain's third prime minister in two months, quickly re-appointed Hunt as the Chancellor in a move designed to calm markets. Hunt, after his appointment, said the government would work to restore stability, confidence and long-term growth, while acknowledging a tough time lay ahead. It come as Sunak resurrected Suella Braverman, Dominic Raab and Michael Gove to the Cabinet while keeping Hunt on as Chancellor and vowing to fix the 'mistakes' of Truss's leadership. On his first day as Prime Minister, Sunak culled nearly a dozen of Truss's top-tier ministers including Jacob Rees-Mogg before reviving the careers of ousted frontbenchers. The new Tory leader warned the UK is facing a 'profound economic crisis' and braced the nation for 'difficult decisions' as he criticised his predecessor's record. Eager to reassure the markets, Sunak maintained Hunt's position in the Treasury after he was brought in to secure the economy after Truss's disastrous mini-budget. The cost of Government borrowing dropped and the pound rallied to the highest level since before the chaos, as Hunt warned it will be 'tough' ahead of his Halloween financial statement. Boris Johnson's loyalists who stayed close to Truss were among the 11 ministers who were out of government, while Sunak rewarded allies with Cabinet roles. A No 10 source said that the new Cabinet 'brings the talents of the party together' and that it reflects a 'unified party'. A YouGov poll found that 50 per cent of voters trusted Sunak to manage the economy, while 36 per cent did not. Asked to think back about his time as Chancellor, 53 per cent said he did a good job, with only 28 per cent saying he did a bad job. However, 48 per cent to 37 per cent say they don't trust Sunak to make the right decisions on the cost of living crisis, with almost identical figures saying the same of the rising cost of energy. Sunak said his predecessor, whose 49 days in office made her the shortest-lasting PM in history, was 'not wrong' to want to drive up growth, describing it as a 'noble aim'. 'But some mistakes were made. Not born of ill will or bad intentions - quite the opposite in fact. But mistakes nonetheless,' he added. 'I've been elected as leader of my party and your Prime Minister in part to fix them - and that work begins immediately.' Sunak, 42, became the UK's first Hindu PM, the first of Asian heritage and the youngest for more than 200 years when he was appointed by Charles at Buckingham Palace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Joe Biden were among the first world leaders Mr Sunak spoke to on Tuesday evening. He also made time to speak with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, in contrast with Ms Truss. Truss had used her valedictory speech to stress the need to be 'bold' as she defended her tax-cutting ideals despite being forced to reverse most of her policies. She made no apologies for her mini-budget and stressed the need for lower taxes, before wishing Sunak 'every success, for the good of our country'. After Sunak was pictured shaking the King's hand during a formal handover of power in which the monarch was 'graciously pleased to accept' Truss's resignation, he sought to explain why he was now Prime Minister. 'Right now our country is facing a profound economic crisis,' he warned, blaming the lingering aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic and Vladimir Putin's destabilising war in Ukraine. He vowed to place 'economic stability and confidence at the heart of this Government's agenda', after the financial chaos triggered by Truss. 'This will mean difficult decisions to come,' he said, but he promised to repeat the 'compassion' he showed during the coronavirus pandemic. Sunak entered Downing Street after winning the swift Conservative leadership contest on Monday, with rivals Johnson and Mordaunt pulling their campaigns before a single vote was cast. Johnson, who had plotted a comeback less than two months after he resigned following a series of scandals, offered his 'congratulations' to Sunak just after his speech ended. He welcomed the 'historic day' and said 'this is the moment for every Conservative to give our new PM their full and wholehearted support'. As he became the third prime minister based on the mandate won by Johnson in the 2019 general election, Sunak vowed to deliver on the last manifesto's promises. 'All I can say is that I am not daunted. I know the high office I have accepted and I hope to live up to its demands,' he said. Rishi takes to the world stage as he receives calls from Biden and Zelensky on first night in charge – vowing to make defeating Putin and boosting the Special Relationship key aims By Stewart Carr For Mailonline Rishi Sunak stepped up to the international stage last night taking calls from world leaders as he laid down the foundations for his premiership. The new PM had earlier hit headlines with a dramatic cabinet reshuffle that saw him displace key Truss allies while retaining Jeremy Hunt as Chancellor and James Cleverly as Foreign Secretary and reappointing Suella Braverman to the Home Office. Hours after his cabinet reshuffle, Mr Sunak took a call from US president Joe Biden and discussed the war in Ukraine, as the US President called the UK his country's 'closest ally'. The new Prime Minister will meet Joe Biden in the coming weeks at the G20 summit in Indonesia. Sunak reiterated the special relationship between the UK and US by referring to the two countries 'the closest of allies' in an Instagram post, alongside a picture of himself taking the call. The PM also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and pledged the UK would continue to provide support as it defends itself from Russian aggression. Yesterday, the PM received congratulatory messages from a host of other world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Gloria Meloni, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi But not all reactions were quite as welcoming, as Russia acknowledged the new Prime Minister in the frostiest of terms. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that in Moscow, 'we do not see any preconditions, grounds, or hope that in the foreseeable future there will be any positive changes' in the relationship between the United Kingdom and Russia. A Downing Street spokesperson said that Mr Biden congratulated Mr Sunak on his appointment, adding that 'the leaders looked forward to working closely together'. Both of Sunak's predecessors Boris Johnson and Liz Truss had vocally promised full support to war-torn Ukraine and on Tuesday evening the new Prime Minister said the UK's support would be as 'strong as ever' under his leadership. Calling it a 'privilege' to speak to Mr Zelensky, who had earlier sent him congratulations, Mr Sunak tweeted: 'Both he and the Ukrainian people can count on the UK's continued solidarity and support. 'We will always stand with Ukraine.' Mr Zelensky, in a tweet, called it an 'excellent conversation' with the pair agreeing to 'write a new chapter' in relations between the two countries. Speaking outside Number 10 on Tuesday, the new Prime Minister referenced Russia's invasion of Ukraine twice, saying: 'Putin's war in Ukraine has destabilised energy markets and supply chains the world over.' In recent days, Biden appeared to publicly criticise short-lived PM Liz Truss's doomed economic strategy, in a rare intervention by the US President. Relations between the two countries have also been somewhat strained in recent years amid ongoing UK-EU tensions over post-Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland, with White House concerns over the impact on peace in the region. The issue appears to have come up in the call, according to details released by Downing Street, as well as the war in Ukraine and the rising power of China. President Zelensky congratulated the Prime Minister on his appointment and wished him a happy Diwali. The Prime Minister thanked him and said he hoped they would see each other in person soon.' In his congratulatory message to Mr Sunak earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron also said the two countries would work together to tackle the challenge of the war in Ukraine. Ms Truss was widely criticised after she declined to say whether Mr Macron was a 'friend or foe' when asked during the previous Tory leadership contest. Mr Macron later suggested it was a 'problem' if Britain could not call itself a friend of France. A Downing Street spokesperson said: 'President Biden congratulated the Prime Minister on his appointment and the leaders looked forward to working closely together. 'President Biden said that the UK remains America's closest ally, and the Prime Minister agreed on the huge strength of the relationship. 'The leaders discussed the extent of UK-US cooperation, both bilaterally and in regions such as the Indo-Pacific where the AUKUS pact forms part of our efforts to enhance stability and counter China's malign influence. 'They reflected on the leading role our countries are playing in supporting the people of Ukraine and ensuring Putin fails in this war. 'The Prime Minister and President Biden also agreed on the need to ensure the people of Northern Ireland have security and prosperity through preserving the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. 'The leaders looked forward to meeting in person at the upcoming G20 Summit in Indonesia.' The spokesperson added that Sunak's call with Zelensky had been 'to underline the United Kingdom's steadfast support for Ukraine'. 'The Prime Minister said the United Kingdom's support for Ukraine would be as strong as ever under his premiership, and President Zelensky could count on his Government to stand in continued solidarity. 'The Prime Minister also noted the importance of the International Atomic Energy Agency's work in Ukraine to ensure nuclear safety and provide transparency around any disinformation. 'Both leaders agreed on the need to continue to place pressure on Putin's barbaric regime through continued economic sanctions.' Ms Truss eventually hailed the French President as a friend when the pair met at the first summit of the European Political Community in Prague. In his message to Mr Sunak, Mr Macron tweeted: 'Congratulations to Rishi Sunak, who has become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. 'Together we will continue working to tackle the challenges of the moment, including the war in Ukraine and its many consequences for Europe and the world.' The new PM received a host of congratulations from other world leaders during his first day in office. From Italy, newly-installed Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that she was 'eager to cooperate with (Sunak) and his cabinet on the common challenges, standing for our shared values of freedom and democracy.' 'I look forward to our further cooperation and partnership in NATO and (the) G7 as close friends,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz tweeted. Maros Sefcovic, the European Union's point man on post-Brexit ties with Britain, said that 'a positive EU-UK relationship is of strategic importance'. He vowed to work towards 'a partnership in full respect of our agreements' - including the contentious issue of British province Northern Ireland's land border with EU-member Ireland. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said that 'in these testing times for our continent, we count on a strong relationship with the UK to defend our common values'. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said that with Sunak 'as the first Prime Minister of British-Asian descent and the youngest in about 200 years, these milestones will be especially inspiring for young people' in the Commonwealth, the association mostly of former British colonies. 'We seek to deepen our partnership with Britain' to address challenges including terrorism, food insecurity, energy and climate change, Buhari added. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not wait for Sunak to be officially appointed, sending congratulations via Twitter on Monday. 'As you become UK PM, I look forward to working closely together on global issues,' Modi wrote. 'Special Diwali wishes to the 'living bridge' of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership,' he added. Sunak is married to an Indian, Akshata Murty, the daughter of the co-founder of IT giant Infosys."

Alan Mahon, founder and CEO of Brewgooder, said rising production costs driven by the conflict in Ukraine and soaring inflation had created a 'perfect storm' for the industry. Mr Mahon said the price of raw ingredients including wheat and barley are rising more than the rate of inflation. And he said other key 'unseen' materials, such as energy and gas, have hit eye-watering levels, with carbon dioxide costing 3,000 per cent more than it did this time last year. Mr Mahon warned £7 for a pint could become norm in big cities. Glasgow based Brewgooder's customers include Morrisons, Asda, and the Coop, as well as on-trade customer such as the Gleneagles Hotel. Mr Mahon said: 'I used to think ""perfect storm"" was a cliche until we found ourselves slap bang in the middle of what the industry is facing right now. 'It is perhaps a greater long-term challenge than that created by rolling covid lockdowns. 'On the brewery side, raw material prices for the likes of wheat and barley are rising faster than the average rate of inflation, and consumers can perhaps understand that. 'What is less visible but equally as important is the things that don't often come to drinkers mind when they think of what goes into beer - such as the eye-watering explosion in carbon dioxide prices which is 3000 per cent higher than 12 months ago, on top of soaring energy prices, a pain everyone is feeling right now. 'From what we are seeing, the pressures on the industry with cost price inflation challenges and the Chancellor's scrapping of the alcohol duty freeze might make a £7 pint the norm rather than the exception in many places - particularly in bigger cities. 'This is bound to make a pint a relative luxury for a lot of people, something we should all be concerned about and force us all to take stock of the challenges facing the beer industry. 'Footfall to the on-trade has definitely been one of the biggest challenges facing the industry, with consumers having to make difficult choices on where to spend their money. 'A potential bright spot for the industry might be the winter World Cup rolling into the Christmas season providing a double shot in the arm for venues. 'It is therefore vital the industry and brewers continue to work hard on ensuring that the pub environment is something that cannot simply be re-created at home - whether that be through beers only available in the pub, or in encouraging people to socialise and meet friends for a drink/something to eat through various marketing or promotional platforms. 'The beer and pub trade is a resilient industry, one that's full of passionate people who will dig deep during the challenges to come. 'It's important for the public and the government to recognise their efforts with support in the coming few months.'"
2022-10-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11354981/Biden-Sunak-reaffirm-special-relationship-agreed-Ukraine-support-White-House.html,Still special! Biden has spoken with UK's new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to reaffirm the two countries' relationship as they agreed to work together to support Ukraine and stand up to China,"U.S. President Joe Biden and new British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have reaffirmed their two countries' 'special relationship' and agreed on the importance of supporting Ukraine. The affirmation came as the pair shared a phone call yesterday in which they also agreed on the importance of working together to address the challenges posed by China and to secure sustainable and affordable energy resources, a White House statement said. They also discussed their commitment to the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, it said, something which Biden has previously expressed concern over and has been insistent that Britain do nothing that could endanger a quarter century of peace in Northern Ireland. Their conversation was held just a day after Biden stumbled over Sunak's name during a speech congratulating the new Prime Minister. The President, speaking at a White House event to mark the Indian holiday of Diwali on Monday, made several failed attempts at Sunak's name before calling him 'Rashee Sanook' - the latest in a long line of gaffes that will only fuel widespread speculation of his declining mental state. Sunak, a 42-year-old multimillionaire former hedge fund boss, yesterday became the country's youngest leader in modern times and its third in less than two months as his Conservative Party endures a period of considerable turmoil. In his speech on Monday, Biden said: 'And whether it's the United Kingdom, where just today, we've got news that [Rishi Sunak] is now the prime minister. 'As my brother would say, ''go figure''!' he exclaimed, to a round of laughs from the audience. 'And the Conservative Party, expected to become the Prime Minister, I think, tomorrow when he goes to see the King. 'Pretty astounding. A groundbreaking milestone. And it matters, it matters.' However, an opposition member of Parliament in Britain spoke out on Twitter against Sunak, claiming his appointment is 'not a win for Asian representation' because of his vast personal wealth. Nadia Whittome, a Labour party MP and member of the Socialist Campaign Group, told her followers that Britain's new leader is 'not on your side.' 'Rishi Sunak as Prime Minister isn't a win for Asian representation,' the 26-year-old, who also has Indian roots, tweeted yesterday. 'He's a multimillionaire who, as chancellor, cut taxes on bank profits while overseeing the biggest drop in living standards since 1956. 'Black, white or Asian: if you work for a living, he is not on your side.' Her tweet was later deleted after she was contacted by Labour headquarters and told to remove it, the Daily Telegraph reported. With his victory in the Conservative party leadership race coming on Diwali, Sunak became the UK's first-ever Hindu prime minister, the first of Asian heritage and the youngest to take up the mantle in more than two centuries at the age of 42. Sunak ascends to Downing Street after previous the prime minister, Liz Truss, resigned having spent just 45 days in office. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Sunak on Twitter and wrote: 'Special Diwali wishes to ""living bridge"" of UK Indians as we transform historic ties into modern partnership.' Sunak has previously spoken about how his Asian identity matters to him, telling the BBC: 'I'm a first generation immigrant. My parents emigrated here, so you've got this generation of people who are born here, their parents were not born here, and they've come to this country to make a life.' The UK's first – and only other – minority prime minister was Benjamin Disraeli, who was Jewish, in 1874."
2022-10-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11354933/Financial-publication-make-family-slur-against-Rishi-Sunak.html,Russian newspaper brands Rishi Britain’s ‘premier from the slums’: Financial publication make family slur against man they dub ‘first black head of the British government’,"Britain's newly-appointed Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been called the 'premier from the slums' by a Russian newspaper. The financial publication Kommersant used the slur against the prime minister, 42, as well as dubbing him the 'first black head of the British government' - a term that is often used to refer to someone who is 'dark-skinned'. Kommersant used sixteen images to document Rishi's rise to power, and in the first wrote: 'Both of Rishi Sunak's grandfathers are Punjabis from the most disadvantaged regions of British India.' Sunak's paternal grandparents - Ramdas and Suhag - were born in Gujranwala, in what was then British India but is now Pakistan. Little is known about their upbringing but the couple are unlikely to have grown up wealthy. At some point they relocated to Tanzania to small community of Punjabi Indians. Living in the same region - in what was then the nation of Tanganyika - were Rishi's maternal grandparents Raghubir, an immigrant, and Sraksha, who was born locally. In the 1960s, Sraksha sold her wedding jewellery to move to the UK where she got a job as a book-keeper and saved up enough to move the rest of the family - including Rishi's parents Yashvir and Usha - to Britain. Yashvir and Usha settled in Southampton where he worked as an NHS GP and she ran a pharmacy, which was where RIshi was born in 1980. The publication put out the images on their website and social media after Sunak was elected. It chronicled his journey into politics from the age of 17, when he wrote his first political manifesto. And the paper also wrote of the jobs he had before he came a politician in 2015. The article also published images of Sunak and his wife and discussed the politicians whom he has supported throughout his career. Kommersant also wrote of Sunak's riches, as the new leader and his wife take the position of 222nd richest in the world, with a combined fortune of 730 million. The use of the slurs to describe Sunak comes after Russia, who is in an ongoing war with Ukraine, said there is 'no hope' of an ease in tensions under the new leader. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the appointment of the former chancellor will do little to repair the damaged diplomatic relationship caused by Vladimir Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine. However, Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the new leader, after forging a strong friendship with Boris Johnson who was unwavering in his support of Kyiv. Peskov said yesterday: 'At the moment, we do not see any preconditions, grounds, or hope that in the foreseeable future there will be any positive changes. 'Russia maintains its openness and readiness to discuss the most difficult issues at the negotiating table. But not to the detriment of its own interests.' Mr Zelensky instead congratulated Mr Sunak and said it was a chance to strengthen ties even further with a key military ally. The Ukrainian President said: 'Congratulations to Rishi Sunak on taking office as British Prime Minister!' 'I wish you too successfully overcome all the challenges facing British society and the whole world today. 'I'm ready to continue strengthening the Ukrainian-British strategic partnership together!' the Ukrainian leader added. Emmanuel Macron also joined in with the chorus of congratulations from world leaders for the new PM. The French President had a tricky relationship with Mr Johnson and Liz Truss, who refused to say whether he was a 'friend or foe'. Mr Macron said yesterday: 'Congratulations to Rishi Sunak... together we will continue working to tackle the challenges of the moment, including the war in Ukraine and its many consequences for Europe and the world.' Elsewhere in Europe, German chancellor Olaf Scholz congratulated Mr Sunak after he became Britain's third prime minister this year, and vowed to continue working closely with London. 'I look forward to our further cooperation and partnership in NATO and G7 as close friends,' Mr Scholz tweeted. From Italy, newly installed Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that she was 'eager to cooperate with [Mr Sunak] and his Cabinet on the common challenges, standing for our shared values of freedom and democracy.' Maros Sefcovic, the European Union's pointman on post-Brexit ties with Britain, said that 'a positive EU-UK relationship is of strategic importance'. He vowed to work towards 'a partnership in full respect of our agreements' – including the contentious issue of British province Northern Ireland's land border with EU-member Ireland. Across the Irish Sea, leaders welcomed the news but cautioned that Sunak must move quickly to resolve an impasse on the Northern Ireland protocol. Prime minister Micheal Martin called on Mr Sunak to move quickly to start substantive engagement with the European Union on post-Brexit trade rules governing Northern Ireland. He said in a statement: 'Building on work already under way, there is a real opportunity for the EU and UK to find jointly agreed solutions on the issues pertaining to the [Northern Ireland] Protocol, and I urge Prime Minister Sunak to move quickly to substantive engagement with the EU on that basis.' Ireland's deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar, who is due to take over as prime minister in December, said he was encouraged by the pragmatism and lack of 'magical thinking' demonstrated by Mr Sunak. Mr Varadkar, who was a key player in trade talks between Britain and the European Union during an earlier stint as prime minister, said however that Ireland would be realistic about Mr Sunak's history as a Brexit supporter. 'I think he has demonstrated during his period as chancellor that he did have a real understanding of the economy and how it works ... and a real concern for businesses and jobs,' he said of Sunak at a press briefing today. 'And I think he has probably demonstrated a lot of pragmatism and less of the magical thinking that we perhaps have seen from some British politicians and I think that is encouraging,' he said. Dublin, however, needs to be realistic in its expectations of a breakthrough due to Sunak's history as an early supporter of Brexit, Mr Varadkar said. Joe Biden also hailed the appointment of Britain's first non-white prime minister as a 'groundbreaking milestone,' but failed to pronounce his name correctly in an embarrassing gaffe. The US President stumbled over Mr Sunak's name, making several failed attempts before calling him 'Rashee Sanook'. In his speech, Mr Biden said: 'And whether it's the United Kingdom, where just today, we've got news that [Rishi Sunak] is now the prime minister. 'As my brother would say, ''go figure!""' he exclaimed, to a round of laughs from the audience. 'And the Conservative Party, expected to become the Prime Minister, I think, tomorrow when he goes to see the King. 'Pretty astounding. A groundbreaking milestone. And it matters, it matters.' Indian prime minister Narendra Modi did not wait for Sunak to be officially appointed, sending congratulations via Twitter on Monday. 'As you become UK PM, I look forward to working closely together on global issues,' Mr Modi wrote. 'Special Diwali wishes to the ""living bridge"" of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership,' he added. Mr Sunak is married to an Indian, Akshata Murty, the daughter of the co-founder of IT giant Infosys. Elsewhere, the president of Rishi Sunak's home temple in Southampton said the UK is undergoing its own 'Barack Obama' moment with him becoming PM. Sanjay Chandarana, president of the Vedic Society Temple - which Mr Sunak's grandfather co-founded 50 years ago - also said his elevation to Prime Minister meant more fireworks would be needed for Diwali celebrations on the 24th October and that Mr Sunak would be an 'inspiration for youngsters'. Parliamentarian Raghav Chadha tweeted on Monday: 'Today, as India celebrates Diwali in its 75th year as an independent nation, the UK gets an Indian-origin Prime Minister. History comes full circle.' With his victory coming on Diwali, Mr Sunak will be the UK's first Hindu prime minister, the first of Asian heritage, and the youngest for more than 200 years at the age of 42. 'It is a moment of pride for India that the country which ruled us for many years has now a prime minister of Indian heritage,' said Manoj Garg, a New Delhi businessman. Mr Sunak will be the first person of colour to become prime minister, an accomplishment reflecting that of Kamala Harris, a woman of Indian heritage who became US vice president last year. Former Bihar state government chief secretary Dr M.A. Ibrahimi tweeted: 'Rishi Sunak is now set to be elected leader of Conservative Party to become UK PM. All Indians are proud of his achievement.' Tory former Cabinet minister Sajid Javid said Rishi Sunak becoming the first prime minister of Asian heritage is 'something we can all celebrate'. 'I've always believed the UK is the most successful multiracial democracy on earth - and I think this takes it to a new level,' he told ITV's Peston. 'This is beyond politics and it's something we can all celebrate.' Mr Chandarana, 41, who works at an investment bank in London, said: 'We are going to need more fireworks now, 'Rishi becoming prime minister is Great Britain's Barack Obama moment,' he said. 'This will be a proud moment for everyone who is Hindu. We are no longer just a community that is not part of the mainstream, we are part of the mainstream.' Citizen TV in Kenya also drew comparisons with Obama's rise to the White House. Indian TV channels celebrated Sunak's victory, with New Delhi Television announcing 'Indian son rises over the empire'. India Today news channel took a jibe at the UK's economic and political turbulence, using the Hindi term for someone of Indian background: 'Battered Britain gets 'desi' big boss.' Some said Mr Sunak's selection was particularly special for the country with its recent celebration of 75 years of independence from British colonial rule. Others celebrated Mr Sunak as a 'proud Hindu', saying he did not shy away from embracing his faith and Indian culture. They shared videos on Twitter showing Mr Sunak taking his oath of allegiance in 2020 on the Hindu holy book Bhagvad Gita. Other videos shared on Twitter showed Mr Sunak praying to a cow, considered holy by Hindus, when he was running for Britain's top job for the first time in August."
2022-10-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11355727/Rishi-Sunak-DELAY-Halloween-budget-bonnet-nations-finances.html,Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt's first budget is DELAYED so 'difficult decisions' can be made and 'stability' restored amid fears of spending cuts to plug to £40bn black hole in nation's finances,"Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt today postponed a key financial announcement due to take place on Halloween to give them more time to 'get under the bonnet' of the nation's broken finances. The fiscal statement due to be held on October 31 will now be held on November 17, they told the new look Cabinet this morning. It came as the new Prime Minister prepared for his first face-off with Labour's Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions. The statement was originally set for November 23 by former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, but he was forced to bring it forward amid economic turmoil created by last month's mini-Budget. The markets have been calmed by the replacement of Mr Kwarteng and Liz Truss in the top jobs, potentially giving the new team more time to play with. But they are facing a serious task of how to find savings to fill in a black hole in the public coffers of up to £40billion. Mr Hunt said today that he had discussed the plan last night with the Bank of England, after Kwarteng left Andrew Bailey out of the loop. Mr Hunt told broadcasters: 'I want to confirm that it will demonstrate debt falling over the medium term which is really important for people to understand. 'But it's also extremely important that that statement is based on the most accurate possible economic forecasts and forecasts of public finances. 'And for that reason the Prime Minister and I have decided it is prudent to make that statement on November 17 when it will be upgraded to a full autumn statement.' Rishi Sunak stepped up to the international stage last night taking calls from world leaders as he laid down the foundations for his premiership. The new PM had earlier hit headlines with a dramatic cabinet reshuffle that saw him displace key Truss allies while retaining Jeremy Hunt as Chancellor and James Cleverly as Foreign Secretary and reappointing Suella Braverman to the Home Office. Hours after his cabinet reshuffle, Mr Sunak took a call from US president Joe Biden and discussed the war in Ukraine, as the US President called the UK his country's 'closest ally'. This was despite the president earlier mispronouncing the PM's name as 'Rashee Sanook' in his congratulatory speech. The new Prime Minister will meet Joe Biden in the coming weeks at the G20 summit in Indonesia. Sunak reiterated the 'special relationship' between the UK and US by referring to the two countries 'the closest of allies' in an Instagram post, alongside a picture of himself taking the call. The PM also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and pledged the UK would continue to provide support as it defends itself from Russian aggression. Zelensky in turn invited Sunak to visit Ukraine. Yesterday, the PM received congratulatory messages from a host of other world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Gloria Meloni, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi But not all reactions were quite as welcoming, as Russia acknowledged the new Prime Minister in the frostiest of terms. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that in Moscow, 'we do not see any preconditions, grounds, or hope that in the foreseeable future there will be any positive changes' in the relationship between the United Kingdom and Russia. In a statement, a No10 spokeswoman said: 'The Prime Minister and the Chancellor agreed that the fiscal event would now take place on the November 17, and would be an Autumn Statement. 'He (the chancellor) said it is important to reach the right decisions and there is time for those decisions to be confirmed with Cabinet. 'The Autumn Statement will set out how we will put public finances on a sustainable footing and get debt falling in the medium term and will be accompanied by a full forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility. It came as the head of the International Monetary Fund backed Mr Sunak to steer Britain towards fiscal sustainability. Kristalina Georgieva said today he was right to warn the public of difficult decisions ahead and welcomed what she said was Sunak's clarity and constructive attitude that she knew from his time as finance minister. She expects to speak to the recently appointed finance minister Jeremy Hunt in coming days. 'The new prime minister comes with a platform that he has shaped during his days as a chancellor, and it is one of being very prudent in bringing fiscal discipline in the UK,' she said in Berlin. 'I listened carefully to him talking to the British people, and this is a message that should resonate across the world. These are tough times, and tough times require tough decisions.' Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: 'This delay risks leaving mortgage borrowers, pensioners and struggling families under a damaging cloud of uncertainty. 'Rishi Sunak must confirm now that benefits and pensions will be up-rated in line with inflation, and there will be no cuts to our NHS and other crucial public services.' Foreign Secretary James Cleverly had earlier hinted this morning that a delay could occur. He told BBC Breakfast: 'Obviously the date of that fiscal statement was originally set with no expectation of a change of prime minister. We've now had a change of prime minister. 'Thankfully that's happened very quickly, because nobody wants uncertainty. 'But the Prime Minister was appointed less than 24 hours ago. He is in the process of forming a Government. He will want some time with his Chancellor to make sure that the fiscal statement matches his priorities. 'Now, I don't know whether that means that date is going to slip but, as you suggested, the current date is only a couple of days away. 'The Prime Minister and the Chancellor know they need to work quickly on this but they also want to get it right, so we'll see what happens to that date.' When it was put to him that a delay would bring more uncertainty, Mr Cleverly said that 'a short delay, in order to make sure that we get this right, I think that is not necessarily a bad thing at all'. Last night the new PM plunged the knife in on Liz Truss with a pledge to 'fix' her 'mistakes' and win back the public's 'trust'. The incoming premier addressed the nation from Downing Street after being asked to form a government by King Charles in the traditional 'kissing hands' ceremony at Buckingham Palace. In a sombre speech, he warned of 'difficult' decisions to deal with the 'profound economic crisis' facing the country, saying he 'understood' that Britons were suffering. Rebutting jibes that he is too wealthy to identify with the struggles of ordinary people, he said: 'I fully understand how hard things are.' In a swipe at Boris Johnson, who dramatically pulled out of the Tory leadership battle on Sunday night, Mr Sunak said the 'mandate' from the 2019 election did not belong to any individual. He also stressed his government will have 'integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level'. Mr Sunak then embarked on a Cabinet reshuffle, with Jacob Rees-Mogg and Brandon Lewis early casualties. A slew of further Truss appointments followed them out the door, including some who had backed him for the leadership. They included work and pensions secretary Chloe Smith, education secretary Kit Malthouse and environment secretary Ranil Jayawardena. Meanwhile Tory Party chairman Jake Berry, a close ally of Boris Johnson, also quit. The PM will face his first Commons appearance as Prime Minister at lunchtime, as he begins the gruelling task of uniting his party and restoring the UK's economic credibility. The new Prime Minister will square off against Sir Keir Starmer later, fresh from appointing a new Cabinet that he hopes will bring a measure of political stability to the country. It comes after another momentous day in British politics that saw Mr Sunak cull nearly a dozen of Ms Truss's top-tier ministers, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, while reviving the careers of a host of big names, including Suella Braverman, Dominic Raab and Michael Gove. Tory MP Johnny Mercer will return to the role of Veterans' Affairs Minister just a month after his wife called Liz Truss an imbecile and compared her to a Muppet for axing him. The Plymouth Moor View MP, 41, arrived at No10 Downing Street tonight as Rishi Sunak resurrected Suella Braverman, Dominic Raab and Michael Gove to the Cabinet while keeping Jeremy Hunt on as Chancellor. The news of his reappointment was announced on No10's social media page and his wife, Felicity Cornelius-Mercer, tweeted: 'So proud of him and huge thanks to the creators and signers of the petition too. 'I wasn't sure that he would want the front bench again; it was so bruising last time but ultimately he couldn't say no for Veterans causes.' The former British Army officer previously revealed that Ms Truss laughed at him when she sacked him as Veterans Minister, adding that the move was a 'gut punch' that sent him into depression. As soon as she took office on September 6, Ms Truss removed him from his post and folded his responsibility for veteran care into James Heappey's role as Defence Minister. 'When this happened it was such a gut punch. I remember Liz kind of laughing while she did it,' Mr Mercer said in an interview for the Men's Health Talking Heads series by Alastair Campbell. Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday will be the first test of how unified the party is behind its new leader, after Mr Sunak used his first public address on Tuesday to brace the country for 'difficult decisions' as he criticised much of the legacy left behind by Liz Truss's brief tenure. 'Some mistakes were made. Not born of ill will or bad intentions - quite the opposite in fact. But mistakes nonetheless,' he said. 'I've been elected as leader of my party and your Prime Minister in part to fix them - and that work begins immediately.' Volodymyr Zelensky and Joe Biden were among the first world leaders Mr Sunak spoke to on Tuesday evening, as he told the Ukrainian president that the UK's support for the war-torn country would be as 'strong as ever under his premiership'. He also made time to speak with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, in a stark contrast with Ms Truss. It is expected that the first meeting of Mr Sunak's new-look Cabinet could come as soon as Wednesday morning, in what would amount to a gathering of Sunak allies, former Truss backers and figures too from the right-wing of the party. A No 10 source said that the new Cabinet 'brings the talents of the party together' and that it reflects a 'unified party'. Mr Raab, who was among several Sunak loyalists rewarded with key roles, was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and won a return to Justice Secretary. Elsewhere, Mark Harper was handed the role of Transport Secretary, while former Education Secretary Sir Gavin Williamson returned to Government as minister without portfolio in the Cabinet Office. Opponents and rivals took some spots too, with Penny Mordaunt kept in place as Commons leader while Truss ally Therese Coffey became Environment Secretary. There was also a return to his old role of Levelling Up Secretary for Michael Gove, while Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Foreign Secretary James Cleverly both kept their jobs. The most controversial appointment however came in the return of Suella Braverman to Home Secretary, only days after she dramatically quit the Government after being accused of breaching the ministerial code. Mr Sunak, who earlier promised that his new Government would be one of 'integrity', immediately faced questions about the decision to re-hire Ms Braverman as Labour accused the new PM of 'putting party before country'. Rishi Sunak spoke to the first ministers of Scotland and Wales on Tuesday evening in constructive talks, emphasising their 'duty' to work together in order to respond to the UK's 'shared challenges'. In a marked contrast to predecessor Liz Truss, Mr Sunak spoke to Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford following the conclusion of his cabinet reshuffle. Ms Truss is not believed to have spoken to either leader about policy, sharing only a few words with Ms Sturgeon at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. During the summer leadership election, Ms Truss came under fire for saying she would 'ignore' Ms Sturgeon. Following the conversation last night, Mr Sunak said it was 'good to speak to' Mr Drakeford and Ms Sturgeon. He tweeted: 'I emphasised our duty to work closely together to respond to the shared challenges we face, so that collectively we can deliver for the people of the United Kingdom.' Ms Sturgeon said the call had been 'constructive', tweeting: 'I expressed hope that we will build a UK/Scottish Government relationship based on mutual respect - including for mandates - and my fear that further austerity will do real damage to people and public services. 'I look forward to further engagement soon.' Following the call, a Scottish Government spokesperson said Ms Sturgeon congratulated Mr Sunak on his appointment and wished him well. 'She expressed her hope that political differences notwithstanding, they would build a constructive working relationship,' the spokesperson said. 'She made clear that the Scottish Government would do everything possible to establish such a constructive relationship but stressed that this must be built on mutual respect.' Ms Sturgeon said the UK Government should 'address the pressure' and pain being felt by people and businesses as a result of other economic pressures and further austerity could exacerbate the problems. It is understood Mr Sunak 'assured' Ms Sturgeon the UK Government would engage with the devolved governments ahead of the Chancellor's forthcoming budget statement. Mr Drakeford said he took the opportunity to congratulate Mr Sunak on his appointment as prime minister. The Welsh Labour leader tweeted: 'Tonight, I spoke to the Prime Minister. 'A chance to congratulate the Prime Minister and discuss the importance of working together as four nations to address the urgent challenges we face as a United Kingdom.' Earlier this month, Ms Sturgeon told the BBC's political editor Chris Mason she had not had a conversation with former prime minister Liz Truss since she was appointed on September 6, other than 'an exchange or two' at events following the death of the Queen. 'It's quite absurd in many ways. When I became First Minister, David Cameron was prime minister and I think we spoke on the phone the first night I became First Minister,' she said. 'I spoke on the phone to Theresa May within a day or two of her becoming prime minister, same with Boris Johnson actually. 'I have deep political differences with all of these politicians, but we have a duty to work together constructively.' Welsh government minister Jane Hutt said Ms Truss had not contacted Mr Drakeford during her brief spell in office. DOMINIC RAAB Justice Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister Mr Raab's stint on the backbenches following Liz Truss's reshuffle was a brief one, having been rewarded for his loyalty to Rishi Sunak with a return to Government. The karate blackbelt and former Foreign Office lawyer will be given an opportunity to pick up where he left off under Boris Johnson, as Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary. JEREMY HUNT Chancellor of the Exchequer A vastly experienced minister across the many departments, Mr Hunt replaced Kwasi Kwarteng as Chancellor this month. He put in a measured performance from the Commons despatch box as he tore up Miss Truss's tax-cutting plans, calming the markets. Mr Hunt, the longest-serving health secretary in British political history, keeps his job and remains in No 11 Downing Street. SUELLA BRAVERMAN Home Secretary Mrs Braverman is a leading figure on the Right of the party, and came out in support of Rishi Sunak during the latest leadership contest. She returns as Home Secretary, a week after she was forced out of Government for breaking the ministerial code after emailing a sensitive document from a personal account. Often outspoken, she recently blamed eco-protests across the country on 'the Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati'. JAMES CLEVERLY Foreign Secretary Mr Cleverly retains his job as Foreign Secretary – one of the Great Offices of State – despite being an old ally of Boris Johnson. In fact, Mr Cleverly publicly endorsed Mr Johnson for PM in the latest leadership race and had previously been a staunch backer of Liz Truss. BEN WALLACE Defence Secretary Retaining former soldier Mr Wallace as Defence Secretary is likely to be an attempt to soothe the military community amid growing unease over defence spending. The Sandhurst graduate has been in post for more than three years, making him one of the longest-serving ministers to hold the same position. STEVE BARCLAY Health Secretary Mr Barclay returns to his job in Government having previously been sacked as Health Secretary as part of Liz Truss's reshuffle. He previously held the role for two months and was memorably interrupted by a heckler while giving an interview outside a hospital. Mr Barclay worked with Rishi Sunak at the Treasury during the pandemic. He will be expected to get a grip on NHS spending. NADHIM ZAHAWI Minister Without Portfolio Mr Zahawi earned a reputation during the pandemic as a safe pair of hands and skilled media performer. But the former vaccine minister's magic touch well and truly deserted him during the two recent Tory leadership races after a series of loyalty flip-flops. OLIVER DOWDEN Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Mr Dowden now holds the most senior Cabinet position after the PM. The ex-Culture Secretary has been rewarded for his unwavering support during the leadership races. He quit as party chairman after taking responsibility for the Tories' disastrous by-election defeats in two seats in the summer. GRANT SHAPPS Business Secretary Mr Shapps is another to have served across multiple government departments, most recently as Home Secretary less than a week ago following the departure of Suella Braverman. He was a prominent figure during the pandemic as transport secretary. GILLIAN KEEGAN Education Secretary Mrs Keegan is the fifth person this year to hold the position of Education Secretary. She spent a year as health minister before moving to the Foreign Office as part of Liz Truss's doomed premiership. She was forced to apologise earlier this year for an 'error of judgment' after continuing a meeting with grieving fathers despite testing positive for Covid part- way through. PENNY MORDAUNT Commons Leader In a major humiliation, there was no big promotion for Miss Mordaunt, the former magician's assistant who holds on to her position as Leader of the House of Commons. She stood against Mr Sunak for the leadership this weekend, but pulled out at the last moment when it became clear she did not have the backing of enough MPs. She appears to have paid the price for her failure to strike a deal with her rival. MEL STRIDE Work and Pensions Secretary Mr Stride is well known to Rishi Sunak, having managed his campaign to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. He publicly criticised Liz Truss's ill-fated mini-Budget, saying it had put the Conservative Party's reputation for managing the economy in jeopardy. The chairman of the Treasury Select Committee is a former president of the Oxford Union. THERESE COFFEY Environment Secretary A big demotion on the face of it for ex-health secretary Miss Coffey, though the fact she remains in Government despite her support of Liz Truss suggests the PM was keen to appease his predecessor's followers. The self-confessed karaoke fan admitted she was 'not the role model' when it came to her own health after being questioned about her lifestyle. She left Downing Street yesterday by announcing she was 'going home to Defra' – a department which she served in for three years from 2016. SIMON HART Chief Whip The former Welsh Secretary is not exactly a household name. But he takes on one of the most significant roles in Government, responsible for ensuring discipline within the Conservative Parliamentary Party.

2022-10-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11356165/Afghan-commandos-trained-Allied-forces-recruited-RUSSIA-fight-Ukraine.html,Afghan commandos trained by Allied forces are being recruited by RUSSIA to fight in Ukraine after they were abandoned by the West when country fell to the Taliban,"Afghan commandos who had been trained by Allied forces to fight the Taliban are now being recruited by Russia to fight in Ukraine. Up to 30,000 members of the elite National Army Commando Corps were abandoned by the West when the country fell to the hardline Islamist group last year. Now, the US-trained light infantry force that fought side by side with allied troops for nearly 20 years could be joining Vladimir Putin's savage war effort. It is believed the shadowy Wagner Group is behind the recruitment drive, exploiting the jobless commandos. An ex-official told Foreign Policy: 'I am telling you [the recruiters] are Wagner Group. They are gathering people from all over. '[The Afghan commandos] would be better used by Western allies to fight alongside Ukrainians. They don't want to fight for the Russians; the Russians are the enemy. But what else are they going to do?' Many say they have been contacted via WhatsApp and Signal with offers to join the Russian 'foreign legion' in Ukraine. Senior military and security officials in Afghanistan fear as many as 10,000 soldiers could be tempted to join, because they have 'nothing to lose'. Only a few hundred senior officers were evacuated by the US in the dramatic withdrawal from Kabul in August 2021. Many Afghan soldiers fled to neighbouring countries and others went into hiding fearing reprisals from the Taliban for their loyalty to the collapsed government and the West. The commandos were honed by US Navy Seals and the British SAS, with a staggering £80billion spent on their training by the US. An ex-security official said their call-up to Ukraine would be a 'game-changer' in Putin's faltering war. Last year, Rep. Michael McCaul warned abandoning the commandos could prove to be a costly mistake by the US as they could be recruited for adversary armies. One Afghan ex-commando captain who is now in hiding said he helped his comrades connect with recruiters in Iran. They were flown to Tehran and then on to Russia where their phones are switched off and they carry out their mission 'secretly', he said. The 35-year-old said: 'We are very disappointed. For 18 years, shoulder to shoulder, we performed dangerous tasks with American, British, and Norwegian consultants. Now, I am in hiding. I am suffering every second.' Despite the appealing offer, many are reluctant to fight for a country which under the guise of the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and recently supported the Taliban. It is not the first time Russia has tapped up foreign powers to assist in its brutal campaign in Ukraine. Syrian mercenaries with years of experience fighting in their country's civil war were offered $1,000 a month for joining the war. The first group of at least 300 of Syrian fighters arrived in Russia in March to begin military training - and to return the favour to Moscow for helping Al-Assad in the civil war, the New York Times reported. Iranian troops have also been secretly sent to the frontline to help train Moscow's forces in how to operate kamikaze drones. Up to 50 Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) specialists have been sent to the southern and eastern front with hundreds of Shahed-136 drones. Iran has denied shipping drones or troops to be used against Ukraine But Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said: 'It's just indicative of the kinds of rhetoric that you hear coming from Iran and from Russia, trying to say that these are not Iranian drones when they clearly are. 'In many ways, these drones are used to, as psychological weapons used to create fear. 'But from an operational, from a strategic standpoint, it still doesn't change the fact that Russian forces on the ground continue to lose territory or at best hold ground.' But the recruitment of Afghan troops will serve as a major embarrassment to the US, after years and billions of dollars spent on their training. The Wagner Group, led by billionaire Yevgeny Prigozhin, has been linked to a string of killings, rapes and war crimes is known as Putin's private army which carries out his dirty work at an arm's length from the state. The army-for-hire, allegedly run by oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin - a close ally of the Russian president who is often dubbed 'Putin's chef' - was flown into Ukraine at the start of the war. It has previously been deployed to Africa, where it has carried out black ops operations that the Kremlin wants done while avoiding direct responsibility. They are currently engaged in a bloody battle with Ukraine in the eastern town of Bakhmut. Russia has officially denied the group's existence and its origins are murky, though it first appeared in 2014 in the Donbas. Initially, it was made up of only a few hundred Russian army veterans. They were ordered to assassinate Donbas leaders who were broadly supportive of Russia, but refused to follow instructions from the Kremlin. These assassinations were then blamed on Ukrainian forces, according to security experts. Wagner's founder is Dmitry Utkin, a shaven-headed former lieutenant colonel in Spetsnaz – Russia's special forces. He named it after his Spetsnaz code name. Utkin is seen as a neo-Nazi and was described by one Russian newspaper as having 'an appreciation of the aesthetic of the Third Reich', complete with tattoos of the Waffen-SS on his shoulder and an eagle on his chest. Mercenaries are illegal in Russia but Putin used Wagner to crush Syrian rebels and even awarded Utkin a medal. Eventually, however, the Wagner Group became so dangerous that even the Russian government refused to pay them. This led to Putin appointing oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin to control the group. The notorious Wagner Group, a private military company, has committed war crimes across the globe. They have now been tasked with assassinating Volodymyr Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian politicians. In December, the EU accused Wagner of 'serious human rights abuses in Ukraine, Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic, Sudan and Mozambique'. So what are some of the crimes the group has committed? Donbas, Ukraine: The Wagner group first appeared in 2014, to help Russia destabilise the Donbas region. Hundreds of members assassinated Donbas separist leaders who were not following Kremlin orders, with the killings blamed on Ukraine. Syria: Wagner was operating in Syria in 2015, where the Russians wanted to bolster the regime of dictator Bashar al-Assad. In 2017, Wagner employees tortured a deserter from the Syrian army. Sickening footage showed how they broke his legs with a sledgehammer and then crushed his chest, before cutting off his hands, his head and finally setting his corpse alight. The conduct of Wagner in Syria eventually became so bad that the Russian government refused to pay them, viewing them as dangerous cowboys. Wagner's founder and leader is Dmitry Utkin, a shaven-headed former lieutenant colonel in Spetsnaz – Russia's special forces. He is described as a neo-Nazi with 'an appreciation of the aesthetic of the Third Reich'. Utkin was sanctioned by the EU for ordering Bouta's killing. Central African Republic: Wagner mercenaries arrived in CAR to support President Faustin-Archange Touadéra against rebels in 2017. Wagner employees were accused by the UN and France of carrying out human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings of suspected rebels. There were also accusations of rape, robbery and torture against unarmed civilians. The United Nations is probing an alleged massacre during a joint operation by government forces and Wagner fighters. One military source told AFP that more than 50 people died, some in 'summary executions' In 2018, three Russian journalists reporting on Wagner's activities in CAR were ambushed and shot dead. Another Russian journalist investigating the group 'fell' to his death from his fifth floor flat. Sudan: Wagner mercenaries are believed to have trained government forces. The group also 'spreads disinformation on social media and engages in illicit activities connected to gold mining'. Mozambique: Wagner has supported the army in its fight against the Islamist militant insurgency in the north. They have been accused of burning down villages, terrorising civilians and killing women and children. However, the group retreated in the face of jihadists after around a dozen men were killed in gruesome attacks by ISIS terrorists. They were believed to have been killed in ambushes and botched operations. Mali: The Mali government employed 1,000 Wagner operatives in December. Russian operatives are believed to have helped train coup plotters who took over last year."
2022-10-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11356601/Putin-watches-military-prepare-Armageddon-simulated-massive-nuclear-strike.html,Russian propaganda video shows ‘Armageddon nukes’ being launched in drill watched over by Putin from his command centre lair as Kremlin despot taunts the West with simulation of ‘massive nuclear strike’ and nuclear sub deployment,"Vladimir Putin watched on today as Russia simulated a 'massive nuclear strike' with terrifying practice launches of ballistic and cruise missiles. The despot remotely observed the annual exercise, called 'Grom' or 'Thunder', which uses test launches to put Moscow's nuclear forces through their paces in a show of force to the West. Defence minister Sergei Shoigu reported to Putin that the drills were intended to simulate a retaliatory 'massive nuclear strike' by Russia. The drills involved the test-firing of a Yars land-based intercontinental ballistic missile from the northern Plesetsk launch site and the launch of a Sineva ICBM by a Russian nuclear submarine in the Barents Sea, just ten miles away from the shores of NATO member Norway. As part of the exercise, Tu-95 strategic bombers also launched cruise missiles at practice targets. Footage shows a large nuclear submarine in the water during the simulation that featured multiple drills. The large team were filmed making preparations for the simulation nuclear strikes and following launch protocol as they took part in the annual exercise. Clips also showed them flicking switches, running up stairs, speaking to each other on radios and monitoring the missiles before they were fired. As the test began, the Russian Sineva was seen soaring through the air from the water and disappearing into the clouds. Meanwhile the Yars later shot into the air after switches were flicked and a sound indicated that it was about to go off. After it was launched, a huge ball of flames engulfed the sky and left a cloud of smoke in its wake as a loud bang was also heard. The drills were monitored remotely by Putin, who also spoke to some of his military chiefs after the drills. The manoeuvres followed Putin's warning about his readiness to use 'all means available' to fend off attacks on Russia's territory in a reference to the country's nuclear arsenals. The Kremlin said that all tasks set for the exercise were fulfilled and all the missiles that were test-fired reached their designated targets. Such drills involving land, sea and air components have taken place on an annual basis to train the country's nuclear forces and demonstrate their readiness. The Biden administration said on Tuesday that Russia gave notice it intended to stage routine drills of its nuclear capabilities. The Pentagon and US State Department said Russia had complied with the terms of the last US-Russia arms control agreement in notifying Washington of the upcoming tests. The Russian exercise comes amid Moscow's warnings of a purported Ukrainian plot to detonate a radioactive device commonly known as a 'dirty bomb' in a false flag attack to blame Russia. Ukraine and its allies strongly reject the allegation, and today NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: 'This is absurd. Allies reject this blatantly false accusation, and Russia must not use false pretexts to escalate the war further.' NATO's Stoltenberg underlined that the 30-nation military organisation 'will not be intimidated or deterred from supporting Ukraine's right to self-defence for as long as it takes.' There are fears that Russia is pushing the claims because that it what the Kremlin is planning to use the deadly device that uses explosives to scatter radioactive waste. Putin told a meeting of intelligence officials from the CIS group of ex-Soviet countries that the West was 'pumping' Ukraine with heavy weapons, adding: 'There are also plans to use a so-called 'dirty bomb' for provocations.' Shoigu today called his counterparts from India and China to convey Moscow's concern about the purported Ukrainian plan. He voiced Moscow's concern about 'possible Ukrainian provocations involving a 'dirty bomb'' in the calls with his Indian counterpart, Rajnath Singh, and China's Wei Fenghe, according to the Russian Defence Ministry. The conversations followed Shoigu's calls with British, French, Turkish and U.S. counterparts Sunday in which he made the same claim. Britain, France, and the United States rejected that claim as 'transparently false.' Poland's government said it is preparing for the Kremlin's potential use of nuclear or chemical weapons after its warnings on Ukraine. Marcin Ociepa told Polish state broadcaster TVP1 the government believes Putin 'may reach for nuclear or chemical weapons' because his country's forces are struggling in Ukraine and that Poland 'must be prepared for all scenarios.' Polish President Andrzej Duda, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, national security ministers and leaders of Poland's armed forces met Tuesday to discuss aid for Ukraine and the course of the war, including Russia's nuclear threats. The head of Poland's National Security Bureau, Jacek Siewiera, said after the meeting that the leaders discussed the risks and consequences associated with the use of any type of nuclear weapons in light of the changing characteristics of the war as well as the approaching winter. Despite the Western dismissal of the Russian claims, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted that 'we have the information that there is an ongoing preparation in Ukraine for such a terror attack.' 'We will continue to energetically inform the global community about what we know to persuade it to take action to prevent such irresponsible action by the regime in Kyiv,' Peskov told reporters. Moscow also took its accusation to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, voicing its concerns during a closed-door meeting. Russia has not made public the evidence that it asserts it has, but says it has prepared its troops to work under conditions of nuclear contamination. Its deputy U.N. ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, told reporters after the Council meeting that it had passed intelligence information to Western counterparts with the 'necessary level of clearance'. Britain's Deputy U.N. Ambassador, James Kariuki, called the allegations 'pure Russian misinformation of the kind we've seen many times before'. Russia targeted more than 40 villages around Ukraine over the past day, Ukrainian officials said Wednesday, killing at least two people and sustaining the terror that forces people into air raid shelters each night. Russian forces launched five rockets, 30 air strikes and more than 100 multiple-launch rocket system attacks on Ukrainian targets, the Ukrainian armed forces general staff said. A Ukrainian official reported Wednesday that a Russian strike hit a gas station in the city of Dnipro, killing two people, including a pregnant woman. The governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Valentyn Reznichenko, said four people wounded were hospitalized. Mykolaiv, a southern port city near the war's front line, is among the places where residents have lined up to receive rations of bread and canned food as increases in food prices and losses of income add to the war-time burdens of low-income households in Ukraine. Several buildings and neighborhoods were struck in Mykolaiv on Tuesday, though it was still unclear if there were any casualties, according to local authorities. Missiles continued early Wednesday morning. The sole food distribution point in Mykolaiv allows each person to receive free bread once every three days. Many must walk long distances to collect the essential food items for their family."
2022-10-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11356725/Kremlin-talks-Griner-swap-confidential.html,Kremlin keeps door open to free Brittney Griner from her nine year jail sentence in a prisoner swap but insists any talks must be kept secret,"The Kremlin kept the door open for talks on a possible swap involving jailed US basketball star Brittney Griner but reiterated that any such discussions must be kept strictly confidential. A Russian court on Tuesday rejected Griner's appeal against her nine-year prison sentence for drug possession. The eight-time all-star center with the WNBA´s Phoenix Mercury and a two-time Olympic gold medalist was convicted in August after Russian police said they found vape canisters containing cannabis oil in her luggage at Moscow´s Sheremetyevo Airport. Asked if Griner could be freed as part of a prisoners swap with Washington, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a conference call with reporters that 'we always say that any contacts about possible exchanges can only be conducted in silence under a tight lid on any information.' Griner´s arrest in February came at a time of heightened tensions between Moscow and Washington, just days before Russia sent troops into Ukraine. At the time, Griner was returning to play for a Russian team during the WNBA´s offseason. President Joe Biden told reporters that his administration is in 'constant contact' with Russian authorities on Griner and other Americans who are detained there. While there has not been progress on bringing her back to the U.S., Biden said, 'We´re not stopping.' At her trial, Griner admitted to having the canisters in her luggage but testified she packed them inadvertently in her haste to make her flight and had no criminal intent. Her defense team presented written statements saying she had been prescribed cannabis to treat chronic pain. Before her conviction, the U.S. State Department declared Griner to be 'wrongfully detained' - a charge that Russia has sharply rejected. WNBA star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner is seen waiting to appear in a video link as a Russian court on Tuesday started hearing the appeal against her nine-year prison sentence for drug possession. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement that Biden 'is willing to go to extraordinary lengths and make tough decisions to bring Americans home.' In July, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an unusual step that Washington had made a 'substantial proposal' to Moscow get Griner home, along with Paul Whelan, an American serving a 16-year sentence in Russia for espionage. He didn´t elaborate, but The Associated Press and other news organizations have reported that Washington has offered to exchange Griner and Whelan for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer who is serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S. and once earned the nickname the 'merchant of death'.

2022-10-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11357591/MBS-told-Biden-officials-wouldnt-cut-oil-just-days-did-just-that.html,REVEALED: MBS told Biden officials he wouldn't cut oil just days before Saudi crown prince did just that - and then ignored desperate US pleas to stick to the original deal,"Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman duped Joe Biden's administration into thinking there was a deal for more oil production ahead of the president's July trip to Saudi Arabia only to renege on the matter and, ultimately, slash the number of barrels of crude being produced. A stunning report in the New York Times on Wednesday outlines how Biden's aides thought they had a handshake agreement with the Saudis ahead of president's visit to Jeddah, where his fist bump with MBS - the crown prince is known by his initials - caused a political shake up in the United States. Administration officials thought the deal to boost oil production through the end of the year - thus keeping gas prices down during the midterm election - was worth breaking Biden's campaign pledge to shun MBS and the Saudi kingdom. Instead, after the trip, the Saudi-led OPEC Plus energy alliance, which controls 40% of the world's crude production, announced it would cut back its output by two million barrels a day, which represents about 2% of global oil production. The announcement was the latest speed bump in the rocky road of a relationship between Biden, 79, and MBS, 37, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. U.S.-Saudi relations have declined under the Biden administration. It started back during the 2020 presidential campaign when Biden pledged to treat the kingdom like a 'pariah' after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. MBS, in return, has mocked Biden's age and questioned the president's mental prowess. He's also told aides he preferred President Donald Trump, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Kingdom's reversal of the agreement to increase oil production infuriated the administration and led Biden officials to claim that Saudi Arabia was helping Russia, a member of the greater OPEC alliance, with its war in the Ukraine. 'Look, it's clear that OPEC Plus is aligning with Russia with today's announcement,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at the time. OPEC's decision caused gas prices to spike. Energy is Russia's greatest revenue generator and is a major source of funding for Vladimir Putin's war. Biden has released more crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve in at attempt to bring down prices at the pump. Biden administration officials said that in the days leading up to the OPEC Plus announcement, they had received assurances from MBS that production would not be slashed. When they learned of Saudi's reversal they made a futile last-ditch push to change it but failed in their attempt. In a statement to The Times, the Saudi Energy Ministry said that 'the kingdom rejects these allegations and stresses that such mischaracterizations made by anonymous sources are entirely false.' Meanwhile, the White House indicated it might seek retribution and some Democrats in Congress are backing such a move. A DEAL IN THE MAKING When White House officials starting planning for Biden's stop in Saudi in July, they reached a private oil deal that would see the Saudis would accelerate an OPEC Plus production increase of 400,000 barrels per day already planned for September to July and August. Additionally, the Saudis would arrange for OPEC to announce a further production increase of 200,000 barrels per day for each month from September to December. A presidential visit would be a win for the Saudis. Biden had made his clear his distain for MBS, saying early on his administration he would only talk to the aging Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. But the politics and economics behind America's driving need for oil outweighed the president's personal feelings on the matter. The deal administration officials made helped smooth the path for Biden's sit down with the crown prince. On June 2, OPEC Plus announced the production increase of 200,000 barrels per day. The White House praised the move. 'The United States welcomes the important decision from OPEC+ today to increase supply by more than 200,000 barrels per day in July and August based on new market conditions,' said Jean-Pierre in a statement at the time. Shortly thereafter, the White House confirmed Biden would visit Jeddah in July after his stop in Israel. The price of oil was dropping when Biden arrived on July 15th. His fist-bump greeting was heavily criticized back in the States particularly by the family and friends of Jamal Khashoggi. The president laughed off the criticism when asked about it by a DailyMail.com reporter. He said it was a 'silly question' when asked how he can be sure another murder like that of Khashoggi wouldn't happen again. Biden also insisted that he brought up Khashoggi's murder in his meeting with bin Salman, who is often referred to by his initials, MBS. 'In respect to the murder of Khashoggi, I raised it at the top of the meeting, making it clear what I thought of it at the time, and what I think of it now,' Biden told reporters from a Jeddah hotel after his meetings with the Saudis. 'I was straightforward and direct ... I made my view crystal clear.' White House officials believed the political fallout was worth the oil deal they cut. But then the Saudis showed signs they were reneging on the deal. In August, OPEC announced a production increase of 100,000 barrels a day - half of what was agreed upon. In September, they cut back production by 100,000 barrels a day - making the August increase moot. On Sept. 24, American officials held an in-person meeting in Saudi Arabia with MBS and his brother Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the Saudi energy minister. MBS reassured them there would be no production cuts, U.S. officials with direct knowledge of what transpired told The Times. But, on Oct. 5, OPEC Plus announced it would cut production by 2 million barrels a day. Administration officials had received an early head's up this was in the pipeline. They had Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen call Mohammed al-Jadaan, the Saudi finance minister, to argue against the move - to no avail. Now the Biden administration reviewing whether the Saudi relationship is serving U.S. national security interests. The Saudis also said they are re-evaluating relations with the U.S. 'Rarely has the chain of broken expectations and perceived insults and humiliations been greater than they are now,' Aaron David Miller, a veteran U.S. diplomat in the Middle East now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told The Wall Street Journal. 'There's almost no trust and absolutely no mutual respect.'"
2022-10-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11358087/Jon-Stewart-describes-Hunter-Bidens-time-board-Burisma-Corruption-straight-ip.html,Jon Stewart says that Hunter Biden's $1 MILLION position on the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma was 'corruption - straight up off the bat',"Satirist Jon Stewart used his podcast on Wednesday to lay into Hunter Biden's career, describing his time on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma as corruption. President Joe Biden's troubled son joined the natural gas company in 2014. Critics have long questioned his qualifications for the role, other than that his father was vice president closely involved in Barack Obama's Ukrainian policy. For his trouble he was paid as much as $1 million a year. The issue came up during Stewart's podcast, the Problem with Jon Stewart, released on Tuesday. He was discussing the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop with British journalist Gabriel Gatehouse, and the way much of the American media ignored the story. 'Turned out that not only was it real, but the FBI had the bloody laptop all this time,' said Gatehouse. 'Hadn’t really looked on it. Hadn’t figured out ... 'And then it took the establishment media in the US the New York Times and the Washington Post, let’s say the kind of, you know, the big boys… It took them nearly two years to go through the laptop as you expect they would do.' He said he had even ignored the story because it was being pushed by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who was famous for a strategy of 'flooding the zone with s***.' As DailyMail.com has verified, the hard drive was packed with genuine photographs, emails and data painting a picture of Hunter Biden's business interests and associates. Stewart interrupted Gatehouse to flag some of the relevant details, but admitted that some - such as a comment about holding 'ten percent for the big guy' from a deal, widely interpreted as being Joe Biden - were far from unambiguous. 'Let's say it was real and people just thought, well, the one thing in it maybe is ""10 percent to the big guy,"" which is circumstantial at best. But as far as like, look, Hunter Biden being on the board of –' 'Burisma,' said Gatehouse quickly. 'To me that's corruption - straight up off the bat,' finished Stewart. He went on to say that the known ties to Ukraine were a bigger problem than anything on his laptop. 'It's that it's corrupt on its face,' he said. 'I don't need a laptop with like a hint of circumstantial evidence. 'Now tying Joe Biden to it, that's gonna take some digging.' Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma for five years before stepping down in 2019. A years-long probe into Biden's only surviving son is rapidly coming to a head, according to a recent report in the Washington Post. Unnamed federal officials told the outlet that they believe there's enough evidence to bring tax charges against him, as well as an indictment related to lying about his information while buying a gun in 2018. Earlier this month, President Biden defended his son. 'This is a kid who got, not a kid - he’s a grown man. He got hooked on - like many families have had happen, hooked on drugs. He’s overcome that. He’s established a new life,' he told CNN’s Jake Tapper. 'I'm confident that he is - what he says and does are consistent with what happens. 'And for example, he wrote a book about his problems and was straightforward about it. I'm proud of him.' Biden also appeared to falter on his promise to stay neutral when he tried to explain background to his son's firearm purchase - though he clarified that he 'didn't know anything about it.' 'He came along and said, by the way, this thing about a gun - I didn’t know anything about it,' the president said. by Josh Boswell Emails, text messages, and photographs published by DailyMail.com are among a wealth of evidence that prosecutors could use at trial if Hunter Biden is charged with tax crimes and lying on gun purchase documents. The FBI believes it has enough evidence to charge Hunter Biden with failure to declare income from his foreign business deals and a failure to declare he was a drug addict on a gun application, sources told The Washington Post Thursday. Agents told the Post they assembled enough evidence for a criminal case against the First Son 'months ago' – and the decision to charge now lies with federal prosecutors. The agents claim they have sufficient proof that Hunter failed to declare income from his overseas business dealings to the IRS. The First Son also wrote on a gun application that he was not a user of illegal drugs, but later admitted in his own memoir that he was a crack addict at the time. Since 2019 the Bureau has been in possession of revealing emails, furtive text messages and photographs from Hunter's abandoned laptop that he never intended to fall into law enforcement's hands. Now DailyMail.com can reveal some of the most suspicious pieces of evidence prosecutors could use in a potential trial. A SMOKING GUN On October 12, 2018 Hunter bought a .38 caliber handgun from StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply in Wilmington, Delaware. The federally required Firearm Transaction Record for the purchase, obtained by DailyMail.com, asks: 'Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?' Hunter checked the box: 'No'. But in his memoir, Beautiful Things, he admitted to his continued 'full-blown addiction' at the time – and in doing so, appeared to admit to the felony of lying on the firearm form. 'I had returned [to the East Coast] that fall of 2018, after my most recent relapse in California, with the hope of getting clean through a new therapy and reconciling with Hallie. Neither happened,' he wrote in the 2021 autobiography. He said he would go for regular ketamine therapy sessions as part of his rehab treatment but continued to smoke crack throughout. 'The therapy's results were disastrous,' he wrote. 'I backslid. I did exactly what I'd come to Massachusetts to stop doing. I'd stay clean for a week, break away from the center to meet a connection I found in Rhode Island, smoke up, then return. 'One thing I did remarkably well during that time was fool people about whether or not I was using. Between trips up there, I even bought clean urine from a dealer in New York to pass drug tests. 'I doubt much good comes from doing ketamine while you're on crack.' A copy of the Firearms Transaction Record and a receipt for the purchase was first obtained by news site Politico last year. Lying on gun forms is a felony, punishable by a maximum 10 years prison and a $250,000 fine. However, not all cases are prosecuted. Of the 478 referrals for 'lying and buying' the Justice Department received in 2018, charges were filed for 298 cases, about 60%. Hunter barely had the gun for a two weeks when a dangerous incident occurred. His lover and brother's widow Hallie Biden found it in his truck on October 23 and threw it in a trash can outside local grocery store Janssens, opposite a high school. It was discovered by a homeless man rifling through the trash. Local police as well as the FBI were called. Hunter argued about the incident with Hallie in panicked text messages in the following days. 'The f***ing FBI Hallie. It's hard to believe anyone is that stupid // so what's my fault here Hallie that you speak of. Owning a gun that's in a locked car hidden on another property?,' he wrote. 'It was open unlocked and windows down and the kids search your car,' Hallie replied. 'I'm scared you would use it hunt … I'm scared for your life hunt.' Despite the Bidens not having Secret Service protection at the time, USSS agents reportedly showed up and asked the gun store owner, Ron Palmieri, to hand over purchase documents. Suspecting the case would be covered up, Palmieri refused and instead later gave his papers to agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, according to a March 2021 Politico report. The Secret Service has denied any involvement. But in texts from Hunter's laptop he also claimed they had a role in the debacle. 'She stole the gun out of my truck lock box and threw in a garbage can full to the top at Jansens. Then told me it was my problem to deal with,' Hunter wrote in a three-way text message with Hallie and his therapist in January 2019. 'Then when the police the FBI the secret service came on the scene she said she took it from me because she was scared I would harm myself due to my drug and alcohol problem and our volatile relationship and that she was afraid for the kids.' Transparency organization Judicial Watch is currently suing the Secret Service over its refusal to hand over records relating to the incident under the Freedom of Information Act. Last year the agency told Senators Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson, who have been investigating Hunter's potential criminal activity, they weren't involved. 'The Secret Service did not provide protection to any member of the Biden family in 2018,' special agent in charge Benjamin Kramer said in a letter published by the Republican senators. 'Further, records searches concerning the reported involvement of Secret Service personnel in the alleged incident have yielded no results.' SHADY BUSINESS DEALS Hunter's foreign business dealings have been controversial for years and have come under intense scrutiny since details from his laptop emerged. Potential charges for alleged undeclared income may focus on his work for allegedly corrupt Ukrainian gas company Burisma, his deals with Chinese financial firms and Beijing-backed oil giant CEFC, or his business schemes hatched with oligarchs from Russia, Kazakhstan and other Eastern European magnates. Transactions involving Hunter or his family members have triggered more than 150 suspicious activity reports, filed by banks for law enforcement to draw on in future financial crime investigations, according to House Oversight Committee ranking member, Republican James Comey. Those voluminous reports have been in the hands of the FBI and were part of the evidence used by the Senate Homeland Security Committee for its bombshell 2020 report that flagged 'millions of dollars in questionable transactions' and national security concerns over Hunter's foreign business dealings. Emails and documents from Hunter's laptop show he made at least $11million from his overseas deals between 2013 and 2018 – and the total he got from Chinese businesses alone has been estimated as high as $31million. A bank statement from August 2017 on Hunter's abandoned laptop shows a wire transfer of $5million to an account for Hudson West III, linked to Hunter in his deal with CEFC. When CEFC executive Patrick Ho was arrested on bribery charges that year, contracts and wire transfers show he paid Hunter a $1million retainer to represent him. Hunter even recounted once being presented with a 2.8 carat diamond by CEFC Energy China tycoon Ye Jianming – though he claimed he gave it to his associates and never saw it again. UNDECLARED INCOME Hunter sold his reported 10% stake in another Chinese venture, Bohai Harvest RST, late last year. The fund had $2billion under its management and experts estimated Hunter's share at around $20million. The enormous sums, if not fully or properly declared, would make prime targets for Delaware US attorney David Weiss in his potential tax prosecution of the First Son. A 2017 email from Hunter's business partner Eric Schwerin warns him that he needs to 'amend' his 2014 tax filing to reflect the thousands he received from Ukrainian gas firm Burisma. 'In 2014 you joined the Burisma board and we still need to amend your 2014 returns to reflect the unreported Burisma income,' Schwerin wrote. 'That is approximately $400,000 extra so your income in 2014 was closer to $1,247,328.' A November 2018 email from Hunter's assistant lists $412,309.23 in unpaid tax bills. That figure may have swelled considerably, as Hunter's 'sugar brother' lawyer Kevin Morris reportedly paid off over $2million in Hunter's tax bills this year. Despite the millions of dollars Hunter earned, by 2019 he was claiming in court filings that he did not have enough money to pay child support to a former employee he impregnated then ghosted. Lunden Roberts, 31, coached his daughter in basketball and worked at his firm, Rosemont Seneca. He at first denied her son was his, then when she sued him in Arkansas and a DNA test proved paternity, he said he had insufficient income to pay child support. 'I am unemployed and have had no monthly income since May 2019,' he wrote in a November 2019 affidavit in the case. The First Son settled with Roberts two days before a hearing to decide whether he should be held in contempt for failing to produce financial records proving his alleged penury. Hunter's lawyers reacted with fury to the Washington Post's Thursday story that quoted sources saying the feds had enough evidence to charge the First Son. 'It is a federal felony for a federal agent to leak information about a Grand Jury investigation such as this one,' attorney Chris Clark told the paper. 'Any agent you cite as a source in your article apparently has committed such a felony. We expect the Department of Justice will diligently investigate and prosecute such bad actors. 'As is proper and legally required, we believe the prosecutors in this case are diligently and thoroughly weighing not just evidence provided by agents, but also all the other witnesses in this case, including witnesses for the defense. That is the job of the prosecutors. They should not be pressured, rushed, or criticized for doing their job.'"
2022-10-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11358499/IAN-BIRRELL-reveals-thousands-Ukrainian-children-deported-Russia-adoption.html,"The child snatcher: Just when you thought Vladimir Putin couldn't sink any lower, IAN BIRRELL reveals thousands of Ukrainian babies and infants are being deported to Russia for forced adoption","The blonde woman in the polka-dot dress was clutching a huge teddy bear as she stood with a small group awaiting the arrival of an early morning flight from Moscow two weeks ago. 'We're waiting for the kiddies,' she said. 'We're so excited in anticipation. We have tears.' Then the cluster of children were led into the arrivals hall. First came an infant in a bright pink anorak, carried by a woman clutching the tiny hand of another small girl also dressed in pink. They were followed by 22 more exhausted-looking boys and girls bearing name tags on their coats, bobble hats on their heads and baffled looks on their faces. Despite the toys, the hugs, the shrieks of excitement from the waiting adults, these children were not being greeted by the familiar faces of loving family members. Instead, they were victims of a horrific human trafficking operation run by the Kremlin, cruelly snatched from the security of their homes in Ukraine and flown thousands of miles to Siberia. There, they were being handed over to Russian families like human spoils of war, while being filmed — innocent pawns in Vladimir Putin's propaganda campaign. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed this month that more than 1.6 million of its citizens have been deported during the war, many stripped of all documents and then dispersed across Russia. 'They are stealing people,' he said. Yet the most heinous aspect of this ethnic cleansing is the trafficking of unaccompanied children, with 9,441 known to have been forcibly deported and thousands more missing. This month, three military planes with a cargo of 234 snatched children, including 53 babies, flew into Moscow from occupied areas of Ukraine. Days later, 104 more were despatched from Moscow into the arms of new families in places such as Siberia, the sprawling region once infamous for its Soviet gulags. The regional governor in Siberia claimed the children were young refugees who had 'found a family, home, warmth, peace and security'. He added that they expected another batch to arrive within weeks. His officials insisted these 'orphans' all met their 'future parents' by video and agreed to live with them. Given the obvious youth, one has to question his claim. When those 24 children from Luhansk landed in the Siberian capital Novosibirsk, the youngest was just two years old. Others looked little older as they were handed over to families in front of Maria Lvova-Belova — the woman holding the big stuffed bear — who was appointed Russia's Children's Ombudsman shortly before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Lvova-Belova is the wife of a priest, mother of 23 mostly adopted children and a loyal ally of Putin who gushes about the 'indescribable delight and tears of joy' she experiences from such meetings. Yet she is the central figure in these Kremlin war crimes of astonishing inhumanity. She tells the regime's patsy media Moscow is acting benevolently, providing security for frightened children found in orphanages or cowering in basements and bombed-out streets. This ignores the obvious fact that these terrified children, like all Ukrainians, would be living in peace if Putin had not invaded their nation. They are victims of a callous Kremlin policy that sweeps up the young from occupied lands with no attempt made to find their family members — a clear breach of international law. The theft of children and eradication of their past and culture is a tactic carried out by some of the most repulsive regimes in recent history, including the Nazis and Islamic State. Yet Lvova-Belova — who has five birth children and five adopted children living at home as well as 13 more with disabilities in care settings — boasted last month in the Russian parliament about the success of their campaign. She told a tale of 30 children taken to Moscow after being 'found in the basements' of Mariupol, a key port ferociously battered by Russian forces before it fell in May. The children, she said, 'spoke negatively about the president [Putin], said all sorts of nasty things, sang the anthem of Ukraine and shouted 'Glory to Ukraine'.' But after they were handed over to local families — including one 16-year-old boy that the Ombudsman herself adopted — their 'negativity . . . turns into love for Russia', she bragged. In a chilling social media post, Lvova-Belova said another 370 teenagers had been taken to Russia for 'rehabilitation' that included daily lessons in language and history — and now 'they say that they are ready to go to the front line'. Little wonder this sanctimonious official in her floaty dresses, who reports directly to Putin, was sanctioned by Britain for 'orchestrating a new policy to facilitate . . . forced adoptions in Russia'. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, said these deportations proved genocide. 'They invaded, destroyed their city, killed their parents and now they are taking away their identity,' he said. The scale of these atrocities was revealed by childcare officials in the Russian region of Krasnodar, next to Crimea. They inadvertently issued a statement at the end of August celebrating their adoption of 'more than 1,000 young children from the liberated Mariupol'. The online bulletin — which was hastily deleted — said the 'small' children were dispersed across Russia including to a far-off region bordering Mongolia. It added that 300 more babies were 'looking forward to meeting their new families'. Ukrainian officials warn that children are being sent as far as possible from their homes so that even if tracked down, their families might not be able to afford to collect them. They add that siblings are routinely separated. Kyiv's government angrily condemns 'state-organised kidnapping of children and destruction of the future of the Ukrainian state', warning it intends to prosecute Russians who adopt their children. Yet only 98 lone minors taken into Russian hands have been returned to Ukraine. They include Kira Obedinsky, 12, saved by the fame of her father, a sporting hero in Ukraine, and the steely determination of her grandparents. Kira, whose mother died soon after childbirth, stumbled upon her father's corpse after emerging from hiding in a Mariupol cellar at the end of a bombardment. Then she was hit by shrapnel from a mine, as she fled with other residents. The bereaved child, bleeding from neck and leg wounds, was taken by Russian-speaking soldiers for treatment in Donetsk, the Ukrainian region first occupied in 2014 and illegally annexed by Putin last month. But her father was the former captain of the national water polo team and her grandparents used the media to win attention for her plight. She called her grandfather, Oleksander, using her father's mobile in tears from a Donetsk hospital on the other side of the front line. Medical staff told him she would be sent to an orphanage in Russia, sparking fears they would never meet again. So Oleksander embarked on a risky four-day journey through Poland, Turkey and Russia to save Kira. 'Nobody believed it would be possible — but thank God we managed,' he said. 'This venture could have ended with neither me nor Kira being released.' Another insight into the Kremlin's sinister programme came from a 17-year-old attending a holiday camp in Mariupol with his five younger siblings when war broke out. Stranded behind enemy lines, they were stopped at a checkpoint when they tried to return home. First the children were paraded on Russian television. Then the eldest brother was told he would be sent to a new school and his siblings put in an orphanage before being handed out to new families. 'I was terrified,' he said. Eventually his mother, helped by the head of a children's charity, won their release after two months of negotiation. But the teenager said other Ukrainian children with them were given new identity papers for the so-called Donetsk People's Republic. Amid the chaos of war, many families are left searching for children with no idea if they are alive, injured or been given a new name, parents and documents after forced adoption. One woman living in Spain is searching desperately for two nephews and a niece, last seen by their teacher in May being driven away on a bus from Mariupol. 'I don't know where are they and what happened. I'm so worried for the kids,' said Olena. Now there are fears many more will disappear amid the confusion as Ukrainian troops advance in the south. Kyiv's armed forces said about 170 children were 'taken away' from the occupied Kherson region in the first fortnight of this month as Russian stooges ordered an evacuation. The painful irony is that Russia's own orphanages, notoriously underfunded and infamous for atrocious care, are overflowing with unwanted children. Russian law bars adoption of foreign children. But in May, Putin backed an edict that made it easier to adopt and give citizenship to Ukrainian children without parental care. This makes it much harder for Ukrainians to take them back. During one meeting in the Kremlin, Lvova-Belova told her president that Russian families were 'queueing up' to take 'orphans' from 'various child-care facilities' in occupied Ukraine. Many prospective parents will have been convinced by state propaganda they are saving war victims. Yet there are also hefty benefits for big families to counter Russia's falling birth rates and population, along with adoption benefits such as a one-off payment of £2,260 plus £300 a month for each child in Moscow. Not all the children in Ukraine's orphanages lack parents, however. Many are placed in them, sometimes temporarily, after family-care failures due to alcoholism, drug addiction, mental health problems or financial struggles. One pro-Kremlin newspaper, reporting on Lvova-Belova's handover stunt in Siberia last week, even admitted the Luhansk children being doled out for adoption were all 'social orphans — that is Mum and Dad are alive but were stripped of parental rights'. Putin denies kidnap allegations, praising his Ombudsman's work. 'It is only natural she evacuated children from the zone of combat operations or dangerous areas in Donbas. We should make a low bow to her,' he said. But the Kremlin strategy is as deliberate as it is heartless since seizures of children began the day before the full invasion, when officials in Donetsk began transporting Ukrainian children from orphanages to Russia. Then proxy leaders of other occupied regions said any child born after February 24 — the day Putin's troops poured over Ukraine's border — would be automatically deemed Russian citizens. The director of one Donetsk orphanage spoke to a TV reporter from the train taking some of her 225 children to Moscow for adoption. 'Every child wants warmth, motherly care, fatherly care,' she said. 'The children, of course, gave their consent.' The youngest was three years old. And despite the staged footage, two bemused-looking brothers aged eight and nine admitted they had a grandmother in Ukraine. There is also evidence some Russian military leaders see Ukrainian orphans as war booty. In one video shared by Ramzan Kadyrov, the brutal Chechen leader, his troops express dismay at failing to seize children from a village near Kyiv. 'We didn't start clearing this village, did not do reconnaissance, but immediately brazenly really fast went straight to this orphanage,' says one heavily-armed man. 'We quickly blocked it, got inside but, unfortunately, there were no children there. The cribs were still warm. It turned out that we were late only by a couple of hours.' Putin's forced adoptions have been condemned by UN bodies and leading charities. 'What is happening in Ukraine is truly horrifying,' said Peter McDermott, chief executive of Lumos, a child protection charity set up by the author J.K. Rowling. International law states that adoption should not be used for unaccompanied children in emergencies. 'Even those children who have been separated from parents cannot be assumed to be orphans,' McDermott said. Ultimately, this is one more petrifying front in Ukraine's fight — to stop more of its children falling into the clutches of Putin and his cruel allies, who hide their evil intent behind cold smiles and teddy bears.

2022-10-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11358351/US-Army-Navy-launch-rocket-successfully-testing-hypersonic-weapon-experiments-Nasa-facility.html,US Army and Navy launch rocket successfully testing hypersonic weapon experiments at NASA facility in Virginia,"The US Army and Navy successfully launched a rocket while testing a new class of hypersonic weapons at a seaside NASA facility, the Pentagon confirmed. NASA's Wallop Flight Facility in Virginia hosted the test by Sandia National Laboratories which evaluated hypersonic weapon communications and navigation equipment as well as advanced materials that can withstand the heat in a 'realistic hypersonic environment,' according to a Navy statement. The testing comes amid growing concerns Russia and China have had more success developing their own hypersonic weapons than the US. The United States and its global rivals have quickened their pace to build hypersonic weapons - the next generation of arms that rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms. Hypersonic glide vehicles are launched from a rocket in the upper atmosphere before gliding to a target at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 3,853 miles (6,200 km) per hour. To speed the development the Pentagon launched these experiments and prototypes using a sounding rocket, a smaller and therefore more affordable test vehicle, to fill a critical gap between ground testing and full-system flight testing. Wednesday's test was intended to validate future aspects of the Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) and the Army's Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW). Glide bodies are different from their air-breathing hypersonic weapon cousins, which use scramjet engine technology and the vehicle's high speed to forcibly compress incoming air before combustion to enable sustained flight at hypersonic speeds. The test will allow for advancement of the missiles to proceed 'to rapidly maximize the war fighting capability delivered to our Soldiers and Sailors,' according to the Navy. Companies such as Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Technologies Corp are working to develop U.S. hypersonic weapon capability. The US successfully tested two hypersonic missiles - referred to as an Air-Launched Response Weapon (ARRW) - off California's coast in July. The ARRW allows the missile to accelerate to hypersonic speeds, more than five times the speed of sound. The glide body detached and accelerated before reaching its target, the first time the US has been able to separate the booster mid-air successfully. 'This second successful test demonstrates ARRW's ability to reach and withstand operational hypersonic speeds, collect crucial data for use in further flight tests, and validate safe separation from the aircraft,' Lockheed Martin, the company that developed the two missiles, said in a statement in July. One of Lockheed Martin's concepts for the weapon is to fire it via High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher, like those sent to Ukraine. China was the first country to test a hypersonic weapon in 2021, but Russia became the first nation ever to use hypersonic weapons in war when it launched its Iskander and Kinzhal missiles at targets in Ukraine. UNITED STATES The US military has a number of hypersonic weapons programs across the Navy, Army and Air Force but most are still in development phase and highly top secret. However the known programs are all more conventional hypersonic weapons that strike from high altitude, rather than orbital bombardment systems that strike from space which the Chinese were revealed to have developed tis week. The only US hypersonic weapon know to have been successfully tested is the Air Force's GM-183 ARRW which is designed to be launched from a large bomber aircraft. It then accelerates to hypersonic speeds using of up to 15,345mph using a supersonic combustion ramjet to strike targets within 1,000 miles. Donald Trump referred to a 'super duper missile' while in office and this is believed to be the AGM-183 ARRW. The Navy's submarine launched Long Range Hypersonic Weapon is expected to be operational by 2023 and will have a range of 1,725 miles. Darpa, the US army's scientific wing, recently announced successful tests of what it called a HAWC missile (Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept) but kept details such as range, speed and payload secret. The missile uses oxygen in the atmosphere as part of its fuel - marking the first successful test of that class of weapon since 2013. The missile, which is built by Raytheon, was released from an aircraft just 'seconds' before the scramjet engine from Northrop Grumman kicked on, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) said. The engine works by compressing incoming air with hydrocarbon fuel to create a fast airflow mixture, one capable of reaching over 1,700 meters per second, or five times the speed of sound. Earlier this year, a test of a hypersonic missile from the U.S. Air Force was abandoned after it was unable to complete its launch sequence. On March 19 last year, the Pentagon flight-tested a hypersonic glide vehicle at its Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii. It deemed the test a success and 'a major milestone towards the department's goal of fielding hypersonic warfighting capabilities in the early- to mid-2020s.' Unlike Russia, the United States says it is not developing hypersonic weapons for use with a nuclear warhead. As a result, a U.S. hypersonic weapon will need to be more accurate, posing additional technical challenges. In 2004, NASA's experimental unmanned hypersonic aircraft X-43 reached 7,366mph (Mach 9.6) using a scramjet engine, setting the current record. In 2019, DailyMail.com reported that the Raytheon and Northrop Grumman-developed missile would use an engine made by a 3D printer. Last year, DARPA said it was working with Aerojet Rocketdyne on a nearly $20 million project to develop a hypersonic rocket that could intercept enemy missiles mid-air. RUSSIA Russia recently launched a hypersonic missile, the Zircon, from a submarine, and since late 2019 has had the hypersonic nuclear-capable Avangard missiles in service. The Avangard can travel at up to Mach 27, changing course and altitude. The range of Russia's hypersonic missile, the Zircon, is 621 miles with a speed of 9,800mph. But the missile flies below the atmosphere and uses fuel to power itself to hypersonic speeds rather than the Earth's orbit. Earlier this month, Russia announced it has successfully test-fired the Zircon from a nuclear submarine for the first time. The 6,670mph weapon hit a target in the Barents Sea according to the Moscow defense ministry, who claims the missile is capable of Mach-9 speeds and able to evade all Western defenses. Russia said it had completed flight tests of the new-age missile from a frigate - the Admiral Gorshkov - and a coastal mount, but it had not previously been launched from a submarine. The Zircon has been identified by Moscow's state-controlled TV as Vladimir Putin's weapon of choice to wipe out coastal American cities in the event of an atomic conflict. He has declared the missile as 'truly unparalleled anywhere in the world', and the Russians have boasted it is 'unstoppable' by Western defenses. Putin first announced the development of an array of new hypersonic weapons in 2018, insisting that they would be able to hit almost any point in the world and evade a US-built missile shield. The Zircon is due to go into service next year, and will first be deployed via the Admiral Golovko frigate which carries significant stealth-technology. A key use of the missile is taking out enemy ships and reports suggested its maximum range is between 188 and 620 miles. But there have been unconfirmed reports its true range is some 1,200 miles. The missile system's design and development have been conducted in deep secrecy, and Putin has warned that foreign spies have tried to steal its secrets. It is one of a number of hypersonic missiles Russia is deploying including the 188-tonne Sarmat - known in the West as Satan-2 - which will be the biggest beast in Russia's nuclear arsenal, due for tests in the autumn with deployment slated for next year. In May, Russia said it tested three 'invincible' hypersonic 'Satan 2' missiles that some have said could wipe out areas the size of England and Wales. CHINA The hypersonic orbital bombardment system that China tested in August reportedly reaches a top speed of 21,000 mph and strikes from space. The core concept of China's 'new' weapon - deliver a warhead into orbit and have it circle the globe before hitting a target - was first developed by the Soviets in the 1960s. Called a Fractional Orbital Bombardment System, or FOBS, it was developed to evade powerful US radar arrays and missile defense systems. Those systems work by detecting launches of ICBMs - very long-range missiles that can be tipped with nukes - and tracking them into space, then firing at the warheads as they come down in the hope of blowing them up before they hit their targets. This is possible because ICBMs and their warheads follow a predictable trajectory that rises high into space - making them relatively easy to spot and allowing defense crews to calculate where they are aimed so they can be shot out of the sky. FOBS aim to negate these defenses by firing their warheads along a much-flatter trajectory - assisted by Earth's gravity. This means they pass under the scope of many radar detection arrays and are harder to track. It also makes the warheads much harder to shoot down because their trajectory is harder to calculate. The use of orbit makes a warhead's range potentially unlimited, meaning it can be fired at its target from any direction. This helps to avoid radar systems which generally point at a fixed spot in the sky - in America's case, over the North Pole. Meanwhile, China has also unveiled a hypersonic medium-range missile, the DF-17, in 2019, which can travel around 2,000 kilometers and can carry nuclear warheads. In October, China deployed the DF 17 missile to coastal areas in preparation for a possible invasion of Taiwan. The weapon has a maximum range of 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) and is capable of achieving speeds of up to 7,680 miles per hour (12,360 kph) - or 10 times the speed of sound - while carrying a nuclear warhead, according to previous reports. It has been billed as 'a death sentence' to aircraft carriers within its range. Hypersonic missiles travel at more than five times the speed of sound in the upper atmosphere - or about 6,200 km per hour (3,850 mph). This is slower than an intercontinental ballistic missile, but the shape of a hypersonic glide vehicle allows it to maneuver toward a target or away from defenses. Combining a glide vehicle with a missile that can launch it partially into orbit - a so-called fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) - could strip adversaries of reaction time and traditional defenses mechanisms. Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), by contrast, carry nuclear warheads on ballistic trajectories that travel into space but never reach orbit. China on Monday insisted that the test in August was a routine one for a spacecraft rather than a missile."
2022-10-26,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11354789/Rishi-takes-world-stage-receives-calls-Biden-Zelensky.html,Zelensky invites Sunak to Ukraine as pair hold first phonecall since Rishi took power: New PM vows to 'write a new chapter' in UK's support for Kyiv before chatting to President Biden hours after US leader pronounced his name wrong,"Rishi Sunak stepped up to the international stage last night taking calls from world leaders as he laid down the foundations for his premiership. The new PM had earlier hit headlines with a dramatic cabinet reshuffle that saw him displace key Truss allies while retaining Jeremy Hunt as Chancellor and James Cleverly as Foreign Secretary and reappointing Suella Braverman to the Home Office. Hours after his cabinet reshuffle, Mr Sunak took a call from US president Joe Biden and discussed the war in Ukraine, as the US President called the UK his country's 'closest ally'. This was despite the president earlier mispronouncing the PM's name as 'Rashee Sanook' in his congratulatory speech. The new Prime Minister will meet Joe Biden in the coming weeks at the G20 summit in Indonesia. Sunak reiterated the 'special relationship' between the UK and US by referring to the two countries 'the closest of allies' in an Instagram post, alongside a picture of himself taking the call. The PM also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and pledged the UK would continue to provide support as it defends itself from Russian aggression. Zelensky in turn invited Sunak to visit Ukraine. Yesterday, the PM received congratulatory messages from a host of other world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Gloria Meloni, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi But not all reactions were quite as welcoming, as Russia acknowledged the new Prime Minister in the frostiest of terms. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that in Moscow, 'we do not see any preconditions, grounds, or hope that in the foreseeable future there will be any positive changes' in the relationship between the United Kingdom and Russia. A Downing Street spokesperson said that Mr Biden had congratulated Mr Sunak on his appointment, adding that 'the leaders looked forward to working closely together'. Both of Sunak's predecessors Boris Johnson and Liz Truss had vocally promised full support to war-torn Ukraine and on Tuesday evening the new Prime Minister said the UK's support would be as 'strong as ever' under his leadership. Calling it a 'privilege' to speak to Mr Zelensky, who had earlier sent him congratulations, Mr Sunak tweeted: 'Both he and the Ukrainian people can count on the UK's continued solidarity and support. 'We will always stand with Ukraine.' Mr Zelensky, in a tweet, called it an 'excellent conversation' with the pair agreeing to 'write a new chapter' in relations between the two countries. Speaking outside Number 10 on Tuesday, the new Prime Minister referenced Russia's invasion of Ukraine twice, saying: 'Putin's war in Ukraine has destabilised energy markets and supply chains the world over.' In recent days, Biden appeared to publicly criticise short-lived PM Liz Truss's doomed economic strategy, in a rare intervention by the US President. Relations between the two countries have also been somewhat strained in recent years amid ongoing UK-EU tensions over post-Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland, with White House concerns over the impact on peace in the region. The issue appears to have come up in the call, according to details released by Downing Street, as well as the war in Ukraine and the rising power of China. President Zelensky congratulated the Prime Minister on his appointment and wished him a happy Diwali. The Prime Minister thanked him and said he hoped they would see each other in person soon.' In his congratulatory message to Mr Sunak earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron also said the two countries would work together to tackle the challenge of the war in Ukraine. Ms Truss was widely criticised after she declined to say whether Mr Macron was a 'friend or foe' when asked during the previous Tory leadership contest. Mr Macron later suggested it was a 'problem' if Britain could not call itself a friend of France. A Downing Street spokesperson said: 'President Biden congratulated the Prime Minister on his appointment and the leaders looked forward to working closely together. 'President Biden said that the UK remains America's closest ally, and the Prime Minister agreed on the huge strength of the relationship. 'The leaders discussed the extent of UK-US cooperation, both bilaterally and in regions such as the Indo-Pacific where the AUKUS pact forms part of our efforts to enhance stability and counter China's malign influence. 'They reflected on the leading role our countries are playing in supporting the people of Ukraine and ensuring Putin fails in this war. 'The Prime Minister and President Biden also agreed on the need to ensure the people of Northern Ireland have security and prosperity through preserving the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. 'The leaders looked forward to meeting in person at the upcoming G20 Summit in Indonesia.' The spokesperson added that Sunak's call with Zelensky had been 'to underline the United Kingdom's steadfast support for Ukraine'. 'The Prime Minister said the United Kingdom's support for Ukraine would be as strong as ever under his premiership, and President Zelensky could count on his Government to stand in continued solidarity. 'The Prime Minister also noted the importance of the International Atomic Energy Agency's work in Ukraine to ensure nuclear safety and provide transparency around any disinformation. 'Both leaders agreed on the need to continue to place pressure on Putin's barbaric regime through continued economic sanctions.' Ms Truss eventually hailed the French President as a friend when the pair met at the first summit of the European Political Community in Prague. In his message to Mr Sunak, Mr Macron tweeted: 'Congratulations to Rishi Sunak, who has become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. 'Together we will continue working to tackle the challenges of the moment, including the war in Ukraine and its many consequences for Europe and the world.' The new PM received a host of congratulations from other world leaders during his first day in office. From Italy, newly-installed Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that she was 'eager to cooperate with (Sunak) and his cabinet on the common challenges, standing for our shared values of freedom and democracy.' 'I look forward to our further cooperation and partnership in NATO and (the) G7 as close friends,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz tweeted. Maros Sefcovic, the European Union's point man on post-Brexit ties with Britain, said that 'a positive EU-UK relationship is of strategic importance'. He vowed to work towards 'a partnership in full respect of our agreements' - including the contentious issue of British province Northern Ireland's land border with EU-member Ireland. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said that 'in these testing times for our continent, we count on a strong relationship with the UK to defend our common values'. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said that with Sunak 'as the first Prime Minister of British-Asian descent and the youngest in about 200 years, these milestones will be especially inspiring for young people' in the Commonwealth, the association mostly of former British colonies. 'We seek to deepen our partnership with Britain' to address challenges including terrorism, food insecurity, energy and climate change, Buhari added. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not wait for Sunak to be officially appointed, sending congratulations via Twitter on Monday. 'As you become UK PM, I look forward to working closely together on global issues,' Modi wrote. 'Special Diwali wishes to the 'living bridge' of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership,' he added. Sunak is married to an Indian, Akshata Murty, the daughter of the co-founder of IT giant Infosys. The Prime Minister also made time to speak with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, in a stark contrast with Ms Truss who was strongly criticised for failing to speak with Mr Drakeford in her time in office. It is expected that the first meeting of Mr Sunak's new-look Cabinet could come as soon as this morning, in what would amount to a gathering of Sunak allies, former Truss backers and figures too from the right-wing of the party. A No 10 source said that the new Cabinet 'brings the talents of the party together' and that it reflects a 'unified party'. The coming days are likely to bring details of what policies Mr Sunak might pursue alongside continuing Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, as the pair ponder how to fill the multi-billion pound fiscal black hole inherited from the Truss administration. Sunak will face off against Labour leader for his first PMQs today. His government's fiscal statement is still scheduled for October 31, but there is speculation that date could shift."
2022-10-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11354095/Russia-warns-U-S-start-nuclear-exercises-Biden-tells-Putin-not-use-nukes.html,Russia warns the U.S. it will start nuclear exercises THIS WEEK as Biden tells Putin he will be making a 'serious mistake' if he uses a 'dirty bomb' - and can't guarantee if it's a 'false flag operation',"Russia has formally told the United States that it is about to start exercises with its nuclear forces, officials said Tuesday, at a time of heightened tension over Ukraine amid claims and counterclaims that one side or the other was planning to use a dirty bomb. To underscore the high stakes, President Joe Biden warned Moscow it would be making a serious mistake if it chose to use tactical nuclear weapons. It follows alarm that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready for one last brutal roll of the dice as his forces face setbacks in Ukraine. Moscow has claimed, without evidence, that Ukraine is preparing to use a 'dirty bomb' - a conventional explosive packed with radioactive material - on its own soil as part of a false-flag operation to blame Russia. Against that backdrop, Russia announced it is about to start its 'Grom' exercises - Russian for 'thunder' - which will likely include test launches of ballistic missiles. 'The U.S. was notified and, as we've highlighted before, this is a routine annual exercise by Russia,' spokesman Air Force Brigadier General Patrick Ryder told a news briefing. 'So in this regard, Russia is complying with its arms control obligations and its transparency commitments to make those notifications.' The annual maneuvers typically include more than 10,000 service personnel, hundreds of launchers and more than 100 aircraft. This year they come with added baggage. At the White House, Biden was asked about worries Russia was preparing to use battlefield nuclear weapons. 'Russia would be making an incredibly serious mistake for it to use a tactical nuclear weapon,' he said after getting an updated coronavirus booster shot. 'I'm not guaranteeing you that it's a false flag operation yet. I don't know. 'But it would be a serious, serious mistake.' Meanwhile, Russia continued making its case. It took its claims to the United Nations Security Council. Moscow sent a letter detailing the allegations to the United Nations on Monday, and then raised the issue at a closed meeting with the Security Council. 'We're quite satisfied because we raised the awareness,' Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy told reporters. 'I don't mind people saying that Russia is crying wolf if this doesn't happen because this is a terrible, terrible disaster that threatens potentially the whole of the Earth.' With Ukrainian forces advancing into Russian-occupied Kherson province, threatening a major defeat for Moscow, Russian officials phoned their Western counterparts on Sunday and Monday to communicate their allegations about a dirty bomb. Energoatom, which operates the country's four nuclear power plants, said that Russian forces have carried out secret construction work over the last week at the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, pictured (file image) Western and Ukrainian security officials have rubbished the claims. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the allegation showed Moscow was planning such an attack with an explosive device laced with radioactive material, and seeking to blame Kyiv. And on Tuesday Ukraine's energy watchdog said that it assumed the Russians are preparing a terrorist act at an occupied power plant which could contaminate hundreds of square miles. Energoatom, which operates the country's four nuclear power plants, said Russian forces have carried out secret construction work over the last week at the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. The company said in a statement that Ukrainian staff were being denied access to the plant or monitors from the UN's atomic energy watchdog that would allow them to see what the Russians are doing. And it has today said that it believes the Russians are preparing a terrorist act using nuclear materials and radioactive waste stored at the plant. It said that there were 174 containers at the plant's dry spent fuel storage facility, each of them containing 24 assemblies of spent nuclear fuel."
2022-10-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11353395/Democrats-battle-response-Putin-letter-urges-Biden-launch-talks.html,Chaos as progressive Pramila Jayapal WITHDRAWS letter from colleagues including AOC urging Biden to start direct negotiations with Putin - and blames STAFF for sending it out after backlash from Democrats,"The chair of the House progressive caucus Rep. Pramila Jayapal and the House Progressive Caucus suddenly withdrew their support for a letter urging negotiations with Russia over Ukraine after blowback from fellow Democrats and an uproar for how the letter went out. 'As Chair of the Caucus, I accept responsibility for this. Because of the timing, our message is being conflated by some as being equivalent to the recent statement by Republican Leader [Kevin] McCarthy threatening an end to aid to Ukraine if Republicans take over,' the Washington lawmaker said in a statement. Her statement also blamed aides, saying it was 'released by staff without vetting.' 'The proximity of these statements created the unfortunate appearance that Democrats, who have strongly and unanimously supported and voted for every package of military, strategic, and economic assistance to the Ukrainian people, are somehow aligned with Republicans who seek to pull the plug on American support for President Zelensky and the Ukrainian forces,' she said in a statement, speaking for a group that includes prominent Democrats such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. 'The letter was drafted several months ago, but unfortunately was released by staff without vetting,' she said. The U.S. has provided billions of military aid to Ukraine, with bipartisan support, although there have been some signs of fraying. McCarthy told Punchbowl news last week: 'I think people are going to be sitting in a recession and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) responded with a statement reaffirming U.S. support for Ukraine. Jayapal's withddrawal statement came after fellow Democrats blasted the letter after it was reported in the Washington Post. It came at a time when Russia was relentlessly hitting Ukrainian civilian targets, in what the U.S. has identified as Iranian-made drones. 'This letter is an olive branch to a war criminal who's losing his war. Ukraine is on the march. Congress should be standing firmly behind @JoeBidens effective strategy, including tighter - not weaker! - sanctions,' wrote Massachusetts Rep. Jake Auchincloss. The group's letter urged Biden take a 'proactive diplomatic push, redoubling efforts to seek a realistic framework for a cease fire.' it cited the risk of the use of nuclear weapons, the danger of 'catastrophic escalation,' and said it was in the interest of the U.S., Ukraine and the world to avoid a 'prolonged conflict.' That came as news to some Biden loyalists, who have undertaken diplomatic efforts but also called on Russia to end its war on Ukraine and withdraw from its neighbor's territory. Just how the letter got put together and put out was still unraveling, with multiple signers say they signed on this past summer. 'Timing in diplomacy is everything. I signed this letter on June 30, but a lot has changed since then. I wouldn't sign it today. We have to continue supporting Ukraine economically and militarily to give them the leverage they need to end this war,' wrote Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.). Rep. Marc Pocan (D-Wis.) addressed an online critic of the letter, writing: 'Hear you. First, this was written in July & I have no idea why it went out now. Bad timing. Second, it was trying to get to a cease-fire & diplomacy as others were banging war drums, not criticizing Biden. Third, I've supported the efforts & will continue. Over analyzed by some.' He was responding to University of Wisconsin professor Yoshiko Herrera, who wrote: 'Big problems with this letter from democratic members of Congress, including my own congressman @RepMarcPocan, to @POTUS. It asks the Biden admin to do some things that it's already doing and to do others that are counterproductive.' Jayapal's withdrawal came after she tried to clarify the situation with another letter. In that statement, she said: Let me be clear: we are united as Democrats in our unequivocal commitment to supporting Ukraine in their fight for their democracy and freedom in the face of the illegal and outrageous Russian invasion, and nothing in the letter advocates for a change in that support.' She called diplomacy 'an important tool that can save lives,' adding: 'but it is just one tool. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) responded to a tweet about the release of the letter four months after it got circulated. 'Once in a while they do [get circulated this way] and it's very frustrating,' she wrote. 'Once you sign on to a letter, it’s up to the original drafters and unfortunately not all of them will keep folks updated. That’s why some of us don’t sign on to letters without direct insight into when or how it will be released.'"

2022-10-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11353879/Wall-Street-bonuses-set-plunge-22-amid-inflation-war-Ukraine-rising-rates.html,"Wall Street bonuses forecast to plunge 22% from bumper 2021 that saw average bankers' pay hit $516,000, because of rocketing inflation, rising interest rates and Ukraine war","Wall Street bonuses are forecast to fall 22 percent compared to last year's numbers, thanks to soaring inflation, rising interest rates and the war in Ukraine. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli warned the average $516,000 payout given to bankers in 2021 could drop by $113,642 this year, to an average of $403,137. That is more than five-times the average salary handed to private sector workers. Last year's figure was a huge surge from the average $438,450 payouts awarded in 2020. The United States' economy roared back post-COVID last year, but is now facing a seemingly inevitable recession, thanks to soaring inflation, rising interest rates deployed to combat inflation, and the Ukraine war. Across Wall Street, investment-banking fees plunged from their 2021 records as the markets for mergers, acquisitions and initial public offerings dried up. Average bonuses for bankers working in securities industries hit $257,500 'The last two years of profits and bonuses fueled in part by the extraordinary federal response to the pandemic were not sustainable,' DiNapoli said. A slump in bonuses spells bad news for NYC, which gleans huge sums in tax revenue from well-paid financial services workers based in the Big Apple. They account for 16 percent of New York's economic output. 'As the sector slows down in 2022, leading firms are reviewing staffing and office space needs and a prolonged downturn could negatively impact state and city coffers,' DiNapoli added. Financiers can expect leaner times this year. Wall Street firms have set aside 6.5 percent less for compensation in the first half of 2022 as pretax profits halved to $13.5 billion, DiNapoli said. Pretax earnings have dropped 56 percent from $31 billion earned in the same period last year. In 2021, the industry handed out the biggest bonuses to employees since 2006 as the economy roared back from the pandemic. Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase paid bumper bonuses for 2021. Goldman's best performing staff saw bonuses increase by between 40 percent and 50 per cent, while JP Morgan upped bonuses for its best-performing staff .Morgan Stanley raised its average bonus by more than 20 percent. Overall, 2021 bonuses on average rose by 20 percent -25 percent, Johnson Associates estimated. A variety of economic events resulted in much weaker market performance this year. In late 2021, the emergence of the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus caused additional shutdowns in manufacturing centers around the globe, exacerbating the ongoing supply chain issues that have accompanied the pandemic since its onset. Meanwhile, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February furthered economic instability in Europe and has added pressure to global prices for a variety of essential commodities, including energy and food. In an already unsettled global economy, these shocks drove U.S. inflation to 40-year highs in June 2022 to 9.1 percent, according to Politico. In a bid to bring down prices by cooling consumer demand, the Federal Reserve aggressively put efforts toward combating high inflation, increasing interest rates five times so far this year. The Fed's multiple rate hikes beginning in March of this year to ease decades-high inflation drove interest expenses up $7.5 billion, triple the first half of 2021. Profits so far in 2022 have returned to the range experienced prior to the pandemic. Challenging market conditions persist, and profits for the third and fourth quarters may see further declines. The Fed's latest projections show its policy rate rising to 4.25 percent - 4.5 percent by the end of the year from the current range of 3 percent - 3.25 percent, further increasing interest expense liability for financial firms. Meanwhile, Wall Street workers remain an important force in New York City, accounting for 16 percent of its economic activity. In 2020, one in 11 jobs in the city was linked to the securities industry, though that had fallen from one in nine in 2019. The drop probably came from fewer workers reporting to offices, which meant fewer customers for restaurants, stores, arts and entertainment venues. The securities industry added 1,600 jobs through September for a total of 181,600 workers. Employment fell 1.9 percent in 2020 and 2021 in the financial industry, compared with a 9.8 percent decline in the broader private sector. Despite the darkening economic outlook, some major U.S. banks have added staff this year, according to their third quarter earnings. It was a 'surprise' to see that banks were adding a few jobs in recent months, DiNapoli told reporters on a conference call. 'We can see that trend going in the opposite direction, but it's too soon to tell right now.' The comptroller's annual report on 2022 Wall Street bonuses will be released in March."
2022-10-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11352493/Russia-says-no-hope-improving-ties-Britain-Rishi-Sunak.html,Russia says there is 'no hope' of improving ties with Britain under Rishi Sunak as Macron and Zelensky are among first world leaders to congratulate the new PM,"Russia has already blasted any hope of improving ties with Britain following Liz Truss's departure, saying there is 'no hope' of an ease in tensions under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the appointment of the former chancellor will do little to repair the damaged diplomatic relationship caused by Vladimir Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine. However, Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the new leader, after forging a strong friendship with Boris Johnson who was unwavering in his support of Kyiv. Peskov said today: 'At the moment, we do not see any preconditions, grounds, or hope that in the foreseeable future there will be any positive changes. 'Russia maintains its openness and readiness to discuss the most difficult issues at the negotiating table. But not to the detriment of its own interests.' Mr Zelensky instead congratulated Mr Sunak and said it was a chance to strengthen ties even further with a key military ally. The Ukrainian President said: 'Congratulations to Rishi Sunak on taking office as British Prime Minister!' 'I wish you too successfully overcome all the challenges facing British society and the whole world today. 'I'm ready to continue strengthening the Ukrainian-British strategic partnership together!' the Ukrainian leader added. Emmanuel Macron also joined in with the chorus of congratulations from world leaders for the new PM. The French President had a tricky relationship with Mr Johnson and Liz Truss, who refused to say whether he was a 'friend or foe'. Mr Macron said today: 'Congratulations to Rishi Sunak... together we will continue working to tackle the challenges of the moment, including the war in Ukraine and its many consequences for Europe and the world.' Elsewhere in Europe, German chancellor Olaf Scholz congratulated Mr Sunak after he became Britain's third prime minister this year, and vowed to continue working closely with London. 'I look forward to our further cooperation and partnership in NATO and G7 as close friends,' Mr Scholz tweeted. From Italy, newly installed Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that she was 'eager to cooperate with [Mr Sunak] and his Cabinet on the common challenges, standing for our shared values of freedom and democracy.' Maros Sefcovic, the European Union's pointman on post-Brexit ties with Britain, said that 'a positive EU-UK relationship is of strategic importance'. He vowed to work towards 'a partnership in full respect of our agreements' – including the contentious issue of British province Northern Ireland's land border with EU-member Ireland. Across the Irish Sea, leaders welcomed the news but cautioned that Sunak must move quickly to resolve an impasse on the Northern Ireland protocol. Prime minister Micheal Martin called on Mr Sunak to move quickly to start substantive engagement with the European Union on post-Brexit trade rules governing Northern Ireland. He said in a statement: 'Building on work already under way, there is a real opportunity for the EU and UK to find jointly agreed solutions on the issues pertaining to the [Northern Ireland] Protocol, and I urge Prime Minister Sunak to move quickly to substantive engagement with the EU on that basis.' Ireland's deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar, who is due to take over as prime minister in December, said he was encouraged by the pragmatism and lack of 'magical thinking' demonstrated by Mr Sunak. Mr Varadkar, who was a key player in trade talks between Britain and the European Union during an earlier stint as prime minister, said however that Ireland would be realistic about Mr Sunak's history as a Brexit supporter. 'I think he has demonstrated during his period as chancellor that he did have a real understanding of the economy and how it works ... and a real concern for businesses and jobs,' he said of Sunak at a press briefing today. 'And I think he has probably demonstrated a lot of pragmatism and less of the magical thinking that we perhaps have seen from some British politicians and I think that is encouraging,' he said. Dublin, however, needs to be realistic in its expectations of a breakthrough due to Sunak's history as an early supporter of Brexit, Mr Varadkar said. Joe Biden also hailed the appointment of Britain's first non-white prime minister as a 'groundbreaking milestone,' but failed to pronounce his name correctly in an embarrassing gaffe. The US President stumbled over Mr Sunak's name, making several failed attempts before calling him 'Rashee Sanook'. In his speech, Mr Biden said: 'And whether it's the United Kingdom, where just today, we've got news that [Rishi Sunak] is now the prime minister. 'As my brother would say, ''go figure!""' he exclaimed, to a round of laughs from the audience. 'And the Conservative Party, expected to become the Prime Minister, I think, tomorrow when he goes to see the King. 'Pretty astounding. A groundbreaking milestone. And it matters, it matters.' Indian prime minister Narendra Modi did not wait for Sunak to be officially appointed, sending congratulations via Twitter yesterday. 'As you become UK PM, I look forward to working closely together on global issues,' Mr Modi wrote. 'Special Diwali wishes to the ""living bridge"" of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership,' he added. Mr Sunak is married to an Indian, Akshata Murty, the daughter of the co-founder of IT giant Infosys."
2022-10-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11352887/Russian-state-TV-pundit-makes-rare-admission-failure-Ukraine.html,"'Russia miscalculated its strength and after eight months still can't win' in Ukraine, state TV pundit says in rare admission of failure - while also doubting Kyiv has a 'dirty bomb'","Russia miscalculated its strength and is losing the war in Ukraine, an expert told state media last night in a rare and risky outburst. Viktor Olevich, a well-known 'Americanist' within Russia and chief analyst at the Centre for Actual Politics, told viewers and a stunned host that Russia 'cannot win' despite eight months of fighting. Olevich, who was schooled in the US but now lives in Moscow, also cast doubt on Russia's claims that Ukraine is building a 'dirty bomb' despite the protests of host Andrey Norkin. While Olevich has a reputation for not always towing the party line, his remarks are none-the-less a stunning admission of failure made in public. He made the remark Monday night as host Norkin asked him about calls between Russia's top brass and their counterparts in the UK and US over the 'dirty bomb'. 'The Americans called us,' Norkin proudly remarked, before adding: 'How does it look, [and] what may come of it?' Olevich said: 'Here is approximately how it all looks. Russia initiated a special military operation, miscalculated its strength, and for eight straight months can't win. 'At the same time, we're complaining and getting upset that our opponents - the same countries that want to neutralise Russia, to dismember and destroy us - don't believe us, don't support us and aren't listening.' Norkin shot back: 'We aren't complaining, we're outraged, I would say.' But Olevich continued: 'We can be outraged and angry until we turn blue, but it will in no way solve our problems.' Turning to the so-called 'dirty bomb' - a charge laced with radioactive material that Russia is claiming Ukraine will detonate on its own soil - Olevich cast doubt on it. 'If there is real information, real evidence, as to where this dirty bomb is located, where they are planning to use it, [then] where are the documents,' he asked. 'Show the documents - these provocations don't happen without orders. If Russia's military intelligence has all this data, it's time to reveal it.' Olevich's doubts chime with Washington and London, which have both said there is no evidence to support Russia's claims and the allegation has caused suspicion that Russia is actually the one about to resort to atomic weapons. Olevich's comments, while not unique, are one of just a handful of protests against the war that Russian TV viewers have got to see since Putin invaded in February. Marina Ovsyannikova, a reporter with Channel One, made it on-air back in March with a sign protesting the war and accusing state TV of lying to viewers. And Mikhail Khodarenok, a retired Russian colonel, has occasionally given a withering assessment of the military's performance. But, at least until recently, full-throated criticism was rare. However, since Russia has been forced back on both northern and southern fronts even the Kremlin's usual sycophants have become critical. While careful not to directly attack Putin, several prominent propagandists have slammed the war effort and suggested those in charge are incompetent. Putin aimed to spend just a few days fighting in Ukraine to topple the government and reassert Russia as a great power state. But instead he has found his military trapped in a grinding war of attrition that has left it badly mauled. He has so-far failed to achieve any of the aims he set for himself - either the seizure of Kyiv or 'liberation' of the Donbas - and is instead trying to hold on to what territory he has managed to take. But even that effort is failing as Ukraine advances through Kharkiv and into the Donbas in the north and east, and in Kherson in the south. Putin's top commander Sergei Surovikin has said the situation in Kherson is 'tense' and hinted that a retreat might be necessary. President Zelensky has said publicly that his military intends to keep pushing all the way to Crimea - which Russia annexed in 2014 - where the war will end."
2022-10-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11351635/Chechen-leader-Kadyrov-slams-Russias-weak-Ukraine-attacks-calls-cities-WIPED-OUT.html,Chechen leader Kadyrov slams Russia's 'weak' attacks on Ukraine and calls for cities to be 'WIPED OUT' as Kremlin doubles down on claims Kyiv plans to set off a 'dirty bomb',"Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov has slammed Russia's 'weak' attacks on Ukraine in the latest show of high profile dissent from one of Vladimir Putin's biggest cheerleaders. The colonel general ordered Kremlin troops to 'wipe out Ukrainian cities off the face of the earth' in a chilling video message on Telegram. The head of the Chechen Republic said Russia should respond with fire and fury to the surge in counterattacks on its border regions. His dire threats come as Moscow doubled down on its warning that Kyiv is preparing to use a 'dirty bomb', amid fears the Kremlin could stage a false flag attack. Kadyrov said: 'We've already declared martial law… but they're not shy, they shoot. I'm very dissatisfied. Our response is weak. 'If a shell comes in our direction, our region, we need to wipe out [Ukrainian] cities off the face of the Earth … so they can't even think of shooting in our direction.' Earlier this month, Kadyrov called for the use of low yield nuclear weapons amid Ukraine's stunning counter-offensive which pushed back Kremlin troops. At the same time, Putin promoted the 46-year-old to colonel general, the third-highest command rank in the Russian military. In the 13-minute video shared today, he said the Kremlin should stop referring to the invasion as a 'special military operation', admitting a full scale war is underway. He said: 'Earlier we said that we were conducting a special military operation on the territory of Ukraine, but already a war - already a war is going on on our territory.' The bellicose leader also believes the West is running out of options and has been weakened by its support for Ukraine and Russia's price gouging. He said: 'There will be no more, no worse. Europe has no strength.' It comes after Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed to his British, French, Turkish and U.S. counterparts over the weekend that Ukrainian forces were preparing a 'provocation' involving a radioactive device - a so-called dirty bomb. Britain, France, and the United States rejected that claim as 'transparently false.' A dirty bomb uses explosives to scatter radioactive waste in an effort to sow terror. Such weapons don't have the devastating destruction of a nuclear explosion, but could expose broad areas to radioactive contamination. Russian authorities have doubled down on Shoigu's warning. Today, Russia's UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said: 'We will regard the use of the dirty bomb by the Kyiv regime as an act of nuclear terrorism. 'We urge the western countries to exert their influence on the regime in Kyiv to abandon its dangerous plans threatening international peace and security.' Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, head of the Russian military's radiation, chemical and biological protection forces, said Russian military assets were on high readiness for possible radioactive contamination. He told reporters a dirty bomb blast could contaminate thousands of square miles. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov emphasized that 'it's not an unfounded suspicion, we have serious reasons to believe that such things could be planned.' Ukraine has rejected Moscow's claims as an attempt to distract attention from its own plans to detonate a dirty bomb. German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht on Monday dismissed as 'outrageous' the Russian claim that Ukraine could use a dirty bomb. Meanwhile, a senior Russian military expert has threatened Britain and the US with full scale nuclear strikes as Moscow froths over its claims that Ukraine is poised to release a 'dirty bomb'. Colonel Igor Korotchenko, editor-in-chief of Russia's National Defence magazine, told state TV that Putin must launch Topol-M attacks on military targets in the two Western countries. Korotchenko claimed on TV such strikes would be retaliatory for what he portrayed as expected NATO action. Russian experts are in a frenzy over claims of a dirty bomb in a supposed false flag to be blamed on Moscow, claiming the West's hand is behind such a scheme. Ukraine and the West suspect Putin's forces are planning a dirty bomb attack intending to blame Kyiv and NATO. 'If NATO goes to war with Russia, we will not be able to limit ourselves to appealing to international law….to the UN charter,' said hardliner Korotchenko in Kremlin-controlled Rossiya-1. Nor would persuasion or intimidation halt the West, he claimed. 'There is only one way. They [the West] must know that if they try to fight with Russia in Ukraine or on our territory, there will be only one answer 'Topol-M - with a [nuclear] warhead…on a military facility in the UK and simultaneously in the US, not on cities.' This should be with high-capacity mono-block warheads to minimise detection. 'And then we will enter negotiations or whatever happens,' he said. 'This is exactly what we have to prepare for, not to threaten…. 'But to be ready with an immediate quick response without any hesitation.' Moscow is scaring its own people with claims the West is threatening nuclear attacks. In fact, it is Russian officials and Putin's extremist war propagandists who almost daily make such threats. On another propaganda show on Channel One,, Korotchenko spooked viewers that Ukraine could acquire from the UK or US a 'low-yield backpack-type nuclear warhead'. A 'terrorist' could 'put this on his shoulders, take somewhere and blow up', he said. Or Ukraine could independently build its own dirty bomb, said the Russian expert. 'The technology is very simple', he claimed, telling viewers that Ukraine possessed 'highly radioactive materials'. Then Kyiv would accuse Putin of striking the country with a tactical nuclear weapon which 'supposedly did not work' properly and 'was rusty'. Defence analyst Mikhail Khodaryonok offered a rare voice of dissent that the UK might be involved in a dirty bomb. 'London is, of course, unlikely to pass on any nuclear technologies to a third party,' he said. 'I think that this can largely be ruled out.' Yet Ukraine could do this independently."

Mr Shoigu levelled the charge over the weekend in calls to British, French, Turkish and US counterparts. But Britain, France and the US have labelled his allegation 'transparently false.' The claim was also dismissed by Ukraine, who said that it was used in an attempt to divert attention from the Kremlin's alleged plans to detonate a dirty bomb, using explosives to scatter radioactive waste in an effort to sow terror. The White House on Monday again said that the Russian allegations were false. John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said: 'It's just not true. We know it's not true. 'In the past, the Russians have, on occasion, blamed others for things that they were planning to do.' Later today, the UN Security Council were set to hold closed-door consultations about the dirty bomb allegations, at Russia's request. The council were asked by Russia to establish a commission to investigate its claims that the US and Ukraine are violating the convention prohibiting the use of biological weapons at laboratories in Ukraine. It comes after Russian ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia claimed in February that secret American labs in Ukraine were engaged in biological warfare. This was a charge denied by the US and Ukraine. The Kremlin has insisted that its warning of a purported Ukrainian plan to use a dirty bomb should be taken seriously and criticized Western nations for shrugging it off. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: 'The dismissal of Moscow's warning is 'unacceptable in view of the seriousness of the danger that we have talked about.' In a conference call with reporters, Peskov added: 'We again emphasize the grave danger posed by the plans hatched by the Ukrainians.' Concerns have been growing in recent weeks that Moscow could order its forces to set off a dirty bomb of its own, place the blame on Kyiv, and use it as justification to further escalate the war with a devastating nuclear strike."
2022-10-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11351643/Democrats-slammed-exceedingly-naive-letter-asking-Biden-negotiate-Putin.html,30 US Democrats are slammed for 'exceedingly naive' letter asking Biden to negotiate with Putin in move that 'rewards his murderous aggression',"'Progressive' Democrats have been slammed for penning an open letter to Joe Biden calling on him to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine with Vladimir Putin. Thirty left-wing politicians - among them Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar - wrote to Biden on Monday saying that 'direct talks with Russia' to 'seek a rapid end to the conflict' should be his 'top priority'. But Mark Hertling, America's former top general in Europe, branded the group 'exceedingly naive' while Bill Browder, a financier targeted by the Russian state, accused them of 'rewarding Putin's murderous aggression.' Within hours the group had been forced to backtrack, but it will do little to assuage fears in Kyiv that the West's support - which has been crucial in halting Russia's bloody assault - could falter as the cost of Putin's war on energy begins to bite. In the letter, a copy of which was published online, the group say they support 'Ukraine's legitimate struggle against Russia's war of aggression' and want to see 'a sovereign and independent Ukraine.' But they also urge Biden to 'explore prospects for a new European security arrangement acceptable to all parties' and to seek 'a negotiated settlement and ceasefire' with the Kremlin. That suggestion caused fury in Ukraine, with journalist Anastasiia Lapatina tweeting that 'Russia does not accept a sovereign Ukraine - how many times does this have to be reiterated?' Her frustration was shared by General Hertling who said Ms Lapatina was 'exactly right' and the politicians had been 'exceedingly naive about this crucial point.' Mr Browder, who ran Russia's most successful venture capital firm until a crackdown by Putin's regime saw his lawyer and friend - Sergei Magnitsky - beaten to death, added that it 'makes my blood boil'. '[They] want the US to reward Putin's murderous aggression,' he added. 'We all know where appeasement goes and it's nowhere good.' Putin launched an all-out war against Ukraine eight months ago having under the guise of protecting Russia for NATO expansion. But, in speeches delivered since then, he has ranted about the 'historical mistake' of allowing Ukraine its independence and vowed to right the wrongs of history that Russia suffered when the Soviet Union collapsed. Putin has asserted that Ukraine has no right to statehood, that Ukrainians and Russians are really one people longing to be reunited, and has sought to demonise any Ukrainian who resists as being in thrall to a 'Nazi' regime in Kyiv. The Russian leader and his media puppets have also posited the war as one against the West, vowing to establish a so-called 'multipolar order' in which Washington would have to kowtow to Moscow. Experts and analysts say any ceasefire negotiated with Putin would simply allow him to freeze the conflict, repair his beleaguered army, and then attack again at a time of his choosing - as he did after the last invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Any guarantee that Moscow gives regarding Ukraine's security would be near-impossible to trust, experts add, because Russia had already agreed never to use force against its neighbour after Kyiv agreed to give up its nukes back in the 1990s. The Kremlin spent weeks in late December and early January vowing it had no plans to invade the country, before launching an all-out assault. Moreover, Ukrainians themselves show absolutely no appetite for ending the war and President Zelensky has vowed never to negotiate with Putin. A Gallup poll conducted a week ago showed 70 per cent of Ukrainians believe their country 'should continue fighting until it wins the war'. Zelensky, meanwhile, said he has nothing to discuss with Putin after the despot annexed the occupied parts of Ukraine to Russia in sham referendums. 'Ukraine will not hold any negotiations with Russia as long as Putin is the president of the Russian Federation,' he said at the time. 'We will negotiate with the new president.' As the war has gone from bad to worse for Putin, he has resorted to energy price wars, attacks on Ukrainian civilians, and nuclear threats in an attempt to fracture the alliances upon which Kyiv relies and break people's will to keep fighting. A third of Ukraine's power plants have been destroyed over the last fortnight in Russian missile and suicide drone attacks, that have left Ukrainians cuddling their pets to keep warm as blackouts plague the country and winter sets in. Meanwhile his throttling of gas supplies by shutting down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline has been driving up the cost of energy in Europe and the US. Missiles and drones have also been used indiscriminately against civilians, killing dozens and wounding hundreds in the last couple of weeks alone. Moscow is now warning that Ukraine is preparing to use a 'dirty bomb' - a charge laced with radioactive material - on its own territory, sparking fears that it is laying the groundwork for its own use of nuclear weapons. Putin has also threatened the West directly with Russia's long-range arsenal, prompting Biden to warn that 'Armageddon' is closer than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis. However, experts including the Atlantic Council's Andriy Zagorodnyuk have argued that the West must not give in to 'nuclear blackmail'. 'The current rush to appease Moscow is deeply unnerving', he wrote last week. 'Giving in to Putin’s nuclear blackmail would not end the war in Ukraine. 'What it would do is set a disastrous precedent that makes a future nuclear war far more likely while encouraging dozens of countries to acquire nuclear arsenals of their own.' Russia is now more than eight months into a war that was supposed to last only a few days, and is struggling to hold on to the meager gains it has made on the battlefield. Ukraine has pushed Moscow's forces back in both the north and south of the country, and is thought to be closing in on the southern city of Kherson. Sergei Surovikin, Russia's top commander in Ukraine, has begun laying the groundwork for a retreat from the city - which is the only regional capital captured by the Kremlin's forces and the main city in a province Putin annexed. Losing it to Ukraine would be the most embarrassing defeat that Putin's army has yet suffered, and open the door to a Ukrainian assault on Crimea - the crowning glory of his last war in Ukraine."
2022-10-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11351457/Fathers-fail-pay-child-maintenance-Russia-sent-Ukrainian-line.html,"Fathers who fail to pay child maintenance in Russia are being sent to Ukrainian front line: Mothers, led by glamour model military pin-up, are telling enlistment officers who to go after, according to Kremlin mouthpiece","Russia is punishing men who refuse to pay child maintenance by sending them to the front lines in Ukraine, according to a Kremlin mouthpiece. One city - Sochi - is responding to pressure from aggrieved mothers and sweeping up men dodging maintenance payments, ordering them to the front, leading Putin TV propagandist Margarita Simonyan has claimed. Then the money to pay alimony is taken from their military earnings as mobilised soldiers, or family compensation if they are killed, and handed to the mothers of their children. Angry Russian women are also taking matters into their own hands by providing to enlistment officers details of their former partners who fail to pay alimony ordered in divorce settlements. TV presenter Dana Borisova, a former Playboy model and Russian army pin-up, is demanding a call-up for her own ex-husband with whom she is in a legal dispute. She and her ex are in a long running legal dispute concerning support for their teenage daughter. 'I have a [...] non-payer of alimony living in my neighbour's house - the father of my daughter,' alleged Borisova, now 46. 'Unfortunately, he did not yet receive a [military] summons. 'I sincerely think that it would be great if he showed responsibility, if not in relation to his daughter, then at least in relation to his country.' She is convinced that 'non-payers can only be taught by being sent to the front line… If not this, then what else can fix them?' At 22, Borisova was hailed as a 'national institution', a pinup for Russian soldiers, credited with raising morale among draftees in a Defence Ministry-backed TV show called Army Store. Later she was the star of reality shows and also posed for Maxim's Russian edition. Other women highlighted by investigative outlet Verstka are reporting defaulting fathers to military enlistment offices. They want to tap into the earnings of mobilised soldiers in Putin's war - around £2,900 a month, four times the national average male earnings, and eight times typical salaries in impoverished regions where many draftees are from. One woman, Lilya Sergeyeva, said her non-paying former spouse had been sentenced to 'corrective labour' for failing to pay maintenance - but this did not help her or their daughter, 17, who he had played no part in raising. Sergeyeva wanted him to serve in the war. 'It will even be good if he gets killed,' she posted. State compensation payouts for relatives of those killed runs to £180,000. Ardent Putin propagandist Simonyan, 42, told on video how loyalist Sochi mayor Alexey Kopaygorodsky, 37, is chasing defaulting father and sending them to the front. She explained: '[The Mayor of Sochi told me that] we took a list of persistent non-payers of alimony from the bailiffs and sent them [to the front]. 'People who do not repay their debt even to their children will now not only do that but also will pay child support from very decent military payments. 'And these people will repay their Motherland. 'The most interesting thing is that we do not see a single complaint from Sochi.' The war on father in arrears was backed by leading Russian music producer Iosif Prigozhin, 53. 'A man should be responsible to a woman, whom he then leaves with a child,' he said. 'It's not enough to learn how to **** - you still need to be responsible. 'I say this as a father of six children.' Russian president Vladimir Putin has been desperate to bolster his army's numbers in recent months, after suffering a series of embarrassing setbacks in the war. Last month, he announced partial mobilisation across the country - with his defence minister saying they were looking to recruit 300,000 troops. The move prompted thousands of Russian men to flee the country, while many reports have said enlistment efforts have focused on marginalised groups and communities away from why Putin considers Russia's heartland. Last week, Putin declared martial law in the four occupied regions of Ukraine, empowering their Russian-installed administrations to step up mobilisation."
2022-10-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11350847/FBI-raid-former-ABC-News-investigative-producer-NOT-related-work.html,Network insiders say FBI raid on former ABC News investigative producer - who was writing a book about Biden's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan - was NOT related to his work,"The 'disappearance' of a former ABC News producer six months ago may not be as mysterious as it initially seemed, according to a new report. James Gordon Meek, 52, was last week reported by Rolling Stone to have vanished. But sources say the veteran journalist quit his job to avoid embarrassment for the network, left his home, and is now living with his mother. They said he 'abruptly' left his job at the news network, withdrew from the book he was co-authoring about Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan, and has kept a low profile ever since. Online, people speculated that Meek's work with classified documents was behind the raid. 'Independent observers believe the raid is among the first—and quite possibly, the first—to be carried out on a journalist by the Biden administration,' the magazine reported. Yet on Monday, the Confider newsletter from the Daily Beast reported that Meek had not disappeared, but was living with his mother. The site reported that Meek resigned from ABC News - which he had joined in April 2013, after working at the New York Daily News - on April 27. He said his resignation was due to 'personal reasons' and told friends it was to 'save colleagues and the company any embarrassment.' The FBI raid on his apartment was the same day. The FBI refused to comment on their raid on his Arlington, Virginia home, but the Justice Department said it was not connected to his work. 'While the department cannot speak to any specific case or activity, the Department strictly adheres to the Attorney General's July 2021 memorandum prohibiting the use of compulsory process with regards to members of the news media acting within the scope of newsgathering activities,' said Dena Iverson, principal deputy director in the DOJ's Office of Public Affairs. ABC News has not investigated Meeks' 'disappearance', the Daily Beast pointed out. A spokesman for ABC News told DailyMail.com last week that Meek resigned 'abruptly' - but they would not be drawn on the details of his departure. 'He resigned very abruptly and hasn't worked for us for months,' they said. Meek worked at ABC for nine years before he suddenly resigned. In the past, he had also served as a senior counterterrorism adviser and investigator for the House Homeland Security Committee. He had also produced a documentary about a separate US military mission in Niger, which he believed exposed a cover-up. Around the same time as the raid on his home, Meek also withdrew from the book about Afghanistan which he had been co-writing with Lt. Col. Scott Mann, a retired Green Beret. The book was published in August with only Lt. Col. Mann listed as the author. A previous description of the book included a line about Meek being contacted by a Special Forces operator overseas. It read: 'In April, ABC News correspondent James Gordon Meek got an urgent call from a Special Forces operator serving overseas.' Now, promotional text for the book has no mention of his name. Instead, the blurb reads: 'In April, an urgent call was placed from a Special Forces operator serving overseas.' Meek has not commented on the saga. His last tweets were on April 27 - the day of his resignation and the raid. Eugene Gorokhov, Meek's attorney, said he knew nothing of any classified documents, but that if Meek did possess them it would have been within the scope of his career as a journalist investigating national security and military operations. 'Mr Meek is unaware of what allegations anonymous sources are making about his possession of classified documents,' he said. 'If such documents exist, as claimed, this would be within the scope of Mr. Meek's long career as an investigative journalist covering government wrongdoing. 'Press inquiries on this issue are troubling for a different reason: they appear to be based on statements from a source inside the government. 'It is highly inappropriate, and illegal, for individuals in the government to leak information about an ongoing investigation.'"
2022-10-25,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11352077/Russian-commander-accused-running-unit-targeting-Putins-missiles.html,Is this the Russian officer behind Putin's 'terrorist' missile onslaught? Commander accused of orchestrating clandestine unit programming targets into Vlad's rockets,"This is the face of the Russian officer accused of orchestrating the Kremlin's brutal missile strike campaign against Ukrainian civilians and power plants. Lieutenant-Colonel Igor Bagnyuk, 40, has been identified by website Bellingcat as the key figure responsible for targeting Putin's missiles including those that blew apart the country on October 10, killing at least 20 and wounding more than 100. Bagnyuk is accused of parlaying orders from his superiors - Major-General Robert Baranov and Colonel Evgeniy Kapshuk - to three teams of engineers who are thought to be responsible for programming targets into the deadly projectiles. In total, Bellingcat identified more than two dozen members of the clandestine missile unit buried within the Russian military's Main Computation Centre of the General Staff (GVC) who they believe are involved in the strikes. President Zelensky has accused Russia of 'terrorism' for blowing up a third of Ukraine's power plants and killing civilians in indiscriminate attacks, which international law defines as war crimes. Bellingcat said it pieced together the identities of this secretive team from personal data including phone records obtained on the Russian black market. Using this information, they devised a command structure for the team with Major-General Baranov at the top, followed by Colonel Kapshuk, Lt-Colonel Bagnyuk and then Lt-Colonel Anton Timoshinov below him. They believe the rest of the team - 27 people in total, mostly in their late-20s - are split into three groups, each of which programs a certain kind of missile. Investigators say Bagnyuk is the key go-between for the leaders of these three teams and the unit's superior officers, with patterns of communication that intensify shortly before major Russian missile strikes on Ukraine. Some of the team have served long-term in the military - either in the army or navy - while others appear to have worked in civilian IT support or programming jobs before signing up. Bagnyuk is believed to have served in Syria, and evidence suggest he also coordinated missile strikes in that country, Bellingcat adds. Investigators believe the October 10 barrage that hit virtually every Ukrainian city may have been planned for weeks and possibly as long as a month beforehand. Call records show increased activity between Bagnyuk and other team members beginning around October 2. That increased steadily over the next fortnight before peaking on October 9, the day before the barrage was unleashed. At 3pm that day, Bagnyuk had called his three team leaders in sequence, before getting a call from his superior Col. Kapshuk around 5.10pm. That sparked two further calls to the team dealing with air-launched cruise missiles, before Bagnyuk called his superior officer back. Bagnyuk then made his way from his suburban home in the outskirts of Moscow to his office at Znamenka 19, the headquarters of the General Staff of Russia's army. He stayed there until gone 9pm, when he made a final call to his chief commander - General Baranov - before heading home. Despite the late night, Bagnyuk was back in the office for 5.30am the next day which was around an hour before the attack took place. Bellingcat said it contacted each member of the unit, most of whom refused to answer questions or denied having anything to do with the military. However, one engineer admitted the unit was tasked with programming complex flight paths for the missiles and provided a photo of the unit outside the Russian MoD building in Moscow. Another did not deny being part of the unit but said it was not safe to answer questions about his work. Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians, despite mounting evidence implicating its troops and commanders in war crimes and possible crimes against humanity. Putin has turned to attacks on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure - particularly power and water plants - as his troops are forced back on the battlefield. Following a rout in Kharkiv, retreat in Kherson, and a strike on the Crimean Bridge, his military has consistently bombed Ukraine's cities and power plants. President Zelensky has said a third of the country's energy generating capacity is currently out of action, with rolling blackouts taking place. That has left Ukrainians - many of whom are living in bombed-out homes - cuddling their pets for warmth as winter sets in and temperatures dip below freezing. Strikes have also indiscriminately targeted civilians, hitting busy intersections, playgrounds, schools and apartment buildings. It is hard to conclusively prove these buildings were deliberately targeted as opposed to falling victim of a misfired rocket or poor targeting data, but a pattern of attacks on residential areas has emerged throughout the war. Bellingcat did pose that question to several members of the unit they contacted, all of whom refused to answer."
2022-10-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11348803/Putins-relatives-concerned-coughing-fits-constant-nausea.html,Putin's relatives 'are concerned about his coughing fits and constant nausea' say 'Kremlin insiders' who claimed he is also suffering cancer,"Vladimir Putin's relatives are concerned about coughing fits, constant nausea and a lack of appetite, it is claimed, after the Russian leader allegedly underwent a medical examination over the weekend. His circle is worried that his 'thinness and persistent cough' is becoming noticeable and will be seen by the elites in Russia as a 'sign of the leader's rapidly deteriorating health', according to Telegram channel General SVR, which has long claimed he is suffering from cancer despite the Kremlin insistence he is in good health. Despite appearing considerably bloated and puffy in the face, the Russian president has lost 18lbs in recent months, said the channel which purports to have sources inside the Kremlin. Today Putin sounded uncomfortable, stifling coughs while speaking in quiet, laboured tones during a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko. He let slip one cough during a discussion about sporting provision in Ukrainian regions he annexed from Ukraine, and hurriedly continued speaking as if trying to cover and move on as quickly as possible. The Telegram channel - which cited no proof for its claims of Putin's ill health - reported: 'Both Putin himself and his relatives, as well as doctors, are worried about the president's coughing fits, as well as constant nausea and lack of appetite due to medication and a specific diet [for] oncology. 'In the past few months, Putin has lost eight kilograms, and those around the president are worried that the thinness and persistent cough that is noticeable in progress will be regarded by the elites as a sign of the leader's rapidly deteriorating health.' Putin was only seen once between Friday and Sunday - the period during which he is said to have undergone a medical examination amid declining health - in an unremarkable online meeting with the governor of former GULAG region Magadan, Sergey Nosov. However, such meetings are often believed to be 'canned' - recorded at an earlier date, edited and then broadcast as though they are live. The General SVR channel has further claimed that Putin is particularly bad tempered over his troops poor performance in the war, berating and then cutting off defence minister Sergei Shoigu during a recent online meeting. Putin resorted to screams and profanities, it was alleged, then cut the call amid a coughing fit. 'After Shoigu was disconnected from participating in the video conference, Putin started talking to other representatives of the leadership of the military bloc, but could not continue due to an attack of severe coughing, so much so that the meeting had to be stopped, and the president needed medical help,' claimed the channel which says it has sources in the Kremlin. Earlier at the meeting Putin was told that the loss of the Su-30 plane - in which two test pilots were killed - was unlikely to have been sabotage. The channel does not specify which of Putin's relatives are supposedly worried about his condition. Ever since Putin ordered his military forces to invade Ukraine on February 24, rumours have been swirling about the state of his health. Over the summer, the Russian president was pictured awkwardly swatting mosquitos from his face with one arm while the other hung limply by his side. Similarly, at a huge Victory Day parade in Moscow in May, the now 70-year-old autocrat appeared to walk with a limp and had a blanket over his lap, while in April he was seen gripping a table during a televised meeting with Shoigu. The General SVR channel has long claimed that Putin is suffering from abdominal cancer, Parkinson's disease and a schizoaffective disorder. Its claims cannot be verified but it was among the first to report in advance the shape of Putin's recent mobilisation strategy. The channel is reportedly authored by an exiled Kremlin lieutenant-general, known by the alias Viktor Mikhailovich. Last week, Putin was pictured during a visit to the Ryazan region southeast of Moscow alongside Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, where he shot a newly developed sniper rifle in what was one of his increasingly rare appearances designed to boost morale of Russian troops. Wearing ear protectors and safety glasses, Putin lay under a net and fired several shots from the Russian SVD sniper. He was also filmed speaking to officers, shaking hands with them and wishing them 'good luck'. The training camp is for newly mobilised Russians, with the state video aimed at boosting moral as the war in Ukraine continues."
2022-10-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11347857/Captured-female-Ukrainian-soldier-reveals-brutal-torture-inflicted-women-Russian-forces.html,"Captured female Ukrainian soldier reveals brutal torture inflicted on women by Russian forces, including beatings with hammers, electric shocks and pouring boiling water over them","Dozens of women rescued in Ukraine's first female-only prisoner exchange have spoken of horrific torture at the hands of Vladimir Putin's forces. The women were beaten with hammers, electrocuted, and had boiling water poured over them, they revealed after they were reunited with their families in Zaporizhzhia. Torturing prisoners of war is considered a war crime under the Geneva Convention. One woman named only as Hanna, 26, a serviceman of the 36th Marine Brigade, was held in captivity for six months and four days. She was a defender at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol and said the forces there would have died had they not surrendered. 'I can't believe it now... I dreamt so many times about being at home...' Hanna said. The servicewoman has not heard from any of her relatives for more than half a year. Hanna told Ukrinform about how the women were treated. 'They beat the girls, they tortured the girls with electric current, beat them with hammers, that's the easiest thing,' she said. 'They hung girls. I don't talk about the food at all, because it was sour. Even the dogs are not given such food.' Her husband is still being held in captivity, and his location is unknown. She has a child in Ukrainian territory occupied by Russians who she has not yet been able to contact. 'Those who had tattoos... they wanted to cut off our hands, cut off the tattoos, scalded us with boiling water just because you exist, because you are a marine, because you speak Ukrainian,' she said. Approximately 96 of the swapped prisoners are servicewomen, including 37 evacuees from Azovstal, whereas 12 are civilians. Some of the women were forced to give interviews to Russian media while in captivity, threatening to beat them if they refused. The women did not know they were being prepared for exchange. They were taken to Taganrog, a Russian city close to the Ukrainian border, before crossing over for the prisoner swap. The Russians had told them they would not be exchanged, and that instead they would be imprisoned until the end of the 'special operation', the Kremlin's name for the War in Ukraine. At the end, they would 'shoot us like dogs', Hanna recalled the soldiers telling them. The women only found out they were being rescued when they began hearing Ukrainian after they were loaded on to the bus. Among those rescued was a military doctor from Azovstal, separated from her 4-year-old child by the Russians during the evacuation on May 8. Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov in south-eastern Ukraine, withstood weeks of relentless Russian bombardment, with resistance concentrated in a dense network of underground tunnels at its Azovstal steel plant. Alisa, her four-year-old, had been living in Poland with her grandparents before being reunited with her mother. None of their possessions were returned, and many of the women will have to start from scratch, but they wept tears of joy after being reunited with their loved ones. The women will undergo medical examination and rehabilitation."
2022-10-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11348615/Rishi-Sunak-set-appoint-Cabinet-TOMORROW-new-PM-faces-monstrous-tray.html,Rishi set to appoint Cabinet TOMORROW as new PM faces monstrous in-tray: Penny Mordaunt touted for Foreign Secretary with Jeremy Hunt to remain as Chancellor - amid speculation Suella Braverman could RETURN as Home Secretary,"Rishi Sunak is set to appoint his Cabinet tomorrow after becoming Britain's new Prime Minister. His win, which came after rival Penny Mordaunt dropped out the Tory leadership race, caps a meteoric rise for the 42-year-old, who only became an MP seven years ago. Mr Sunak is due to travel to Buckingham Palace to meet King Charles tomorrow morning before making his first address to the nation as PM from Downing Street around 11.35am. But, while Mr Sunak might allow himself a celebratory can of his beloved Coca-Cola tonight, he will soon have to get to work in No 10 with a string of challenges awaiting him. The parlous state of the economy, the war in Ukraine, possible elections in Northern Ireland, the Channel migrants crisis and reuniting the Conservative Party are all critical tasks lying in his in-tray. Yet the most immediate duty for Mr Sunak is to choose who will sit around the Cabinet table with him in Downing Street. Ms Mordaunt ended up being Mr Sunak's closest challenger for the Tory leadership and, by convention, she should be offered a job in the new PM's top team. The Royal Navy reservist has already held the role of defence secretary and is currently the Leader of the House of Commons. She is likely to be looking for a move up the Cabinet hierarchy, perhaps to one of the 'great offices of state'. Could foreign secretary suit someone who is a confident media performer? Ms Mordaunt is a former international development secretary so has experience of managing Britain's overseas aid budget, which is now under the remit of the Foreign Office. The most immediate crisis facing Mr Sunak as the incoming PM is the state of the economy in the wake of Ms Truss's mini-Budget disaster. Her second Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has been working on plans to restore market confidence at a planned fiscal statement on October 31. This includes spending cuts and possible tax rises in order to fill a blackhole in the public finances. With financial markets having reacted well to Mr Hunt's appointment and his ripping up of Ms Truss's economic agenda, Mr Sunak will be tempted to keep him in place as Treasury chief. Mr Hunt last night came out in support of Mr Sunak as PM in an article for The Daily Telegraph. The final 'great office of state' could be filled by Suella Braverman, who is popular on the Tory Right, returning as home secretary. Mrs Braverman also used a Daily Telegraph article this weekend to declare her backing for Mr Sunak. Having been touted as a possible successor to Ms Truss herself, it hinted that Mrs Braverman had extracted promises from Mr Sunak on various home affairs issues. This included dealing with the Channel migrants crisis by delivering on the Rwanda scheme and possibly reforming the UK's relationship with the European Convention on Human Rights. If Mr Sunak is keen to keep the Tory Right on side as he enters No 10, why not return Mrs Braverman to the Home Office – a job she only left five days ago? What are the challenges waiting in Mr Sunak's in-tray? ECONOMY Liz Truss's downfall as PM stemmed from her mini-Budget disaster when her announcement of £45billion in unfunded tax cuts prompted meltdown on the financial markets. The price of government borrowing has soared in recent weeks and the Treasury is scrambling to deal with a huge blackhole in the nation's finances. Mr Sunak is likely to have to oversee severe public spending cuts and, perhaps, even tax rises in order to balance the books. He will also have to deal with the continuing cos of living crisis, exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the harmful impact of runaway inflation. As soon as she entered No 10, Ms Truss promised that energy bills for typical households would be frozen at £2,500 a year until 2024. But, after her mini-Budget spectacularly unravelled, she was forced to pull apart that promise with the bills bailout now due to end in April. From that point onwards, financial help is only set to be made available to those most in need. Will Mr Sunak continue to limit help from April? Or will he give the policy yet another rethink in order to prevent millions of Britons being slapped with huge increases in their bills next spring? He will also have to decide whether to increase both pensions and benefits by the rate of inflation, or at a lower level. A 'WINTER OF DISCONTENT' There are fears that disputes between militant trade unions and employers could worsen further as the cost of living crisis continues to bite. Britons have already been forced to endure a series of nationwide rail strikes in recent months, while Royal Mail workers, barristers, port workers and BT staff have also staged walkouts. Teachers are set to be balloted on industrial action, with one union having pencilled in strikes from January. And the Royal College of Nursing is also threatening a walkout in a dispute over pay. Will Mr Sunak pursue a hardline stance on public sector wages at a time of spending restraint? Or will he not want to risk public anger over weeks' or months' worth of disruption? UKRAINE The most severe threat to global security remains Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Vladimir Putin continuing his brutal assault on his country's neighbour. There are fears the Russian president's barbarism could escalate further if the conflict continues to go against him and his desperation increases. Mr Sunak will be under pressure to continue Britain's staunch support for Kyiv, while also keeping in mind how he would react should Putin decide on more drastic action. He will also face continued demands from Tory MPs to boost defence spending, having refused to commit to a target of raising it to 3 per cent of GDP. CHINA Relations between Britain and China have deteriorated further after a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the Chinese consulate grounds in Manchester and beaten up. With an ever-growing number of Sino-sceptics among Tory MPs, how Mr Sunak deals with Beijing is set to be an important test of his premiership. CHANNEL MIGRANTS Mr Sunak has committed to continuing the Government's bid to send migrants who enter the UK illegally to Rwanda. The £120million scheme has still yet to get going, amid a series of legal challenges, despite it being announced back in April. Former home secretary Priti Patel unveiled the plans as a means of clamping down on the number of migrants making perilous journeys to Britain across the Channel. Mr Sunak will have to decide how he will push forward with the scheme, including possibly overhauling Britain's relationship with the European Convention on Human Rights. And, if the scheme continues to stall, the PM will have decide on what further action to take to try to stem the number of migrants arriving in small boats. NORTHERN IRELAND New elections are due in Northern Ireland if there is no return to a power-sharing government before Friday. The DUP is currently blocking the functioning of Stormont institutions as part of their protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. But the party is under pressure to end their boycott while resumed talks between the UK Government and the EU over the Protocol continue. Mr Sunak will hope that increased positivity around the state of those negotiations with Brussels will soon lead to a breakthrough in the Protocol row. This should then, hopefully, allow power-sharing to resume in Northern Ireland ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement next year. US President Joe Biden is said to be planning a trip to the UK and Ireland to coincide with the anniversary. UNITE THE TORY PARTY After two divisive leadership elections this year and months of bitter infighting between MPs, Mr Sunak faces a huge task in trying to unite the Conservative Party behind him. If he fails to do so, it is not impossible that the Tories could seek to junk yet another leader before the next general election. When he abandoned his sensational comeback bid last night, Boris Johnson raised the possibility that he could still chase a return to No 10 at another date. 'I believe I am well placed to deliver a Conservative victory in 2024,' the ex-PM said. Mr Sunak faces an immediate question over how to handle Mr Johnson, who obviously believes his career in frontline politics is not over. The new PM hinted at a possible foreign diplomacy job for Mr Johnson, saying last night: 'I truly hope he continues to contribute to public life at home and abroad.' OVERHAUL LABOUR'S POLL LEAD The Tories are currently staring at political oblivion on the basis of current opinion polls, which have given Labour huge leads amid the chaos of Ms Truss's premiership. Can Mr Sunak turn the Tories' fortunes around, even as he faces all the numerous challenges listed above?"
2022-10-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11348419/Russia-faces-inevitable-defeat-Kherson-former-head-UK-armed-forces-says.html,Russia faces 'inevitable defeat' in Kherson as elites 'scramble to negotiate with the West and position themselves to replace Putin',"Russia is staring down the barrel of an 'inevitable defeat' in the city of Kherson, the former head of Britain's armed forced has said. General Lord Dannatt, former chief of the general staff, said Putin's forces are in the midst of a 'managed withdrawal' from the regional capital - in southern Ukraine - to avoid a chaotic rout of the kind they suffered last month in Kharkiv. Meanwhile the country's elite are trying to negotiate an end to the war with the West because they realise they have lost, according to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence branch, Kyrylo Budanov. Kremlin insiders are also plotting to seize power from Putin with Nikolai Patrushev, the security council secretary, and Sergey Kiriyenko, Vladimir's domestic policy tsar, among the frontrunners, Budanov added. Ukraine is plotting with the UK to create a nuclear 'dirty bomb' to use on its own territory, Russia has implausibly claimed today. Kyiv plans to use spent fuel from its nuclear plants and British know-how to create a device capable of spreading radioactive contamination over 'thousands of square meters', according to the Russian MoD. The blast will be blamed on Russia to justify an escalation in fighting, the ministry added. It came as Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov, head of Russia's radiation defence forces, vowed his men are ready to fight through fallout. Ukraine and its allies - the UK and US included - say Kyiv has no nuclear weapons or and does not intend to create any. They say Russia's talk of a nuclear blast may be intended to cover up Putin's own use of atomic weapons, and have warned of 'devastating' consequences if he choses to detonate one. Lord Dannatt, speaking to Sky News this morning, said Russia remains 'on the back foot' on the battlefield in Ukraine and is targeting infrastructure as a result. The situation is particularly critical in the southern city of Kherson, which Ukraine has been attacking since early August. Sergei Surovikin, Putin's new overall commander in Ukraine, has been hinting at a retreat in recent media appearances. Lord Dannatt said; 'The Russians are obviously thinking about trying to turn what is probably an inevitable defeat there into some kind of managed withdrawal to make it appear less chaotic.' Mr Budanov painted a slightly different picture in an interview with Ukrainska Pravda, saying the Russians are only withdrawing civilians and related infrastructure - such as banking machines and cash stores. Putin's commanders are actually moving troops into the city and preparing defences, and they plan to try and keep control, he added. But they also know that if they lose control of the nearby dam at Nova Kakhovka they will lose their only route of retreat out of the city, Mr Budanov added, and may have to make a quick decision about whether to flee. Surovikin's comments are designed to lay the groundwork for that retreat in the event it is ordered at short notice, he said. Losing Kherson - the only regional capital captured by Putin's troops, which he declared to be Russian territory just weeks ago - would be the most embarrassing loss of the war to date. Mr Budanov said annexing the regions had hugely backfired for Putin, and sent some of his elites scrambling to negotiate with the West because they realised the hopelessness of the situation. 'The higher military and political leadership began to carry out massive strikes... in order to force negotiations,' he said. 'It won't work. 'Others ran to negotiate, as they say, with Western countries. How to negotiate? To say: ""We're powerless here, it's not us. But we're ready for changes, it all has to stop.""' In-fighting to replace Putin also 'definitely got worse' after the annexation, Mr Budanov added, with public faith in the leadership being eroded as more and more 'Russian' territory is liberated by Ukraine. Asked who could replace Putin, Mr Budanov put forward two names: Nikolai Patrushev and Sergey Kiriyenko. Patrushev is a former director of the FSB who has served as secretary of the security council since 2008. He is a staunch Putin ally, and hostile to the West. His name is frequently put forward as a likely successor. Kiriyenko served a short and disastrous tenure as Russia's youngest prime minister after being appointed to the post aged 35 in 1998. But during that time he did appoint Putin as head of the FSB, who returned the favour and saved Kiriyenko's political career when he became president in 2000. Kiriyenko is now known as Putin's domestic policy tsar and has reportedly been entrusted with overseeing the annexation of occupied Ukraine. Putin's war in Ukraine has now lasted for eight months, after what was supposed to be a days-long 'special military operation' spectacularly backfired. Russia has instead found itself fighting a grinding war of attrition with its neighbour which has seen its army mauled and almost none of its objectives achieved. Having given up advancing almost everywhere except the eastern town of Bakhmut, Putin now appears to be trying to cling to what territory he has managed to take. He has called up Russia's military reserves - some 300,000 men - to plug gaps on the frontline as Ukraine pushes to re-take territory before winter sets in. As well as being pushed back towards Kherson, Ukraine has also managed to liberate a swathe of territory near Kharkiv, in the north. Troops are now pushing further to the west, into Luhansk, in an attempt to out-flank the offensive in Bakhmut. It is thought the Ukrainian game plan would then be to push south, towards Crimea, before re-taking the peninsula - which is hugely important to Russia. President Zelensky has declared that the war will end on the peninsula, and Mr Budanov said he believes that moment could come as soon as next summer."
2022-10-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11348411/Russia-claims-Ukraine-final-stage-creating-dirty-bomb.html,Russia claims Ukraine is in the 'final stage' of creating a 'dirty bomb' as Kyiv's top general admits Zelensky's office is worried that Putin plans nuclear strike,"Russia has claimed Ukraine is in the 'final stage' of creating a 'dirty bomb', further raising fears that Moscow will carry out a false flag attack. The claim came as Kyiv's top general admitted President Volodymyr Zelensky's office is 'worried' about the threat posed by Vladimir Putin's nuclear weapons. Concerns have been growing in recent weeks that Moscow could order its forces to set off a dirty bomb of its own, place the blame on Kyiv, and use it as justification to further escalate the war with a devastating nuclear strike. Following a series of embarrassing battlefield setbacks, the Russian despot issued a thinly veiled threat late last month that he would be willing to resort to using nuclear weapons. Nuclear sabre rattling has also come from other Russian hardliners. On Monday, the Kremlin stood by its allegation that Ukraine may be preparing to detonate a so-called dirty bomb, which disperses radioactive material. 'According to the information we have, two organisations in Ukraine have specific instructions to create a so-called 'dirty bomb'. This work is in its final stage,' Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov claimed in a statement on Monday. Ukraine, the United States, Britain and France have dismissed Moscow's claim. General Oleksandr Syrskiy, commander of Ukraine's ground forces, did not mince his words when assessing the threat posed by the nuclear weapons at Putin's disposal. 'We are and should be worried,' he told ABC news in an interview released Monday. Syrskiy, who won the battle for Kyiv in the spring, and the battle of Kharkiv in September, said that he was confident Ukraine was winning the war which is about the 'survival of our people'. 'Of course, I think we are winning. Because first and foremost, we are winning the psychological battle,' he said. 'We have success on the battleground, but the war is difficult.' The blistering Ukrainian counteroffensive, that forced the Russians out of lands they seized in the more industrial north, has now reached the agricultural south. Kherson, the southern region's main city, was the first to fall to Moscow's troops in the invasion's early days and retaking it would be a major prize for Kyiv. But as Ukraine continues to add to its victories, Russia is getting more desperate. Russia has intensified its strikes on Ukraine, particularly on energy facilities, after the bridge linking the annexed Crimea peninsula to mainland Russia was partially destroyed by an explosion this month. Last week, Putin declared martial law in four occupied regions, empowering their Russian-installed administrations to step up mobilisation. Compelling civilians to serve in the armed forces of an occupying power is defined as a breach of the Geneva Conventions on conduct in war. While he is confident Ukraine was winning the war, Syrskiy stressed the importance of pressing on, saying that there is 'no other option but to win'. 'We know what we are fighting for,' he told ABC. 'There hasn't been any wars at that scale in Europe, or elsewhere in the world, since the Second World War. 'And we understand that this war is about the survival of our people and our state and this is why we have no other option but to win,' Syrskiy added. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu made the claim that Ukraine is developing a dirty bomb in phone calls with his counterparts from the United States, Britain, France and Turkey over the weekend. The Russian Defense Ministry said Shoigu voiced concern about 'possible Ukrainian provocations involving a ""dirty bomb"",' a device that uses explosives to scatter radioactive material. Such a device doesn't have the devastating effect of a nuclear explosion, but could expose broad areas to radioactive contamination. The Russian Defence Ministry and the Kremlin didn't publicly offer any specific information to back up its claim. But speaking during Monday's call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted that Shoigu's warning reflected a real threat. 'Their distrust of the information that has been provided by the Russian side doesn't mean that the threat of using such a dirty bomb doesn't exist,' Peskov said. 'Such a threat exists, and the defence minister has given the information about it to his interlocutors. It's up to them whether to trust it or not.' Western allies said they reject 'Russia's transparently false allegations' and warned they would 'see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation' - suggestion Russia could be preparing for a 'false flag' attack. Ukraine's top diplomat urged the U.N. nuclear watchdog to immediately send an inspection team to the country to counter Moscow's claim that Kyiv is preparing a 'provocation' involving a dirty bomb. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Monday he made the request in a call with Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Kuleba said Grossi agreed to send a team of inspectors, adding that 'unlike Russia, Ukraine has always been and remains transparent. We have nothing to hide.'"
2022-10-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11348273/Su-34-bomber-smashed-Russian-building-killing-15-caused-two-SEAGULLS.html,"SEAGULLS caused one of Putin's warplanes to crash into Russian residential building, killing 15, it is revealed as new footage of Su-34's final seconds emerges","The Russian Su-34 which smashed into an apartment block last week in a huge fireball killing 15 people malfunctioned after seagulls entered the engine, investigators have said. The fighter-bomber was taking off from an airfield in the southern Russian city of Yeysk, near the border with Ukraine, on Monday evening when it plunged from the sky moments later with one engine on fire — slamming into the ground in front of an apartment block and dousing the building in burning fuel. Both pilots ejected safely, with footage showing one of them on the ground nearby still attached to his parachute. Investigators probing the crash say it was caused by two seagulls entering the engines during takeoff. TASS news agency was told: 'Their remains were found by experts while examining the wreckage of the aircraft.' It comes as remarkable new footage has emerged showing the terrifying final seconds before the warplane flew into the apartment block. The video is formed from a car, with a woman's voice telling the driver: 'Sasha get out of here, fast…!' Then she sees people fleeing for their lives and tells him to take care. 'People, there are people,' she says. 'Careful not to knock anyone down…' The footage shows the low-flying bomber at 18:16 and 56 seconds, we see the plane entering the frame from the right. It apparently has an on board fire. At 18:17.00 there is a loud bang coinciding with the pilots ejecting. 18.17.02, the plane hits the yard of the apartment block and erupts in a fireball. Afterwards as people fled, reports say explosives were heard from the crash site. The plane had ammunition on board which exploded when the aircraft hit the yard of the apartment block. The crewmen may have ejected after they realised a crash was inevitable and could not fly the plane away from the residential building. The death toll in the apartment block has hit 15, including three children and three adults who jumped from a burning apartment block after a Russian military jet crashed next to the building and set it on fire. The Russian military said the men were taking part in training when the crash happened and the stranded pilot can be heard denying the craft was shot down as people try to help him. The crash was yet another humiliating loss for Putin's beleaguered air force, which has now suffered ten non-combat crashes since the start of the war. His pilots have also failed to destroy Ukraine's much smaller air force and are limited to operating behind Russian lines after failing to take out Kyiv's air defences. Footage of the pilot lying on the ground also appears to capture the sound of explosions in the background, sparking rumours on Russian social media that the plane was flying a combat mission and ammunition detonated after it came down. But Krasnodar regional governor Veniamin Kondratyev denied this, saying the explosions were fuel tanks bursting. Russian outlet Zvezdanews reported the fire was extinguished with the help of 410 firefighters and emergency services personnel. Deputy governor Anna Minkova said additional beds were being prepared for injured civilians, adding: 'Specialists of the burn department from regional clinical hospitals have been sent to Yeysk.' Putin was informed of the fire and ordered 'all necessary assistance be given to casualties from the military plane incident', the Kremlin told state-run news agency TASS. The plane narrowly missed a kindergarten with 150 children. The Russian ministry of defence said: 'On October 17, 2022, while climbing to perform a training flight from the military airfield of the southern military district, a Su-34 aircraft crashed. The aircraft crashed within the city of Yeysk. 'According to the report of the ejected pilots, the cause of the plane crash was the ignition of one of the engines during take-off. 'At the site of the crash of the Su-34 in the courtyard of one of the residential areas, the fuel of the aircraft ignited.' In a similar blow to Putin, another Russian fighter pilot was forced to eject from his burning plane moments before it crashed and exploded. Newly-released helmet camera footage captures the pilot bailing out of an Su-25 jet as it spirals out of control, believed to be over Belgorod, in Russia, back in June. It is thought the jet in question had clipped a nearby power line, breaking off one of its tail fins and causing it to plunge to the ground. But pro-Ukraine sources claimed it had actually been shot down. Russian war bloggers had reported the crash at the time it happened, along with footage of the plane's wreckage burning in a field. They said that 'according to preliminary data, the aircraft hit a power line pole.' But new video released for the first time on Sunday captures the crash from the pilot's point of view. The footage appears to start moments after the aircraft was struck - either by some kind of anti-aircraft missile or a power line. The jet begins to twist in the air as the pilot loses control, before the aircraft turns sideways and rolls upside down. Halfway through the roll the pilot ejects - capturing an astonishing glimpse of his own plane as it flies away into the distance. Parts of the aircraft are breaking off as it falls and there is a fire in one of the engines. Half of the rear upright tail fin appears to be missing. There are 'V' war makings on the fuselage, and a red '09' number on the side. Online observers believe the plane is likely to be an Su-25SM aircraft based out of Russia's far east that had been relocated to Ukraine to fight in the war. The pilot's parachute is seen deploying before he floats back down to earth as his jet slams into the ground several hundred yards away and explodes. On Sunday, an Su-30 plane taking part in a training flight over Irkutsk - eastern Russia - nose-dived into the ground, killing both of its pilots. Those airmen have since been named as Maxim Konyushin, 50 and a renowned test pilot, and Major Viktor Kryukov, 43. The exact cause of the crash remains a mystery, though information has emerged that both pilots may have blacked out in the cockpit. A second plane was sent up to make contact with the doomed aircraft after it failed to respond to calls from the Irkutsk Aviation Plant and began circling on autopilot. The aircraft is though to have circled 'for a considerable period' before their fuel ran out and the plane plunged to earth. The crew of the second plane saw the pilots 'with their heads hanging down low, in other words, they both blacked out', a source at the testing plant said. The insider told SibReal media that shocking safety abuses were common at the plant - one of Russia's major aircraft manufacturers. 'Given the quality of pre- and post flight checks, I am not surprised at all,' said the source. Boxes were ticked but safety measures were not carried out properly. 'Clearly if both pilots fainted simultaneously, something was wrong with the cabin's [air pressure]'. Yet another eyewitness disputed that account, saying: 'I watched it fly. The plane soared sharply upwards, and then began to fall, like a stone, downwards.' Air Force major Andrei Krasnoperov said that a fault was likely with oxygen on the plane. But experts cited by Readovka media disputed that the plane was on autopilot and had run out of fuel, since its engines were heard functioning when it crashed. 'There was no attempt to straighten the flight line by the pilots during the crash, which confirms the version of at least unconsciousness of the people on board,' said the report. 'Fighter pilots have to wear oxygen masks during the whole flight, so system malfunction might have been the cause of unconsciousness.'"
2022-10-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11347965/Russians-blamed-spate-SPEED-CAMERA-thefts-Sweden-stripped-drones.html,"Russians are blamed for spate of SPEED CAMERA thefts in Sweden, which can be stripped for parts to build or repair drones","Working in the dead of night, thieves are ripping out scores of sophisticated speed cameras from roadside poles across Sweden - but who is behind the mysterious thefts? One bizarre theory that has emerged is that Russia is behind the vanishing act and is using the Swedish speed cameras to build home-made drones that are being deployed to Ukraine. Swedish officials were left scratching their heads after 70 of Sweden's distinctive blue fartkameror, which are used to enforce limits of 70-90 km/h, went missing over an eight day period in August in Stockholm and Uppsala. The night-time attacks stopped in September - but picked up again this month with 80 more speed cameras, which cost 250,000 Swedish kronor (£19,780) each, ripped out. The devices contain the highly-sophisticated camera, a flash, radar and a processor - all of which could be used in a drone. Russia has now been blamed for the attack after the recent discovery of a camera of a similar type to that found in Swedish speed cameras was found in a home-made Russian drone that was sent to spy on Ukraine. Ukraine's Ministry of Defence has previously posted a video online of a crashed Russian drone being taken apart. It showed a Canon camera, similar to that used in Sweden's speed camera, attached to the drone with a strip of Velcro. Swedish police said that speed cameras have been vandalised in Sweden in the past - but sporadically and by disgruntled drivers who have been handed a speeding ticket. But the sheer scale of these targeted attacks on the speed cameras has prompted some to theorize that Russia could be behind it. Lars Wilderang, author of a popular Swedish military blog, has speculated that the crippling technology sanctions imposed on Russia by the West has forced Moscow to find creative solutions to access components that they can use for military equipment. 'The thieves come from somewhere, but the buyers come from someone else,' Wilderang said. 'You don't do these kinds of big systematic thefts unless you have someone ordering the products.' Local police say that the systematic thefts are completely different to what they have seen before. Jonas Eronen, a police spokesperson for Region Mitt, where there has been a spate of speed camera thefts, told New York Times that previous vandals would be 'someone who's mad because they got a speeding ticket'. They would 'either spray paint the lens or knock it over,' he added. 'But in the past few weeks someone has systematically broken into these cabinets and plundered the contents, taking the camera and throwing the rest on the ground near the crime scene,' Eronen said. Hans Liwang, associate professor at the Norwegian Defence Academy, told Swedish media it was possible the stolen cameras could find their way into Russian drones through a growing black market. But there remains scepticism about whether Russia are using Sweden's speed cameras, which contain customised Nikon cameras, to build or repair their drones as Ukraine has only found drones with Canon cameras. The Nikon cameras used in Sweden take pictures from 50 feet away, meaning that the lens will be out of focus at any other distance. 'It’s not possible to adjust this, according to our supplier. Not easily, at least,' said Eva Lundberg, national coordinator for the traffic camera system at Trafikverket, the country’s transport agency."
2022-10-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11347963/Putin-propagandist-called-Ukrainian-children-DROWNED-apologises-begs-job.html,Putin propagandist who called for Ukrainian children to be DROWNED 'apologises' as he begs to keep his job as a presenter on Russia's state-funded RT channel following outcry,"One of Vladimir Putin's leading propagandists has apologised and pleaded to keep his job after launching a 'genocidal' diatribe on air in which he called for Ukrainian children to be drowned. Anton Krasovsky, 47, is both a star presenter and a director of broadcasting with RT, one of Russia's top state-owned news channels headed up by infamous editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan, currently subject to Western sanctions. Putin's pundits regularly advocate decimating Ukraine or laying waste to the West with nuclear weapons across multiple state TV channels. But Krasovsky's savage rant on drowning Ukrainian children caused horror even among his own chiefs. 'Just drown those children, drown them in the Tysyna [River],' he said in recorded TV comments that were not edited. 'You throw them in the river with a strong undercurrent… Shove them right into their huts and burn them.' He was promptly suspended from RT by Simonyan and even faces possible criminal action after the head of the Russia's Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin - a former university classmate of Putin's - ordered an investigation into his remarks. Krasovsky today issued an apology to anyone he had offended and openly begged his boss to allow him to come back to work - though he stopped short of retracting the comments. 'Listen, I feel truly uneasy about somehow missing that red line [in what I said] about the children,' the RT director of broadcasting said. 'Sometimes it happens that you get carried away while on air and you cannot stop. 'I apologise to everyone who got stunned by this. I beg Margarita [Simonyan] to pardon me. And I apologise to all those who saw this as wild and unthinkable. 'I hope you can forgive me.' Simonyan - who usually exchanges loving messages and warm praise with Krasovsky - said his TV comments were 'savage and disgusting'. 'Perhaps Anton would explain himself by saying what temporary insanity it was caused by, and how it slipped off his tongue,' she said, adding: 'It is hard to believe Krasovsky truly thinks children should be drowned. 'As of now I am suspending our co-operation, because neither myself, nor the rest of the RT team can allow even a hint of thought that any of us can share such nonsense.' Despite having personally advocated for a Russian crackdown in Ukraine, Simonyan concluded: 'To the children of Ukraine, as well as to children of Donbas and to all other children, I wish for it all to end as soon as possible, so that they can live peacefully and study in the language they consider to be their mother tongue.' Krasovsky made his vile comments during an interview with Sergei Lukyanenko, a Russian sci-fi author who also holds aggressively anti-Ukrainian views. In the horrifying footage of the interview, Krasovsky makes a series of statements suggesting he would kill the Ukrainian children and uses an offensive slur throughout. Krasovsky comments came in response to Lukyanenko's account about how, when he first visited Ukraine in the 1980s, children told him they would live better lives were it not for Moscow occupying their country. As he spoke, Krasovsky was seen lifting his fist and mimicking how he would drown children. 'That's not your method - you sci-fi writers are intelligent people - but it is our method', he told Lukyanenko with a smirk. Krasovsky went on to declare that all Ukrainians should be killed, and that he would burn them alive in their homes and shoot them. In a short segment of the interview, shared on social media, Krasovsky also laughed at reports that Russian soldiers had raped elderly Ukrainian women during the invasion. Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called for a global ban on RT in the wake of the shocking interview. He said on Twitter: 'Governments which still have not banned RT must watch this excerpt. 'This is what you side with if you allow RT to operate in your countries. 'Aggressive genocide incitement (we will put this person on trial for it), which has nothing to do with freedom of speech. Ban RT worldwide!' Responding to Krasovsky's suspension, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford said that his comments are 'just the tip of the iceberg' and that 'hate speech is the now the norm on Russian state-TV when it comes to Ukraine'. Krasovsky has previously aired vile comments on TV without censure. On TV protester Marina Ovsyannikova - a former editor who interrupted a live state television news bulletin holding an an anti-war sign, he said: 'The bitch should be jailed for ten years.' He has previously referred to Ukrainians as 'animals' in broadcasts. Russian media continues to bombard people with anti-Ukrainian messaging, with analysts warning hatred against Ukrainians in Russia could be embedded for generations. In a recent broadcast, a pair of pro-war pundits claimed Ukrainians are 'mentally sick' Russians who will later recover and understand the errors of their ways. One journalist, Sergei Mardan, asked rhetorically: 'Who exactly is our enemy? It has not been outlined by anybody in the past seven months. For some inexplicable reason, our bosses are shy about it… 'They regularly repeat ritual mantras about [Russians and Ukrainians being] one people.' War reporter Vladlen Tatarsky then replied: 'What are Ukrainians? I suddenly understood it. A Ukrainian is a Russian who got mentally sick… 'A Ukrainian is a Russian spiritual transvestite who is trying to squeeze into another skin. 'I was always interested - when was this moment when they shifted from a healthy Russian person… into total schizophrenia? 'The future of Ukraine, those people who live there, is that they are Russian people and they will return to their normal state. 'When we win in Ukraine, the future of these people is that they are Russian people who ho recovered from their craziness, their spiritual transvestism, and returned to their normal state.'"

Anton Krasovsky, 47, has since been suspended by the Kremlin-backed channel, a move commentators have described as 'too little too late' as anti-Ukrainian rhetoric in Russia escalates and becomes increasingly violent. The Director of Broadcasting has made vile comments previously and is considered extreme even amongst supporters of Putin's war. Krasovsky, who is a senior journalist at RT, made the comments during an interview with Sergei Lukyanenko, a Russian sci-fi author who also holds aggressively anti-Ukrainian views. In the horrifying footage of the interview, Krasovsky makes a series of statements suggesting he would kill the Ukrainian children and uses an offensive slur throughout. Krasovsky made the comments in response to Lukyanenko's account about how, when he first visited Ukraine in the 1980s, children told him they would live better lives were it not for Moscow occupying their country. 'They should have been drowned in the river, right there where the duckling swims. 'Just drown those children, drown them in the Tysyna (river),' he says. 'You throw them in the river with a strong undercurrent.' As he speaks, Krasovsky can be seen lifting his fist and mimicking how he would drown children. 'That's not your method, you sci-fi writers are intelligent people, but it is our method', he tells Lukyanenko with a smirk. He later says - with a grin on his face - that all Ukrainians should be killed, and that he would burn them alive in their homes and shoot them. Krasovsky makes other violent threats throughout the rest of the interview, including saying that Ukraine is 'not supposed to exist at all' before asking 'should Ukraine remain on the map of the world at all'. In a short segment of the interview, shared on social media, Krasovsky also laughed at reports that Russian soldiers had raped elderly Ukrainian women during the invasion. Following extensive backlash, RT suspended the TV host. The channel's Editor-in-Chief, Margarita Simonovna Simonyan, described his statement as 'wild and disgusting'. 'Perhaps Anton will explain what kind of temporary insanity it was caused and how it broke from his tongue. 'It is hard to believe that Krasovsky sincerely believed that children should be drowned. 'For now, I'm stopping our collaboration, as neither I nor the rest of the RT team can afford to even think that any of us are capable of sharing such a game. I'm confused what to say. 'For the children of Ukraine, as well as for the children of Donbass, and for all other children, I wish that all this ends as soon as possible, and that they can live and study in peace again - in the language they consider native.' Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has since called for a global ban on RT. He said on Twitter: 'Governments which still have not banned RT must watch this excerpt. 'This is what you side with if you allow RT to operate in your countries. 'Aggressive genocide incitement (we will put this person on trial for it), which has nothing to do with freedom of speech.

Newly-released helmet camera footage captures the pilot bailing out of an Su-25 jet as it spirals out of control, believed to be over Belgorod, in Russia, back in June. It is thought the jet in question had clipped a nearby power line, breaking off one of its tail fins and causing it to plunge to the ground. But pro-Ukraine sources claimed it had actually been shot down. Russian war bloggers had reported the crash at the time it happened, along with footage of the plane's wreckage burning in a field. They said that 'according to preliminary data, the aircraft hit a power line pole.' But new video released for the first time on Sunday captures the crash from the pilot's point of view. The footage appears to start moments after the aircraft was struck - either by some kind of anti-aircraft missile or a power line. The jet begins to twist in the air as the pilot loses control, before the aircraft turns sideways and rolls upside down. Halfway through the roll the pilot ejects - capturing an astonishing glimpse of his own plane as it flies away into the distance. Parts of the aircraft are breaking off as it falls and there is a fire in one of the engines. Half of the rear upright tail fin appears to be missing. There are 'V' war makings on the fuselage, and a red '09' number on the side. Online observers believe the plane is likely to be an Su-25SM aircraft based out of Russia's far east that had been relocated to Ukraine to fight in the war. The pilot's parachute is seen deploying before he floats back down to earth as his jet slams into the ground several hundred yards away and explodes. It is just the latest embarrassing incident involving one of Russia's fighter jets. On Sunday, an Su-30 plane taking part in a training flight over Irkutsk - eastern Russia - nose-dived into the ground, killing both of its pilots. Those airmen have since been named as Maxim Konyushin, 50 and a renowned test pilot, and Major Viktor Kryukov, 43. The exact cause of the crash remains a mystery, though information has emerged that both pilots may have blacked out in the cockpit. A second plane was sent up to make contact with the doomed aircraft after it failed to respond to calls from the Irkutsk Aviation Plant and began circling on autopilot. The aircraft is though to have circled 'for a considerable period' before their fuel ran out and the plane plunged to earth. The crew of the second plane saw the pilots 'with their heads hanging down low, in other words, they both blacked out', a source at the testing plant said. The insider told SibReal media that shocking safety abuses were common at the plant - one of Russia's major aircraft manufacturers. 'Given the quality of pre- and post flight checks, I am not surprised at all,' said the source. Boxes were ticked but safety measures were not carried out properly. 'Clearly if both pilots fainted simultaneously, something was wrong with the cabin's [air pressure]'. Yet another eyewitness disputed that account, saying: 'I watched it fly. The plane soared sharply upwards, and then began to fall, like a stone, downwards.' Air Force major Andrei Krasnoperov said that a fault was likely with oxygen on the plane. But experts cited by Readovka media disputed that the plane was on autopilot and had run out of fuel, since its engines were heard functioning when it crashed. 'There was no attempt to straighten the flight line by the pilots during the crash, which confirms the version of at least unconsciousness of the people on board,' said the report. 'Fighter pilots have to wear oxygen masks during the whole flight, so system malfunction might have been the cause of unconsciousness.' They called for the criminal probe of the Russian Investigation Committee to examine 'the details of the accident and determine exactly what happened, since the currently available information does not allow making any specific conclusions'. It comes shortly after another Russian jet - a Sukhoi 34 fighter-bomber - plunged into an apartment block in the city of Yeysk and exploded, killing at least 13 people. Ten people burned to death inside the building including three children, while another three died jumping from the roof rather than perish in the fire. Both pilots ejected safely. The Russian military said the men were taking part in training when the crash happened, denying some of the deaths were caused by exploding ammunition. The crash is yet another humiliating loss for President Putin's beleaguered air force, which has now suffered eleven non-combat crashes since the start of the war."
2022-10-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11347727/Blinken-slams-Russian-accusations-Ukraines-impending-use-dirty-bomb.html,Antony Blinken slams Russian accusations of Ukraine's impending use of a 'dirty bomb' and accuses Putin of 'continuing to push in the opposite direction of peace talks',"US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has slammed Russia following its accusations that Ukraine was planning to deploy a radioactive bomb in occupied territory. Blinken tweeted on Sunday that he had spoken to Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba regarding the allegations and confirmed he had 'rejected Russia's false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory'. It comes after the Secretary of State earlier this week accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of 'doubling and tripling down' on his aggression towards the neighboring country. 'Every indication is that far from being willing to engage in meaningful diplomacy, President Putin continues to push in the opposite direction,' he said at a press conference with his French counterpart Catherine Colonna. Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu this weekend spoke with his British, French and Turkish counterparts to convey 'concerns about possible provocations by Ukraine with the use of a dirty bomb,' - a weapon that uses traditional explosives to contaminate an area with radioactive waste. But Ukraine swiftly dismissed Moscow's allegations as 'dangerous lies', with the United States, Britain and France also issuing a joint statement on Sunday rejecting Russia's 'transparently false' claims. Earlier on Sunday, Kuleba also denounced Moscow's claims as 'absurd' and 'dangerous'. 'Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves,' he added, before tweeting about his call with Secretary Blinken. 'We both agreed Russia's ''dirty bomb'' disinformation campaign might be aimed at creating a pretext for a false flag operation,' Kuleba wrote. 'We also discussed further practical steps to boost Ukraine's air defense. Secretary affirmed the US spares no effort to this end.' Moscow said Shoigu had also spoken to US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, but the Pentagon said Austin had 'rejected any pretext for Russian escalation' in the phone call. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile called for a united international response. 'If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,' Zelensky said in a video address on social media. 'I believe that now the world should react as harshly as possible.' In Washington, National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said President Joe Biden's administration dismissed Moscow's 'transparently false allegations'. And the UK Ministry of Defense said: 'Minister Shoigu alleged that Ukraine was planning actions facilitated by Western countries, including the UK, to escalate the conflict in Ukraine. '[British Defense Secretary] Wallace refuted these claims and cautioned that such allegations should not be used as a pretext for greater escalation.' Russia announced Sunday it had destroyed a depot in central Ukraine that was storing over 100,000 tonnes of aviation fuel. Kyiv's energy operator said scheduled power cuts had been introduced in the capital due to Russia's repeated strikes on Ukraine's power network, and urged residents to use electricity sparingly. More than one million Ukrainian households have lost electricity following recent Russian strikes and at least a third of the country's power stations have been destroyed ahead of winter, according to officials in Kyiv. Zelensky condemned the strikes as 'vile'. The intensification of Russian strikes on Ukraine, particularly on energy facilities, came after the bridge linking the annexed Crimea peninsula to mainland Russia was partially destroyed most likely by Ukrainian forces earlier this month. It was another major setback for Moscow, whose troops are battling to contain a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south and east of the country. Speaking in Rome on Sunday at the start of a peace conference, French President Emmanuel Macron said that it was for Ukrainians to decide when 'peace is possible'. Ukraine reported three deaths in an overnight Russian artillery strike in the Toretsk area, a governor of the eastern Donetsk region said. Inside Russia, two lines of defense have been built in the border region of Kursk to deal with any possible attack, a local governor said Sunday. And defense structures are also being built in the neighboring Russian border region of Belgorod after two civilians were killed there in strikes Saturday and thousands were left without electricity, according to governor Vyacheslav Gladkov. Ukraine's SBU intelligence service said it had detained two officials of Ukrainian aircraft engine maker Motor Sich on suspicion of working with Russia. The SBU said management at the company's plant in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region - partly controlled by Russian forces - had colluded with Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec. The suspects had supplied Russia with Ukrainian aircraft engines that were used to make and repair attack helicopters, the SBU said. In the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, which Russia claims to have annexed, pro-Moscow officials have urged residents to leave amid Ukraine's counteroffensive. Kherson, the region's main city, was the first to fall to Moscow's troops in the invasion's early days and retaking it would be a major prize for Kyiv. Around 25,000 people have already left Kherson city to the left bank of the Dnipro River, according to Kremlin-installed officials. Ukraine has denounced the removal of residents from Kherson, describing them as 'deportations'."

Olena Zelenska, who married the Ukrainian president in 2003, spoke out as she visited some of the million refugees who have fled to cities including Frankfurt. Pleading for more air defence weapons this weekend, she said: 'In the situation of Ukraine, we are forced to use every chance to be heard. We must close the sky and stop this deliberate missile terror of Russia.' Ms Zelenska also met her German counterpart, Elke Budenbender, and raised the issue of providing more weapons. She added: 'I am forced to raise the topic of providing weapons to Ukraine. This should not be a topic of protocol communication between first ladies.' On Saturday, she told an audience at an event organised by German women's magazine Brigitte in Frankfurt that her role demands she 'tell the truth' about the horrors faced by Ukrainians, adding: 'We are fighting for our lives.'"
2022-10-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11349481/Russia-probably-paying-Iranian-drones-nuclear-research-assistance-Zelensky-warns.html,"Russia is 'probably' paying for Iranian drones with nuclear research assistance, Zelensky warns as he slams Israel's neutral stance on the war","President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned Russia is 'probably' paying for Iranian drones with nuclear research assistance, as he slammed Israel's neutrality in the war. At a conference organised by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Mr Zelensky said: 'I have a question for you, how does Russia pay Iran for this, in your opinion? Is Iran just interested in money?' He continued: 'Probably not money at all but Russian assistance to the Iranian nuclear programme. Probably, this is the exact meaning of their alliance.' Mr Zelensky also on Monday said the decision by Israeli leaders not to support Kyiv had encouraged Russia's military partnership with Iran. The Ukrainian president said Russia ordered around 2,000 drones from Iran, the same kind that Kyiv says Moscow has been using in its recent attacks against Ukraine. 'The disgusting sound of Iranian drones is heard in our skies every night. According to our intelligence, Russia ordered about 2,000 'Shaheds' from Iran,' Mr Zelensky said during a speech at a conference organised by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. It was not immediately clear if he was referring to Russia's past purchases or new ones. Mr Zelensky also said 'Iranian instructors came to teach Russians how to use drones' in Ukraine. On Israel's neutral stance, he told the conference: 'This alliance of theirs simply would not have happened if your politicians had made only one decision at the time... it seems that it was adopted a long time ago - in 2014, when Russia began its aggression against Ukraine,' 'The decision 'not to annoy' the Kremlin, not to help Ukraine for real,' enabled the alliance between Moscow and Tehran, Mr Zelensky said. Mr Zelensky has on several occasions criticised Israel for failing to firmly oppose Russian aggression. The Israeli position has however evolved over recent months, from near neutrality to more forceful condemnations of Russia. Still, on Monday, Israeli defence minister Benny Gantz told his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksiy Reznikov that 'Israel will not provide weapon systems to Ukraine.' Mr Zelensky's speech came a few days ahead of legislative elections in Israel, on November 1. This comes after Britain, the US and France claimed that Iran's export of 'kamikaze drones' to Russia, which have been deployed in multiple attacks on Ukrainian urban and civilian centres, violates a key UN security council resolution and a landmark 2015 nuclear deal. On October 17, a US State Department spokesperson said: 'Earlier today our French and British allies publicly offered the assessment that Iran's supply of these UAVs (for) Russia is a violation of UN Security Council resolution 2231. This is something that we agree with.' Resolution 2231 endorsed the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - that limited Tehran's uranium enrichment activity, making it harder for Iran to develop nuclear arms while lifting international sanctions. Under the resolution, a conventional arms embargo on Iran was in place until October 2020, but Western diplomats said the resolution still includes restrictions on missiles and related technologies that last until October 2023 and that encompass the export and purchase of advanced military systems such as drones. Iran has not confirmed the delivery of its drones to Russia, and the Kremlin has not confirmed their use in Ukraine. The attacks prompted Ukrainian citizens to protest outside of the Iranian embassy in Kyiv, waving their national flag and demanding that the Iranian government cease the delivery of more deadly drones to Russia. Hanged paper planes were also seen in front of the Iranian Embassy during the protest against Iran's allegedly supply of drones on October 19. Andrii Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, confirmed in a social media post that Shahed drones were among those used in the strike. Iran has previously denied providing Russia with weapons, although its Revolutionary Guard chief has boasted about providing arms to the world's top powers, without elaborating. The drones have also been repeatedly used by Russia elsewhere in Ukraine in recent weeks to target urban centres and infrastructure, including power stations. They are comparatively cheap, costing in the region of £17,730. Their use in swarms presents a challenge to Ukrainian air defences, said Ihnat, the Air Force spokesman. Western nations have promised to bolster Ukrainian air defences with systems that can shoot down drones but much of that weaponry has yet to arrive and, in some cases, may be months away. Ukraine has accused Moscow of using Iranian-made drones as part of multiple deadly strikes that Russian forces launched across Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces used both missiles and Iranian-built drones - believed to have been sent from Belarus - to strike his country. With a range of more than 600 miles, the explosive-laden drones can 'loiter' above potential targets for hours before being slammed directly into enemy soldiers, vehicles or buildings from above - causing an explosion. Reports coming out of Ukraine suggest the drones have inflicted serious damage to Kyiv's forces, as well as Ukrainian infrastructure. Ukrainians who have witnessed attacks by the drones say they make a recognisable noise, and have described them as sounding like 'motorbikes' in the air, while some soldiers have taken to calling it 'the flying lawnmower'. While the drones can be devastating to their targets, soldiers have said they a vulnerable to small arms fire. On Saturday, the General Staff of the Armed forces of Ukraine released a video on Facebook showing a smoking wreckage that it claimed to be one of the drones. The post said it had been shot down by a machine gun. 'This is a primitive handmade product,' Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFERL) last week. 'It's not a high-tech conveyor-belt production like the [Turkish-made] Bayraktar or American and Israeli [unmanned aerial vehicles],' he added. Ukrainian residents described the drone attacks to RFE. 'You can hear the roar. First, I just hear them, but then I saw one fly by and then explode,' one man said. Another said: 'There was a buzz that woke me up. I remember thinking: 'What's that?' The sound was approaching and then there was an explosion near the house.' According to reports, the first recorded use of the drones was in Yemen in Houthi-controlled areas. Iran is reported to have sold hundreds of the drones to Russia. Tehran has denied that it is selling the deadly munitions to the Kremlin, but there is mounting evidence that Moscow's armies have been using them since September against the Ukrainian military to make up for a lack of artillery firepower. Ukrainian military officials say the drones are cheaper and less sophisticated than cruise missiles - but can have a similarly devastating affect on their target. There are concerns among Ukraine's military leaders that if they are not supplied an effective counter-measure, the drones could destroy western-supplied artillery, which have successfully been used to push Russian forces back east. The almost 12-foot long Shahed 136 is designed with a delta-wing shape, with stabilising rudders at the top of the aircraft. The explosives are contained in the nose of the drone, as well as the technology that guides it to its targets for a precision strike. The engine, meanwhile, is found at the rear of the drone, and drives two bladed propellers. It has been compared to an engine one would find on a lawnmower or a moped. 'Its motor sounds like a [motorbike]. You can spot it when it's a few kilometres away,' a Ukrainian soldier named only as Magyar told RFE. 'That's my advice to the military. They fly low and are slow, so you can shoot them down,' he said, noting the drones are usually used against larger targets. 'They carry such a load of explosives that it doesn't make sense to use them against infantry.' Overall, the drone weighs 440lbs, and can fly at speeds of almost 120mph. In order to overwhelm air defences, several of the drones (batches of five and above) are launched at once from the same rack. They are fired almost horizontally with rocket-launch assistance. The rocket is jettisoned on take-off, with the engine taking over once it is airborne. On Friday, Oleksandr Starukh - the regional governor of Zaporizhzhia - said such drones damaged facilities in the city. On Wednesday, other Ukrainian officials said the drones were used to target the town of Bila Tserkva - 50 miles south of Kyiv. The attacks destroyed several buildings in the town, Newsweek reported."
2022-10-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11350271/Ukraine-slams-Emanuel-Macron-broker-peace-talks-Vladimir-Putin.html,Ukraine slams Emanuel Macron over move to broker peace talks with Vladimir Putin,"Ukraine has issued a slap down to Emmanuel Macron after he urged Western leaders to negotiate ‘around a table’ with Russian despot Vladimir Putin. Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to the Ukrainian president, blasted the French leader for telling Volodymyr Zelensky to consider talking to the Kremlin dictator as the country’s towns and cities are being attacked. Speaking to the Daily Mail in Kyiv, Mr Podolyak said Mr Macron displayed ‘a total misunderstanding’ of the Russian tyrant’s invasion, saying such a move would only play into Moscow’s hands. The French president used a speech in Italy late on Sunday to call on his Ukrainian counterpart to rethink his stance that peace talks with Putin are impossible. ‘It is more important for Macron to understand the soul of the Ukrainian people and know that they will never get on their knees for Russia,’ Mr Podolyak said. ‘If he wants to see children dying, and waiting before giving extra help, OK let him wait. But Ukraine will still resist.’ The 50-year-old former journalist accused the French president of making the same mistakes as his predecessors, Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande, in dealing with Putin. Both men tried to broker peace deals after Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014, which failed to dissuade Putin from launching the war against its neighbour. ‘It’s very strange behaviour by the French,’ Mr Podolyak said. ‘Macron cannot depart from this conservative, traditional European mentality. ‘Any continuation of the negotiating process with Russia will only mean the continuation of war in the future and intensifying the war,’ he added. Mr Macron told a conference in Rome that any talk of peace should not be taken as a sign of appeasement to Russia. ‘Let’s not let peace be hostage to Russian power,’ he said. ‘Peace will be built with the other... around a table.’ Earlier this month Mr Zelensky signed a decree which formally declared the prospect of any Ukrainian talks with the Kremlin despot directly ‘impossible’, but left the door open to talks with Russia. Ukrainian officials said negotiations with Putin would never happen after Moscow claimed to have annexed four occupied Ukrainian regions in a series of rigged referendums. They have also cited the emergence of evidence of possible war crimes committed against their troops and civilians as a reason not to sit down with Russia. Mr Macron has tried to position himself as a possible peacemaker, holding several phone calls with Putin in a bid to broker a deal. However the French president caused uproar in Kyiv in June when he insisted the Ukrainian government and its Western allies ‘must not humiliate’ Russia in any possible negotiations to end the war. But senior sources close to Mr Macron insist France backs Ukraine’s bid to regain control of all of its territory, including the occupied Crimea and Donbas regions. His defence minister Sebastien Lecornu joined the UK and the US on Sunday in dismissing Russian claims Ukraine will use a so-called dirty bomb in the battle for the key southern city of Kherson. Western officials believe the Kremlin could use a nuclear weapon in a desperate bid to deter them from supplying Ukraine with modern weapons, intelligence and training. Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov said: ‘Lies about a “dirty bomb” Ukraine is supposedly preparing to use is an element of the Kremlin’s usual tactics. ‘The one where Russian criminals try to pre-emptively blame the victim of aggression for their own crime.’ The Ukrainian military has launched its counter-offensive to retake Kherson, a port city which is the gateway to occupied Crimea and was seized by Russia in the early days of the invasion. Kyiv’s armed forces have already managed to claw back large swathes of its territory from Putin, including last month’s successful push in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. Faced with a series of humiliating defeats, Russia has been striking civilian targets and key energy infrastructure to destroy Ukraine’s power grid ahead of winter."
2022-10-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11350489/Boris-Johnson-continue-backing-Ukraine-Russia-war.html,"Boris Johnson will continue his backing for Ukraine in Russia war by making sure new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak maintains UK's strong support, friends say","Boris Johnson is set to keep his promise to his friend Volodymyr Zelensky and keep flying the flag for Ukraine following his aborted Downing Street bid. After leading the international response to Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion, Mr Johnson plans to keep up the pressure on the Russian leader. Allies of the former PM yesterday promised that he would hold Rishi Sunak’s ‘feet to the fire’ over Ukraine to make sure the UK’s commitment does not slip. He is also said to be planning visits to Washington to ensure there is no back-sliding from US President Joe Biden or other Western nations. And Mr Johnson’s allies say his decision to pull out of the Tory leadership race on Sunday does not mean his career in frontline politics is over. He could become a thorn in the side of his former chancellor from the backbenches thanks to a determination to make sure his flagship levelling-up agenda remains on course. Interventions could include critical speeches in the Commons chamber and visits to ‘Red Wall’ seats, long held by Labour, in the North and Midlands that he snatched in the 2019 election. ‘He’s interested in maintaining his legacy on levelling up and protecting the 2019 feeling that something unique was happening when we were winning in places that we have never won before,’ one ally said. It may force Mr Sunak to offer Mr Johnson a frontline role to neutralise any threat. The ally also didn’t rule out a return to No 10, saying: ‘He still thinks the job’s not done.’ However, one of his first priorities will be to clear his name in the Partygate investigation being conducted by the privileges committee. It is considering whether Mr Johnson deliberately misled the Commons over Downing Street parties when Covid-19 lockdown measures were in place and is due to start hearing evidence, including from Mr Johnson, within weeks. It could prove hugely embarrassing for the ex-PM and if he is found to have deliberately misled Parliament – which he denies – he could be suspended as an MP. As that would fall under the Recall of MPs Act, it could even trigger a by-election and see Mr Johnson ousted from his Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat – potentially ending his political career. Yesterday it was confirmed by the backbench 1922 Committee that he had reached the threshold of support from 100 MPs that was needed to reach the final ballot for a showdown with Mr Sunak. Some of his supporters were angered by his decision to pull out, saying they felt ‘betrayed’ after publicly backing him. But Nadine Dorries, a former culture secretary and one of his staunchest allies, said he ‘did the right thing’, insisting: ‘That doesn’t mean it’s the end of Boris Johnson.’ In his statement on Sunday night, Mr Johnson hinted he could still lead the Tories into a general election, saying he still has ‘much to offer’ but that ‘this is simply not the right time’. Will Walden, who was Mr Johnson’s director of communications when he was mayor of London, said he had further destabilised the Conservative Party and predicted ‘he won’t be back’. However, one MP who backed Mr Johnson said: ‘I’d never count him out of making a comeback. You never know with him.’"
2022-10-24,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11349177/Putins-state-TV-mouthpieces-say-racist-Ukrainians-wont-love-Sunak-like-did-Boris.html,Russia v Rishi: Putin's state TV mouthpieces say 'racist' Ukrainians won't love Sunak like they did Boris but UK 'will still want to destroy Russia' under his leadership,"Kremlin state TV propagandists have wasted no time in taking a swipe at Britain's new prime minister Rishi Sunak. Olga Skabeyeva, known as Putin's Iron Doll, blasted the new Conservative leader, saying 'racist' Ukrainians won't show him the same love they showed Boris Johnson. Speaking on state-run Rossiya 1, the presenter said: 'Of course, London's commitment to destroying Russia is unlikely to change. 'Admittedly in Kyiv, as expected, they've started crying. 'For unclear reasons, Johnson, who travelled to Kyiv solely to improve his ratings, is for some reason considered a greater friend of Ukraine than Rishi Sunak is.' Skabeyeva then took aim at 'racist' Ukraine, a common Russian attack line against Kyiv, saying they could never support Britain's first ever PM of Asian descent. She added: 'Sunak shouldn't expect the same love from Ukrainians. 'After all, racism is an important component in the ideology of Ukrainian nationalists. 'What's more, we need to understand that London doesn't need Kyiv's love at all for its war with Moscow.' Kremlin TV has regularly fired shots at Britain throughout the war, with Boris Johnson's staunch support for Ukraine and fierce condemnation of Russia making him a regular target. Liz Truss was also mocked in her brief stint in office by Russia. Upon her resignation, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: 'Britain has never known such a disgrace of a prime minister. 'The catastrophic illiteracy and the queen's funeral immediately after her audience with Liz Truss will be remembered.' A guest on the political talkshow 'Time Will Tell' said Truss had possessed the three traits needed to thrive in British politics: 'Stupidity, arrogance, and belligerence'. Truss has been the target of withering comments from Moscow since she visited in February as part of a fruitless drive by Western politicians to the invasion of Ukraine. Russian officials took a dim view of Truss's premiership from the outset and have revelled in her numerous gaffes. Upon her appointment in September, Lavrov said Truss did not know how to compromise and questioned how the British leader could say she did not know whether French President Emmanuel Macron was a 'friend or foe'. Zakharova also on Thursday mocked Truss' high-profile photo shoot in Estonia last year, where she donned a flak jacket and helmet to ride in a tank during a visit to British troops stationed in the Baltic country. Along with her husband Yevgeny Popov, Skabeyeva has throughout the war spread baseless conspiracy theories, overstated Moscow's war successes, parroted Kremlin lies about 'Nazis' in Ukraine, and issued dire warnings of World War Three and threats against the West. As a result, she has been branded a 'monster' by commentators, with other analysts suggesting her sabre-rattling rhetoric has marked a shift in the Kremlin's tone. She was previously involved in efforts to discredit the British investigation into the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal by Novichok nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury. She has called Putin's invasion an effort to 'to protect people in Donbas from a Nazi regime' and said that the decision to send Moscow's forces into the country was 'without exaggeration, a crucial junction in history.'"
2022-10-23,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11344753/Defiant-Penny-Mordaunt-vows-fight-Tory-leadership-race-despite-chances-fading-rapidly.html,Defiant Penny Mordaunt vows to fight on in Tory leadership race - despite her chances fading rapidly,"Penny Mordaunt vowed to fight on last night despite her chances of winning the Tory leadership fading rapidly. With Rishi Sunak on more than 100 declared backers, and Boris Johnson’s allies briefing that he had privately reached that threshold, Ms Mordaunt’s prospects looked bleak. Last night, just 23 MPs had publicly given her their support – far fewer than the 67 who initially backed her in July’s leadership race. Candidates must get the support of at least 100 of the 357 Tory MPs to enter the next round, meaning no more than three can battle it out. A source close to Ms Mordaunt, pictured left, insisted that she was a fresh face who was not tainted by association with the ‘psychodrama’ between Mr Johnson and his former Chancellor. Her struggles to rally support come after she sparked fears among foreign embassies last week about an escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, after repeatedly refusing to explain Liz Truss’s absence from Parliament. At least nine times, Ms Mordaunt told MPs there were ‘genuine’ and ‘good’ reasons for Ms Truss not being in the Commons to face a grilling about the sacking of Kwasi Kwarteng following his shambolic mini-Budget. But Ms Mordaunt declined to share those reasons, sparking concerns among foreign diplomats based in London that she was being briefed about Russia testing nuclear weapons after President Vladimir Putin had threatened their use. Filling in for Ms Truss, Ms Mordaunt said the Prime Minister was ‘not hiding under a desk’. Questioned further about the Prime Minister’s absence, Ms Mordaunt said: ‘I cannot disclose the reasons; I have asked if I can. I am being very genuine with the House on this matter.’ After it was suggested that Ms Truss was tendering her resignation, Ms Mordaunt said there were ‘very serious matters, as well as economic matters, in her in-tray’, muddying matters. Moments later, Ms Truss walked into the Chamber, having had a meeting with Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers. A Foreign Office source said they could not rule out that embassies had made calls to check in about the situation in Ukraine."
2022-10-23,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11346459/Ben-Wallace-denies-Russias-dirty-bomb-theories-rare-call-Russian-counterpart.html,Ben Wallace denies Russia's 'dirty bomb' theories: Defence Secretary hits back at Kremlin's claim that Ukraine is planning a false flag attack in rare call with Russian counterpart - as Kyiv hits out at 'absurd Russian lies',"Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has strongly denied the Kremlin's allegations that Ukraine is planning to detonate a ‘dirty bomb’, as his Russian counterpart warned of an 'uncontrollable escalation'. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba dismissed the claims as ‘Russian lies’ which are ‘as absurd as they are dangerous’. In a rare phone call with Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, Mr Wallace denied that the West was conspiring with Kyiv to ‘facilitate’ a planned escalation of the conflict. Mr Shoigu claimed that Ukraine was planning to use a dirty bomb - a device that uses explosives to scatter radioactive waste - and blame it on Russia, but provided no evidence to support the allegations. President Volodymyr Zelensky asserted that the international community was unlikely to believe the claims. Mr Wallace cautioned Moscow's defence chief against using such allegations as a 'pretext for greater escalation'. The call – which was held at Russia’s request – came as Mr Shoigu suggested Kyiv was planning a false flag attack in conversations with French, Turkish and US officials. Mr Kuleba said: ‘Firstly, we neither have any “dirty bombs” nor plan to acquire any. Secondly, Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves.’ Mr Zelensky also implied that Moscow was setting the stage for deploying a radioactive device on Ukrainian soil. Posting on social media, he said: ‘If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing – Russia has already prepared all this. I believe that now the world should react as harshly as possible.’ The mention of the threat has raised fears that the conflict could escalate further. In his call to French counterpart Sebastian Lecornu, Shoigu claimed the situation in Ukraine was rapidly deteriorating and ‘trending towards uncontrollable escalation’. In a statement, the UK Ministry of Defence said: ‘Minister Shoigu alleged that Ukraine was planning actions facilitated by Western countries, including the UK, to escalate the conflict in Ukraine. ‘[Mr Wallace] refuted these claims and cautioned that such allegations should not be used as a pretext for greater escalation. ‘The Defence Secretary also reiterated UK and wider international support for Ukraine and desire to de-escalate this conflict.’ It came as a Russian warplane crashed into a Siberian house and burst into flames for the second time in less than a week. The two pilots of the Su-30 fighter jet, which Russia said was on a training flight, were killed when the plane plummeted into the city of Irkutsk yesterday. No civilians are believed to have been killed. In a strikingly similar incident last Monday, an Su-34 bomber exploded near an apartment building in the Russian city of Yeysk, killing 15 people."

The warplane crashed into the residential building in Irkutsk but there were no casualties on the ground. The city's governor Igor Kobzev said the plane came down on a private two-storey building housing two families. State-controlled United Aircraft Corporation said a plane came down during a training flight before its delivery to the air force. An official probe has begun into why the plane crashed. A surveillance cam video posted on Russian social networks showed the fighter diving towards the ground almost vertically. Other footage showed the building engulfed by flames and firefighters deployed to extinguish the blaze. Sunday's crash was the 11th reported non-combat crash of a Russian warplane since Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine on February 24. Military experts have noted that as the number of Russian military flights increased sharply during the fighting, so did the crashes. Irkutsk, a major industrial centre of more than 600,000 in eastern Siberia, is home to an aircraft factory producing the Su-30s. The Su-30 is a supersonic twin-engine, two-seat fighter that has been a key component of the Russian air force and also has been used by China, India and many other countries. Meanwhile separate footage has shown the final seconds of another Russian warplane crashing into an apartment block. Moscow claims the Su-34 had a technical malfunction and forced two pilots into a parachute landing. Russia says both men survived the horror on 18 October and were treated in hospital. Statistics reveal 15 people died and 26 were injured from the nine storey apartment block. So far 16 remain in hospital."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez praised the United Kingdom's political system for making Prime Minister Liz Truss' ouster possible while simultaneously taking a veiled shot at her fellow Democrats' party politics. In a Saturday night post on Instagram, the New York Democrat complained that her home country's political system gave people 'limited political options' compared to the UK. It's not clear what political freedoms in the UK she was eyeing when contrasting the two systems. Truss' brief, tumultuous tenure came and went without a single everyday Briton casting a vote. The conservative British leader announced outside of No. 10 Downing Street on Thursday that she would be stepping down after just 44 days on the job. Her six weeks were marked by economic turmoil and inter-party rebellion sparked by a controversial tax cut plan that sent the British pound's value into a downward spiral. But Ocasio-Cortez still championed it as a positive alternative to the American system, for the latter's rules allowing Donald Trump to serve a full term as president. In a Q&A on her Instagram Story, Ocasio-Cortez was asked by a British supporter how England's political turmoil is being viewed on the outside - adding that it was a source of embarrassment for them. 'Can't speak for the world, but honestly I respect the UK for having a political system that is responsive and independent enough to swiftly make corrections in situations such as these,' the lawmaker replied. 'I respect that your parliamentary system seems to afford a greater level of independence and accountability than the US, where our two-party duopoly forces people to have much more limited political options.' In an apparent jab at Congressional leadership, she added: 'Our system makes it extremely difficult to hold one's own party leadership accountable without being accused of (and in some cases actually risking) ""helping the other side,"" which only further protects (or erodes) the status quo.' 'Think about it: We had Trump for four years! No take backs! Imagine being stuck like that,' Ocasio-Cortez said. 'Or being a rich country with no guaranteed healthcare. Now THAT's embarrassing.' But far from giving the public the opportunity to choose a new leader, the UK's Conservative Party appears to be bucking calls from left-wing Labor to hold a new general election - which would see the Tories risk losing their governing power. Currently, the next election is due January 2025. As it stands, Conservative members of Parliament are due to vote for a new leader amongst themselves next week. Among the frontrunners is former Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Standing outside of the prime minister's residence at No. 10 Downing on Thursday, Truss acknowledged the tumultuous financial situation the world found itself in during her short leadership stint. 'I came into office at a time of great economic and international instability. Families and businesses were worried about how to pay their bills. Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine threatens the security of our whole continent. And our country had been held back for too long by low economic growth,' Truss said. 'We set out a vision for a low-tax, high-growth economy that would take advantage of the freedoms of Brexit.' She added, 'I recognize, though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative party.' 'I have therefore spoken to His Majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative party.' US President Joe Biden, who previously called Truss' tax plan a 'mistake,' credited the embattled politician for her 'partnership' in helping lead the West's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, in a statement reacting to her resignation. He reaffirmed his gratitude for her collaboration on Ukraine when asked by reporters if Truss did 'the right thing' late on Thursday morning. 'Well that's for her to decide, but look she was a good partner on Russia and Ukraine,' Biden told reporters on his way to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 'The British are going to solve their problems, but she was a good partner.'"

Dog lovers haven't had much to celebrate lately when watching the news coming out of the frontline, but it's not all doom and gloom in Ukraine. Film producer Nate Mook said he installed a make-shift dog food dispenser in the eastern city of Kramatorsk. 'I’ve never seen anything like this. Yesterday we installed a displaced pet feeding station in Kramatorsk (with your support!),' he said. 'This morning, the Ukrainian dogs waited in line to eat.' The dogs can be seen politely waiting their turn to eat, remembering their manners in spite of their ordeal on the frontline. 'No pushing and crowding. No fighting. Everyone just waiting politely their turn,' observed one social media user. Dogs weren't the only animals to take advantage of the feeder, with local cats also dropping in for a free meal. Mook has also spent his time rescuing kittens from the Ukrainian frontline, helping the fuzzy animals reach safety. But Mook doesn't limit his altruism to household pets. He's also been snapped building a shelter for racoons in the war-torn country. 'We’ve seen a huge need for support for the animals,' Mook told The Dodo. 'Dogs and cats who used to have homes.' Mook recently helped deliver 500 pounds of donated food to a pet sanctuary in Sviatohirsk. He has set up a PayPal link to help house animals affected by the war in Ukraine. Just under an hour's drive away, Russian forces have been dashing themselves against Ukraine's eastern frontline. 'The key hot spots in Donbas are Soledar and Bakhmut,' president Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. 'Very heavy fighting is going on there.' The town of Bakhmut has been the next target of Russia's armed forces in their slow advance through the Donetsk region since taking the key industrial towns of Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk in June and July. Soledar lies just to the north of Bakhmut."
2022-10-23,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11345515/Major-explosion-kills-three-gunpowder-factory-Russia.html,Major explosion kills three at gunpowder factory working 24/7 to make rocket launchers and air defence systems for war on Ukraine,"A major explosion killed three people at a gunpowder factor working 24/7 to make rocket launchers and air defence systems for the war in Ukraine. Perm Gunpowder Plant, which produces Grad and Smerch weaponry for Russian troops, reportedly went up in flames. Video footage showed a plume of smoke rising in the distance, with some witnesses claiming to have seen the explosion at the time of the attack. Two of those who were killed were allegedly burned alive while more are feared dead and could be buried under the rubble. The building also makes engine charges for aircraft missiles, booster systems for cruise missiles and products for the A-135 missile defence system. Reports suggested there was an explosion and fire on Saturday around 8pm in the large plant sector 12. The explosion come amid suspicion of sabotage linked to a series of explosions fires at key Russian sites during the war. The Russian Investigative Committee - seen as similar to the FBI in Russia - is conducting a probe into the Saturday blast, say reports. Last month the Perm munitions plant announced it had recruited 350 extra staff to boost Putin's war effort. The extra manpower was to allow the plant to work three shifts during a 24 hour period to provide munitions for the Ukraine war. It follows reports that Russia has been short of missiles with which to target Ukraine. An earlier explosion at the same Perm defence plant came on 1 May in which three women were killed. In the earlier May explosion an eyewitness told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper: 'The building just flew into the air.' One woman called Svetlana 'couldn't even run out, but the other girls fled - they were all burned. 'Olga had 100 per cent body burns. She was not even taken to the hospital. 'But Ulyana was alive, she had 99 per cent burns, and her son in the second grade is waiting for her at home. 'I don't know how to go to work any more. I cried all night.' The dead explosives workers were named as Svetlana Bardakova, 59, Olga Savishchenko, 43, and Ulyana Frants, 36."
2022-10-23,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11345417/Russian-officials-collaborators-fleeing-Kherson-Ukrainian-troops-near-claims-resident.html,"Russians ‘flee’ Kherson: Putin loyalists, officials and collaborators are among thousands evacuating city as advancing Ukrainian troops close in, claims resident - after dictator unleashed missile blitz on power stations","Russian officers and collaborators are evacuating Kherson under the guise of a 'civilian evacuation' as the Ukrainian army approaches, one resident has said. The Ukrainian army has set its sights on liberating Kherson, the second largest city in Ukraine, from Vladimir Putin's forces. Russia has declared a civilian evacuation to funnel residents into Russia, but civilians living there say they aren't the ones being evacuated. 'Mostly it's families of Russian officers, families of Russian officials and collaborators who helped to organise the referendum,' said a local Kherson-based activist and organiser, speaking to Sky News on condition of anonymity. 'Among them are teachers and doctors, municipal workers and kindergarten staff. Those who have taken Russian passports.' Roughly a thousand people are fleeing a day, but made up mostly of either Russians or those who aided the Russian advance in the early weeks of the war when Putin's troops captured the city on March 2. 'Due to the tense situation at the front, the increased danger of massive shelling of the city and the threat of terrorist attacks, all civilians must immediately leave the city and cross to the (east) bank of the Dnipro!' occupation authorities posted on Telegram. Ukraine's military said it was making gains as its forces moved south through the region, taking over at least two villages it said Russian troops had abandoned. Kherson links Ukraine to the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Telegram: 'Kherson region! Just a little bit more. Hang in there. The Ukrainian Armed Forces are at work.' Russia has spent weeks launching a series of devastating strikes against Ukraine's power infrastructure, leaving millions without power. Russia has been using drones imported from Iran to destroy Ukrainian facilities and attack Kyiv, with Iran denying its involvement. The strikes hit at least half its thermal power generation and up to 40% of the entire national grid. Officials in a swath of regions on Saturday reported strikes on energy facilities and power outages as engineers scrambled to restore the network. Governors advised residents to stock up on water. More than a million people were without power, said presidential adviser Kyrylo Tymoshenko. Parts of Kyiv suffered power cuts into the evening, and a city official warned strikes could leave Ukraine's capital without power and heat for 'several days or weeks'. Presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said Moscow wanted to create a new wave of refugees into Europe with the strikes, while Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter the attacks constituted genocide. Moscow has acknowledged targeting energy infrastructure but denies targeting civilians. Zelenskiy, in his nightly video address, said the 'latest mass strike' affected regions in western, central and southern Ukraine. 'Of course we don't have the technical ability to knock down 100% of the Russian missiles and strike drones. I am sure that, gradually, we will achieve that, with help from our partners. Already now, we are downing a majority of cruise missiles, a majority of drones.' Ukrainian forces had downed 20 missiles and more than 10 Iranian-made Shahed drones on Saturday, he said. The air force command earlier had said 33 missiles had been fired at Ukraine, with 18 shot down. Meanwhile, Ukraine's security service said it has detained the long-time chief of a major aircraft engine factory, accusing him of collaborating with Russia by supplying military equipment for Russian attack aircraft. Viacheslav Bohuslaiev, president of the Motor Sich plant in Zaporizhzhia, and another top factory official were charged with collaboration and 'assisting the aggressor state'. The Ukrainian security service SBU said that the two are accused of colluding with a Russian arms maker close to the Kremlin to supply Ukrainian-made engines and spare parts to Russian forces. The SBU described a complex scheme using intermediaries in three countries to evade sanctions against Russia. Motor Sich is one of Ukraine's leading manufacturers and has been a key maker of aircraft engines since Soviet times. Its facilities have been repeatedly targeted by Russian strikes during the war. Engines made by Motor Sich were used to equip Russian helicopters before supplies were halted following Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. Zelenskiy on Friday urged the West to warn Moscow not to blow up the Russian-controlled dam on the Dnipro. Russia has accused Kyiv of rocketing the dam and planning to destroy it in what Ukrainian officials called a sign that Moscow might blow it up and blame Kyiv. Neither side has produced evidence to back up their allegations. The Soviet-era structure holds back 4.3 cubic miles of water, about equal to the Great Salt Lake in the US state of Utah. Its destruction could devastate much of the Kherson region. It supplies water to Crimea and the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Regarding the Zaporizhzhia plant, considered a potential flashpoint for catastrophe, the Group of Seven industrial powers on Saturday condemned Russia's kidnapping of the Ukraine-operated plant's leaders and called for the immediate return of full control of the plant to Ukraine. Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu held a telephone call with his British counterpart Ben Wallace on Sunday to discuss the situation in Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported, citing the defence ministry. Shoigu told Wallace that Russia was concerned Kyiv could be preparing to use a 'dirty bomb' in Ukraine - a claim he also made in calls with the French and Turkish defence ministers earlier on Sunday. Russia has published no evidence to support the claim."

The latest accounts for the former Prime Minister’s non-profit institute reveal its links with industrial mogul Moshe Kantor, who was born in Russia. Sanctions on Mr Kantor, who is worth an estimated £8billion, were imposed by the Government in April following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine on February 24. The Government said Mr Kantor was the ‘largest shareholder of fertilizer company Acron, with vital strategic significance for the Russian government’. ‘We are showing the Russian elite that they cannot wash their hands of the atrocities committed on Putin’s orders,’ a Government Minister said at the time. Documents filed with Companies House reveal Mr Kantor made annual charitable donations to the Tony Blair Institute which was enough to support ‘around two members of staff’. The institute – set up to support globalisation – said it no longer received funds from him, but did not say whether it had returned any that had already been donated. Mr Blair’s former links with the oligarch led to a prestigious role on Mr Kantor’s European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, which appointed the former Labour leader as its chairman in 2015. The ECTR was listed among the Tony Blair Institute’s wealthy donors. But their relationship ended in April after Mr Kantor was added to the UK sanctions list, alongside other seven oligarchs. His vast wealth stems from his shareholding in Acron. Originally from Moscow, Mr Kantor now has British citizenship. He was awarded Russia’s Order of Honour by Putin ‘in recognition of his professional achievements’. In recent years he has arranged for delegations to meet the Russian leader in his role as President of the European Jewish Congress. The wealthy Russian has long cultivated deep ties with British politicians and Establishment figures, including the Royal Family. The Tony Blair Institute’s links with Mr Kantor are just one example of the non-profit organisation’s reach among the global elite. The institute’s latest figures revealed that turnover surged from £40.25million to £71.8million last year, while the number of staff has grown from 263 to 440. Mr Blair does not take a salary for his role as its executive chairman."

Footage taken in Stavropol region in southern Russia reveals a man complaining about the pitiful resources he has for fighting, showing his paintball mask. The man said: 'Thank you for these warm gifts for mobilised fighters. 'They think we will be wandering around like Star Wars wearing this b*******t, with no aim and no goal.' Still unimpressed, he reveals the hat and one litre thermos he has, which he also mocks. Throwing the thermos down on the bed he says: 'Very useful thing, it will help us.' Another item which is not satisfactory for him is the child-sized gloves he has received. He quips: 'The best thing that is, these are tactical gloves for a child. Because they don't fit my hand at all, and they didn't fit any fighter.' The video continues with him showing the camera some rubber boots which he is frustrated with as they are rubber and says he will throw them away. And he bemoans the fact that he has not got access to a 'warm' winter uniform and shows the raincoat he is wearing to fight. Footage concludes with one of the soldiers wearing some of the equipment as the men laugh and joke: 'Elite star warrior' and say 'Ready?' The clips are more examples of the chaos that has ensued amid the scramble to mobilise Russian men after Putin's conscription order on September 21. Scores of men have headed to the frontline in the last few weeks hugely under-equipped and under-prepared. It has led to some of the men already losing their lives and being returned to Russia to be buried by their families. Angry men have said that often they were required to buy their own food and equipment and food. And there is such a high demand for kit that prices have surged in Russia, according to the Kommersant newspaper. Body armour in Russia has soared to around £1,115 with a rucksack costing up to £560 and thermal underwear skyrocketing to more than £300. Putin's call for conscription was a bid to bolster his Russian troops in his war against Ukraine as Zelensky's troops fought on. The extra 300,000 soldiers from Russia were called up to fight in the first scramble for conscription since 1941. However, frustrated Russians have criticised Putin and his war in the wake of the announcement. One woman expressed her fear about the conscription in footage from Kursk, Northern Russia. She said: 'The guys are being abandoned in the forest without ammunition, without food or water and are being fired at, wounded and killed. 'Who are we to turn to? The president? The govenment? Help us. Return our children to us.' It comes after some desperate men got friends and their wives to deliberately break their bones as they hoped to avoid conscription. And photographs showed hundreds of people trying to flee the country over the last month. Those remaining in Russia have often been plucked from the street to fight in Ukraine. Police and enlistment officers have been spotted lurking on street corners and near blocks of flats. Armed recruiters have even been visiting offices seeking men for mobilisation and in some cases enlistment teams are reportedly using facial recognition cameras to snare dodgers. 'They are acting like dog catchers. It's sickening how they are dragging men away as cannon fodder,' said one commenter. In Polyustrovo Park residential complex in St Petersburg, men of mobilisation age were trapped near the entrance for summonses to be served. In Moscow, there was a mass delivery of summonses at underground stations, reported Ostorozhno News. Witnesses said police officers interview men, take their personal details, then serve some of them with summonses. Some people are taken away to police cars. Pavel Chikov, prominent lawyer and human rights activist, warned of 'increasing reports of raids'. 'There are cases of summonses being served on the street, citizens being detained by the police in the subway and hotels, and their forced delivery to military enlistment offices or mobilisation points' He stated: 'This practice is illegal.' Senator Andrey Klishas - from the pro-Putin United Russia party - called for checks on whether it was legal to pluck men from the metro and force them to the war. The authorities are using police, traffic police, FSB security service and residential databases to track down possible dodgers. They are also raiding offices to root out men of mobilisation age, even though Russians were promised that one percent of the male population would be sent to Putin's war. 'Police officers walk around the floors and take men of military age,' reported a source of The Village online media. 'In the morning there was one paddy wagon, it was filled. A second was brought. They took our administrator and other men who were on the first floor. [Men] are caught in the corridor. 'Specifically, three policemen came to our reception.' Reservists are vulnerable for mobilisation to the lower ranks up to the age of 35; junior officers can be called up to the age of 50 and senior officers can be drafted up to 55. The conscript-catching raids seem to give lie to claims in Russia that the first wave of mobilisation is over, and that no second wave has begun. The sinister conscript catchers come as a holiday flight in Russia was delayed for nine hours because the co-pilot was conscripted. The unnamed pilot was barred from going abroad even as passengers were on board and ready to fly to Antalya in Turkey. Holidaymakers in the AzurAir flight were told: 'Due to the mobilisation and subsequent prohibition on crossing the border for the co-pilot, take-off has been cancelled. 'We ask you to leave the plane.' The flight left oil city Ufa in the Urals some nine hours later once a replacement co-pilot was found. 'Everyone was shocked,' said passenger Vadim. 'It was insane, the military enlistment office came for the co-pilot. We were supposed to take off at 5:20 am, but we eventually left only at 2pm. 'At first we waited for two hours, then we were all sent to hotels.' Officials evidently blamed the plane nightmare on the co-pilot ignoring an initial summons to fight in Putin's bloody war in Ukraine. This is why he was barred from leaving Russia, it was claimed. Meanwhile, Russian president Vladimir Putin has increased the number of his strategic nuclear bombers stationed at an airbase near the Finnish and Norwegian borders, satellite images show. The move comes amid high tension over whether Putin plans to launch an atomic attack in Europe and his on-going invasion of Ukraine, which has suffered a string of embarrassing setbacks in recent months. The Russian tyrant has gradually increased the number of strategic bombers at Olenya air base - from none on August 12, to four supersonic Tu-160s on August 21, to 11 now. The Armageddon planes are usually stationed at Engels Air Base, 450 miles south-east of Moscow. Now, however, the bombers are stationed around 115 miles away from the border of NATO member Norway, and about 95 miles away from the soon-to-become Alliance member, Finland. They can also be used with conventional weapons. There is evidence the deployment at Olanya has Kh-101 cruise missiles for possible use against targets in Ukraine. The Kh-101 can carry conventional or nuclear warheads. The runway at Olenya airbase was empty on 12 August, with satellite images from October 7 showing that it is now full of warplanes."

Russian 'research' ship sails close to Shetland after undersea cables were mysteriously cut - as engineers battle to restore internet and phone communications,"A Russian 'research' ship sailed close to Shetland after undersea cables were mysteriously cut- as engineers battle to restore internet and phone communications. Research ship Akademik Boris Petrov travelled through the Shetland-Orkney Gap on the afternoon of 21 October, a day after the south subsea cable between the island and mainland was cut and it lost power. At 6pm on 21 October, the ship was seen north of Noup Head Lighthouse and continued towards a Minches transit. According to the Auxiliary Shipping Forecast blog, the Dutch warship HNLMS Tromp moved to a position North East of the Isle of Lewis on the same day. They added that the warship likely positioned there to intercept and escort Akademik Boris Petrov if it continued towards UK sensitive waters. The underwater surveillance and intelligence gathering ship is a 'vessel of interest' for Western Navies. The blog referred to the transit of the research ship as 'strategic messaging' to the UK amid increased interest and sensitivity regarding underwater infrastructure due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Akademik Boris Petrov has now carried on its journey to Brazil. The ship had left Kaliningrad on October 17 for the expedition. Its original route was set to see it go through the English Channel into the Atlantic. But after it left the Skagerrak changed route. The blog added that the change of route was a likely plot to 'increase tensions' in the Northern Isles. After Skagerrak it went past underwater infrastructure in the North Sea. It was also scheduled to continue through sensitive waters off the Faslane Naval base, where Britain's nuclear-submarine based deterrent is. The route was also set to take it through waters off of north west Ireland. In these waters, critical transatlantic infrastructure is kept. The blog added that this area was likely surveilled by a spy vessel called 'Yantar' in August 2021. Yantar is Russian Main Directorate of Deep Sea Research (GUGI) owned and there was a response to the vessel by the Irish Navy. Meanwhile, in Shetland, phone and internet services had yesterday been restored with the help of a 'temporary solution.' It came after the outage on Thursday which caused chaos on the island, with police declaring a major incident and patrolling to reassure residents. People were warned not to try and make non urgent calls and to check on elderly or vulnerable neighbours as assistance alarms may not be working. Nicola Sturgeon had declared the situation an 'emergency' for the island. And the outage also came after a cable connecting Shetland and Faroe was damaged last week. By this weekend, the company expects that the first damaged cable will be fully repaired by Faroese Telecom. Afterwards, the subsea engineers will work on fixing the second damaged cable. A top military man warned in January that Russian sabotage could wreck undersea cables that supply our internet and $10 trillion of financial deals a day. Then just weeks ago senior politicians, defence chiefs and experts warned Europe's critical infrastructure is now at risk after the Nord Stream gas pipes were blown up in an attack widely thought to have been orchestrated by Russia. BT said: 'While both cable links are being repaired by subsea engineers, engineers were able to reconnect all services via a temporary solution on Thursday afternoon. 'Further testing and monitoring overnight has shown that broadband services have remained stable, and we will continue to monitor this. 'As a precaution, we have specialist teams in Shetland with satellite backup links should either of the subsea cables fail while they are being repaired.'"

Moscow’s ‘nuclear blackmail’ had failed and the Kremlin was now resorting to new scare tactics, the head of the Ukrainian presidential office Andriy Yermak said last night. ‘Ukraine will not succumb to peace by coercion,’ he added. ‘They won’t break us. We will hit back even harder.’ His remarks came after President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned ‘Russian terrorists’ for laying explosives along the barrier at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant in the occupied Kherson region which Ukraine is pushing to retake. Seized by Russia at the beginning of the war, the Kakhovka dam provides one of the last remaining routes over the Dnipro river in the region. Kherson has been the scene of intense fighting over the past week as the Ukrainian armed forces look to retake the regional capital of the same name, a key strategic port on the Black Sea. Kyiv hopes to recapture the city before winter sets in. In a desperate attempt to hang on to the territory, Russia yesterday ordered 2,000 conscripts to be dispatched to the area. Mr Zelensky said: ‘Everyone in the world must act powerfully and quickly to prevent a new Russian terrorist attack. Destroying the dam would mean a large-scale disaster. ‘If the dam is destroyed, the North Crimean canal will simply disappear.’ The canal provides the illegally occupied Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea with 85 per cent of its water supplies. Mykhailo Podolyak, another top aide to Mr Zelensky, said Moscow’s move was an attempt to halt the Ukrainian advance across the Kherson region. ‘Russia is preparing a man-made catastrophe by flooding [this] territory to stop Ukraine’s counter-offensive and block their own retreat,’ he wrote on Twitter. Vladimir Putin’s puppet officials began ‘evacuating’ civilians out of the area this week and claim the number could reach 60,000 in a move that Kyiv has described as forced deportations. A report by the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, said last night that Russia was ‘likely continuing to prepare for a false flag attack’ on the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant. It added Moscow was creating the ‘information conditions’ for Russian forces to blow up the dam after they pull out of western Kherson. The ISW suggested Russia would then accuse Ukraine of flooding the river and surrounding settlements. The Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, a Kremlin mouthpiece, said it would be difficult to survive ‘such a grandiose water apocalypse’. In a self-styled ‘exclusive investigation’ warning of major floods lasting three days, the newspaper said: ‘In the event of a dam explosion, a wave five meters [16ft] high will go down the Dnipro at a speed of 25km/h [15mph]. ‘It would wash away all the coastal villages that it met on the way. In two hours, this tsunami would be in Kherson.’ The propaganda campaign underlines Russia’s desperation to hold on to the only regional capital it has successfully occupied in its eight-month invasion. Retaking Kherson would be a significant morale boost for the Ukrainians, who have faced a barrage of deadly attacks by Iranian ‘suicide’ drones over the past two weeks. The Ukrainian air force said yesterday it was taking down 85 per cent of the drones fired by Russia but their deployment is forcing Kyiv to use up vital air defence supplies."

Ukrainian President Zelensky said Russian troops planted explosives at the Nova Kakhovka dam at a massive reservoir in the south of country. He claimed Putin's regime were planning to destroy the dam, and called on world leaders to say blowing it up would be responded to in 'exactly the same as the use of weapons of mass destruction'. He added: 'Now everyone in the world must act powerfully and quickly to prevent a new Russian terrorist attack. 'Destroying the dam would mean a large-scale disaster.' Zelensky's warning came after Kremlin-backed governments in southern Ukraine urged civilians to move deeper into Russian-held territory as Ukrainian forces advance. Evacuees from Kherson gather after arriving at the railway station in Dzhankoi, Crimea Kherson has been held by Russia since the early days of the nearly 8-month-long war in Ukraine. The city is the capital one of four regions Vladimir Putin illegally annexed last month. Thousands crowded over the river, many by boat to escape Kherson ahead of the Ukrainian advance. 'I really didn't want to (leave), I'm still in work,' one resident said. 'We wanted to stay here in the region, but now we don't know.' The Russian-installed leader of Kherson said this week Russia was planning to move an estimated 10,000 residents a day from Kherson and that Russia was preparing to take in residents in anticipation of Ukraine's counterattack. Despite the latest warning, the occupation authorities invited people still in the city on Saturday to attend an 'evening of Russian literature, music and art' in Kherson's Palace of Culture, with a book reading and orchestra playing. On Friday, Ukrainian forces bombarded Russian positions across Kherson region, targeting pro-Kremlin forces' resupply routes as they prepare to reclaim the city. Ukraine has retaken some villages in the region's north since launching its counteroffensive in late August. Russian-installed officials were reported as trying desperately to turn the city of Kherson into a fortress while attempting to relocate tens of thousands of residents. The Kremlin poured as many as 2,000 draftees into the surrounding region to replenish losses and strengthen front-line units, according to the Ukrainian army's general staff. The wide Dnieper River figures as a major factor in the fighting, making it hard for Russia to supply its troops defending the city of Kherson and nearby areas on the west bank after relentless Ukrainian strikes rendered the main crossings unusable. Taking control of Kherson has allowed Russia to resume fresh water supplies from the Dnieper to Crimea, which were cut by Ukraine after Moscow's annexation of the Black Sea peninsula. Tens of thousands are being told to flee Kherson ahead of an expected Ukrainian advance A Ukrainian soldier sits in shelter as he prepare fire the Russian positions with the mortar in Bakhmut, Donetsk region The dam upstream from Kherson city is a key source of energy for the southern region. Ukraine and Russia accused each other of trying to blow it up to flood the region. A Russia-installed official estimated Saturday that around 25,000 people from across the region had made their way over the Dnieper. In a Telegram post, Kirill Stremousov claimed that civilians were relocating willingly. 'People are actively moving because today the priority is life. We do not drag anyone anywhere,' he said, adding that some residents could be waiting for the Ukrainian army to reclaim the city. Ukrainian and Western officials have expressed concern about potential forced transfers of residents to Russia or Russian-occupied territory. Ukrainian officials urged Kherson residents to resist attempts to relocate them, with one local official alleging Moscow wanted to take civilians hostage and use them as human shields. Elsewhere in the invaded country, hundreds of thousands of people in central and western Ukraine woke up on Saturday to power outages and periodic bursts of gunfire. In its latest war tactic, Russia has intensified strikes on power stations, water supply systems and other key infrastructure across the country. Ukraine's air force said in a statement Saturday that Russia had launched 'a massive missile attack' targeting 'critical infrastructure,' adding that it had downed 18 out of 33 cruise missiles launched from the air and sea. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy later said Russia had launched 36 missiles, most of which were shot down. 'Those treacherous blows on critically important facilities are characteristic tactics of terrorists,' Zelenskyy said. 'The world can and must stop this terror.' Air raid sirens blared across Ukraine twice by early afternoon, sending residents fleeing into shelters as Ukrainian air defense tried to shoot down explosive drones and incoming missiles. 'Several rockets' targeting Ukraine's capital were shot down Saturday morning, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging service. The president's office said in its morning update that five suicide drones were downed in the central Cherkasy region southeast of Kyiv. Similar reports came from the governors of six western and central provinces, as well as of the southern Odesa region on the Black Sea. Ukraine's top diplomat said the day's attacks proved Ukraine needed new Western-reinforced air defense systems 'without a minute of delay.' 'Air defense saves lives,' Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office, said on Telegram that almost 1.4 million households lost power as a result of the strikes. He said some 672,000 homes in the western Khmelnytskyi region were affected and another 242,000 suffered outages in the Cherkasy region. Most of the western city of Khmelnytskyi, which straddles the Bug River and had a pre-war population of 275,000, was left with no electricity, shortly after local media reported several loud explosions. In a social media post on Saturday, the city council urged local residents to store water 'in case it´s also gone within an hour.'"
2022-10-22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11343295/Giorgia-Meloni-sworn-Italys-female-PM-leads-far-right-Government-WW2.html,Giorgia Meloni takes oath of office as she is sworn in as Italy's first female PM and will lead country's first far-right Government since WW2,"Giorgia Meloni has today been sworn in as Italy's first far-right premier since the end of the Second World War as well as the first woman to take the role of Italian Prime Minister. Ms Meloni, 45, whose political party has neo-fascist roots, took the oath of office before the Italian president at the Quirinale Presidential Palace in Rome. Her Brothers of Italy party received the most votes Italy during last month's Italian general election, winning 26 per cent of the vote, 119 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 65 in the Senate. The party has neo-fascist origins in the Italian Social Movement, which was founded by Mussolini supporters. Ms Meloni, 45, will be the leader of Italy's most far-right government since fascist Benito Mussolini was deposed during WW2 in 1943. Ms Meloni announced her first cabinet yesterday evening. Her coalition allies include the anti-immigrant and right-wing League of Matteo Salvini and the conservative Forza Italia party headed by former premier Silvio Berlusconi. Ms Meloni recited the ritual oath of office, pledging to be faithful to Italy's post-war republic and to act 'in the exclusive interests of the nation'. The pledge was signed by her and countersigned by President Sergio Mattarella, who, in his role as head of state, serves as guarantor of the constitution, drafted in the years immediately after the end of the war, which saw the demise of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Ms Meloni's 24 ministers followed, similarly swearing in. Five of the ministers are technocrats, not representing any party. Six of them are women. One of her new deputy prime ministers, Matteo Salivini, was seen making a heart symbol as he expressed his support to her. Ms Meloni will head her first cabinet meeting on Sunday. Her government replaces that led by Mario Draghi, a former European Central Bank chief, who was appointed by Mr Mattarella in 2021 to lead a pandemic national unity coalition. Ms Meloni was the sole major party leader to refuse to join the coalition, insisting the nation's voters return to the polls, which they did on September 25. Obtaining the premiership was a rapid rise to power for the Brothers of Italy. Meloni co-founded the party in December 2012, and it was considered a fringe movement on the right during its first years. Italy along with much of the rest of Europe are struggling with soaring energy costs and the crisis caused by Russia's war in Ukraine, which could further impact gas supplies this winter and continue increasing household and business power bills. Her election comes after a turbulent time in Italian politics as messy coalitions formed and fell apart before technocrat Mario Draghi was appointed to take control of the economy until an election could be held. But Meloni's success is far from assured. She staunchly backs Ukraine in its war with Russia, but coalition partners Mr Berlusconi and Matteo Salvini - leader of the Lega Nord party - have voiced sympathies for Putin. Tensions over the issue are said to have hobbled coalition talks, with leaked audio appearing to show Berlusconi discussing his ties to Moscow and view that Ukraine started the war. However, in public he has been keen to insist his views are in lockstep with Ms Meloni and the European Union. What bonds all three candidates are shared Eurosceptic views and a desire to see immigration to Italy greatly reduced. Meloni's coalition wants to renegotiate Italy's part of the EU's post-Covid recovery fund, arguing the almost 200 billion euros it expects to receive should take into account the current energy crisis, exacerbated by Moscow's invasion. But the funds are tied to a series of reforms only just begun by outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi, and analysts say she has limited room for manoeuvre. Meloni had campaigned on a platform of 'God, country and family', sparking fears of a regression on rights in the Catholic-majority country. She has distanced herself from her party's neo-fascist past - and her own, after praising dictator Benito Mussolini as a teenager - and presented herself as a straight-talking but unthreatening leader. But she and her party have been outspoken against women's rights to an abortion and gay rights. At political rallies Meloni has fiercely denounced what she calls 'gender ideology' and 'the LGBT lobby'. Federico Mollicone, her culture spokesperson, said last week that same-sex parenting was not normal, triggering outrage. Speaking in a television interview with San Marino's Rtv late on Thursday, Mollicone revived criticism he had previously expressed of an episode of the popular children's cartoon 'Peppa Pig' that featured a polar bear with two mothers. 'It is a very serious issue,' Mollicone said. 'As long as the Italian state does not legislate on these couples, presenting them as something absolutely normal is wrong, because it is not.' He went on to say that 'in Italy homosexual couples are not legal, are not allowed' - despite the country having legalised same-sex civil unions in 2016 with a reform that FdI opposed in parliament. During the campaign, Meloni has repeatedly denied suggestions she might roll back legislation on abortion or gay rights, while reaffirming her opposition to adoptions and surrogacy for LGBT couples. Meloni said she wanted to give a choice to women unsure about terminating pregnancies. 'We won't touch the abortion law. We just want (women) to know there are other options,' she said."

Anastasia Spiridonova, 23, was made a director of the Security Institute, the UK’s largest professional membership body for security professionals, which has close ties to Westminster and whose members include intelligence officers, senior police and military. But concerns were raised by some board members about her past and how her appointment might be publicly perceived following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. ‘The board was split and there were ructions, but she eventually agreed to step down in June after less than two months,’ said a source. ‘It was very embarrassing.’ Enquiries in Russia by this newspaper and the investigative website National Security News found that Ms Spiridonova, who speaks six languages and is described by several colleagues as ‘exceptionally charming’, is connected to the Putin regime through members of her family. Her grandfather was an MP in Putin’s United Russia party, while her mother Marina worked at the Kremlin in a department running resort hotels and presidential retreats around Russia. Meanwhile, Ms Spiridonova’s father, Grigory Bryukhov, was once president of Intourist, the privatised successor of the giant Soviet travel agency that was notoriously riddled with KGB spies. After spending her early years in Moscow, Ms Spiridonova moved to the UK. She was educated at £40,000-a-year Sevenoaks School in Kent and studied modern languages at Stanford University in the US. While at Stanford in 2019 she began applying for internships in the UK. An article in the Security Institute’s in-house newspaper said she wanted ‘to gain an insight into the legal or security sectors, and was particularly interested in experiencing work within the world of criminal, civil and corporate investigations’. But it added: ‘What she was not expecting... was to be accidentally copied into an email by the HR department of a large law firm with one comment on her application: “Sounds like a spy to me.”’ She eventually got a job with a detective firm and joined the Security Institute, which boasts establishment credentials. Its patron is Princess Anne and its president is a member of the House of Lords. A former president, Lord Carlile, was described as having astonishing access to Britain’s secret state as the ‘independent reviewer of terrorism legislation’ and later put his expertise to lucrative new use by going into the international consultancy business with former MI6 chief Sir John Scarlett. According to its website, membership of the institute ‘bestows credibility, enhances career prospects, provides a valuable network of contacts’ and offers ‘fantastic networking opportunities’. Companies House records show that Ms Spiridonova changed her nationality from Russian to British on June 7, 2022. She resigned from the Security Institute board on June 23, having joined in April. Ms Spiridonova said last night: ‘I was elected by the members of the Security Institute to be a voluntary non-executive director. I was then asked by the board to resign from my directorship position. In doing so, they acknowledged that this was no reflection on me as a person and that I was not at fault in any way. The reasoning for their decision is for them to explain, if they wish to. ‘It was an extremely upsetting time, especially as I have thoroughly enjoyed my journey as part of the institute. I always stated I would not go to the press about this. As I have been approached, I am simply commenting on the facts and reserving my personal opinion on this matter to myself. ‘I have always been transparent about my country of birth, heritage and international upbringing.’ The Security Institute said it had ‘a number of voluntary directors who are voted in by our members. All of our directors go through a process of vetting. We do not comment on individual cases.’ Friends insisted neither Anastasia nor her family had any ties to the current regime in Russia."

Conscripts drafted into Ukraine war 'threaten to topple Russian regime over spluttering invasion',"Dozens of mobilised soldiers have staged an extraordinary mutiny against Vladimir Putin amid mounting unrest over the spluttering Ukraine invasion. In footage taken inside a military camp, one uniformed conscript earns raucous cheers from his peers after suggesting soldiers should topple their leaders. The unnamed reservist spoke about the lack of respect soldiers hold for Putin and his commanders, berating an unseen official for using threats to get people to join the cause. He mocked a policy in his region - the Tuva republic in Siberia - to gift a ram to each family of those mobilised. 'You give our families, children, a manky ram [sheep], and some groceries,' he said, adding disparagingly: 'What is this?' In his heroic address - for which he could face severe punishment in Putin's Russia - the reservist told his top brass officers 'threatened us' when they were drafted. 'They told us that if we didn't go there [to Ukraine], they would put us in jail,' he said in his native Tuvan language. 'They wouldn't help our families, they would stop all payments… There are not enough walkie-talkies for our squads… How will we communicate [in the war zone]?' He also joined a chorus of voices on the frontline complaining about the lack of suitable equipment and gear. In the vision, the reservist said his group had not been given enough walkie-talkies and no adequate socks ahead of being sent 3,200 miles to fight for Putin. 'These socks issued to us are of no use. We have already bought enough ourselves.' He ridiculed an army-issued foreign guitar when they are not supplied with adequate weapons. 'They give us an [imported] guitar,' he said to cheers from fellow conscripts. 'Are we going to shoot a guitar on the battlefield?' His outburst is all the more significant since his region is also the home of heavily-criticised Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu, who Putin has steadfastly refused to fire despite strong demands for his head over the failure of the military campaign. The reservist asked bluntly: 'If there are no people like us, who will you be in authority over? 'Who are you going to make all your speeches to? Amid applause from the crowd, he said: 'You no longer look like a source of power in our eyes. Perhaps we people should all get together and decide you are of no use.' Tuva - an impoverished region - has suffered a high death toll during the war, far more than Moscow. The region also saw protests - violently crushed by Putin's law enforcement - over men being sent to the war. Messages seen within a Telegraph channel said the Tuvan conscript also questioned whether it was worth tolerating their leaders when they treated conscripts so badly. In late September, Putin announced 300,000 people with previous combat experience or specialist skills would be conscripted to the frontlines in Ukraine to help with the war. Reports from dissenting voices out of Russia revealed pensioners, men with disabilities, and people without any military training or combat experience were receiving the call-up to fight on the frontlines. Leaked complaints from new frontline arrivals in Ukraine reveal the ailing Russian army is struggling to keep their men clothed, fed and armed. Often, conscripts are told they must by their own supplies, sending the cost of standard items like body armour, weapons and camping gear through the roof. Body armour in Russia has soared to around £1,115 with a rucksack costing up to £560 and thermal underwear skyrocketing to more than £300."
2022-10-22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11344269/Russia-unleashes-missiles-Ukraine-Putin-tries-shut-electricity-heating-water.html,"Russia unleashes missile blitz on Ukraine's power stations as Putin tries to shut down the country's electricity, heating and water supplies ahead of winter","Russia unleashed a fresh wave of missile strikes on cities and towns across Ukraine yesterday as Vladimir Putin seeks to shut down the country’s electricity, heating and water supplies ahead of winter. They rained down on power facilities from Odesa, the Black Sea resort in the south, to Kovel, a medieval town near the Belarus border in the north, leaving about 40 per cent of the energy infrastructure out of action. It was the thirteenth day in a row that drones and missiles have targeted the war-torn nation’s power system, resulting in blackouts, water shortages and desperate pleas from leaders for citizens to limit usage. Putin, humiliated by military setbacks in his bungled invasion, is trying to weaponise winter in Ukraine by freezing the nation into submission – just as he is weaponising his control over energy supplies in Europe by driving up prices. The tactic was unleashed two days after the dictator enlisted Sergei Surovikin – a thuggish veteran of the Syrian conflict nicknamed General Armageddon – to take command of the invasion and salvage his beleaguered regime. It comes as the Kremlin faced further setbacks in the eight-month war, with Russian-installed authorities in the southern city of Kherson ordering residents to leave ahead of Ukrainian advances. The pro-Putin administration called on civilians to use boat crossings over the Dnieper River to move deeper into Russian-held territory. Ukrenergo, the state electricity supplier, said yesterday’s attacks caused the most devastating damage yet to its systems in the west of the country. Ten of Ukraine’s 24 regions and 1.5million people had power cuts yesterday, including in the capital Kyiv. The state rail operator, Ukrzaliznytsia – which has kept going with minimal disruption throughout the war – said it was bringing older coal-powered trains back into service and seeing delays ‘due to the enemy’s attack’. In Zhytomyr, a city 90 miles west of Kyiv that has suffered a series of recent strikes, half the population of 220,000 were without electricity and water yesterday. Serhiy Sukhomlyn, the city’s mayor, told me: ‘We are ready to withstand these difficulties although there are no street lights in the city in the evenings, some public transportation is not operating and today we are experiencing water supply problems.’ Hospitals are relying on emergency generators, while engineers desperately try to patch up damaged facilities to restore service. Yet Sukhomlyn insists the nation will remain defiant. ‘This won’t lead to the Ukrainian people surrendering and offering Putin to start peace talks. ‘The victory will be determined at the frontline and we are ready to endure the difficulties to bring victory closer.’ The attacks – at least 330 in two weeks – signify a new twist in the war. Putin wants to cripple Ukraine’s infrastructure to demoralise a population that has already seen grotesque atrocities and millions forced to flee their homes. President Volodymyr Zelensky, ruling out negotiations with Putin last week, warned Europe’s leaders that this ‘terror’ is also intended to drive a fresh exodus of people from his country to stoke disruption across the continent. Defence sources said more than 30 cruise missiles were fired yesterday from Russian aircraft and naval vessels in the Black Sea, with 18 shot down before hitting their targets – including five heading towards Kyiv. Almost 200 attacks have involved kamikaze drones supplied by Iran, which fly low and hover over targets such as the electricity sub-stations that supply the grid. This hits Ukraine’s Soviet-era heating and water systems, which rely on electricity to pump supplies through trunk lines into homes and business premises. After Zelensky urged people to cut down use of electricity, Ukrainians began talking about ‘the energy frontline’ as they shared tips on reducing consumption. In three regions, police are patrolling streets after darkness to ensure shops, firms and offices turn off unnecessary lights such as window displays and neon signs – warning those who fail to take action will have power cut off. Kyiv has been divided into three areas, with rolling four-hour blackouts for each in turn. Residents have been urged to avoid using electrical appliances – even kettles and wi-fi routers – between 7am and 11pm. ‘Even one saved kilowatt is a help to our energy system,’ said Oleksiy Kuleba, the region’s governor. Walking around the capital after nightfall at 6pm, it is striking to see the number of shops, cafes and restaurants closed. There is an eerie darkness and quiet – which feels almost reminiscent of the early days of the war. In one city centre coffee shop the barista Danylo said they were closing up shortly after 8pm on Friday night when the lights went off. So the staff lit candles and played patriotic songs at high volume while they cleaned up. ‘War time is very difficult for businesses,’ he said. ‘Obviously we would all prefer there were no blackouts, or sirens when we must close down, or bad inflation caused by the war – but it is better to be in darkness than under Russian rule.’"

The two men will be speaking on panels at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh on October 25 and 26. Kushner will be sitting down with former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to discuss 'peace and prosperity,' while Mnuchin will be discussing global macro-finances with several others from Saudi, Bahrain, and India. Mnuchin has been to the conference before, including as former President Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary. No one in Biden's administration is attending the event. The pair are attending the conference, despite the growing tensions between the US and Saudi after Biden announced he would be reevaluating the countries' relationship following the OPEC oil production cut. Cutting oil production in the Middle East by 2million barrels a day is sure to push gas prices even higher before the midterm elections, and has led to claims Saudi Arabia is 'aligned' with Russia. For months, since the US cut off exports of Russian oil and the European Union moved toward divestment, Moscow has instead been selling its product to Saudi Arabia. The Saudis keep Russian oil for their own use and then sell theirs on the world market. The Democrats have now vowed to get tough on the kingdom for the production cut, after Biden fist-bumped Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman in Jeddah in July. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin also accused Saudi Arabia of wanting Russia to win the war in Ukraine. 'Do you think Saudi Arabia wants Russia to win in Ukraine?' CNN's John Berman asked him. 'Yes…let's be very candid about this. It's Putin and Saudi Arabia against the United States,' he said earlier this month. Kirby reiterated his remarks in a press briefing later on. 'The president believes that we should review the bilateral relationship with Saudi Arabia and to take take a look to see if that relationship is where it needs to be and that it is serving our national security interests and he is willing to discuss this relationship with members of Congress,' he said. Menendez, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who has veto power over foreign arms sales, said in a statement that he 'will not green light any cooperation with Riyadh until the Kingdom reassesses its position with respect to the war in Ukraine.' Earlier this month, Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat, wrote in a tweet Saudi Arabia has 'never been a trustworthy ally' and that it's time for the US to 'imagine a world without their alliance.' Energy ministers from the OPEC cartel, whose leading member is Saudi Arabia, and allied non-members including Russia met in person at the group's Vienna headquarters last week for the first time since early 2020. They announced production cutbacks in early October and it is the largest since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Just this summer, Biden made a trip to the Middle East and met with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman to discuss energy security and soaring gas prices in the US to avoid a problematic handshake with the leader Biden fist bumped bin Salman. The announcement boosted Russian oil prices to bankroll the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. It also thwarts the West's efforts to choke off Moscow's energy dollars. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon took a veiled swipe at Biden as he said the U.S. should pump more oil and gas and should have been doing so for a long time. 'In my view, America should have been pumping more oil and gas and it should have been supported,' the famed billionaire chairman told CNBC on Monday. 'America needs to play a real leadership role. America is the swing producer, not Saudi Arabia. We should have gotten that right starting in March,' he added. Biden is also considering telling American businesses to stop expanding their ties with Saudi, according to NBC News."

Client numbers 'started to decrease from February, and by last Saturday, after mobilisation, had dropped by 60 per cent,' complained Lucky Lee, owner of Golden Girls venue in Moscow. Now his club is offering special deals to men conscripted by Putin. 'We offer them two private dances free of charge once they show us their [mobilisation] summons…and two free drinks,' said Lee, a Kazakh-born Russian businessman, who is also president of Russian Striptease Clubs Association. 'People go to fight in the war, to perish, to die, and we must inspire them with creativity. 'Women must inspire men so that they protect motherhood.' His special promotion is called 'We Are Together', he said, 'and he recommends all clubs in his association to join it. 'This already gave us a 10 per cent increase in visits.' But he blamed the overall slump in demand for striptease clubs on a mass exodus from Russia of wealthy men fearing the Putin draft. 'There is an overall decrease in the industry because rich people left Russia,' he said. 'The wealthy are saving themselves. 'I am just back from Turkey - it's full of rich Russians, like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. 'So the men left in Russia, they will die tomorrow. 'So let them at least have a drink for free, let's support them….' He told how 'the day before yesterday a mobilised man came with his wife' into his club. 'They realise that they are bidding farewell to each other, that he might be killed in a month, or two or three. 'And he is telling her: 'Enjoy this beauty, let's go and make some babies. 'You'll watch this sexy beauty of the striptease, you'll get excited, and at least you'll have a baby left'. She vowed to use the state handout if he is killed to pay for their child, said Lee. 'She said: 'I'll use the money paid for your death to raise the baby…. 'So that our baby becomes a peace keeper'. 'This is what women are telling their husbands in our club.' A manager named Dmitry, at another club, called Striptease, said: 'We are having 50 per cent less men coming now. 'I link it to the events of February this year [when Putin began his invasion of Ukraine]. 'Since it started there have been fewer and fewer visitors. 'Not by 20 per cent or 30 per cent, but by 50 per cent - it is very noticeable indeed.'"
2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11335625/Power-4-7pm-save-240-winter.html,Power off from 4-7pm to save £240 this winter! Up to one million homes could be paid to avoid using costly appliances during peak times as part of huge National Grid scheme to combat looming blackouts,"Millions of Britons could get up to £240 off their energy bills this winter if they use their appliances at night after a scheme designed to help avoid blackouts was made more generous, MailOnline can reveal today. Households could receive payments of up to £20-a-day if they don't use washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers and even games consoles between 4pm and 7pm. The National Grid's Electricity Systems Operator (ESO), which manages supply and demand of energy in the UK, hopes at least 1million homes with smart meters will sign up to its so-called 'demand flexibility service' scheme, which is set to run between November 2022 and March 2023. And after listening to concerns from energy firms, National Grid is proposing to pay a rate of £3 per kwh saved instead of 52p to incentivise people to take part. But some experts have said it needs to be more like £6 if they want to get the public on side. Households will be asked on 12 occasions to use less energy at peak times likely to be either 4pm until 7pm or 2pm until 9pm over then next five months. There may also be a test in the morning peak. They will be advised to use washing machines, tumble dryers, ovens, dishwashers and other appliances outside those periods so boffins can measure how much energy is saved on the grid when it is at its busiest. If the entire proposed £3 per kwh rebate if passed on to Britons by their supplier, over five months this could mean around £240 off their bills in total. Before she resigned Liz Truss said that there will be no energy rationing this winter but the National Grid scheme forms part of a worst-case scenario drawn up by the National Grid's Electricity Systems Operator if the UK receives no imports of electricity from Europe this winter alongside a shortage of gas. Experts have predicted that turning off the lights on days when the wind doesn't blow might also be suggested. National Grid has warned that there could be blackouts this winter if gas power plants are not able to keep running due to the energy crisis. The electricity systems operator said it is still unlikely but winter could see the first planned blackouts, which the grid calls rota load shedding, since the 1970s. But why might blackouts happen this year - who will be impacted and what can be done to avoid them? Why would a grid ever plan blackouts? Engineers working on the energy grid need to make sure it is 'balanced' at all times. This means that the amount of electricity being put into the grid by power plants, wind farms and others should match the amount being taken out by households and businesses at any given time. The grid plans for when it thinks demand can be high so it can ask generators to meet that demand. But if there is ever an imbalance where demand is higher than supply or supply is higher than demand, it can cause major breakdowns in the grid. That could cause actual physical damage to the grid that could take days to repair. If the engineers know there will not be enough supply to match demand, sometimes they need to reduce demand by planned outages to avoid major damage. Why might blackouts be necessary this winter? Britain has one of the most reliable power networks in the world and unless cables are cut by storms or other accidents outages are rare. But this winter, gas generators might not be able to get enough gas to keep running. The grid said that if this happens, it still thinks that is 'unlikely', then it might have to cut power to some households and businesses. Who will be impacted by blackouts and who gets cut off first? If the grid realises that it has to cut off some parts of the country, it will issue a warning to the local and regional distributors saying how much demand needs to be cut. It will be up to these so-called distribution network operators to decide who gets cut off and who does not. But the DNOs have limited controls so most of the time it will be whole areas that are impacted. How can we avoid blackouts? If the blackouts are caused by a lack of supply, then the only way is to reduce demand at particular times. Most demand happens during peak hours of between around 4pm and 7pm when people get home from work, put the kettle on, switch on their ovens and sit down to watch TV. The overall amount of electricity that people use does not have to reduce if they just change their usage to other times of the day. For instance, electric cars could be unplugged during these hours, switching the dishwasher could wait until 9pm and you could put the washing machine on earlier in the day or during the weekend. The grid and energy suppliers will launch a new system in November to pay people if they change the time that they use energy. The Government could also step in to ration peoples' energy use or advise them to use less, similar to a hosepipe ban, but so far it has ruled this out. The National Grid's Electricity Systems Operator hope the 'demand flexibility service' scheme could save 2GW of electricity - equivalent to powering 1million homes - and will help the see how much energy use can be 'shifted' from peak times to manage supply and demand. They want as many people as possible to take part. But the scheme relies on users having a controversial smart meter, a device which automatically transmits your energy usage to your provider. So far around 29.5 million smart meters have been installed in homes and small businesses around the UK – which means that just under half do not have one. There have been many complaints about the devices, ranging from them logging inaccurate readings that lead to inflated bills to stopping working altogether. The roll out of smart meters has been plagued by an industry-wide supply problem – but hundreds of thousands of households are unable to get one because they live in high-rise flats, old properties with thick walls, or remote regions with poor signal. Some critics have said that it should have been rolled out to all homes, regardless of whether they have a smart meter. Planned blackouts hit the UK during the 1970s in response to the miners strikes and the oil crisis. There have also been major unplanned outages in storms, including in 1987 when over 1.5 million people were left in the dark. But the lights will stay on this winter unless the gas-fired power plants that produced 43 per cent of Britain's electricity over the last year cannot get enough gas to continue operating. It is the most dire of three possible scenarios that the ESO laid out on Thursday for how Britain's electricity grid might cope with the worst global energy crisis for decades. In the other two scenarios, the operator hopes that by paying people to charge their electric cars at off-peak times and firing up backup coal plants it can offset the risk of blackouts. The margins between peak demand and power supply are expected to be sufficient and similar to recent years in the National Grid Electricity System Operator's (ESO) base case scenario for this winter. But in the face of the 'challenging' winter facing European energy supplies following Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the grid operator is also planning for what would happen if there were no imports of electricity from Europe and insufficient gas supplies. To tackle a loss of imports from France, Belgium and the Netherlands, there are two gigawatts of coal-fired power plants on stand-by to fire up if needed to meet demand. The National Grid Gas Transmission separately said that while gas demand will increase this winter, it expects Britain to be able to get enough gas to take it through a Beast from the East scenario or a long, cold winter. People are being encouraged to sign up with their electricity supplier to a scheme which will give them money back on their bills to shift their use of power away from times of high demand to help prevent blackouts. Households tend to consume a fifth of their daily energy between 4pm and 7pm, according to data from Ovo Energy. The supplier on Thursday said its customers could save £100 if they signed up to use energy at off-peak times. That could mean putting on the dishwasher or washing machine overnight or charging an EV at off-peak times. Earlier this year, The Times reported that the figure required to make the scheme work, and attractive to consumers, was £6 per kWh. 'Customers should be properly incentivised to join up front — ie at least £1 to £2 per kWh,' an Octopus representative warned National Grid at the briefing, The Times reported. They added that customers were 'expecting up to £6 per kWh', the rate mooted in proposals reported in June by The Times. A representative from Eon at the briefing said that payments need to be around £2 per kWh, arguing that the repayments are 'not high enough to incentivise customers to take part', The Times reported. In addition, larger businesses will be paid for reducing demand, for example by shifting their times of energy use or switching to batteries or generators in peak times. The 'demand flexibility service' will run from November to March, and it is expected to swing into action 12 times whatever happens to ensure people get rewarded for being part of the scheme — with additional use if needed to protect supplies. In September, energy expert Kathryn Porter, from consultancy Watt-Logic, said it was possible all households could be asked not to use energy guzzling appliances at peak hours or eat their dinner at a different time if it is a very cold winter or Russia strangles supply of gas. In the US tens of millions of people have been asked not to use washing machines, dishwashers and ovens between 2pm and 8pm because of the global energy crisis. Charging cars before 9pm is also not advised. Away from the home, in Germany, street lights are being dimmed, traffic lights at quieter junctions are turned off, hot water and central heating is off in public buildings and monuments will no longer be lit overnight. Ms Porter has said that it's 'very possible' the UK will see plans for energy rationing, despite Liz Truss absolutely ruling it out. She told BBC's World at One: 'Unfortunately, as each winter goes by, the risk of blackouts is increasing because we have been replacing thermal and nuclear generation with intermittent renewables. That makes us vulnerable in times when wind output is low. 'We have had quite low wind output in July and August...Demand is a lot higher in the winter, so if we have those weather conditions in the winter, our system is going to get very tight and that raises a risk of blackouts.' With similar schemes in California and Texas - Ms Porter expects that authorities could ask consumers to reduce their use of electricity during peak hours - although in the US all these schemes are not enforced in law. 'It is possible we will see something similar here this winter,' she said, adding: 'I think it would be more an appeal or request for people to have their dinner earlier or later, or avoid using large appliances like washing machines during peak hours. I think it would be voluntary rather than compulsory'."
2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11339599/Social-media-explodes-memes-calling-return-Boris-Johnson.html,'Boris will be back!': Social media explodes with memes calling for a return of Boris Johnson - from Top Gun to Lord of the Rings and Terminator,"Social media is exploding with memes calling for a return of Boris Johnson following the dramatic resignation of Liz Truss - using references from Top Gun, Lord of the Rings and Terminator. The hashtag #BringBackBoris is trending on social media with hundreds voicing their support for the axed PM just six weeks after he left No 10, forced out by his own MPs after one scandal too many. Mr Johnson's face was superimposed onto multiple snippets of scenes from the Top Gun movies in order to depict him as the hero the UK needs to escape this mess. One shared a photo of Mr Johnson on the cover of The Lord of the Rings 'The Return of the King'. Another replaced the well known 'keep calm and carry on' slogan with 'keep calm and bring back Boris'. One supporter said: 'The country never lost confidence in Boris. The party did. It's time he returned.' Another added: 'Boris is on his way back to save the UK, he'll rise from the ashes like a phoenix. And we will all live happily ever after.' The former prime minister, who is is reported to be jetting back from the Caribbean, has not announced plans to stand for leader, but is believed to have the backing of dozens of MPs. But social media has been flooded with memes on both sides of the argument since yesterday - with many calling to 'bring back Boris' but others saying 'no, not again.' While many are excited at the prospect of Mr Johnson's triumphant return to the top job, others have voiced concerns. 'The country needs stability, not scandal,' one critic said. 'Integrity, market confidence, support for the most needy. Oh and there's no money left thanks to him and Truss. Johnson is not anything that this country needs.' Another said: 'Boris Johnson?! Are you having a laugh? Picking a new Tory leader is like picking the best toilet on the last day of a festival.' 'Imagine the bar being so low that Boris Johnson coming back actually seems like an improvement in some people's eyes,' one critic tweeted. Another said: 'You call for a return to 'mature politics' and return of Boris Johnson with straight face? Johnson? The man who prefers quips, winks, and punchlines over debate, meetings and preparation?' Ukraine officially backed Boris Johnson to return as Prime Minister yesterday. Amid mounting speculation Mr Johnson is poised as a likely contender to replace Ms Truss, the official Twitter account for Ukraine released a statement on Thursday which read: 'Better call Boris'. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Mr Johnson shared a particularly close relationship during the former PM's time in office, owing primarily to his outspoken support of Ukraine after the Russian invasion. Throughout Mr Johnson's messy departure from No. 10, Mr Zelensky hailed him as a 'true friend' who 'acted swiftly and resolutely' to offer support during the crisis. Mr Zelensky said the UK was his country's 'dearest friend and closest ally' under Mr Johnson, and praised the PM's 'courage and determination' in championing support for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made no secret of the high esteem in which he held Boris Johnson during his time as Prime Minister. Mr Zelensky said the UK was his country's 'dearest friend and closest ally' under Mr Johnson, and praised the PM's 'courage and determination' in championing support for Ukraine. Mr Zelensky thanked Boris for walking with him through the streets of Kyiv in April, and again on Ukraine's independence day. 'Boris Johnson, as his nation's envoy, was with us, welcomed by ordinary Ukrainians,' he said. 'We even started to address him, warmly and humorously, as 'Boris Johnsoniuk' – a Ukrainian-sounding surname if you put a stress on the last syllable.' The Ukrainian leader praised the UK's 'unwavering' support and ongoing financial and humanitarian aid, as well as its introduction of sanctions against Russia. He added: 'But I believe in the power of personal leadership. I know it has not been an easy ride for Boris Johnson as he had to deal with many internal challenges. Prioritising support for Ukraine demanded a great courage and determination.' He said upon Boris' messy exit: 'I sincerely wish that Boris's legacy be preserved.' 'At every meeting and conversation Boris had one very good question, 'What else? What else do you need?',' he said. 'It became our watchword, guaranteeing effective progress and movement forward.' It comes after the Conservative Party announced would-be successors would need to win nominations from 100 MPs to get on the ballot. The threshold means that realistically a maximum of three can make it into a vote, and that there could be a simple coronation of a winner if they get far more than that. According to the ConservativeHome tally, Mr Sunak is the current front runner with 35 openly declared, while Mr Johnson has 19 and Ms Mordaunt 11. While Mr Johnson has been publicly backed by some MPs to run to return to power, including his former culture secretary Nadine Dorries, several others said they don't believe he will reach the threshold. One said the 'brutal truth' is he is likely to get no more than 60 - leaving some of his close friends to advise him not to run. He also remains on holiday in the Caribbean and faces a race against time to return and launch an effective campaign. However in a boost to his chances, the final two candidates will go head-to-head in a final online vote by party members next Friday. Mr Johnson remains popular with the Tory grassroots and could win such a vote, and allies say he would be able to 'honestly say' he has a mandate for government, and has the ability to 'turn the tide and avert the disaster of a Labour government'. But it remains unclear whether he can reach the 100 threshold, or whether a figure from the Tory right could stand and risk splitting the vote. The technicalities of the party vote has not stopped the public from voicing an opinion. Diehard loyalist Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary, said she had spoken to Mr Johnson following Ms Truss's resignation and hinted strongly that he was preparing to run. 'He is a known winner and that is certainly who I'm putting my name against because I want us to win the general election. Having a winner in place is what the party needs to survive,' she told Sky News. Veteran backbencher Sir Roger Gale, a long-time critic of Mr Johnson, however warned that if he succeeds he could be met with a wave of resignations by Tory MPs. 'I think that there would be people, indeed like myself, who would find ourselves in the awful position of having to resign the Conservative whip,' he told Times Radio. For critics, a comeback would be particularly problematic as Mr Johnson still faces an investigation by the Commons Privileges Committee over claims he lied to Parliament over lockdown parties in Downing Street, which could potentially see him expelled as an MP. It comes as Ms Truss was relentlessly mocked on Twitter last night after her humiliating resignation. Her 44 days in office made her the shortest serving prime minister in UK history. Speaking from a lectern in Downing Street this afternoon, Ms Truss said she had told the King she was resigning as the leader of the Conservative Party as she recognised she 'cannot deliver the mandate' which she committed to a little over six weeks ago. She held talks with the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives, Sir Graham Brady, and agreed to a fresh leadership election 'to be completed within the next week'. 'This will ensure that we remain on a path to deliver our fiscal plan and maintain our country's economic stability and national security,' she added. 'I will remain as Prime Minister until a successor has been chosen.' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer demanded a general election 'now' so that the nation can have 'a chance at a fresh start'. Without a general election, the Conservatives will be on their third prime minister on the mandate won by Boris Johnson in December 2019. Sir Keir said: 'The Conservative Party has shown it no longer has a mandate to govern. The British public deserve a proper say on the country's future. They must have the chance to compare the Tories' chaos with Labour's plans to sort out their mess, grow the economy for working people and rebuild the country for a fairer, greener future. 'We must have a chance at a fresh start. We need a general election - now.' Ms Truss's resignation came just a little over 24 hours after she told MPs she was 'a fighter, not a quitter'. But her odds of survival were slashed following chaotic scenes in the Commons after the resignation of Suella Braverman as home secretary. The number of Tory MPs publicly demanding Ms Truss's resignation doubled before lunch was over on Thursday, taking the total to 15, but a far greater number were privately agitating for her exit. The pound lifted on the resignation announcement following another volatile 24 hours for the currency amid political turmoil. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: 'We don't need another Conservative Prime Minister lurching from crisis to crisis. We need a general election now and the Conservatives out of power.' This morning Sir David Lidington, who served as a Cabinet Office minister under former prime minister Theresa May, said Mr Johnson's time in office ended with 60 ministers and parliamentary private secretaries saying 'they did not feel they could remain in his government and that he was not fit to lead an effective administration'. Sir David told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We do need competence now at a time of great economic challenge for this country. 'Boris Johnson has always been somebody who has focused on the big picture, not on detail. 'He is not really interested in the detail of governing and nor when he was prime minister did he appoint a couple of ministers with delegated authority on his behalf to get things done, instead we had bunches of aides in Number 10 busy briefing the media and shouting at each other most of the time.' Sir David added: 'Even on top of the fact that he is still being investigated by Parliament on allegations of deliberately lying to MPs, I think he has had his chance and the Conservative parliamentary party concluded just a few months ago this could not go on and it would not be right for him to continue as prime minister - that, after all, is why he resigned.'"
2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11340075/Ukraines-official-Twitter-account-DELETES-post-backing-Boris-Johnsons-return-Britains-PM.html,Kremlin says 'we don't expect political wisdom from Britain' in response to Boris Johnson's possible return as PM… as Ukraine DELETES tweet backing BoJo,"Russia said it was not expecting any 'political wisdom' from Britain on Friday in response to Boris Johnson's possible return as the country's Prime Minister. After Johnson's successor Liz Truss resigned on Thursday, there is mounting speculation that he could again be elected leader of the Conservative Party - and return for a second stint in Downing Street/ But Moscow, which was also scathing in its assessment of Truss after she resigned, offered a withering view on Johnson's possible return. 'We cannot expect any insights or political wisdom from anyone in the West now... especially from Great Britain, where the current head of the executive is not elected by the people,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Johnson, an outspoken supporter of Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, was ousted from the premiership in July amid a wave of scandals. At the time, Russian media and officials celebrated news of his departure. Meanwhile, Ukraine deleted a tweet backing Johnson to return as Prime Minister, after the country's official Twitter account released a statement which read: 'Better call Boris' - along with a graphic done in the style of TV show Better Call Saul. It was posted on Thursday but by Friday the tweet had been deleted. It was not clear why the tweet was removed. While a polarising figure at home, Johnson had become popular in Ukraine since the country was invaded by Russia in February. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Johnson shared a particularly close relationship, owing primarily to his outspoken support of Ukraine after Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered his troops across the border. Throughout Johnson's messy departure from No 10, Zelensky hailed him as a 'true friend' who 'acted swiftly and resolutely' to offer support. Zelensky, who met the former PM several times, said the UK was his country's 'dearest friend and closest ally' under Johnson, and praised the PM's 'courage and determination' in championing support for the beleaguered country. 'At every meeting and conversation Boris had one very good question, ""What else? What else do you need?"",' he said. 'It became our watchword, guaranteeing effective progress and movement forward.' Now, it's looking possible the pair will be able to continue their professional relationship. On Thursday Russia took one last swipe at Truss after her resignation, saying she was a disgrace of a leader who would be remembered for her 'catastrophic illiteracy'. 'Britain has never known such a disgrace of a prime minister,' Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. 'The catastrophic illiteracy and the queen's funeral immediately after her audience with Liz Truss will be remembered.' The claim of illiteracy appeared to refer to Truss's visit to Moscow in February before Russia invaded Ukraine, when she was Foreign Secretary. In a meeting with Russia's veteran foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, she appeared to confuse two regions of Russia with Ukraine, triggering widespread mockery in Russian media. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev wrote on Twitter: 'Bye, bye @trussliz, congrats to lettuce', referring to the British Daily Star tabloid's days-long livestream asking whether Truss' troubled premiership would outlast the shelf-life of a lettuce. Truss' resignation attracted extensive and gleeful coverage on Russian state TV. A guest on the political talkshow Time Will Tell said Truss had possessed the three traits needed to thrive in British politics: 'Stupidity, arrogance, and belligerence'. Truss has been the target of withering comments from Moscow since she visited in February as part of a fruitless drive by Western politicians to stop the invasion of Ukraine. Russian officials took a dim view of Truss's premiership from the outset and have revelled in her numerous gaffes. Upon her appointment in September, Lavrov said Truss did not know how to compromise and questioned how the British leader could say she did not know whether French president Emmanuel Macron was a 'friend or foe'. Zakharova also mocked Truss' high-profile photo shoot in Estonia last year, where she donned a flak jacket and helmet to ride in a tank during a visit to British troops stationed in the Baltic country. Relations between Moscow and London have deteriorated for years, over issues such as the 2018 poisoning of a former Russian spy in Salisbury. They have reached record lows since Moscow's offensive in Ukraine. The UK is one of Kyiv's staunchest supporters in the face of Putin's invasion, and Russia considers it as one of the most unfriendly Western countries. Twitter is alight with debate. While many are excited at the thought of Johnson's triumphant return to the top job, others have voiced concerns. 'The country needs stability, not scandal,' one critic said. 'Integrity, market confidence, support for the most needy. Oh and there's no money left thanks to him and Truss. Johnson is not anything that this country needs.' Another said: 'Boris Johnson?!

Another added: 'Boris is on his way back to save the UK, he'll rise from the ashes like a phoenix. And we will all live happily ever after.' With a quarter of MPs declaring support for their preferred candidates, Johnson currently counts 50 backers, compared to Rishi Sunak's 39 and Penny Mordaunt's 17, according to the latest tally by Guido Fawkes. It comes after the Conservative Party announced would-be successors would need to win nominations from 100 MPs to get on the ballot.

2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11339799/Russian-missiles-slam-cities-Kharkiv-Zaporizhzhia.html,Russian missiles slam into cities of Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia destroying 'infrastructure' and a SCHOOL - as Putin's brutal mission to terrorise civilians continues,"Russian missiles slammed into two Ukrainian cities early on Friday as Vladimir Putin continues his brutal campaign to terrorise civilians into giving up on the war. Kharkiv, the country's second city, and Zaporizhzhia were struck shortly after 8am local time with targets including 'infrastructure', a school and residential buildings. At least nine people were wounded in the attacks but it appears nobody was killed, local officials said. It is unclear what 'infrastructure' was hit, but Putin's military is currently hitting energy and water facilities in an attempt to freeze Ukrainians as winter approaches. Oleksandr Starukh, head of the Zaporizhzhia regional administration, said on Telegram that Russian S300 anti-aircraft missiles had destroyed 'a residential building and infrastructure facilities' in the city. He said: 'According to preliminary information, there are no casualties. There are three wounded. 'As a result of the attack, the gas system was damaged in a residential high-rise building, there was a fire, and a wall was destroyed. 'The occupier also targeted a school in one of Zaporizhzhia's districts. The roof of the school was damaged and the windows were broken. 'There were also hits on infrastructure facilities and open areas.' Meanwhile Oleg Synegubov, head of the Kharkiv administration, said missiles had struck 'industrial infrastructure' in the north of the city. He said: 'Six people were injured. Information about the destruction and victims is being clarified.' Putin is almost eight months into a war he intended to last days and end with Ukraine being returned to Russia's 'sphere of influence'. Instead, he is in control of less than a fifth of the country and is being forced backwards on two fronts - both north and south. A devastating counter-attack out of Kharkiv routed his troops back in September and led to Ukraine recapturing thousands of square miles of territory in just a few days, Rapid advances have also taken place in Kherson, in the south of the country, where Ukrainian troops are now bearing down on the city itself. Sergei Surovikin, Putin's new commander in Ukraine, has been preparing Russians for a retreat from the city - saying the situation is 'tense' and he refuses to rule out making 'the most difficult decisions'. Losing Kherson, the only regional capital taken during this war, would be the most-humiliating loss that Putin and his armed forces have yet faced. The city is the only toe-hold that Russian forces have on the west bank of the Dnipro River, and is a key stepping-stone on the road to Odesa. Putin's generals have previously said that capturing the Black Sea port city and denying Ukraine access to its coastal trading routes was a key aim of the war. In an attempt to hold on to the city, Ukraine says some 2,000 Russian conscripts have been moved into the area in recent days. Some of Putin's best battlefield units are also stationed there. However, Ukraine also says that Russian forces have booby-trapped the Nova Kakhovka dam - around 40 miles upstream from Kherson - likely as an insurance policy in case the city falls. The Institute for the Study of War, a respected think-tank, said blowing the dam - which would flood dozens of towns and villages - would provide cover for a Russian retreat across the river. It would also further damage Ukraine's power network, and - by blaming the attack on Ukraine - would provide Russia's hardline media commentators something else to discuss other than the army's retreat."
2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11340291/Far-right-Giorgia-Meloni-asks-permission-Italys-leader.html,Giorgia Meloni on brink of leading Italy's first far-right government since WW2 and becoming its female PM as she asks to form an administration,"Far-right politician Giorgia Meloni looks set to become Italy's next leader after officially asking the President for the right to form a government. Meloni and her post-fascist Brothers of Italy party emerged the winners of last month's election, but - short of an overall majority - she needed to negotiate a coalition with allies including Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia. The 45-year-old went to the Quirinal Palace Friday morning to tell President Sergio Mattarella that negotiations were over and she is ready to form an administration. Mr Mattarella could give approval as early as this afternoon, making Ms Meloni Italy's first ever female leader, giving Italy its first far-right government since the Second World War, and taking Brothers of Italy into power for the first time. Her election comes after a turbulent time in Italian politics as messy coalitions formed and fell apart before technocrat Mario Draghi was appointed to take control of the economy until an election could be held. Summing up the reason for Ms Meloni's election last month, one exasperated pensioner told journalists: 'She's the only one we haven't tried yet – which means she's the only one yet to fail.' But Meloni's success is far from assured. She staunchly backs Ukraine in its war with Russia, but coalition partners Mr Berlusconi and Matteo Salvini - leader of the Lega Nord party - have voiced sympathies for Putin. Tensions over the issue are said to have hobbled coalition talks, with leaked audio appearing to show Berlusconi discussing his ties to Moscow and view that Ukraine started the war. However, in public he has been keen to insist his views are in lockstep with Ms Meloni and the European Union What bonds all three candidates are shared Eurosceptic views and a desire to see immigration to Italy greatly reduced. Meloni's coalition wants to renegotiate Italy's part of the EU's post-Covid recovery fund, arguing the almost 200 billion euros it expects to receive should take into account the current energy crisis, exacerbated by Moscow's invasion. But the funds are tied to a series of reforms only just begun by outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi, and analysts say she has limited room for manoeuvre. Meloni had campaigned on a platform of 'God, country and family', sparking fears of a regression on rights in the Catholic-majority country. She has distanced herself from her party's neo-fascist past - and her own, after praising dictator Benito Mussolini as a teenager - and presented herself as a straight-talking but unthreatening leader. Flanked by Mr Berlusconi and Mr Salvini at the presidential palace in Rome today, Ms Meloni said: 'We have indicated myself as the person who should be mandated to form the new government. 'We are ready and we want to move forward in the shortest possible time.' Ms Meloni cited urgent problems 'at both national and international level' - apparent references to soaring energy prices afflicting households and businesses and the war in Ukraine. Forza Italia president Mr Berlusconi and League leader Mr Salvini stayed silent during Ms Meloni's brief remarks to reporters. Three-time premier Mr Berlusconi has been chafing over the election victory by Ms Meloni's Brothers of Italy party in the past month. He recently derided Ms Meloni as 'arrogant' in written comments. Earlier this week in a meeting with his legislators, Mr Berlusconi expressed sympathy for Mr Putin's motivation for invading Ukraine. In response to Mr Berlusconi's comments that were also derogatory about Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky, Ms Meloni insisted that anyone joining her government must be solidly in synch with the West in opposing Putin's war. If that meant her government could not be formed, Ms Meloni said, she would take that risk. Mr Salvini has at times also questioned the wisdom of tough Western sanctions against Russia. A fellow legislator in Mr Salvini's League party who was recently elected president of the lower Chamber of Deputies has publicly expressed doubts about continuing the measures. Outgoing premier Mario Draghi's national pandemic unity coalition collapsed in July, after Mr Salvini, Mr Berlusconi and populist 5-Star Movement leader Giuseppe Conte refused to back his government in a confidence vote. That prompted Mr Mattarella to dissolve parliament and pave the way for elections some six months early. While final efforts to form the new government were under way, Mr Draghi was in Brussels, attending the final day of a European Council summit, grappling with ways to deal with higher energy prices. Giorgia Meloni's Italian revolution: How victorious far-right leader has vowed to boost Italy's population, crack down on migrant boat landings and continue backing for Ukraine She has won over the Italian public with her dogged campaign focusing on 'God, country and family'. And now Giorgia Meloni has the chance to forge the country in her own image after becoming its largest party, making her the presumptive prime minister of a right-wing coalition. While the unmarried mother-of-one has been slammed as an 'heir to Mussolini' and a neo-fascist, the firebrand has tried to shrug off the labels and appeal to all Italians. Throughout the election, she has focused on the importance of religion and the family unit, railing against the EU and 'woke ideology'. She has courted controversy for slamming the 'LGBT lobby', suggesting she is against abortions, and proposing to blockade Libya to stop migrants crossing the Mediterranean. The influence of her minor coalition partners, Matteo Salvini of the anti-immigrant Lega party and the more moderate Silvio Berlusconi of Forza Italia, could also have a bearing on her leadership. Here, MailOnline takes a look at what the new leader has vowed to do for Italy. While Meloni has backed for the West's policies on Ukraine, coalition partners Matteo Salvini and Silvio Berlusconi have questioned the use of sanctions against Moscow and expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin in the past. Meloni herself also congratulated Putin for his election win in 2018 but has now taken a stronger stance against the tyrant who has rocked Europe with his savage invasion of Ukraine. The coalition programme has committed to respect NATO pledges and backs all attempts to find a solution to the war. Meloni also backs supplying arms so Ukraine can defend itself. The politician used to advocate leaving the EU's single currency but she has now moderated her stance. She has committed to the 'full adherence to the European integration process' but wants a 'more political and less bureaucratic' bloc. She has also called for a review of EU rules on public spending and wants to promote Judeo-Christian values across the union. Her technocratic predecessor Mario Draghi was a key Eurocentric figure, and Meloni's victory risks upsetting the EU at a time when the bloc is already fragile, following Brexit and the departure of Angela Merkel. Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, pushed Rome to the centre of EU policy-making during his 18-month stint in office, forging close ties with Paris and Berlin. In Europe, the first to hail Meloni's victory were hard-right opposition parties in Spain and France, and Poland and Hungary's national conservative governments which both have strained relations with Brussels. Meloni says Rome must stand up more for its national interests and has backed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in his battles with Brussels. For years, the right wing has crusaded against unbridled immigration, after hundreds of thousands of migrants reached Italy's shores aboard smugglers' boats or vessels that rescued them in the Mediterranean Sea. Both Meloni and Salvini have thundered against what they see as an invasion of foreigners not sharing what they call Italy's 'Christian' character. Last month, Meloni was slammed for sharing a video of a Ukrainian woman being raped by an asylum seeker in an Italian city, in a bid to whip up anti-migrant hysteria. A 55-year-old woman was assaulted on a pavement in the city of Piacenza early Sunday by an asylum seeker from Guinea, local officials said. Meloni, tweeted the video saying: 'A hug to this woman. I will do everything I can to restore security to our cities.' She has vowed to bring an end to the influx of migrants, a position she shares with Salvini, who is currently on trial for blocking charity rescue ships when he was interior minister in 2019. She is seeking to target in particular traffickers' boats coming from Libya to Italy and the granting of automatic citizenship to babies born to foreign parents. She wants the Italian navy to blockade the north African coast so that all migrants can be screened before leaving to ascertain whether they are genuine refugees. Those who can prove their refugee status should be allowed through, Meloni said, while those who cannot should be sent home. Speaking to a TV channel owned by the Berlusconi family, she said: 'The problem of migrant arrivals on our shores must be tackled at its source, with a ""naval blockade"".' Likening the plan to EU proposals to get tough on border security, she added: '[This] is no different than a European mission to negotiate together with Libya, the possibility to block the inflatable boats during their departure.' But Meloni's plans came under attack by political opponents, who said any attempt to blockade the shores of a foreign nation would be a de-facto declaration of war. 'Meloni, do you know that under international law it is considered an act of war,' tweeted former house speaker Laura Boldrini. 'Do you know that more ships would be required than the navy has? Do you know the number of dead would outnumber those rejected?' Meloni said: 'Uncontrolled immigration is what ordinary people worry about. It impacts on those in the lower level of society. 'Those who defend open borders, they live on the higher level. A country must be able to decide who comes in.' She doesn't care if Italy's Left-wing press vilifies her for her views, as highlighted by a speech she made in Spain to their Right-wing Vox party a few weeks ago. She reportedly told the rally, with some vigour: 'Yes to natural families, no to the LGBT lobby, yes to sexual identity, no to gender ideology,' before adding, her voice rising to a crescendo: 'No to the violence of Islam, yes to safer borders, no to mass immigration, yes to working for our people.' Meloni has also pledged to establish EU-run centres outside the bloc to manage asylum applications to the continent. She also wants more integrated migration for those who do come to Italy legally, with programmes intended to encourage a more harmonious society. Among her major policies are big cuts on income tax, VAT and business taxes. Like much of Europe, Italy is suffering rampant inflation while an energy crisis looms this winter, linked to the conflict in Ukraine. The Italian economy, the third largest in the eurozone, is also saddled with a debt worth 150 percent of gross domestic product. She has emphasised fiscal prudence, despite her coalition's call for tax cuts and higher social spending. Family purchasing power will be protected despite soaring inflation, and pensions and benefits will be revaluated. She wants to make full use of the £195billion allotted under the EU's Covid recovery plan to reduce the tax burden for families, businesses and the self-employed who will receive a flat tax. At the same time, she wants to renegotiate the grant, seeking more money from the bloc on account of the Russia-Ukraine war and the energy crisis which has exacerbated the previous economic issues. Russian gas accounts for 40 per cent of Italy's imports and she wants to increase its production of renewable energy, and consider nuclear power plants. One of Meloni's biggest obstacles has been her outspoken statements on abortion and the LGBT community as she vows to restore the family unit. At political rallies Meloni has fiercely denounced what she calls 'gender ideology' and 'the LGBT lobby'. Federico Mollicone, her culture spokesperson, said last week that same-sex parenting was not normal, triggering outrage. Speaking in a television interview with San Marino's Rtv late on Thursday, Mollicone revived criticism he had previously expressed of an episode of the popular children's cartoon 'Peppa Pig' that featured a polar bear with two mothers. 'It is a very serious issue,' Mollicone said. 'As long as the Italian state does not legislate on these couples, presenting them as something absolutely normal is wrong, because it is not.' He went on to say that 'in Italy homosexual couples are not legal, are not allowed' - despite the country having legalised same-sex civil unions in 2016 with a reform that FdI opposed in parliament. After the criticism of his comments Mollicone clarified on Friday that he was referring only to gay couples who adopt. He insisted that his party now supports civil unions and 'is against all discrimination.' Two weeks ago he caused a stir when he said the 'Peppa Pig' episode with the lesbian polar bears, first aired in Britain, should not be broadcast in Italy to avoid 'gender indoctrination'. During the campaign, Meloni has repeatedly denied suggestions she might roll back legislation on abortion or gay rights, while reaffirming her opposition to adoptions and surrogacy for LGBT couples. Meloni said she wanted to give a choice to women unsure about terminating pregnancies. 'We won't touch the abortion law. We just want (women) to know there are other options,' she said. Meloni is likely to keep her word on not criminalising abortion, said Bonino, who did time in jail in the 1970s for her fight to legalise it. But she fears Meloni will instead 'push for the law to be ignored', exacerbating an existing problem - difficulties in getting hold of abortion pills or finding gynaecologists willing to perform terminations. Following her election today, French prime minister Elizabeth Borne said she will be 'attentive' to the respect of the right to abortion and other human rights in Italy. 'Obviously we will be attentive, with the president of the European Commission, that these values of human rights, the respect of one another, notably the respect of abortion rights, are respected by all,' Borne told BFM television. Meloni has openly discussed how she wants to reverse Italy's declining population, and limiting abortion would help stop that trend. She also wants to offer incentives for having children including free nurseries, employment protection for young mothers and more welfare payments."
2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11340285/Putins-men-spotted-stealing-WASHING-MACHINE-Ukrainian-home.html,Now Russia 'liberates'... a WASHING MACHINE: Putin's men are spotted stealing kitchen appliance from Ukrainian home,"Two Russian soldiers have been spotted looting a washing machine from a house in Ukraine, before loading it into a military vehicle with a large white 'Z' painted on it. The aerial footage, which was filmed by a Ukrainian drone, shows a pair of Vladimir Putin's soldiers awkwardly carrying the appliance out of the house and across a debris-covered front lawn, before pausing when they reach the gate to the property. After a brief stop to catch their breath, they can then be seen taking the washing machine through a gate before changing sides, and carrying it down a dirt road leading back to their military vehicle. Despite being mostly hidden under a tree, the large white 'Z' is still clear in the footage, showing that the vehicle belongs to Moscow's forces. The 'Z' is one of the symbols, as well as the letters 'V' and 'O' that can be seen painted on many Russian military vehicles taking part in the invasion of Ukraine. With it not being in the Russian alphabet, it has also become a pro-war symbol in the country, and used in propaganda by the Kremlin. The two soldiers can then be seen loading the washing machine into the vehicle, before returning to the house - again going back through the gate and across the lawn as the footage ends. One side of the large house they are apparently looting has been severely damaged, likely by an explosion caused by Russian artillery. The garden down the side of the house is covered in debris, while one of the windows and some of the roof have been blown away. The images were obtained from the Office of Strategic Communications (StratCom) of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Friday, October 21. It was posted to social media channels along with a statement saying: 'The second army of the world - the first army of looters conducted a special operation to free a washing machine from its owners. Every criminal will inevitably be punished.' The images and statement were also relayed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The footage was also shared on Reddit where netizens joked that the Russian soldiers had obviously never seen a washing machine before. Several reports out of Ukraine have told of Russian soldiers looting houses. Pavel Filatiev, a Russian paratrooper who defected from his home country and wrote a memoir of his time fighting in Ukraine, revealed how his company were so desperate for food, they looted a local supermarket. In May 2022, the Moscow Times reported that at least 58 tonnes of looted goods from Ukraine had been sent back to Russia by a group of soldiers. There have also been reports of Russian soldiers looting Ukraine's museums."
2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11338753/Swiss-Air-Force-puts-stunning-display-annual-joining-sanctions-against-Russia.html,The future of Swiss neutrality? Swiss Air Force puts on a stunning display at the annual Axalp show - after taking unusual step in joining Europe's sanctions against Russia,"Switzerland's Air Force put on an impressive display at an annual air show in the Alps, amid heightened military tensions in Europe. The famously neutral country has an air force with around 20,000 active personnel, and yesterday showed off its aerial prowess near the summit of the Axalphorn mountain. Tiger F5 airplanes, F-35s, Cougar helicopters and special forces put on a highly-skilled and synchronised performance for onlookers above a stunning background at the annual Axalp show. The land-locked nation has traditionally avoided major European conflicts, such as WWI and WWII, however earlier this summer they angered Russia. In August Russia said Switzerland could not act as go-between in talks with Ukraine because Moscow no longer considers it a neutral country. Switzerland mirrored nearly all the sanctions that the European Union imposed on Russia over its military intervention in Ukraine. The origins of demonstration trace back to World War II, due to the threat of a possible Nazi invasion. The two-day event from the air force shows off its ability in an alpine environment to a public audience. Onlookers were able to see Tiger F5 airplanes from the Patrouille Suisse drop flares during the annual airshow. A Cougar helicopter of the Swiss Air Force also dropped flares and showed its manoeuvrability, including an exercise where Special forces were evacuated. The event is held at Ebenfluh firing range near the summit of the 7,614 feet (2,321m) high Axalphorn mountain. Switzerland has been officially neutral since the singing of the Treaty of Paris 1815, following the final defeat and abdication of Napoleon Bonaparte. However, the Swiss Confederacy had been effectively neutral since 1525 when it pledged never to wage a war of aggression again following defeat to the French at the Battle of Marignano ten years earlier. It means the Swiss can lay claim to having one of the longest-standing neutrality pacts in the world which it maintained throughout both world wars - though it sometimes shot down planes of both sides that crossed into its airspace. Despite its neutrality men aged 19 or older are required to complete compulsory military service. Switzerland has around 140,000 military personnel Switzerland has effectively been neutral for more than 500 years, but a poll from the summer shows citizens increasingly believing that is not the best way to protect their country. Record-high numbers of Swiss said in July that the government should increase defence spending, maintain a fully-equipped army, and build tighter relations with NATO. It comes after Sweden and Finland broke with decades-long neutrality agreements of their own to join NATO, saying Putin's war in the east had prompted them to do so. Overall, support for neutrality in Switzerland remains high - with 89 per cent saying they favour it - but for the first time in two decades that figure has fallen. Back in January, before Russia invaded Ukraine, 96 per cent of Swiss were in favour of neutrality - meaning support has dropped eight per cent in just six months. An unprecedented 52 per cent now favour their country 'moving closer' to NATO, though only 27 per cent want to actually join. The new study was carried out by the Swiss military academy and the Centre for Security Studies, which polled 1,000 people between May and June. The results were compared to a similar survey that was published in January. Pollsters also found that 80 per cent of Swiss now favour their country having an army, while a record 74 per cent say it should be 'fully-equipped' Switzerland has one of Europe's largest reserve forces and still has national service, but maintains only a tiny standing army supported by ageing tanks, armoured vehicles and planes. Nineteen per cent of Swiss now want their government to spend more money on improving that force, up from just seven per cent early this year."
2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11340485/Extra-police-deployed-Shetland-phones-internet-services-temporarily-restored.html,"Extra police are deployed on Shetland as phones and internet services are temporarily restored for 23,000 residents - but it could take a WEEK to repair underwater cables","Extra police are being deployed on Shetland as phones and internet services are temporarily restored for its 23,000 inhabitants - but it could take a week to fix damaged underwater cables. Shetland suffered a total blackout yesterday after the south subsea telecommunications cable between the islands and the mainland was cut which saw a 'major incident' declared by police. It came after another subsea cable connecting Shetland and the Faroe Islands was damaged last week. BT Group, which provides communications services through the cables, said engineers who have been working 'flat out' have been able to reconnect all services via a temporary solution - but both cables are still being repaired. The temporary solution was found on Thursday afternoon and by last night broadband and phone signals were returning to the islands. Cable operator Faeroese Telecom said they expect repairs to the first damaged cable to be completed by this weekend. The second damaged cable will then be examined by specialist subsea engineers and is expected to be repaired next week. Police Scotland told Mail Online they are still carrying out patrols today to provide support and will continue to do so until the issue is completely resolved. Faeroese Telecom’s head of infrastructure Páll Vesturbú said he believed the damage to both cables was likely caused by fishing vessels. The cause is yet to be officially confirmed. It came after a top military man warned in January that Russian sabotage could wreck undersea cables that supply our internet and $10 trillion of financial deals a day. Then just weeks ago senior politicians, defence chiefs and experts warned Europe's critical infrastructure is now at risk after the Nord Stream gas pipes were blown up in an attack widely thought to have been orchestrated by Russia. A spokesperson for the BT group said on Friday: 'Further testing and monitoring overnight has shown that broadband services have remained stable, and we will continue to monitor this. 'As a precaution, we have specialist teams in Shetland with satellite backup links should either of the subsea cables fail while they are being repaired.' Mr Vesturbú told the BBC: 'We have reason to believe that the cable was damaged by a fishing vessel. 'There was also an incident last week, and we also believe that this was caused by a fishing vessel.' First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the situation as 'very serious' for Shetland and confirmed the Scottish government's resilience committee met to ensure necessary support was provided. Homes and businesses were affected across the Shetland archipelago, which is 130 miles (210 km) from the Scottish mainland. Many shops were unable to take card payments. People were warned not to try and make non urgent calls and to check on elderly or vulnerable neighbours amid concerns assistance alarms could not be working. The MP for Orkney and Shetlands, Alastair Carmichael, told Mailonline yesterday: 'We don't know the cause yet. These things have happened in the past with catastrophic effect. 'It is not unknown and usually it is because a trawler picks up the line on the seabed and pulls it up and breaks it. 'That has been known to happen in the past but at the moment they are pretty well focused on finding out exactly where it is broken and getting whatever you need to do to get it fixed.' While he said the priority was fixing the issue, he added that resilience would also need to be looked at in future. 'That is kind of the order of things,' Mr Carmichael said. 'Get it fixed, find out how it broke and then think about what you need to do to make sure it doesn't happen again in the future.' Asked if the damage could have been caused by the Russians in retaliation for the UK's support for Ukraine during the country's war with Putin's army, Mr Carmichael said that had not been ruled out and was very much on people's minds. Mr Carmichael added that it was too early to say with any certainty what was behind the damage and that Russian interference could not be ruled out. He said: 'You're not the first person to ask me that. I have no reason to believe that is the case and as I say we have known this kind of thing to happen before. But until you know anything I guess is possible.' Northern Police said in a tweet about the Shetland outage on Thursday morning: 'Engineers are working to fix a complete outage on Shetland affecting its connection to the main line. 'Phones, internet and computers are not usable. 'Officers will continue to patrol the area and we will give you an update on the situation as soon as we have more information.' A BT Group spokesperson had said: 'Due to a break in a third-party subsea cable connecting Shetland with the Scottish mainland, some phone, broadband and mobile services are affected. 'Engineers are working to divert services via other routes as soon as possible and we'll provide further updates. 'Our external subsea provider is also looking to restore their link quickly. 'Anyone who needs to call 999 should try their landline or their mobile, even if they don't have signal from their own mobile provider. We're sorry for any inconvenience.' People tweeted about the incident as minimal WiFi appeared to be functioning. One said: 'I messaged my dad and no reply, obviously.' She added: 'Guess I won't be speaking to my parents then.' Another wrote: 'No internet. No mobiles. Limited landline phone, sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. Shop down the road only accepting cash.' One said he was having to reschedule meetings and described the implications of the outage given the scale of it as 'pretty scary'. Shetland, also known as the Shetland Islands, lie 105 miles north of the Scottish mainland. The total area is just 550 square miles and, in 2019, the population totalled 22,920. The local authority, Shetland Islands Council, is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland and the islands' administrative centre is Lerwick - which has been the capital of Shetland since 1708. The islands were initially dominated by Scandinavian influences, especially from Norway, and they later became part of Scotland in the 15th century. Scotland became part of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 which caused a decrease in trade with northern Europe. Fishing continues to be an important aspect of the economy up to the present day. The discovery of North Sea oil in the 1970s significantly boosted Shetland's economy, employment and public sector revenues. There are also numerous areas set aside to protect the local fauna and flora, including a number of important sea bird nesting sites. The Shetland pony and Shetland Sheepdog are two well-known animal breeds that originated on the islands. Police Scotland was in talks with partners including the Scottish Fire and Recue Service and HM Coastguard to bring additional emergency support to the island. Their most recent statement said: 'Extra resources are being sent to Shetland as Police Scotland works with partners to ensure the public can access emergency services during the current outage affecting some landlines and mobiles. 'Engineers are working to restore or divert services via other routes and in an emergency you should be able call 999 from your landline or mobile even if you don’t have a signal from your mobile provider.' Superintendent David Ross added: 'We are working with partners to ensure people across Shetland have access to emergency services. Officers and vehicles from across Scotland are being sent to assist until normal service is resumed. 'They will be ready to be deployed on Friday, 21 October, and will remain as long as necessary. Local police stations are open and there is an emergency Hub set up in the Tesco car park in South Road, Lerwick. 'In the meantime, we are advising people not to make non-urgent calls for the time being so that all available lines can be used for emergencies if required. 'If you cannot access 999 by phone you should go to your nearest police station, ambulance station, fire station or hospital to report an emergency or try flagging down an emergency services vehicle that does not have its blue lights on. 'Officers are patrolling in vehicles and on foot and will continue to make themselves available. In addition, I would ask that relatives and neighbours of elderly or vulnerable people check on them regularly. Assistance alarms may not be operating correctly.' Mr Carmichael yesterday said he had raised the issue with the UK government. He insisted both the Scottish and UK governments should be 'all hands to the pump' to get the line repaired as soon as possible. 'The impact has been severe. It is a massive inconvenience because we rely on good phone and broadband lines for so much these days but also the fact that you are not easily going to be able to contact the emergency services has got to be worrying.' He added: 'I don't want ministers in Edinburgh saying this has nothing to do with us. It's all London's fault or vice versa. If there's something to be done to fix this they should all be doing it.' Thousands of feet under the ocean lies a global network of internet cables responsible for carrying 97 per cent of international communications. If they were to be disabled, it would not just prevent us accessing the web on our phones and laptops — it would disrupt everything from agriculture and healthcare to military logistics and financial transactions, instantly plunging the world into a new depression. According to experts, this doomsday scenario ranks alongside nuclear war as an existential threat to our way of life. In January, chief of the defence staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said he thought Russia is the hostile power most likely to cripple these vital arteries. In an interview, he said there had been 'a phenomenal increase' in Russian submarine activity over the past 20 years, adding: 'Russia has grown the capability to put at threat those undersea cables and potentially exploit them.' Any such interference would be treated with the utmost seriousness. Asked whether destroying cables could be considered an act of war, Britain's most senior military officer said: 'Potentially, yes.' In shallower waters, a vessel could deliberately drag an anchor along the seabed to rip the cables apart. Such an attack could be covered up by passing it off as an innocent fishing boat accident. Defence experts warned last month that Europe's critical infrastructure could be at risk after the Nord Stream gas pipes were blown up in an attack widely thought to have been orchestrated by Russia. Fears mounted that pipelines, rigs and undersea cables that countries including Britain rely on for energy, banking, stock trading and business could now be targeted, as German interior minister Nancy Faeser warned leaders to prepare for 'previously unimaginable' threats to their nations. Some have already begun scrambling to shore up their defences. Jonas Gahr Stoere, Norway's prime minister, said the military would be visibly deployed around oil and gas rigs to protect them. That suggests the UK - connected to Norway via two major pipelines which carry a third of this country's gas - could also be at risk. Britain's largest oil and gas fields, which are dotted with dozens of rigs and criss-crossed by pipes, also sit close to Norwegian waters. A Ministry of Defence spokesman previously said: 'We constantly observe our areas of responsibility and interest, this includes protecting critical infrastructure such as underwater cables and offshore structures.' Mark Galeotti - a Russia expert, former adviser to the foreign office, and now at the Council on Geostrategy - told MailOnline that Putin is 'likely' behind the Nord Stream attack and intended it 'as a warning'. 'They blow up their own pipeline to remind the West that if it really pushes Putin into a corner, amongst his options are attacks on infrastructure,' he said. 'A pipeline from Norway to Poland has just been inaugurated, after all. Just as seriously, he could target undersea internet cables, which would not 'break' the internet but would certainly degrade it.' The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the explosions, dismissing the suggestion as 'stupid '. But Russia does have the capacity to carry out such an attack. Britain sent warships to the North Sea to protect underwater gas and oil pipelines and internet cables from Russian sabotage after the Nordstream was blown up in a suspected Kremlin attack. Type 23 frigate HMS Somerset and survey ship HMS Enterprise were deployed earlier this month amid fears that pipelines, rigs and undersea cables that countries including Britain rely upon for energy were at risk of further attacks. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace acted to 'reassure' those working near the pipelines after Western intelligence agencies were blindsided by the pipeline blasts."
2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11341343/Giorgia-Meloni-officially-Italys-female-PM.html,Giorgia Meloni officially becomes Italy's first female PM and will lead country's first far-right coalition since WW2,"Far-right politician Giorgia Meloni has been elected as Italy's leader after officially asking the President for the right to form a government. Meloni and her post-fascist Brothers of Italy party emerged the winners of last month's election, but short of an overall majority. She has now formed Italy's most right-wing government since Benito Mussolini after negotiating a coalition with allies including Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia. The 45-year-old went to the Quirinal Palace Friday morning to tell President Sergio Mattarella that negotiations were over and she is ready to form an administration. A presidential palace official announced that Meloni and her Cabinet would be sworn in on Saturday. Meloni's Brothers of Italy, a party with neo-fascist roots, was the top vote-getter in Italy's national election last month. Her coalition partners are Silvio Berlusconi and Matteo Salvini, leader of anti-migrant League party. Obtaining the premiership capped a remarkably quick rise for the Brothers of Italy. Meloni co-founded the party in December 2012, and it was considered a fringe movement on the right during its first years. Meloni made no public comments before leaving the Quirinal presidential palace. Earlier in the day, she met with Mattarella along with her two main, sometimes troublesome, right-wing allies - Matteo Salvini and former Premier Silvio Berlusconi. Mattarella told reporters the government was formed in 'brief time' following the Sept. 25 election. After the last election, in 2018, it took three months for a new ruling coalition to come together. Quickly giving the country a new government 'was possible due to the clarity of the vote outcome and to the need to proceed swiftly also because of the domestic and international conditions that require a government in its fullness to carry out its tasks,' Mattarella said. Italy and much of the rest of Europe are struggling with soaring energy costs and the drama of Russia's war in Ukraine, which could crimp gas supplies this winter and continue increasing household and business power bills. Her election comes after a turbulent time in Italian politics as messy coalitions formed and fell apart before technocrat Mario Draghi was appointed to take control of the economy until an election could be held. Summing up the reason for Ms Meloni's election last month, one exasperated pensioner told journalists: 'She's the only one we haven't tried yet – which means she's the only one yet to fail.' But Meloni's success is far from assured. She staunchly backs Ukraine in its war with Russia, but coalition partners Mr Berlusconi and Matteo Salvini - leader of the Lega Nord party - have voiced sympathies for Putin. Tensions over the issue are said to have hobbled coalition talks, with leaked audio appearing to show Berlusconi discussing his ties to Moscow and view that Ukraine started the war. However, in public he has been keen to insist his views are in lockstep with Ms Meloni and the European Union What bonds all three candidates are shared Eurosceptic views and a desire to see immigration to Italy greatly reduced. Meloni's coalition wants to renegotiate Italy's part of the EU's post-Covid recovery fund, arguing the almost 200 billion euros it expects to receive should take into account the current energy crisis, exacerbated by Moscow's invasion. But the funds are tied to a series of reforms only just begun by outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi, and analysts say she has limited room for manoeuvre. Meloni had campaigned on a platform of 'God, country and family', sparking fears of a regression on rights in the Catholic-majority country. She has distanced herself from her party's neo-fascist past - and her own, after praising dictator Benito Mussolini as a teenager - and presented herself as a straight-talking but unthreatening leader. Flanked by Mr Berlusconi and Mr Salvini at the presidential palace in Rome today, Ms Meloni said: 'We have indicated myself as the person who should be mandated to form the new government. 'We are ready and we want to move forward in the shortest possible time.' Ms Meloni cited urgent problems 'at both national and international level' - apparent references to soaring energy prices afflicting households and businesses and the war in Ukraine. Forza Italia president Mr Berlusconi and League leader Mr Salvini stayed silent during Ms Meloni's brief remarks to reporters. Three-time premier Mr Berlusconi has been chafing over the election victory by Ms Meloni's Brothers of Italy party in the past month. He recently derided Ms Meloni as 'arrogant' in written comments. Earlier this week in a meeting with his legislators, Mr Berlusconi expressed sympathy for Mr Putin's motivation for invading Ukraine. In response to Mr Berlusconi's comments that were also derogatory about Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky, Ms Meloni insisted that anyone joining her government must be solidly in synch with the West in opposing Putin's war. If that meant her government could not be formed, Ms Meloni said, she would take that risk. Mr Salvini has at times also questioned the wisdom of tough Western sanctions against Russia. A fellow legislator in Mr Salvini's League party who was recently elected president of the lower Chamber of Deputies has publicly expressed doubts about continuing the measures. Outgoing premier Mario Draghi's national pandemic unity coalition collapsed in July, after Mr Salvini, Mr Berlusconi and populist 5-Star Movement leader Giuseppe Conte refused to back his government in a confidence vote. That prompted Mr Mattarella to dissolve parliament and pave the way for elections some six months early. While final efforts to form the new government were under way, Mr Draghi was in Brussels, attending the final day of a European Council summit, grappling with ways to deal with higher energy prices. Giorgia Meloni's Italian revolution: How victorious far-right leader has vowed to boost Italy's population, crack down on migrant boat landings and continue backing for Ukraine She has won over the Italian public with her dogged campaign focusing on 'God, country and family'. And now Giorgia Meloni has the chance to forge the country in her own image after becoming its largest party, making her the presumptive prime minister of a right-wing coalition. While the unmarried mother-of-one has been slammed as an 'heir to Mussolini' and a neo-fascist, the firebrand has tried to shrug off the labels and appeal to all Italians. Throughout the election, she has focused on the importance of religion and the family unit, railing against the EU and 'woke ideology'. She has courted controversy for slamming the 'LGBT lobby', suggesting she is against abortions, and proposing to blockade Libya to stop migrants crossing the Mediterranean. The influence of her minor coalition partners, Matteo Salvini of the anti-immigrant Lega party and the more moderate Silvio Berlusconi of Forza Italia, could also have a bearing on her leadership. Here, MailOnline takes a look at what the new leader has vowed to do for Italy. While Meloni has backed for the West's policies on Ukraine, coalition partners Matteo Salvini and Silvio Berlusconi have questioned the use of sanctions against Moscow and expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin in the past. Meloni herself also congratulated Putin for his election win in 2018 but has now taken a stronger stance against the tyrant who has rocked Europe with his savage invasion of Ukraine. The coalition programme has committed to respect NATO pledges and backs all attempts to find a solution to the war. Meloni also backs supplying arms so Ukraine can defend itself. The politician used to advocate leaving the EU's single currency but she has now moderated her stance. She has committed to the 'full adherence to the European integration process' but wants a 'more political and less bureaucratic' bloc. She has also called for a review of EU rules on public spending and wants to promote Judeo-Christian values across the union. Her technocratic predecessor Mario Draghi was a key Eurocentric figure, and Meloni's victory risks upsetting the EU at a time when the bloc is already fragile, following Brexit and the departure of Angela Merkel. Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, pushed Rome to the centre of EU policy-making during his 18-month stint in office, forging close ties with Paris and Berlin. In Europe, the first to hail Meloni's victory were hard-right opposition parties in Spain and France, and Poland and Hungary's national conservative governments which both have strained relations with Brussels. Meloni says Rome must stand up more for its national interests and has backed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in his battles with Brussels. For years, the right wing has crusaded against unbridled immigration, after hundreds of thousands of migrants reached Italy's shores aboard smugglers' boats or vessels that rescued them in the Mediterranean Sea. Both Meloni and Salvini have thundered against what they see as an invasion of foreigners not sharing what they call Italy's 'Christian' character. Last month, Meloni was slammed for sharing a video of a Ukrainian woman being raped by an asylum seeker in an Italian city, in a bid to whip up anti-migrant hysteria. A 55-year-old woman was assaulted on a pavement in the city of Piacenza early Sunday by an asylum seeker from Guinea, local officials said. Meloni, tweeted the video saying: 'A hug to this woman. I will do everything I can to restore security to our cities.' She has vowed to bring an end to the influx of migrants, a position she shares with Salvini, who is currently on trial for blocking charity rescue ships when he was interior minister in 2019. She is seeking to target in particular traffickers' boats coming from Libya to Italy and the granting of automatic citizenship to babies born to foreign parents. She wants the Italian navy to blockade the north African coast so that all migrants can be screened before leaving to ascertain whether they are genuine refugees. Those who can prove their refugee status should be allowed through, Meloni said, while those who cannot should be sent home. Speaking to a TV channel owned by the Berlusconi family, she said: 'The problem of migrant arrivals on our shores must be tackled at its source, with a 'naval blockade'.' Likening the plan to EU proposals to get tough on border security, she added: '[This] is no different than a European mission to negotiate together with Libya, the possibility to block the inflatable boats during their departure.' But Meloni's plans came under attack by political opponents, who said any attempt to blockade the shores of a foreign nation would be a de-facto declaration of war. 'Meloni, do you know that under international law it is considered an act of war,' tweeted former house speaker Laura Boldrini. 'Do you know that more ships would be required than the navy has? Do you know the number of dead would outnumber those rejected?' Meloni said: 'Uncontrolled immigration is what ordinary people worry about. It impacts on those in the lower level of society. 'Those who defend open borders, they live on the higher level. A country must be able to decide who comes in.' She doesn't care if Italy's Left-wing press vilifies her for her views, as highlighted by a speech she made in Spain to their Right-wing Vox party a few weeks ago. She reportedly told the rally, with some vigour: 'Yes to natural families, no to the LGBT lobby, yes to sexual identity, no to gender ideology,' before adding, her voice rising to a crescendo: 'No to the violence of Islam, yes to safer borders, no to mass immigration, yes to working for our people.' Meloni has also pledged to establish EU-run centres outside the bloc to manage asylum applications to the continent. She also wants more integrated migration for those who do come to Italy legally, with programmes intended to encourage a more harmonious society. Among her major policies are big cuts on income tax, VAT and business taxes. Like much of Europe, Italy is suffering rampant inflation while an energy crisis looms this winter, linked to the conflict in Ukraine. The Italian economy, the third largest in the eurozone, is also saddled with a debt worth 150 percent of gross domestic product. She has emphasised fiscal prudence, despite her coalition's call for tax cuts and higher social spending. Family purchasing power will be protected despite soaring inflation, and pensions and benefits will be revaluated. She wants to make full use of the £195billion allotted under the EU's Covid recovery plan to reduce the tax burden for families, businesses and the self-employed who will receive a flat tax. At the same time, she wants to renegotiate the grant, seeking more money from the bloc on account of the Russia-Ukraine war and the energy crisis which has exacerbated the previous economic issues. Russian gas accounts for 40 per cent of Italy's imports and she wants to increase its production of renewable energy, and consider nuclear power plants. One of Meloni's biggest obstacles has been her outspoken statements on abortion and the LGBT community as she vows to restore the family unit. At political rallies Meloni has fiercely denounced what she calls 'gender ideology' and 'the LGBT lobby'. Federico Mollicone, her culture spokesperson, said last week that same-sex parenting was not normal, triggering outrage. Speaking in a television interview with San Marino's Rtv late on Thursday, Mollicone revived criticism he had previously expressed of an episode of the popular children's cartoon 'Peppa Pig' that featured a polar bear with two mothers. 'It is a very serious issue,' Mollicone said. 'As long as the Italian state does not legislate on these couples, presenting them as something absolutely normal is wrong, because it is not.' He went on to say that 'in Italy homosexual couples are not legal, are not allowed' - despite the country having legalised same-sex civil unions in 2016 with a reform that FdI opposed in parliament. After the criticism of his comments Mollicone clarified on Friday that he was referring only to gay couples who adopt. He insisted that his party now supports civil unions and 'is against all discrimination.' Two weeks ago he caused a stir when he said the 'Peppa Pig' episode with the lesbian polar bears, first aired in Britain, should not be broadcast in Italy to avoid 'gender indoctrination'. During the campaign, Meloni has repeatedly denied suggestions she might roll back legislation on abortion or gay rights, while reaffirming her opposition to adoptions and surrogacy for LGBT couples. Meloni said she wanted to give a choice to women unsure about terminating pregnancies. 'We won't touch the abortion law. We just want (women) to know there are other options,' she said. Meloni is likely to keep her word on not criminalising abortion, said Bonino, who did time in jail in the 1970s for her fight to legalise it. But she fears Meloni will instead 'push for the law to be ignored', exacerbating an existing problem - difficulties in getting hold of abortion pills or finding gynaecologists willing to perform terminations. Following her election today, French prime minister Elizabeth Borne said she will be 'attentive' to the respect of the right to abortion and other human rights in Italy. 'Obviously we will be attentive, with the president of the European Commission, that these values of human rights, the respect of one another, notably the respect of abortion rights, are respected by all,' Borne told BFM television. Meloni has openly discussed how she wants to reverse Italy's declining population, and limiting abortion would help stop that trend. She also wants to offer incentives for having children including free nurseries, employment protection for young mothers and more welfare payments."
2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11338093/Gordon-Sondland-defends-ex-Presidents-Israel-comments-says-Democrats-fed-lines-impeachment.html,"EXCLUSIVE: Trump's EU ambassador Gordon Sondland defends ex-President's Israel comments, says Democrats fed him lines for impeachment hearings and admits there was a smaller chance of Putin invading if the Donald was in office","Gordon Sondland was thrust into the limelight as a focal witness in Donald Trump's first impeachment trial in 2019. The hotelier-turned U.S. Ambassador to the European Union put the nail in the coffin with his bombshell testimony that Trump did offer Ukrainian President Zelensky millions in military aid and a trip to the White House if he investigated his political rivals. Three years on he insists he doesn't regret his 'quid pro comments' and has distanced himself from Trump - but believes the Democrat's impeachment of the former president was a scam. He also admitted in an interview with DailyMail.com that even though he might not support Trump, he still agrees there was a smaller chance of Putin invading Ukraine if he was president and admits the Donald had a point when he said American Jews need to 'get their act together.' 'I think he's right to a certain extent actually,' Sondland, whose Jewish parents came to America to escape the Holocaust, said in a wide-ranging conversation. 'The irony to me is that some of the most successful jews whose parents grandparents like mine came out of the holocaust built lives fortunes here in US don't understand importance of Israel.' 'No President has done more for Israel than I have. Somewhat surprisingly, however, our wonderful Evangelicals are far more appreciative of this than the people of the Jewish faith, especially those living in the U.S,' Trump said on his Truth Social app Sunday. 'Those living in Israel, though, are a different story - Highest approval rating in the World, could easily be P.M.!' Trump concluded: 'U.S. Jews have to get their act together and appreciate what they have in Israel - Before it is too late!' Turning to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Sondland said Vladimir Putin would have been far less likely Trump had been president. 'I think that deep in Putin's DNA is the reunification of Ukraine and Russia. I think he would have been looking for any opportunity under any president,' he said. 'But the odds would have been lower. A lot lower.' 'Trump took a counter-veiling approach which is instead of doing what every president since the beginning of time has done to people like Putin, which is condemn them publicly, he sort of set Putin on his heels by praising him publicly but in private he kind of beat the s**t out of him. He said 'Don't do that because we're going to come after you,' Sondland said. About the potential for all-out nuclear war, Sondland said, 'I'm very concerned about it.' 'I don't think we're dealing with a rational actor today. Why isn't he rational? Because he's being boxed in on a botched invasion, getting a lot of pressure from both his hardliners to go further, others in Russia to immediately stop withdraw. He's under tremendous pressure.' And while Sondland said he prefers Trump's game of hardball with the European Union to Biden's deference, he credited White House's current occupant for his backchannel negotiations to keep the Europeans in line in opposition to Putin. 'His team has done a very, very credible job quietly keeping the alliance together. For that he deserves kudos.' But Sondland said Trump was the first president to call out the Europeans for being ungrateful to the U.S. for helping build the E.U. in the decades since World War II. 'We were the biggest check writers of anyone on the planet,' Sondland said. 'Europe doesn't think they owe us big time at all - It's ""what have you done for us today, what are you going to do for us tomorrow."" So Trump was the first one to really call them on it,' he said. 'Biden is more predisposed to going back to the old ways which is a lot of back slapping a lot of nice talk that accomplishes very little.' In his new book, Sondland unabashedly tells of how his $1 million donation to Trump's campaign helped him land the job he'd always dreamed of, how he played his political novice to score a high-level role in setting the president's agenda and how he reluctantly etched his name into the history books by uttering the three words Democrats seized on to prove Trump's guilt in the first impeachment. The book, 'The Envoy: Mastering the Art of Diplomacy with Trump and the World,' out Tuesday, is replete with idiosyncratic Trumpisms, such as when Sondland walked into the Oval Office for a meeting to find Trump blasting country music to pick songs to play at his rallies. 'Never mind that the Oval Office sounds like a country western bar, and we're supposed to be prepping for a visit with a foreign leader,' Sondland wrote. In another moment Sondland told of how he scolded the former president for pulling out TicTacs and pouring them onto his tongue without offering any to him. 'What the f**k? Aren't you going to share?' Sondland said. 'When you call him out on not acting like a normal person, it catches him off guard, and then he kind of likes it. People do it too infrequently,' the ambassador surmised. The longtime Republican fundraiser and donor initially supported Jeb Bush in the 2016 primary, before backing Trump and then breaking with him over his belittlement of Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim U.S. soldier who died in Iraq. He described how he had to work twice as hard to beat out 'loyal' donors for a cushy ambassadorship, putting his name back on the map with a $1 million donation to the inaugural committee. Once he scored the role, he had to figure out how to make a lasting impression on Trump. On greeting Trump on the tarmac in Brussels for the first time in his new role, he decided to ignore the advice of White House staffers who told him not to get into the Beast, the president's armored vehicle, with him. 'Another off-the-shelf greeting would get me nowhere,' he explains in the book. 'I need a hook, something to grab his attention.' When Trump asked him how he was doing Sondland told the president his genitals were 'sore' because the Europeans had been 'kicking' them since he arrived. Trump took delight in the irreverence, invited Sondland to ride in his limo with him, and the ambassador had established his direct line to the president. While some might disdain the long-established mega-donor-to-posh ambassador pipeline, Sondland said he found business moguls make better diplomats than life-long foreign policy buffs. 'Here’s my take: many who disdain political appointees say that a career-groomed Georgetown foreign service graduate is more qualified to hold the position of chief of mission than the head of a hedge fund who knows relatively little about foreign policy but knows how to manage people and make and close deals,” Sondland wrote in the book. “The former has subject matter expertise, but the latter understands business, knows how to negotiate, knows how to get things done, and has access to the commander-in-chief. Who do you want running the embassy?' In a move that cost him his job and his favor with the former president, Sondland told the House Intelligence Committee in 2019 there was in fact a 'quid pro quo' linking a U.S. demand for Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden-linked Burisma with a meeting between then- new President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump. 'Quid pro quo- It's kind of a sexy word. I don't think it was in the American lexicon until that impeachment hearing,' Sondland mused over breakfast at the Ritz-Carlton in Washington, D.C. The point he wanted to drive home was that everything in life was transactional. Trump as a businessman, he thought, should have embraced this, rather than insisting it was a 'perfect phone call.' 'They're giving me food,' he said, motioning to the wait staff, 'And I'm giving them my Amex card. That's our quid pro quo.' Sondland had been tasked by Trump with working with Rudy Giuliani to convince Zelensky to restart corruption investigations in exchange for a meeting. He place blame squarely on Giuliani, not Trump or himself, for tying aid and a meeting to investigating Hunter Biden before his father Joe faced off with Trump in the 2020 election. 'It was coming from Giuliani, it was never from Trump. That's what the committee didn't want to hear, I never discussed it with Trump. Trump said, 'Deal with Rudy, I don't want to deal with it.' Sondland also said that Giuliani never once mentioned to him that Trump's opponent's son would be caught up in the investigations he wanted so desperately. 'Hunter Biden's name never came up. Not once. I never heard the word Hunter Biden,' he insisted. 'We want to end corruption in Ukraine,' Sondland recalled Giuliani telling him, 'They have to make an announcement that they're going to resume corruption investigations.' Where Trump went wrong, he said, was letting Giuliani as a private citizen handle high-level diplomatic negotiations. 'It was not appropriate for him to be involved in any of these matters.' Still, he said the Ukraine phone call was just a 'red herring' blood-thirsty Democrats used to avenge a highly polarizing president. 'I think a lot was made out of a phone call that was probably not handled as deftly as it should've been,' Sondland said. He said that he had at first tried to avoid testifying, asking the State Department to back him up in ignoring the subpoena. When they would not, his lawyers advised him to sit before the committee. 'As I got into impeachment process I realized [Democrats] already had the answer,' Sondland said. He claimed that impeachment managers tried to feed him lines before he went in front of the cameras at the hearing. 'They would ask my counsel, 'would he say this?' My counsel would say 'no he won't say that because that's not true.' They would say 'well could he say it this way?' 'No, he can't say it this way, that's not true. He can say this because this is what happened. He's not going to make things up.' But Trump, too, should have embraced the quid pro quo, according to Sondland, instead of firing him. 'This whole issue would have gone away if Trump had not been so combative,' he said. 'Instead of saying it's a perfect phone call, I think he should've just put all the cards on the table and just said, 'I was elected president, I get to decide who the US does business with. I don't want to do business with this guy until he does certain things. If that means I'm going to hold up military aid, if you don't like it, don't reelect me, but that's what I'm going to do. Instead he did everything possible to fan the investigatory flames.' After doing Trump's bidding for two years overseas, the ambassador said he would not vote for the former president again. 'I was accepting of the package the Trump package, the good, the bad and otherwise up until the January 6th incident,' he said. 'One thing I learned as an ambassador is that democracies all over the world admire us for how we turn the keys over to the next leadership. 'We go through these ceremonial symbols - someone greets their successor at the steps of the White House even if they hate their guts, they ride in the car to Capitol together ... They leave the note in the drawer, we do all of these things to show we don't transfer power at the point of a gun. People look to us for that. Trump screwed that up.' If 2024 comes down to Trump and President Biden, 'I'd have to do a write-in,' Sondland said. For now, Sondland is back to managing his hotels, but he's not ruling out fishing for another ambassador's role. 'I would do it, for the right president.'"
2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11342053/Pentagon-chief-Lloyd-Austin-talks-Kremlin-counterpart.html,US holds rare call with Russia but says there's no Kremlin interest in ending war in Ukraine,"Russia's defense minister and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin held their first calls since May on Friday in a sign Moscow and Washington have restored lines of communication as Vladimir Putin ups his attacks on civilians. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned there was no signs that Moscow is prepared to end the war in Ukraine as pro-Kremlin officials said they were turning Ukraine's southern city of Kherson into a 'fortress' in the face of Kyiv's advance. Few details emerged of the conversation between Russia's Sergei Shoigu and Austin but both sides confirmed they had discussed Ukraine. Fears Putin could turn to tactical nuclear weapons have been rising since the annexation of four regions in Ukraine and Washington has said Iranians are on the ground helping Russian forces and still selling Moscow drones. 'Topical issues of international security - including the situation in Ukraine - were discussed,' said Russia's defense ministry. 'Secretary Austin emphasized the importance of maintaining lines of communication amid the ongoing war against Ukraine,' said a Washington spokesman. It was only the second call between the ministers since Moscow invaded Ukraine on February 24. Back in May, Austin had urged Moscow to implement an 'immediate ceasefire'. Ukraine has denounced the evacuations from Kherson by pro-Kremlin officials as 'deportations' Kyiv says Russia plans to destroy the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant in Kherson region At the time, Russia's invading force had been beaten back from the capital Kyiv but were making steady gains in the eastern Donbas and Kharkiv regions and had consolidated their position in the south. Six months on, however, Ukraine's forces have pushed back. Kyiv's forces in recent weeks - aided by Western weapons - have been advancing along the west bank of the Dnieper river towards the region's main city, also called Kherson. The first major city to fall to Moscow's troops, retaking it would be a major prize in Ukraine's counter-offensive. Kyiv said Friday it had retaken a total of 88 towns and villages in the region since launching its offensive to retake Kherson in the late summer while President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the capture of Russian arms by his forces in the region. Moscow-installed authorities in the region on Friday accused Kyiv's forces of attacking a bridge being used by civilians. 'Four people were killed,' pro-Moscow official Kirill Stremousov said on Telegram. 'The city of Kherson, like a fortress, is preparing for its defence.' Russian investigators said later two of the dead were journalists and that 13 people had been wounded. A Ukrainian military spokeswoman Nataliya Gumenyuk denied Kyiv's forces were responsible, saying they did not target local populations. Electricity production in Ukraine Kyiv has denounced the organised movement of Kherson residents to Russia and other Moscow-controlled regions as 'deportations' of Ukrainian citizens. Zelensky told European leaders Thursday that Russian forces had mined the nearby Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant with the intent of blowing it up. Its destruction could cause flash-flooding for hundreds of thousands of people, he warned. On Friday, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmygal called for an international monitoring mission to deploy at the dam. Cutting water supplies to the south could also hit the cooling systems of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, he added. Both sides have accused the other of repeatedly shelling the facility, endangering operations. Ukraine's push in the south comes after a sweeping counter-offensive in the northeast Kharkiv region that has badly impaired Russia's supply routes and logistics corridors in the eastern Donbas region. But Russian forces have continued shelling the region's largest city, Kharkiv, and the presidency said six people were wounded Friday when 'industrial infrastructure' was hit in the city. The Sviatohirsk Cave Orthodox monastery has partially been damaged in the Donetsk region of Ukraine Also Friday, the Ukraine presidency said Russian forces were shelling sections along the entire front line of Donbas and that two had been killed in the Donetsk region. And later Friday, Zelensky accused Russia of 'deliberately delaying the passage of ships' exporting grain from Ukrainian ports bound for countries in Africa and Asia. 'Russia is doing everything to ensure that at least hundreds of thousands of these people become forced migrants, who will seek asylum... or die of hunger,' he said in his nightly video address. More than 150 ships had been affected, he said, listing Algeria, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia as among the countries hit by the delays. In late July, Turkey and the United Nations brokered a landmark deal with Moscow and Kyiv that designated three Black Sea ports for Ukraine to send much-needed grain supplies through a Russian blockade. Russia has complained its own exports have suffered and contended that most deliveries were arriving to Europe, rather than poor countries where grain is most needed."

'Dad's Army' of Russians dragged into spluttering Ukraine invasion includes overweight middle-aged men and women learning how to handle machine guns in bizarre scenes at training camp","Bizarre new pictures have emerged of unassuming, middle-aged Russian civilians who have not yet been called on to fight on the frontlines in Putin's army posing with assault rifles and learning hand-to-hand combat. The group were taking part in combat and weapons training sessions in Russia's Rostov region - which shares a 250 mile border with Ukraine - to ensure they're prepared to fight if they're needed. But most of the participants appeared out of place and awkward as they learned how to load and fire Kalishnikov assault weapons. They paired khaki helmets and padded vests with rigid blue jeans and freshly manicured nails - drawing a stark comparison to the pictures of sheer devastation coming out of war-torn Ukraine. Participants said they would be prepared to defend their country if it became necessary to do so, and one instructor told Reuters many said they felt 'better protected' after the classes. One Rostov resident who attended the training session, Anna, said: 'I have no husband. I live with my mum and my son so if anything happens I want to be ready to defend my family.' Another said 'if there's an opportunity... you need to learn for whatever is coming, to be ready. The classes included basic combat tactics and handling of a variety of weapons, including Kalashnikov assault rifles. Meanwhile proper military training is also underway for more conscripts who have been called to the frontlines as part of President Vladimir Putin's 'partial mobilisation'. In late September, Putin announced 300,000 people with previous combat experience or specialist skills would be conscripted to the frontlines in Ukraine to help with the war. Photos released from training camps throughout Russia show these men operating heavy-duty machinery and loading bullets into rifles. Reports from dissenting voices out of Russia revealed pensioners, men with disabilities, and people without any military training or combat experience were receiving the call-up to fight on the frontlines. Leaked complaints from new arrivals in Ukraine reveal the ailing Russian army is struggling to keep their men clothed, fed and armed. Russian soldiers were filmed stealing a washing machine from a destroyed house in Ukraine on Friday - prompting jokes they were taking it back to the military camp. Putin on Wednesday imposed martial law on four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine in response to battlefield reverses. He also placed several border regions including Belgorod on a 'medium alert' - bringing the war closer to home for millions of ordinary Russians. The decree directed those regional administrations to carry out tasks including stepping up support for the military, and also gave them extra powers, including the ability to restrict freedom of movement. In a statement on Telegram after a new regional task force meeting, Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said it was recommending firms in the city of Belgorod and close to the border find ways to allow staff to work from home. There have been a number of attacks in recent weeks on power facilities and other infrastructure in the regional capital and near to the province's 400-km (250-mile) frontier with Ukraine, as well as on fuel and ammunition depots. Belgorod's schools and colleges had already been told to close for two weeks. Gladkov said that, when they returned, those in the city and nine border regions should operate by distance learning until Dec. 1. The regional administration would also support any residents of the city or border regions who wanted to leave the area temporarily. 'The Moscow region is already ready to accept 500 Belgorod residents at one of its sanatoriums,' he said, adding transport, food and accommodation would all be provided for free. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday night Putin's forces mined the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and planned to blow it up, in a bid to cover their retreat from the city of Kherson with a vast deluge of water. Hundreds of thousands of people living around the lower Dnipro River would be in danger of rapid flooding if the dam was destroyed, Zelensky said. The potential damage caused by such a move 'can easily be compared to [an] atomic bomb explosion', environmental security expert Maksym Soroka warned. 'Everyone should understand that one cubic meter of water weighs a ton: imagine the amount of water in a meter-by-meter cube: that's one ton. Dams contain a huge mass of water, millions of tons,' Soroka told Rubryka, a Ukrainian news publication. 'Force is mass multiplied by acceleration, and when that mass accelerates, we have a force of thousands of kilotons, and these forces are enough to destroy concrete. The devastating consequences become catastrophic.' So far, he said, Putin's forces 'have had the sense not to attack our strategic hydraulic structures.' Fears are rising that this could soon change."
2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11338689/Biden-warns-consequential-outcomes-GOP-cuts-Ukraine-funds.html,'These guys don't get it': Biden slams Republicans for their threat to cut Ukraine funding saying there will be 'serious consequential outcomes' to American foreign policy if it happens,"President Joe Biden on Thursday slammed Republicans for saying they want to cut off funding for Ukraine, saying there would be 'serious consequential outcomes' if it happens. Speaking at a fundraiser in Philadelphia for Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman, Biden went after the GOP for their threat to end Ukraine aid if they win control of Congress in November. 'They said that if they win they're not likely to fund, to continue to fund Ukraine,' he noted in his remarks. 'These guys don't get it. It's a lot bigger than Ukraine. It's Eastern Europe. It's NATO. It's really serious, serious consequential outcomes,' he noted. 'They have no sense of American foreign policy.' Biden said the rest of the world looks to America to be a leader, hinting western allies could follow suit, damaging Ukraine's ability to fight off Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces. 'These guys on the other team don't get it. They don't get it that how America does is going to determine how the rest of the world does,' he said, adding: 'They look to us as a leader. They look to us … because they're not as big or as powerful.' House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who is poised to become speaker should Democrats lose control in the House, has warned Republicans are 'not going to write a blank check to Ukraine.' Lawmakers on Capitol Hill seem have taken McCarthy's threat seriously. Lawmakers from both parties have discussed adding $50 billion in Ukraine funding to an omnibus spending bill that they'd pass before a new Congress is sworn-in in January, NBC News reported. Congress last month approved $12 billion package to Ukraine but are looking to add even more funds to the war-torn nation before a new class of lawmakers takes over on Capitol Hill. The amount would be enough 'to make sure [Ukraine] can get through the year,' a Republican senator with knowledge of the matter told NBC News. 'It'll make the $12 billion look like pocket change.' Republicans are favored to take control of the House in the Nov. 8th midterm election. The Senate is seen as more up for grabs. The new lawmakers would be sworn into office in early January. Congress has allocated a total of $65 billion in funding to Ukraine since Russia attacked the country in February. Biden spent Thursday in Pennsylvania campaigning for Fetterman, who is facing a tough race against Republican candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz, who's been endorsed by Donald Trump. Fetterman greeted Biden when the president landed in Pittsburgh. The two men visited the site of a collapsed bridge to talk about the infrastructure funds coming to the state. They also made a stop at Primanti Brothers in Moon Township - a must-eat sandwich shop in the area - before heading to Philadelphia for the fundraiser. Primanti's sandwiches are a Pittsburgh staple, served with a layer of coleslaw and French fries stuffed between giant pieces of bread. Biden ordered the 'Pitts-burger' - beef patty, lettuce, tomato, slaw and fries - and tipped $40, the White House said. After his lunch stop, Biden turned to politics at his final event of the day. Speaking to the Democrats at the fundraising event, Biden warned: 'If we lose this off year election we're in real trouble. America's at a real inflection point.' The Pennsylvania Senate race will help decide whether or not Biden's Democratic Party retains control of the Senate. Biden got in a few shots at Fetterman's rival, Dr. Oz. He noted Oz went to high school in Delaware but 'Delaware was smart enough to send him to New Jersey.' Oz 'is for undoing everything we have done,' he noted. He also repeated his criticism that much of the Republican Party are 'MAGA Republicans' who are loyal to Trump. 'We have to remind people what the Republicans are for, this new Republican party. This is not you father's Republican party,' he said."
2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11339521/Russia-mined-hydro-dam-plans-blow-Zelensky-warns.html,Russian plot to destroy hydro-electric dam would be like dropping 'an atomic bomb': Dire warning after Zelensky claimed Putin's troops have mined the power facility and could cause nuclear catastrophe,"The devastation caused by Russia's plot to destroy a hydroelectric dam in Ukraine would be akin to dropping an atomic bomb, an expert has warned. President Volodymyr Zelensky said last night Vladimir Putin's forces had mined the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and planned to blow it up it, in a bid to cover their retreat from the city of Kherson with a vast deluge of water. Hundreds of thousands of people living around the lower Dnipro River would be in danger of rapid flooding if the dam was destroyed, Zelensky said. The potential damage caused by such a move 'can easily be compared to [an] atomic bomb explosion', environmental security expert Maksym Soroka warned. 'Everyone should understand that one cubic meter of water weighs a ton: imagine the amount of water in a meter-by-meter cube: that's one ton. Dams contain a huge mass of water, millions of tons,' Soroka told Rubryka, a Ukrainian news publication. 'Force is mass multiplied by acceleration, and when that mass accelerates, we have a force of thousands of kilotons, and these forces are enough to destroy concrete. The devastating consequences become catastrophic.' So far, he said, Putin's forces 'have had the sense not to attack our strategic hydraulic structures.' Fears are rising that this could soon change. Ukrainian soldiers have been steadily advancing and Moscow-installed authorities have begun evacuations in the region. On Friday, Kyiv's troops continued to pile on the pressure on Russian positions, targeting resupply routes across the Dnieper river and inched closer to a full-scale assault to retake the strategic southern port city. By blowing the dam, Russia's aim is to halt Kyiv's advance in the occupied region and protect Russian troops, according to Zelensky's adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak. Zelensky said by doing so, Russia would cause a 'catastrophe on a grand scale'. In addition to the devastating from the ensuing flood, he warned cutting water supplies to the south could also impact the cooling systems of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest. This could lead to a nuclear disaster that Ukraine and its western allies have feared since the invasion began. The North Crimean canal, which provides a crucial water supply to Crimea - occupied since 2014 by Russia - could also be destroyed. Meanwhile, Kremlin proxy officials said Friday they were building up defences and turning Ukraine's southern city of Kherson into a 'fortress'. Britain's Ministry of Defence said on Friday that a Russian and Belarusian 'joint taskforce' is a bluff to persuade Ukraine to divert troops to country's northern border. Last week, Belarusian president and close Putin ally Aleksandr Lukashenko claimed up to 15,000 Russian troops would join 70,000 from his own country in the military exercise. The day after, Belarus released images claiming to show Russian forces arriving in the country. However, the MoD questioned the veracity of this, saying Russia 'is unlikely to be able to generate combat-ready formations of the claimed size,' adding: 'Its forces are committed in Ukraine'. 'The Belarussian military highly likely maintains minimal capability to undertake complex operations,' the MoD's assessment said. From this, the ministry concluded that Lukashenko's claim was a bluff, with the goal of forcing Kyiv to divert its forces away from other parts of Ukraine to set up defences in the north - and perhaps stymieing its on-going, successful counter-offensive in the south in the process - to help his ally. 'The announcement is likely an attempt to demonstrate Russian-Belarussian solidarity and to convince Ukraine to divert forces to guard the northern border,' the MoD said. Following the announcement, Ukraine did say it was strengthening its defences in the north, but did not say how much of its forces were being deployed there. As many as 2,000 Russian draftees have poured into the region 'to replenish losses and strengthen units on the front line,' according to Ukraine's Army General Staff. The Antonivskyi Bridge, which is on a main route from Crimea to Russian-held territories in southern Ukraine, was struck late on Thursday, said Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine's southern operational command - but only after the 10pm local curfew, to avoid civilian casualties. 'We do not attack civilians and settlements,' Ms Humeniuk told Ukrainian television, after Kirill Stremousov, the Moscow-installed deputy chief of the regional administration, claimed that at least four civilians were killed. Mr Stremousov said the attack occurred some 40 minutes after the curfew's start. A further 13 people suffered wounds, Kherson's top health official Vadim Ilmiyev said. Among the dead and wounded were journalists from the Russia-created TV channel Tamvria, according to Mr Stremousov. Earlier, Ukrainian strikes had made the Antonivskyi Bridge inoperable, prompting Russian authorities to set up ferry crossings and pontoon bridges to ferry supplies to Russian troops in Kherson, which sits on the Dnieper's western bank. Those crossings have been regularly targeted by Ukrainian rockets. Russian-installed officials have urged residents to evacuate from Kherson city for their safety and to allow the military to build fortifications. Ukraine's military reported on Friday that bank employees, medical workers and teachers have started to be evacuated as the city's infrastructure was wound down. At least 15,000 residents of an expected 60,000 have already been relocated from the city and surrounding areas. Kherson city had a pre-war population of about 284,000. It was one of the first urban areas Russia captured when it invaded Ukraine in February. It remains the largest city it holds, and is a prime target for both sides because of its key industries and major river port. Putin declared martial law in the the occupied regions of Kherson, Luhansk, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions on Wednesday in an attempt to assert Russian authority in the annexed areas as he faced battlefield setbacks, a troubled troop mobilisation, increasing criticism at home and abroad, and international sanctions. In recent days, Russia has been laying the groundwork to destroy the dam. General Sergei Surovikin - Russia's new supreme commander in Ukraine - has spoken to Russian media about what he called a 'devastating strike' on the Nova Kakhovka dam which he said was being plotted by Kyiv 's troops. Surovikin, who has also been preparing the Russian public for a retreat from the region, said the blast would flood Kherson and cause widespread damage. This is likely setting up for a 'false-flag attack' that would cover Russia's retreat and prove a distraction from its latest battlefield humiliation, analysts from the Institute for the Study of War have concluded. Breaching the dam would also be another blow to Ukraine's battered energy grid, with people told to brace for rolling four-hour blackouts from today after a third of the country's power plants were blown up in a little over a week. Ukraine has already struck the dam several times with long-range rockets, because a key roadway runs over it which Russia was using to supply its troops. But Kyiv's attacks stopped once the roadway was unusable. Meanwhile, cities across Ukraine began curbing electricity consumption ahead of winter Thursday as authorities warned that heavy damage to the country's energy grid by Russian attacks would spark a new wave of refugees from the country. 'Russia's leadership has given the order to turn the energy system itself into a battlefield. The consequences of this are very dangerous, again for all of us in Europe,' Zelensky said in an address to the EU council Energy-saving measures were put in place across the country after Russian missile and drone strikes destroyed at least 30 percent of the country's power stations in a week, according to authorities. Following blackouts in parts of Kyiv overnight, the city's mayor Vitali Klitschko urged businesses to limit screens and signage lights 'as much as possible'. 'Even small savings and a reduction in electricity consumption in every home will help stabilise the operation of the national energy system,' he said. Ukrainians responded defiantly. 'It's not going to change our attitude, maybe we will only hate them more,' said Olga, a resident of Dnipro in central Ukraine who declined to give her last name. 'I would rather sit in the cold with no water and electricity than be in Russia,' she said. People were rushing to buy auxiliary power supplies like generators and batteries, according to Kyrylo, an electronics vendor. Speaking of the coming winter, he said: 'I think that there will be nothing that we cannot survive.' 'There will be some kind of heating in any case, and the fact that it will be 16 (degrees Celsius, or 61 Fahrenheit) instead of 20 doesn't matter much. Just put on a thermal and socks,' he said. Russia has been using hundreds of missiles and suicide drones to attack Ukraine's infrastructure in an apparent attempt to break civilian will to continue the war. Such attacks are a war crime, under international law. White House meanwhile said it had evidence of Iranians taking a direct role in the war, helping Russians direct their Iranian-made 'kamikaze drones' - which are destroyed in attacks on Ukrainian targets such as power stations. 'Tehran is now directly engaged on the ground, and through the provision of weapons that are impacting civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine,' said White House national security spokesman John Kirby. He added that there was also concern Iran might supply surface-to-surface missiles to Russia for use in the war. 'The United States is going to pursue all means to expose, deter and confront Iran's provision of these munitions against the Ukrainian people,' he added. The European Union and United Kingdom announced sanctions on three Iranian generals and an arms firm accused of supplying Russia with drones. However, bipartisan support for military aid to Ukraine is starting to wane in Washington, with Republicans signalling that funding could be cut after congressional midterm elections next month. 'They said that if they win they're not likely to fund, to continue to fund Ukraine,' US President Joe Biden said while campaigning in Pennsylvania. 'They have no sense of American foreign policy.' In a separate evening address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky warned 'Russian terror will be directed at energy facilities' and urged the country to conserve electricity starting at 7am. He added that the government was 'working on the creation of mobile power supply points for critical infrastructure in cities and villages'. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko asked residents of the capital not to turn on major electrical appliances. He said: 'Even a small saving and reduction of electricity consumption in each residence will help to stabilise the national energy system's operation'. Ukraine said it had downed 'several Russian rockets' over Kyiv in the third consecutive day of attacks, with Zelensky saying ten Iranian-made drones aimed at the city had also been destroyed Wednesday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Thursday that Russian president Vladimir Putin was using energy and hunger as weapons but has failed to break the West's unity and will not achieve his war aims through scorched earth tactics. He told the German parliament that the country had freed itself from dependence on Russian gas but was working to bring energy prices down, including by securing new gas delivery contracts from other countries. Little changed along the long front lines, where Russia has been sending many of the 200,000 troops newly called up to the fight. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday visited a training centre for mobilised troops south-east of Moscow where he embraced soldiers and fired a gun. Some fighters opened their rucksacks to show him what they had been equipped with, and he asked one about his family, who replied he had a five-year-old daughter. Putin hugged him and wished him 'good luck.' Meanwhile Russia continued to evacuate people from Kherson city as Ukrainian forces inched closer to the southern hub, in Moscow's hands since the earliest days of the invasion in February. Moscow-installed authorities in Kherson said that around 15,000 people have been moved out. Russia's Rossiya 24 TV showed images of people waiting to board ferries, unable to use bridges damaged by Ukraine. Kirill Stremousov, a pro-Russian official, said on Telegram that the evacuations would give Russian forces more room to fight, and said they would not cede the city back to the Ukrainians. 'Remember, nobody is going to give up Kherson,' he said. But Ukrainians said the exit of civilians from the area was in fact forced deportations to Russia. The US-based Institute for the Study of War, in its daily analysis, said that as Ukrainian forces continue to close in on Kherson city, Russian authorities 'are likely setting information conditions to justify planned Russian retreats and significant territorial losses.' In preparation for a battle to control Kherson, Russia began evacuating 60,000 civilians on Wednesday which occupation officials said would last six days. A Ukrainian representative called the evacuations the 'equivalent of deportation'. The city has been in Moscow's hands since the earliest days of the invasion. Putin's 'aim is to create a kind of panic in Kherson and an image (to fuel) propaganda', Sergiy Khlan said, adding Ukrainian forces were still pushing their counter-offensive southward. He said the Russians were using evacuations as a pretext to justify 'their withdrawal from Kherson and more generally from the right bank' of the Dnieper River. Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's national security and defence council, said Moscow's move was criminal. 'Putin's martial law in the annexed regions of Ukraine is preparation for the mass deportation of the Ukrainian population to depressed areas of Russia in order to change the ethnic composition of the occupied territory,' Mr Danilov said. Pro-Russian officials in the town of Oleshky across the Dnieper said residents from Kherson were already arriving. Russia's Rossiya 24 TV showed images of people waiting to board ferries, unable to use bridges damaged by Ukraine. Vladimir Saldo, the Kherson region's Moscow-installed head, told Russian state television that the city's administration would relocate east of the Dnieper. Putin's introduction of military rule in the Moscow-controlled territories also gives additional power to authorities in Russian regions bordering Ukraine to quash dissent. 'We are working on solving very complex large-scale tasks to ensure security and protect the future of Russia,' Putin said."
2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11340509/Biden-officials-mull-investigating-Elon-Musks-twitter-deal-national-security-concerns.html,Elon Musk suggests Biden could KILL his Twitter deal: Government considers investigating 'legality' of the $44bn deal as shares plummet and Tesla CEO's fortune falls by $100 BILLION,"Elon Musk has suggested that the Biden administration could kill his Twitter deal following reports that officials are discussing opening an investigation over national security concerns. US officials are allegedly growing uncomfortable with Musk's $44 billion venture with a group of foreign investors to purchase the social media platform, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. There's also concerns of Musk's recent threat to pull his Starlink satellite service from Ukraine amid tweets suggesting that the country give up part of its territory to Russian invaders. It comes as Twitter's stock fell by 4.67 percent when the markets opened on Friday, a day after Musk vowed to cut the company's workforce by 75 percent. The government's possible interference in the deal would be the latest in Musk and Joe Biden's turbulent relationship as the two have often snubbed each other. Musk has been critical of the president's handle on inflation and the economy, and in turn, Biden has repeatedly failed to mention Tesla as a critical part of his plan for more electric cars in America's future, favoring GM and Ford instead. While Musk, 51, has yet to comment on the possibility of an investigation, he simply laughed at the idea on Twitter that the Biden administration could be the one to stop him for what he's said is 'paying to much' for the social media company. The cost of the deal would chip away further at Musk's fortune as it's revealed that he's lost more than $100 billion of his net worth. The world's richest man made headlines last November after his wealth soared to $320.3 billion, but nearly a year later, Forbes estimate's Musk's current worth at $209.4 billion, a 35 percent drop. Sources speaking under the condition of anonymity told Bloomberg that the government's discussions are still at an early stage, and it is unclear if they have a solid avenue to investigate Musk's business ventures. An investigation could be conducted by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), which reviews acquisitions of American businesses by foreign buyers. The probe would be triggered because Musk has gathered several foreign investors to aid him in the Twitter takeover, including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia; Binance Holdings, a company run by a Chinese native; and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund. The CFIUS operates behind closed doors and does not typically confirm when a review is being conducted. An investigation into the social media deal could also come as a result of a greater probe into the Starlink incident. Last week, Musk claimed he cannot afford to keep funding Starlink satellites that have proved vital for Ukraine in defending itself against Russia, raising fears he may cut support. Starlink terminals have allowed Ukrainian commanders and units to communicate on the battlefield when their usual networks have been taken down by Russia, and have proved vital to the war effort. They have also helped Ukrainian troops control drones which assist with reconnaissance, attacks on enemy tanks, and directing artillery fire. The world's richest man, with a personal fortune north of $200billion, said it is costing firm SpaceX $20million per month to maintain the network that keeps roughly 20,000 Starlink terminals in Ukraine running and it is not sustainable. In October alone, Musk's fortune fell from $237billion to $209billion as of Thursday. Much of the dip in wealth can be attributed to a fall in Tesla's stock as investors worry about his deal to buy Twitter by selling shares. Musk has sold $31billion worth of Tesla stock, and in one year, the company's shares have dipped by more than 30 percent. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Forbes that the stock would continue to fall as Musk looks to close the Twitter deal. 'The problem for Tesla investors is that more stock sales are likely by Musk to fund this deal which we believe will go down as one of the worst, most overpaid M&A deals in the history of the market,' Ives said. Musk lashed out at the Starlink expenses just days after tweeting a 'peace plan' that proposed handing chunks of Ukrainian territory to Russia that prompted a clash with President Zelensky and saw ambassador Andreij Melnyk tell him to 'f**k off'. Possible interference from the Biden administration would be the latest in a tumultuous week for Musk and Twitter, who are looking to close on the deal by October 28, according to the order by a Delaware Chancery Court judge. On Thursday, corporate documents obtained by the Washington Post revealed that the billionaire told prospective investors in his $44 billion deal to buy the social media giant that he plans to get rid of three-quarters of its 7,500 workers. That would leave the company with just a skeleton crew of just over 2,000 employees, which experts say would make it difficult for the social media company to tamp down on what it deems to be 'misinformation.' Now, a number of employees are expressing their fears they may be one of the more than 5,000 workers laid off from the company when Musk, 51, takes over. Matt Walker, a product designer for Twitter, meanwhile, went of on Musk and former CEO Jack Dorsey in a series of tweets Thursday night, writing: 'Every decision Jack has made has gotten us to this point.' He also tweeted that the common thread between the news of MailChimp's CEO writing in an email that pronouns do 'more harm than good' and Musk's planned layoffs is 'billionaires are a**holes.' And in his final tweet, Walker wrote that he was 'doom scrolling on the very source of the doom.' A finance advisor for the company, meanwhile, asked if anyone cared about her while Steph Jeong, a designer, simply tweeted: 'Sigh.' Musk's plans would cut far more jobs than Twitter's current management had been planning to lose, the effects of which would be massive. But it would provide Twitter's leadership with a way to save face and avoid announcing layoffs to one-quarter of the workforce they were already planning to reduce costs. The company spent a whopping $1.5 billion last year on personnel, and had wanted to reduce that amount by some $800 million. Management also planned to make major cuts to its infrastructure, getting rid of data centers that keep the site functioning for more than 200 million users a day. Twitter executives, though, have denied any layoffs, with General Counsel Sean Edgett telling employees on Thursday to expect 'tons of public rumors and speculations' as the closing of the deal nears. 'Since the merger agreement has been in place, there have been no plans for companywide layoffs,' he said, according to Bloomberg. The reported cuts come as Twitter continues to advertise 266 jobs on LinkedIn"
2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11338539/Ukraine-backs-calls-Boris-Johnson-return-UK-PM-Liz-Truss-resigned.html,Ukraine backs #bringbackboris! Country's official Twitter account joins calls for return of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister after he led support for war-torn nation,"Ukraine has officially backed Boris Johnson to return as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom following the resignation of Liz Truss. Amid mounting speculation Mr Johnson is poised as a likely contender to replace Ms Truss, the official Twitter account for Ukraine released a statement which read: 'Better call Boris'. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Mr Johnson shared a particularly close relationship during the former PM's time in office, owing primarily to his outspoken support of Ukraine after the Russian invasion. Throughout Mr Johnson's messy departure from No10, Mr Zelensky hailed him as a 'true friend' who 'acted swiftly and resolutely' to offer support during the crisis. Mr Zelensky said the UK was his country's 'dearest friend and closest ally' under Mr Johnson, and praised the PM's 'courage and determination' in championing support for Ukraine. 'At every meeting and conversation Boris had one very good question, 'What else? What else do you need?',' he said. 'It became our watchword, guaranteeing effective progress and movement forward.' Now, it's looking increasingly likely the pair will be able to continue their professional relationship. Twitter is alight with debate on both sides of the argument. While many are excited at the thought of Mr Johnson's triumphant return to the top job, others have voiced concerns. 'The country needs stability, not scandal,' one critic said. 'Integrity, market confidence, support for the most needy. Oh and there's no money left thanks to him and Truss. Johnson is not anything that this country needs.' Another said: 'Boris Johnson?! Are you having a laugh? Picking a new Tory leader is like picking the best toilet on the last day of a festival.' The hashtag #BringBackBoris is trending on social media with hundreds of voters voicing their support for the axed PM. Mr Johnson's face was superimposed onto multiple snippets of scenes from the Top Gun movies in order to depict him as the hero the UK needs to escape this mess. One of his supporters said: The country never lost confidence in Boris. The party did. It's time he returned.' Another added: 'Boris is on his way back to save the UK, he'll rise from the ashes like a phoenix. And we will all live happily ever after.' With a quarter of MPs declaring support for their preferred candidates, Mr Johnson currently counts 50 backers, compared to Rishi Sunak's 39 and Penny Mourdant's 17, according to the latest tally by Guido Fawkes. It comes after the Conservative Party announced would-be successors would need to win nominations from 100 MPs to get on the ballot. The threshold means that realistically a maximum of three can make it into a vote, and that there could be a simple coronation of a winner if they get far more than that. While Mr Johnson has been publicly backed by some MPs to run to return to power, including his former culture secretary Nadine Dorries, several others said they don't believe he will reach the threshold. One said the 'brutal truth' is he is likely to get no more than 60 - leaving some of his close friends to advise him not to run. He also remains on holiday in the Caribbean and faces a race against time to return and launch an effective campaign. However in a boost to his chances, the final two candidates will go head-to-head in a final online vote by party members next Friday. Mr Johnson remains popular with the Tory grassroots and could win such a vote, and allies say he would be able to 'honestly say' he has a mandate for government, and has the ability to 'turn the tide and avert the disaster of a Labour government'. But it remains unclear whether he can reach the 100 threshold, or whether a figure from the Tory right could stand and risk splitting the vote. The technicalities of the party vote has not stopped the public from voicing an opinion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made no secret of the high esteem in which he held Boris Johnson during his time as Prime Minister. Mr Zelensky said the UK was his country's 'dearest friend and closest ally' under Mr Johnson, and praised the PM's 'courage and determination' in championing support for Ukraine. Mr Zelensky thanked Boris for walking with him through the streets of Kyiv in April, and again on Ukraine's independence day. 'Boris Johnson, as his nation's envoy, was with us, welcomed by ordinary Ukrainians,' he said. 'We even started to address him, warmly and humorously, as 'Boris Johnsoniuk' – a Ukrainian-sounding surname if you put a stress on the last syllable.' The Ukrainian leader praised the UK's 'unwavering' support and ongoing financial and humanitarian aid, as well as its introduction of sanctions against Russia. He added: 'But I believe in the power of personal leadership. I know it has not been an easy ride for Boris Johnson as he had to deal with many internal challenges. Prioritising support for Ukraine demanded a great courage and determination.' He said upon Boris' messy exit: 'I sincerely wish that Boris's legacy be preserved.' It comes as Ms Truss was relentlessly mocked on Twitter last night after her humiliating resignation. Her 44 days in office made her the shortest serving prime minister in UK history. Speaking from a lectern in Downing Street this afternoon, Ms Truss said she had told the King she was resigning as the leader of the Conservative Party as she recognised she 'cannot deliver the mandate' which she committed to a little over six weeks ago. She held talks with the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives, Sir Graham Brady, and agreed to a fresh leadership election 'to be completed within the next week'. 'This will ensure that we remain on a path to deliver our fiscal plan and maintain our country's economic stability and national security,' she added. 'I will remain as Prime Minister until a successor has been chosen.' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer demanded a general election 'now' so that the nation can have 'a chance at a fresh start'. Without a general election, the Conservatives will be on their third prime minister on the mandate won by Boris Johnson in December 2019. Sir Keir said: 'The Conservative Party has shown it no longer has a mandate to govern. The British public deserve a proper say on the country's future. They must have the chance to compare the Tories' chaos with Labour's plans to sort out their mess, grow the economy for working people and rebuild the country for a fairer, greener future. 'We must have a chance at a fresh start. We need a general election - now.' Ms Truss's resignation came just a little over 24 hours after she told MPs she was 'a fighter, not a quitter'. But her odds of survival were slashed following chaotic scenes in the Commons after the resignation of Suella Braverman as home secretary. The number of Tory MPs publicly demanding Ms Truss's resignation doubled before lunch was over on Thursday, taking the total to 15, but a far greater number were privately agitating for her exit. The pound lifted on the resignation announcement following another volatile 24 hours for the currency amid political turmoil. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: 'We don't need another Conservative Prime Minister lurching from crisis to crisis. We need a general election now and the Conservatives out of power.'"
2022-10-21,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11338715/Survey-suggests-32million-people-struggling-pay-bills-amid-cost-living-crisis.html,Cost of living pushes families to brink as survey suggests 32million people are now struggling to pay their bills,"Three in five Britons now struggle to keep up with bills as the cost of living crisis bites, a survey shows. Almost 32million – 60 per cent of UK adults – say the rising cost of energy, food, fuel, mortgages, rent and other bills is pushing them to the brink. That's a huge increase of 6million since a similar survey in 2020. Nearly 8million people also find it a 'heavy burden' to keep up payments on bills, says the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) survey. This is a rise of 2.5million since 2020, when 5.3million said maintaining payments was hurting their financial and mental wellbeing. The number in financial difficulty has also increased. Some 4.2million people had missed a bill or credit card repayment in at least three of the six months before the survey. Those living in the most deprived areas of Britain are nearly seven times as likely to be in financial difficulty as those living in the least deprived spots, researchers found. Around 19,000 people were questioned between February and June, before energy bills rose drastically. With annual inflation at 10.1 per cent, mortgage rates have rocketed in recent months while experts say the move to row back on the Energy Price Guarantee means millions more will be in financial trouble next year. Soaring gas prices since Russia invaded Ukraine mean the typical household energy bill outside a fixed tariff is more than double last winter's, even after the Government stepped in with support. Earlier this week new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt scaled back the £60billion scheme – which caps average UK energy bills at £2,500 per year – from two years to just six months. Bills could rise by as much as 73 per cent to £4,347 annually for the average household in April, consultancy Cornwall Insight predicted. The Chancellor has launched a Treasury review on how to give continued help to the most vulnerable after the scheme ends. Any new aid is likely to be means-tested. National Energy Action says that shortening the support scheme has created 'huge uncertainty' for households already struggling. Sheldon Mills of the FCA said: 'If you're facing financial difficulty, you don't need to struggle alone. Free debt advice is available, and we have told firms that they must work with their customers to solve any problems with payment.' Richard Lane of debt charity StepChange added: 'Our advice would be to not wait to seek help. If you've fallen into arrears or are unsure how you're going to pay your energy bills, mortgage or another financial commitment, speak to your lender or provider as soon as possible. 'Firms have a regulatory responsibility to treat customers fairly, signpost them to sources of support and negotiate more affordable payment plans which are realistic for a customer's finances.'"
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11335901/FOUR-year-olds-shown-use-AK-47s-grenade-launchers-Russian-kindergarten.html,FOUR-year-olds are shown how to use AK-47s and grenade launchers at Russian kindergarten,"Children as young as four and five are being given war lessons in Vladimir Putin's Russia. Shocking footage shows an officer in combat fatigues demonstrating a Kalashnikov machine-gun and an anti-tank grenade launcher to kindergarten youngsters. The 'teacher' is Pavel Firsov, from a militaristic pro-Kremlin movement called Combat Brotherhood. Children at Kindergarten No. 31 in Korolev, near Moscow were taught the 'qualities that distinguish a true defender of the Motherland'. Firsov is a 'veteran of military operations' and regularly gives military lessons to older children. The classes come as tens of thousands of Russian troops have died in Putin's attempt to invade and emasculate independent country Ukraine. One critical commenter asked in disbelief: 'Did I understand correctly that a combatant brought a machine gun and a flamethrower to the kindergarten?' But another replied: 'It is better that a combatant who wishes well for children brings a machine gun and a flamethrower to the kindergarten than a terrorist.' Another commenter despaired: 'In my school childhood, someone's grandfather with noble grey hair came bedecked in medals and told us that war is scary, with pain and tears. 'We were told how wonderful victory was and how to cherish world peace. 'I don't remember a word about weapons. 'Now happy Russian children are being told how and what to use to kill bad people. Feel the difference.' Another complained: 'I'm shocked. 'Why, why show this in the kindergarten? Degenerates!' A parent at the nursery school expressed outrage. 'We were not warned. We were only lucky that our child was not in the kindergarten on this day.' Another critic said it was 'awful' to show children the weapons. 'The law says it is not permitted to involve children in military propaganda. It is necessary to report this violation to the prosecutor's office.' A supporter said that unless boys are taught about weapons they will become 'cowardly men'. Another said: 'The girls will probably not be interested, but the boys - 100%. 'We have become too soft and pampered as we see from so many indignant comments.' In Russia, children attend kindergartens before transferring to schools at the age of seven."
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11336085/RFKs-grandson-Conor-Kennedy-reveals-secretly-fought-Ukraine.html,RFK's grandson Conor Kennedy reveals he secretly fought in Ukraine despite having no military experience and 'was willing to die' there - but only told one person his real name,"Robert F. Kennedy's grandson, Conor, has revealed he secretly fought in Ukraine earlier this year despite having no military experience. In an Instagram post, Conor, 28, said he was 'moved' to enlist in the Ukrainian International Legion - a branch of foreign volunteers - earlier this year after the Ukrainian forces made a desperate plea for help. He didn't say when he fought, nor did he specify how long he was there, but he said he 'liked being a soldier' more than he'd expected. 'I wanted to help. When I heard about Ukraine’s International Legion, I knew I was going, and I went to the embassy to enlist the next day. 'I told one person here where I was, and I told one person there my real name. 'I didn’t want my family or friends to worry, and I didn’t want to be treated differently there. 'Going in, I had no prior military experience and wasn’t a great shot, but I could carry heavy things and learned fast. I was also willing to die there.' The Ukrainian International Legion was a hastily-assembled branch of the Ukrainian forces in which foreign volunteers of able body were invited from overseas to join the fight, regardless of their military background or lack thereof. In April, the Legion changed its rules and began accepting only those who did have combat experience. Corporal Damien Magrou, the legion's spokesman, said at the time: 'We have realized that training people who don’t have that experience drains a lot of resources. 'We’re grateful for the support, but people without combat experience are more of a burden than being of any help.' Conor admitted that he 'wasn't a good shot', but claims he was sent to the northeastern front. 'Going in, I had no prior military experience and wasn’t a great shot, but I could carry heavy things and learned fast. I was also willing to die there. 'So they soon agreed to send me to the northeastern front. 'I liked being a soldier, more than I had expected. It is scary. 'But life is simple, and the rewards for finding courage and doing good are substantial.' It's unclear why or when he returned to the US. He wrote cryptically: 'My friends there know why I had to come home.' He also urged his followers to join the fight, saying: 'This war will shape the fate of democracy in this century.... 'They can’t be asked to act alone.' Conor's parents are RFK Jr. and Mary Richardson Kennedy, who killed herself in 2012 in the family's home in Bedford, New York. His sister, Kyra, was among those to confirm the mission, writing beneath it: 'I love you big brother.' His girlfriend, Brazilian singer Giulia Be, also confirmed his time in the war. 'You’re the bravest man I've ever known, my love… being away from you and worrying for all those months was incredibly hard, but we kept our faith all the way through, and I just want to tell you [once more] how proud I am.' His father, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has not yet commented. He is a staunch opponent of COVID lockdowns and vaccine mandates, and has spent much of the last two years speaking out against them."
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11338029/White-House-says-Iran-ground-Crimea-helping-Russia.html,White House says Iran is 'on the ground' in Crimea helping Russia against Ukraine as well as selling Putin drones,"The White House said Wednesday that Iran was not only selling lethal drones to Russia but had 'assisted' Russia as it carried out attacks from annexed Crimea. White House national security spokesman John Kirby leveled the startling allegation after Russia had carried out a string of attacks on civilian infrastructure using what videos showed and Ukrainian officials identified as the Iranian drones. 'We can confirm that Russia's military personnel that are based in Crimea have been piloting Iranian UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles], using them to conduct strikes across Ukraine, including strikes against Kyiv in just recent days,' Kirby said. 'We assess that Iranian military personnel on the ground in Crimea assisted Russia in these operations,' he added. 'Iranian military personnel were on the ground in Crimea and assisted with these operations,' Kirby continued. 'Russia has received dozens of UAVs so far and will likely continue to receive additional shipments in the future.' In another comment he said it was the Russians who were remotely piloting the drones. 'The information we have is that the Iranians have put trainers and tech support in Crimea, but it’s the Russians who are doing the piloting,' he said. Amid with withering attacks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr continued to plead with the US and NATO allies for more defenses. It came after Israel declined to furnish Ukraine with its Iron Dome missile defense system. Even before the U.S. statement about Iranian forces inside Crimea, Ukraine had signaled its fury at the arms sale, and the foreign ministry submitted a proposal to break diplomatic ties with Tehran. The killer Shahed-136 aren't having a major impact on the battlefield, but Russia appears to be using them to pound Ukrainian towns and cities, in what could be an effort to try to sap morale in the war, which began in February. President Biden and President Zelensky have each rejected the tactic, saying it would only further unify the Ukrainian populace. Kirby's stark statements came on a day Biden fretted that U.S. political support for Ukraine could dip if Republicans take over Congress, following comments by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. 'I am worried,' Biden told reporters on a trip to Pittsburgh. Biden said Wednesday that Russia's repeated attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine were an effort by Russian President Vladimir Putin to force the Ukrainians to capitulate – and that it will fail. He was asked about Putin's latest gambit, declaring martial law in four annexed Ukrainian territories seized by Russia, in the latest effort to use force to try impose order and control. 'I think that Vladimir Putin finds himself in an incredibly difficult position,' Biden told reporters, pausing to collect his thoughts while holding a binder of material. 'And what it reflects to me is, it seems his only tool available to him is to brutalize individual citizens in Ukraine, Ukrainian citizens, to try to intimidate them into capitulating. They're not going to do that,' he said. The U.S. already has heavily sanctioned Iran, but the arms sales could bring additional responses."
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11337415/Putin-dresses-black-fires-sniper-rifle-visit-training-camp-mobilised-Russians.html,Putin dresses all in black and shows off his prowess with a sniper rifle as he joins defence chief Sergei Shoigu on first visit to training camp for mobilised Russians,"State television showed Putin shooting a newly developed sniper rifle in the Ryazan region, southeast of Moscow, alongside Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. Wearing ear protectors and safety glasses, Putin ay under a net and fired several shots from the Russian SVD sniper. The Kremlin did not explain whether or not he hit the targets, which were nearly 1,000ft away. But visible on his visit was a uniformed officer carrying what appeared to be the Russian president’s so-called 'nuclear football' — a briefcase containing the codes needed to authorise a nuclear attack remotely. He was also filmed speaking to officers, shaking hands with them and wishing them 'good luck'. The commander-in-chief 'observed practical exercises' including fire drills, engineering and medical trainings, Russian state-run news agencies reported. Shoigu, by Putin's side during the visit, gave him an update on the training of those called up in the draft, news agencies said. The training camp is for newly mobilised Russians, with the state video seemingly aimed at boosting moral as the war in Ukraine continues. A second man holding a different bag may have been carrying medical supplies potentially vital for the 70-year-old Russian leader's survival. There are claims that Putin is suffering variously from several types of cancer, early Parkinson’s disease and a schizoaffective disorder. The Kremlin denies he has health problems, with the shooting video appeared to be aimed at showing Putin's macho image. Russian state media has previously spread images and video of Putin hunting, dipping into icy cold water, or other material aiming at boosting his strongman persona. The new footage appeared as Putin is feared in the West to be pondering using tactical nuclear weapons following his failure to invade more than a few fringe areas of Ukraine. He watched mobilised soldiers tackle an obstacle course, and stage a practice in a fight against a mock enemy’s armoured vehicles — far away from the frontline. In a wooden exchange, Putin is heard asking the mobilised men: 'How long have you been here?' He was told since 7 October. Putin asked: 'Do you feel confident…are your skills returning?' A conscript called Ruslan replied: 'Yes, sir.' The Shoigu sighting came amid Western speculation that the defence minister is being edged out, perhaps at the expense of hardline new war commander General Sergei Surovikin. Putin seemed to convey the message that Shoigu remains in his top team. The visit happened a day after Putin raised Russia's war footing and declared martial law in four occupied regions of Ukraine that he moved to annex last month in a step condemned as illegal by Ukraine, its allies and the United Nations General Assembly. Faced with a series of defeats in the war, Putin last month declared a 'partial mobilization' to call up hundreds of thousands of extra troops. It has proceeded chaotically, with frequent cases of call-up papers going out to the wrong men, and even Putin has been forced to acknowledge mistakes. Hundreds of thousands of Russians have fled abroad to escape being drafted. Putin said last Friday the mobilization would be over within two weeks. On Thursday, he ordered all Russia's regions to do more to support army needs and stressed that all mobilized men needed to be sent to the front with proper equipment. More than 200,000 people have been conscripted into the Russian army since Putin announced the mobilisation drive, the defence ministry said. Russia's mobilisation is aimed at propping up Moscow's forces in Ukraine after a series of military setbacks. The news comes after video emerged of children as young as four and five being given war lessons in Russia. Shocking footage showed 'teacher' Pavel Firsov demonstrating a Kalashnikov machine-gun and an anti-tank grenade launcher to kindergarten youngsters. Children at Kindergarten No. 31 in Korolev, near Moscow were taught the 'qualities that distinguish a true defender of the Motherland'. Firsov, from a militaristic pro-Kremlin movement called Combat Brotherhood, is a 'veteran of military operations' and regularly gives military lessons to older children. In Russia, children attend kindergartens before transferring to schools at the age of seven."
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11338151/Defence-sources-reject-Kremlin-claim-technical-malfunction-Russian-jet-fired-spy-plane.html,Was Russian jet's missile a warning to UK spy plane? Defence sources reject Kremlin claims of 'technical malfunction' sparking mid-air drama,"Defence sources have rejected Russia's claims that a 'technical malfunction' caused one of its fighter jets to fire a missile close to a British spy plane. They told the Daily Mail that the incident – revealed yesterday by Defence Secretary Ben Wallace – was more likely a Kremlin warning over Britain's military support for Ukraine. Mr Wallace told the House of Commons that an Su-27 fighter jet had intercepted the intelligence-gathering aircraft over the Black Sea on September 29. The Russian jet fired a missile which missed the RAF Rivet Joint – an aircraft packed with sensors and software capable of intercepting Russian military communications. Responding to an official complaint submitted by Mr Wallace, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu insisted the firing of the missile was a mistake. But defence sources cast doubt over Russia's explanation, claiming the missile was fired deliberately. Retired Rear Admiral Chris Parry said: 'Of course it wasn't an accident. The incident displayed clear intimidatory intent. We are in a strategic conflict with Russia now. We need to be tougher and to face down these criminals.' The incident closely resembled another hostile interaction between British and Russian forces in the same region in June 2021. Then, a Russian coastguard vessel fired machine gun rounds towards HMS Defender when the warship crossed its path in the Black Sea. The captain of the Royal Navy ship had previously ignored warnings that it could come under fire if it approached the coastline of the Crimean peninsula – which has been occupied by Russia since 2014. The Russians opened fire once HMS Defender was out of range, ensuring no one aboard the warship was wounded. The more recent incident may have been motivated by Russian concerns that the Rivet Joint was acquiring military intelligence which the UK would give to Ukraine. Defence expert Francis Tusa said: 'If I was in Nato HQ, I'd be concerned there might be a turning point here. 'RAF and US Rivet Joints fly 'racetrack' flight patterns over the Black Sea, the Baltic and eastern Poland gathering intelligence. The role of the aircraft is to hoover up electronic transmissions and communications. 'Do they subsequently pass such intelligence to the Ukrainians? Well, the rate Russian army HQs in the field seem to get hit by Ukrainian artillery seems to point in this direction. 'If the Russian air force is going to get more aggressive as regards to Nato surveillance aircraft, close protection of these assets becomes a real issue.' Mr Wallace said Rivet Joint patrols were suspended temporarily after the incident. They resumed with Nato fighter jets accompanying the spy planes. He said: 'An unarmed RAF Rivet Joint, a civilian-style aircraft, on a routine patrol over the Black Sea was interacted with by two Russian Su-27 fighter aircraft. It is not unusual for aircraft to be shadowed and this day was no different. During that interaction, however, it transpired one of the Su-27s released a missile in the vicinity of the RAF Rivet Joint beyond visual range. The total time of the interaction was approximately 90 minutes. 'The patrol completed and the aircraft returned to base.' Mr Wallace said: 'Everything we do is considered and calibrated with regard to the ongoing conflict in the region and in accordance with international law. 'We welcomed Russia's acknowledgement this was in international airspace. The UK has conducted regular sorties with RAF Rivet Joint over the Black Sea since 2019 and we will continue to do so.' Mr Wallace added that, in a separate incident, a Russian jet had flown within 15ft of a Nato aircraft. He described such behaviour as 'reckless' and 'unnecessary'. Rivet Joint missions are shrouded in secrecy. The aircraft's crew of up to 30 customarily includes linguists, communications experts and technicians. The equipment they operate is strictly classified. The aircraft is 135ft long and can fly at 540mph."
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11335665/Mystery-missing-Russian-nuclear-tests.html,Mystery of Russia's 'missing' nuclear tests: No sign of long-awaited drills amid claims Putin's atomic plans are being 'disrupted' from within with top brass 'sabotaging plans to use nuclear weapons',"Mystery surrounds Russian nuclear tests that were expected to take this week and never materialised, amid claims they are being 'disrupted' from within. Moscow typically carries out large-scale atomic drills dubbed 'Grom' at this time of year and in recent days had issued a number of airspace alerts over its usual testing grounds - heavily suggesting they would be going ahead. But the US says it has received no alert from Moscow about any upcoming tests and there has been no official word from the Kremlin explaining their absence, with the air alerts due to expire Saturday. That has led one prominent Russian academic to speculate that Russian top brass have been 'sabotaging' the nuclear tests - either because they fear Putin trying to use the weapons in Ukraine, or because they don't work. Varlery Solovey, an expert on Putin and former professor at Moscow's prestigious Institute of International Relations, claimed that two tests were supposed to have taken place by now. One warhead was supposed to have been detonated under the Barents Sea and the second was supposed to have been blown up at an underground test site at Arkhangelsk, which sits on the White Sea, he claimed. 'Both times the tests were not held,' he said. The president got reports that there was an emergency situation, that it didn't work out.' Solovey added: 'Once is an accident, twice is a coincidence. 'But…if the third time tests end the same way, with nothing, [it will look like] sabotage... not fulfilling….the orders of the chief commander….' He spoke out amid rising fears in the West that Putin's finger could be creeping closer to the Red Button as his invasion goes into reverse. Earlier this month, Italian media reported a NATO alert had been sent warning that nuclear submarine Belgorod had departed its base in the White Sea. The note speculated that Belgorod could be headed to the nearby Kara Sea to test a Poseidon underwater nuke, reports suggested. Poseidon is a one-of-a-kind Russia weapon that state media claims is capable of exploding with such terrifying force that it causes radioactive tsunamis designed to drown entire coastlines or countries. Days later, it was reported that a train used by Russia's shadowy 12th Chief Directorate - which handles its nuclear weapons - was on the move toward Ukraine. Amid those warnings, Joe Biden spoke out to share his fear that the world is now closer to 'Armageddon' than at any time since the Cold War. Ben Wallace, UK defence secretary, was then summoned to an emergency meeting at the Pentagon this week to have discussions that his deputy - armed forces minister James Heappey - said were 'beyond belief'. That sparked further fears of nuclear escalation, as it came against the backdrop of Russian forces being pushed back in southern Ukraine. Sergei Surovikin, overall commander of the 'special military operation', has been laying the groundwork for a potential retreat from the city - the only regional capital Putin's forces have managed to capture in eight months of fighting. Experts have suggested that Putin could detonate a nuke either over the Black Sea or on a remote testing ground to show that Russia's huge but ageing stockpile of warheads still works. But if Putin's nukes don't work, or his generals are sabotaging attempts to use them, then it could quickly erode his authority and one of the last means he has to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat."
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11336947/Biden-thanks-Liz-Truss-partnership-embattled-PM-quits-just-six-weeks-job.html,Biden thanks Liz Truss - Britain's shortest serving Prime Minister in history - for her 'partnership' on the Ukraine War after criticizing her calamitous economic plan,"President Biden thanked Liz Truss for her partnership on the Russia-Ukraine conflict after the embattled British prime minister dramatically quit Thursday with just six weeks on the job. 'The United States and the United Kingdom are strong Allies and enduring friends — and that fact will never change,' Biden said in a statement. 'I thank Prime Minister Liz Truss for her partnership on a range of issues including holding Russia accountable for its war against Ukraine. We will continue our close cooperation with the U.K. government as we work together to meet the global challenges our nations face.' Just a month ago Biden and Truss met in person at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. He reaffirmed his gratitude for her collaboration on Ukraine when asked by reporters if Truss did 'the right thing' late on Thursday morning. 'Well that's for her to decide, but look she was a good partner on Russia and Ukraine,' Biden told reporters on his way to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 'The British are going to solve their problems, but she was a good partner.' Biden at an ice cream shop in Oregon over the weekend criticized Truss' plan to cut taxes. 'I wasn't the only one that thought it was a mistake,' Biden told reporters. 'I think that the idea of cutting taxes on the super wealthy at a time when - anyway, I just think - I disagreed with the policy, but that's up to Great Britain to make that judgment, not me.' Truss on Friday fired her finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng and scrapped parts of their economic package after it triggered financial turmoil, including a dive in the pound's value. She handed over her resignation while admitting defeat following crisis talks with Tory chiefs in Downing Street and with MPs in open insurrection. After just 44 disastrous days in No10, the PM took to a lectern outside the famous black door to confirm her departure, sealing her fate as the shortest-serving premier in modern political history. Revealing she had informed the King of her decision, she said: 'I cannot deliver on the mandate.... I will remain as PM until a successor has been chosen.' Truss - who insisted she was a 'fighter not a quitter' barely 24 hours ago - said the Tory leadership contest will be completed over the next week. Giving her valedictory statement, she was watched by husband Hugh. Attention immediately turns to the leadership battle - with Jeremy Hunt ruling himself out within minutes. However, there are claims that Boris Johnson - currently on holiday in the Caribbean - will bid for a shock return just six weeks after he left office. Rishi Sunak friends told MailOnline he is almost certain to stand, Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch are likely to run, and Penny Mordaunt's 'grassroots' campaign Twitter account has already fired up. Justice Secretary Brandon Lewis is also considering throwing his hat in the ring, although the number of nominations from MPs needed to appear on the ballot is expected to be very high. One close Sunak ally told MailOnline there would be a 'natural logic' to him facing off against Mr Johnson. 'It will be a battle for the soul of the party,' they added. Conservative 1922 Committee chair Sir Graham Brady told journalists in Westminster that a replacement should be in place by October 28, in time for the Halloween Budget. He suggested that the membership could be 'involved' on that schedule, but refused to give details of how. The bombshell news follows a week of carnage that saw a bewildering array of U-turns on the mini-Budget, the Chancellor and Home Secretary quit, confusion over whether the Chief Whip had followed her out of the door, and MPs wrestling in Commons voting lobbies. I came into office at a time of great economic and international instability. Families and businesses were worried about how to pay their bills. Putin's illegal war in Ukraine threatens the security of our whole continent. And our country had been held back for too long by low economic growth. I was elected by the Conservative Party with a mandate to change this. We delivered on energy bills and on cutting national insurance. And we set out a vision for a low tax, high growth economy – that would take advantage of the freedoms of Brexit. I recognise though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty The King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party. This morning I met the Chair of the 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady. We have agreed there will be a leadership election to be completed in the next week. This will ensure we remain on a path to deliver our fiscal plans and maintain our country's economic stability and national security. I will remain as Prime Minister until a successor has been chosen. Thank you. A slew of apocalyptic polls showing Labour up to 36 points ahead had also fueled outright panic in the Parliamentary party. Truss held crisis talks with Sir Graham, deputy PM Therese Coffey and Tory chair Jake Berry in the building earlier, as they delivered grim message about the mood of the party. A series of previously-loyal MPs joined calls for her to go this morning. Even supportive Cabinet ministers had been conceding the situation is 'terminal'. Transport Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan was sent out to prop up the PM this morning, but would only say that 'at the moment' she believes Truss will lead the Tories into the next election. The main obstacle to removing Truss over recent days was the lack of consensus on who should take over and what the process should be, with little appetite for a drawn-out contest. Nadine Dorries has warned the only person who would be acceptable in a 'coronation' is Johnson. One idea being pushed by influential Tories is that MPs vote on a successor, but there is a very high threshold of nominations to get on the ballot. The 1922 committee could ask candidates to agree that they will step aside if they are not in pole position when the field is whittled down to a final two. That would avoid the need for a run-off vote of the entire party membership. A source said of the blueprint: 'That has been put to someone very senior in the party, very, very senior.' Events accelerated after another bout of madness at Westminster yesterday culminated in stories of tears and tantrums in Parliament, with Truss allegedly engaging in a shouting match with her own enforcers. Deputy PM Therese Coffey was accused of 'manhandling' Tory MPs to vote against a Labour motion that could have killed the government's plans to resume fracking - something she denies. The premier tried to force the issue by declaring that it was a matter of confidence, meaning a defeat the would have collapsed the government. But at the end of the debate a minister declared that it was not in fact a confidence vote - triggering fury from Chief Whip Wendy Morton and her deputy Craig Whittaker. Other whips told MPs they had resigned, but after three hours of silence and frantic wrangling behind the scenes Downing Street announced they were still in post. A 1.33am statement then made clear that it had been a confidence vote, warning that around 30 MPs who abstained will be disciplined. However, in another twist this morning, Trevelyan said that it had not been a confidence vote. The PM lost her second Cabinet heavyweight in five days after Suella Braverman resigned as Home Secretary, admitting using of her personal email to campaign against the government's own immigration policy - but also hit out at Truss for ditching key policies, suggesting she should also quit for 'mistakes'. The PM appointed Grants Shapps, a Rishi Sunak supporter who as late as Monday was telling media that her government was unsustainable. As Truss' time in power came shuddering to an ignominious end: Liz Truss will be the shortest serving prime minister in British history. She has currently clocked up 44 full days in the role – a long way behind the next shortest premiership, that of Tory statesman George Canning, who spent 118 full days as PM in 1827 before dying in office from ill health. Truss was to have overtaken this number of days on January 3 2023. But instead she will fall short by more than two months, with the next prime minister due to be elected within the next week. Some PMs have had shorter terms, but gone on to take charge in No10 again. Truss's announcement came after Graham gave her a grim assessment of her survival prospects. 'I came into office at a time of great economic and international instability. 'Families and businesses were worried about how to pay their bills. 'Putin's illegal war in Ukraine threatens the security of our whole continent. 'And our country had been held back for too long by low economic growth. 'I was elected by the Conservative Party with a mandate to change this. 'We delivered on energy bills and on cutting national insurance. 'And we set out a vision for a low tax, high growth economy – that would take advantage of the freedoms of Brexit. 'I recognize though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. Truss said that the contest should 'be completed within the next week'. 'This will ensure that we remain on a path to deliver our fiscal plan and maintain our country's economic stability and national security,' she added. 'I will remain as Prime Minister until a successor has been chosen.' Labour leader Keir Starmer demanded a general election 'now' so that the nation can have 'a chance at a fresh start'. The Conservatives are set to appoint their third prime minister on the mandate won by Johnson in December 2019. Sir Keir said: 'The Conservative Party has shown it no longer has a mandate to govern. 'The British public deserve a proper say on the country's future. They must have the chance to compare the Tories' chaos with Labour's plans to sort out their mess, grow the economy for working people and rebuild the country for a fairer, greener future. 'We must have a chance at a fresh start. We need a general election – now.' As MPs lined up against Truss earlier, Tory backbencher Gary Streeter said he believed she must go, but warned that even the 'Angel Gabriel' will struggle to lead the party because it lacks 'discipline, mutual respect and teamwork'. Fellow Conservative Sheryl Murray said: 'I had high hopes for Liz Truss but after what happened last night her position has become untenable and I have submitted a letter to Sir Graham Brady.' Hendon MP Matthew Offord told the Evening Standard said Truss needs to make a 'dignified exit'. 'I can't see the situation being sustainable. She does need to sit down and discuss it with her Cabinet and with others to manage some kind of dignified exit.' Crawley MP Henry Smith told Times Radio that the Conservatives 'cannot delay' getting rid of the premier. Tory Jill Mortimer, who shocked Labour by winning the Hartlepool by-election just last year, shared an image of her letter of no confidence on Facebook. She added: 'Yesterday, I tried to get called in PMQs to ask Liz Truss for an assurance of support for our town and our promises. 'Sadly I was not called and the deteriorating situation throughout the day left me with no choice but to submit a letter of no confidence in the Prime Minister to Sir Graham Brady.' Senior MP Simon Hoare told BBC Radio 4's Today program: 'I'm a glass half full sort of person. Can the ship be turned around? Yes. But I think there's about 12 hours to do it. 'I think today and tomorrow are crunch days. I have never known – OK, I've only been an MP for seven years – but a growing sense of pessimism in all wings of the Tory party.' In a rant during an interview that was retweeted by colleagues, veteran Conservative MP Charles Walker said: 'I think it's a shambles and a disgrace. I think it is utterly appalling. I am livid.' Last night Conservative MPs were confident that between 50 and 100 letters of no confidence had been submitted to Sir Graham, despite current rules stating the committee cannot hold a vote of confidence in Liz Truss for a year after her appointment. And in another hit for the PM, Tory MP William Wragg confirmed within the House of Commons that he was one of those who has submitted a letter. There are now at least 14 Tory MPs on the record who have said Truss can't continue. Recent polling shows Truss has lower approval ratings than both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn at any time during their time as leader of their parties. After the government declared yesterday morning that the vote on banning fracking was an issue of confidence and all Conservative MPs had to vote against the motion, raucous scenes ensued after Climate Minister Graham Stuart at the last minute told the Commons it was not a confidence motion after all. Deputy chief whip Craig Whittaker had written to Conservatives telling them it is a '100 per cent hard 3 line whip!' 'We cannot, under any circumstances, let the Labour Party take control of the order paper and put through their own legislation and whatever other bits of legislation they desire,' he said. 'We are voting NO and I reiterate, this is a hard 3 line whip with all slips withdrawn.' The last-minute withdrawal of this caused Chief Whip Wendy Morton to storm out of the Chamber, before reportedly publicly declaring 'I am no longer the Chief Whip' while standing just a metre away from the PM. While Tory MPs were originally telling reporters that both the Chief Whip and her Deputy, Craig Whittaker, had quit their roles and handed in resignation letters, confusion soon intensified after it was reported Liz Truss followed Ms Morton and pulled her into an intense meeting to prevent her quitting. Mr Whittaker reportedly declared as he walked out of the division lobby: 'I am f***ing furious and I don't give a f*** any more.' For several hours, no-one from the government could confirm or deny the claims that both the top whips had resigned. When pressed on issue, Business Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said he was 'not clear' what the 'situation' with the whips was. By 9pm, Ms Coffey was telling reporters outside the Carlton Club - where with exquisite timing the entire Cabinet was due to attend a dinner for the centenary of the agreement that sunk Lloyd George's government - that Ms Morton had won a 'great victory' by defeating the Labour motion. No10 confirmed at 9.49pm that the pair were indeed remaining in post. The Carlton Club bash was originally due to be black tie, but was downgraded to avoid pix of the Cabinet looking too decadent on day huge inflation figures were unveiled. 'If only that was our biggest problem,' said one source. There were extraordinary scenes within Westminster as Tory MPs were left in chaos after the apparent u-turn on the 'confidence' vote, leaving them unsure whether they could now abstain or vote against without losing the whip. Multiple MPs claim they witnessed shouting and screaming amongst Conservative MPs and senior ministers, while the senior members of the whip's office were nowhere to be seen. The barely believable scenes in the division lobbies - captured on camera by Labour MP Chris Bryant in defiance of Commons rules - were the latest evidence of the wheels falling off Ms Truss's administration. Labour had tabled a motion trying to ban fresh drilling and Tory whips told backbenchers it was a 'confidence motion' that could in theory bring down Ms Truss. They threatened to kick rebels out the party if they did not vote with the Government. No Tories voted against the government but 40 abstained - including Kwasi Kwarteng, who was chancellor until last week. Commons records show Ms Truss abstained, although there are now claims that is a mistake and she did vote with the government. Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg said: 'Late in the day, a junior official at 10 Downing Street sent a message through to the front bench that it was not a vote of confidence and nobody else was aware of that. 'The whips were not aware of that, I was not aware of that and most members thought that it was a vote of confidence. It was simply one of those unfortunate miscommunications that occasionally happens. Labour MPs reported screaming and shouting and Tory MPs being dragged in to vote with the Government. Speaking in the chamber afterwards, former minister Chris Bryant said: 'I would urge you to launch an investigation into the scenes outside the entrance to the no lobby earlier. 'As you know, members are expected to be able to vote without fear or favor and the behavior code which is agreed by the whole of the House says there shall never be bullying or harassment. 'I saw members being physically manhandled into another lobby and being bullied. If we want to stand up against bullying in this House of our staff, we have to stop bullying in this chamber as well.' Later on Sky he directly accused Deputy PM Therese Coffey and Mr Rees-Mogg of manhandling MP Alex Stafford into the voting lobby, though he described it as a 'heated exchange'. But Mr Stafford later commented on Twitter that 'no-one pushes me around' in a denial of Labour's version of events. Nevertheless, dozens of opposition MPs shared their own eyewitness accounts on social media during and shortly after the voting period which appeared to back up the allegations, including government whips 'screaming', Therese Coffey 'practically picking up' another MP to walk them through the 'No' lobby, and multiple MPs in tears. Shadow minister Anna McMorrin wrote on Twitter that she witnessed an MP 'in tears' in the lobby. A Tory MP who witnessed the height of the chaos said: 'I was waiting for the votes and then Craig Whittaker came out crying and saying he's sick of everything. Then Wendy came out stony faced. The other whips say they have quit. It was absolute carnage.' Ms Truss eventually won the vote by 326 to 230 but among the chaos Chief Whip Wendy Morton also abstained. One miserable Cabinet source told MailOnline: 'At this rate I'm going to be PM by Christmas. 'The writing was on the wall for Wendy since the day of her appointment.' Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg said he was 'not entirely clear what the situation is with the chief whip'. Conservative MP Sir Charles Walker, MP for Broxbourne since 2005, told the BBC: 'This whole affair is inexcusable. It is a pitiful reflection on the Conservative Party.' When asked whether there is a way back for the government, Mr Walker said: 'I don't think so.' Suella Braverman resigned as Home Secretary yesterday in yet another blow to Truss' authority: but did not go quietly. In her letter, Ms Braverman said she sent a message from her personal email to a 'trusted parliamentary colleague as part of policy engagement, and with the aim of garnering support for government policy on migration'. She acknowledged that constituted a 'technical infringement of the rules', the document was a draft written ministerial statement, and while much of it had already been briefed to MPs 'nevertheless it is right for me to go'. She said 'the business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes' adding: 'Pretending we haven't made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can't see we have made them and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics. 'I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility; I resign.' She added: 'It is obvious to everyone that we are going through a tumultuous time. 'I have concerns about the direction of this government. Not only have we broken key pledges that were promised to our voters, but I have had serious concerns about this Government's commitment to honouring manifesto commitments, such as reducing overall migration numbers and stopping illegal migration, particularly the dangerous small boats crossings.' He added: 'This is an absolute disgrace. 'I think it's a shambles and a disgrace. I think it is utterly appalling. I am livid. 'I hope all those people who put Liz Truss in No.10 I hope it was worth it. [...] Because the damage they have done to our party is extraordinary.' 'I've had enough. I've had enough of talentless people putting their tick in the right box, not because it's in the national interest, but because it's in their personal interest.' Later he added: 'I expect the prime minister to resign very soon because she's not up to her job.' Hours earlier Home Secretary Suella Braverman was forced to resign yesterday, ostensibly for breaching protocol by sending an email from her personal account to a contact revealing details of an announcement on immigration policy. Downing Street said Braverman, the shortest serving Home Secretary of modern times, had resigned after sending a confidential document to a Tory MP in breach of the ministerial code. But multiple sources said her departure followed a 'fiery' 90-minute meeting between her and Miss Truss in No 10 the previous night at which the Home Secretary warned the PM it would be 'insane' to relax immigration rules in order to boost economic growth. In an explosive resignation letter last night Mrs Braverman suggested that the PM should quit and savaged her record. 'It is obvious to everyone that we are going through a tumultuous time,' she wrote. 'I have concerns about the direction of this Government. Not only have we broken key pledges that were promised to our voters, but I have had serious concerns about this Government's commitment to honouring manifesto commitments, such as reducing overall migration numbers.' She swiped that when people made 'mistakes' - something Ms Truss has admitted - the right thing to do was quit. Ms Truss responded with a much briefer letter saying it is 'important the Ministerial Code is upheld' and quickly installed Grant Shapps - previously a strident critic and Rishi Sunak supporter - as a replacement. On Monday of this week, Mr Shapps publicly said that if Ms Truss were to save her premiership, she would need to 'thread the eye of a needle with the lights off'. Ms Braverman was under pressure to sign off a plan to liberalise migration rules to help boost the economy, as part of Ms Truss's drive for growth. The former minister appears to have sent an email with details of the proposed policy to a parliamentary staffer, with speculation she could have been trying to sabotage it. One Tory MP close to Ms Braverman told MailOnline of the security breach: 'It's the kind of thing that you give a wrap on the knuckles and carry on - unless you want to get rid of someone.' The MP said Ms Braverman 'wasn't happy over their stance on immigration', and also warned more resignations could be imminent. 'I get the impression we're going to get an avalanche.' Mr Shapps did not offer any solace to Ms Truss as he spoke outside the Home Office late on Thursday, stressing his duty is to keep the country secure. 'It's been a turbulent time for the government. The most important thing is for the people of the country to know that they have got security.' MPs yesterday described the Cabinet as a 'caretaker' government, and many do not believe that Ms Truss can even survive until the Halloween Budget regardless of divisions over who should take over. Suella Braverman was only in the Home Office for a matter of weeks but she spent most of it positioning herself for a tilt at another job - that of prime minister. The hardline Brexiteer was handed the top job as an acknowledgement of her popularity with the right of the party in the summer leadership contest. But during her tenure she made a series of outbursts that put her at odds with Liz Truss, raising suggestions she was positioning herself for the next leadership race. The 42-year-old mother-of two hit the headlines just yesterday with a rant against the 'tofu-eating wokerati' for effectively preventing police from arresting eco-zealots who have caused mayhem and misery during weeks of protest. She hit out at MPs who voted against tough new measures to strengthen police powers to deal with activists more quickly. Addressing the Commons as MPs debated the Public Order Bill, Mrs Braverman said: 'I'm afraid it's the Labour Party, it's the Lib Dems, it's the coalition of chaos, it's the Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati – dare I say, the anti-growth coalition – that we have to thank for the disruption we are seeing on our roads today.' Her comments came as police arrested two Just Stop Oil protesters who spent 36 hours suspended from the QEII bridge, closing a major transport link between Kent and Essex due to safety fears. At the Conservative Party conference a fortnight ago she also attacked the PM for U-turniong over plans to axe the 45p top rate of income tax. She launched a swipe as the PM tried to regain her balance, branding the U-turn on axing the 45p tax rate 'disappointing' and accusing rebels of a 'coup'. She was also blamed recently for jeopardizing a free trade deal with India by accusing its people of being the worst at overstaying visas in the UK. The staunch Brexiteer, who served loyally in Boris Johnson's Cabinet as Attorney General, was appointed to replace Priti Patel as home secretary. Like Miss Patel, she is of Indian ancestry - her parents, of Goan and Mauritian origins, emigrated to Britain in the 1960s from East Africa before setting up base in Harrow, north-west London. Her mother, a nurse by profession, ensured politics was a part of family life. A Tory councillor for 16 years, she also stood for Parliament in 2001 and 2003. Mrs Braverman herself was an early adopter of Tory values, serving as president of the Cambridge University Conservative Association while studying law. After two failed parliamentary runs, she was elected as MP for Fareham in Hampshire in 2015 and rose through the party ranks quickly. Outside politics, Mrs Braverman has two children with her husband Rael, whom she married at the House of Commons in 2018. She has faced questions over her involvement with the controversial Buddhist Triratna sect. The Triratna order, formerly one of Buddhism's largest sects in the UK, has been the subject of historic sexual abuse allegations. Mrs Braverman is believed to have attended meetings and retreats organised by the group, and was known as a 'mitra' - or friend - within the order. After another difficult PMQs, during which she stunned the house by performing yet another u-turn in announcing she was committed to the pensions triple lock, Ms Truss abruptly cancelled a visit to an aerospace firm earlier without giving a reason beyond 'government business'. She is now facing Tory mutiny on a bewildering range of issues. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt addressed the Conservative 1922 committee last night, and is said to have quipped, 'this sh** would be interesting if I wasn't in the middle of it' - a quote from Barack Obama. Northern Ireland Secretary Steve Baker was sent out on TV to insist Ms Braverman was not attacking the premier, and would still be Home Secretary if not for the security issue. He said he hoped that she would be brought back into government in the New Year. Ms Braverman has repeatedly been embroiled in controversy since taking over at the Home Office. At the Tory conference she complained about the 45p tax rate being kept, and said she wanted Britain to leave the European Convention on Human Rights. She has also suggested that rules on visas for Indian nationals should not be relaxed, seemingly torpedoing a mooted trade deal. Earlier this week she attacked the 'tofu-eating wokerati' for effectively preventing police from arresting eco-zealots who have caused mayhem and misery during weeks of protest. The PM's press secretary shrugged off the latest intervention this afternoon, saying Ms Braverman had a 'way with words'. In front of a gloomy Tory rank-and-file in the Commons during yesterday's PMQs, a clearly-rattled Ms Truss admitted she was 'sorry' and had 'made mistakes'. But despite Keir Starmer joking that she will be 'out by Christmas' after her 'fantasy economics ended in disaster', Ms Truss insisted she will not resign. 'I am a fighter not a quitter,' she said, echoing a famous line from Labour's Peter Mandelson. The clashes came as inflation surged back into double-digits with food prices heaping more pain on hard-pressed Britons. The government had been hinting that pensioners faced real-terms cuts as part of a desperate £40billion spending squeeze - but Ms Truss tried to kill off the issue by declaring she will stick to the triple lock. 'I am completely committed to it, so is the Chancellor,' she said as Jeremy Hunt watched from beside her on the the green benches. However, she pointedly stopped short of making the same promise on uprating benefits, another area where Tories are threatening to revolt. Steve Double warned she could only have 'days' left as he called her position 'untenable', while William Wragg said he had sent a letter of no-confidence to the 1922 committee chief Graham Brady. Sir Graham is believed to have informed the premier that more than 50 Tories have privately sent him no-confidence letters. Ms Truss told MPs: 'I have been very clear that I am sorry and that I have made mistakes.' Amid shouts of 'resign', she added: 'The right thing to do in those circumstances is to make changes, which I have made, and to get on with the job and deliver for the British people.' Former Cabinet minister Sajid Javid had been slated to ask a question at PMQs, but apparently pulled out at the last minute. As the session began reports emerged that Ms Truss's senior aide Jason Stein has been suspended pending an investigating into briefing. There was a vicious barb at Mr Javid over the weekend claiming he was not offered the Chancellor job because the PM regarded him as 'sh**'. The PM's press secretary said this afternoon: 'I am not going to get into individual staffing matters but the Prime Minister has made very clear to her team that some of the sort of briefings that we have seen are completely unacceptable about parliamentary colleagues and they must stop.' The cost-of-living crisis is the stark backdrop for a crisis at Westminster as Ms Truss desperately battles to cling on after being forced to sack ally Kwasi Kwarteng and ditch the disastrous mini-Budget that triggered havoc on markets - before any of last night's chaos came into play. PMQs was only Ms Truss's third since entering No10 and came just a week after she insisted there would 'absolutely not' be spending cuts. Mr Hunt - who has been branded the 'de facto PM' - now says cuts will be 'eye-watering'."
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11336697/Russia-takes-one-swipe-Truss-saying-remembered-catastrophic-illiteracy.html,"Russia takes one last swipe at Liz Truss, saying she will be remembered for her 'catastrophic illiteracy' and was Britain's most 'disgraceful' PM, as global leaders react to resignation","Russia has taken one last swipe at Liz Truss following her resignation as Prime Minister, saying she was a 'disgrace' of a leader who would be remembered for her 'catastrophic illiteracy,' as world leaders reacted to the news. 'Britain has never known such a disgrace of a prime minister,' Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. 'The catastrophic illiteracy and the queen's funeral immediately after her audience with Liz Truss will be remembered.' The claim of illiteracy appears to refer to Truss's visit to Moscow in February before Russia invaded Ukraine, when Truss was British foreign minister. In a meeting with Russia's veteran foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, she appeared to confuse two regions of Russia with Ukraine, triggering widespread mockery in Russian media. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev wrote on Twitter: 'Bye, bye @trussliz, congrats to lettuce', referring to the British Daily Star tabloid's days-long livestream asking whether Truss' troubled premiership would outlast the shelf-life of a lettuce. Truss' resignation attracted extensive and gleeful coverage on Russian state TV. A guest on the political talkshow 'Time Will Tell' said Truss had possessed the three traits needed to thrive in British politics: 'Stupidity, arrogance, and belligerence'. Truss has been the target of withering comments from Moscow since she visited in February as part of a fruitless drive by Western politicians to the invasion of Ukraine. Russian officials took a dim view of Truss's premiership from the outset and have revelled in her numerous gaffes. Upon her appointment in September, Lavrov said Truss did not know how to compromise and questioned how the British leader could say she did not know whether French President Emmanuel Macron was a 'friend or foe'. Zakharova also on Thursday mocked Truss' high-profile photo shoot in Estonia last year, where she donned a flak jacket and helmet to ride in a tank during a visit to British troops stationed in the Baltic country. Relations between Moscow and London have deteriorated for years, over issues such as the 2018 poisoning of a former Russian spy in Salisbury. They have reached record lows since Moscow's offensive in Ukraine. The UK is one of Kyiv's staunchest supporters in the fact of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and Russia considers it as one of the most unfriendly Western countries. Truss announced her resignation on Thursday, just 44 days after being appointed, with a leadership election in her Conservative Party expected within the next week. Truss's tenure was derailed by her economic program, which sent shockwaves through financial markets and was all but abandoned. Other world leaders also reacted as news of Truss's unprecedented resignation as Prime Minister reverberated around the world. France's President Emmanuel Macron wished Britain a rapid return to stability, while the White House reiterated that the US will continue its close relationship. Ireland's Prime Minister Michael Martin expressed his hope that Truss's successor would be selected quickly to ensure stability. Arriving at an EU summit, Macron said he would not comment on British domestic politics but added: 'It is important that Great Britain regains political stability very quickly, and that is all I wish.' Relations between Paris and London have often been sour as Britain negotiated its divorce from the European Union, and threatened to get worse as Truss courted the hardline pro-Brexit wing of her party. During her campaign to be elected leader of the Conservative Party, and thus prime minister, Truss famously said that 'the jury is out' on whether the French leader was a friend or foe of Britain. But there were also signs of a potential rapprochement on strategic issues, with Truss agreeing to attend the first summit in Prague of the Macron-inspired European Political Community. News of Truss's resignation broke as Macron was arriving at the EU summit in Brussels, and he was asked about it by reporters. As he arrived, he gave photographers a wink and a thumbs up. Macron said that he had had several telephone calls with Truss during her brief time in office and had been glad to see her in Prague. 'I want to say that France, as a nation and people who are friends of the British people, wishes them above all stability,' he said, stressing the context of the war in Ukraine and energy price crisis. 'But personally, I'm always sad to see a colleague leave in this way and what I want to say is that I wish stability can return soon.' In August, Mr Macron reacted with anger to Truss's 'friend or foe' comments. In a concerted dig Mr Macron, said at the time: 'The United Kingdom is a friendly nation, regardless of its leaders, and sometimes in spite of its leaders.' Asked further about Ms Truss's perceived insult Mr Macron said: 'It's never a good idea to lose your bearings in life. 'If I'd been asked the question myself [as to whether I'm a friend or foe of Liz Truss], this is how I'd answer it - whoever becomes the next leader of Great Britain, I won't ask myself any questions about them personally. 'Great Britain is a friend of France, and you know we live in a complicated world. 'We have more and more liberal governments, autocratic democracies and other powers that create imbalance, and if we're not able to say whether the French and British people are friends or foes - and the word foes is not a neutral one - then we're heading towards serious problems. 'So yes, I say it with certainty, the British people, the British nation is our friend. The United Kingdom, strong and allied, regardless of its leaders, and sometimes in spite of and beyond its leaders, or regardless of the small mistakes they can make in their speeches,' he said in August. On Thursday, US President Biden vowed to continue close cooperation with Britain following Truss's resignation. 'I thank Prime Minister Liz Truss for her partnership on a range of issues including holding Russia accountable for its war against Ukraine,' Biden said in a statement. 'We will continue our close cooperation with the UK government as we work together to meet the global challenges our nations face.' White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain made a similar statement earlier. 'Our country's always had a special relationship with the United Kingdom without regard to the partisan affiliation of our president or the politics of their prime minister,' Klain told MSNBC in a televised interview. 'That's going to continue no matter who the UK picks as their next prime minister.' Klain cited many shared causes, including Russia's aggression in Ukraine, as areas where the two historic allies would continue to be aligned. 'We're going to work very, very closely with whomever succeeds Prime Minister Truss,' he said. Ireland's Prime Minister Martin said: 'I think stability is very important and we would like to see the UK system within its capacity in a position to have a successor selected as quickly as possible ... during these times when a major war is underway on the continent in Europe.' Donohoe said he is looking forward to continuing Ireland's close friendship with the UK in the wake of Liz Truss's resignation as Prime Minister. Ireland's finance minister said: 'The political and the economic stability of the United Kingdom is a vital ingredient in the economic prospects of Ireland and indeed of Europe, and the Government of the United Kingdom has reaffirmed their commitment to budgetary and economic standards. 'Ireland has always been a close friend of the United Kingdom and of the government of the United Kingdom, and even during tough and challenging moments during the Brexit process. 'We always affirmed the value of that close friendship and we really look forward in the time ahead to continuing that close friendship and co-operation with the new prime minister of the United Kingdom.' Meanwhile, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte expressed his 'annoyance' that she had left the office, and said Truss's successor would be the fifth British Prime Minister he has worked with since he assumed office in 2010. 'I had a good contact with her (...) so I'm annoyed for her personally (...) We agreed on a whole range of views and I'm looking forward to work with who will be my next colleague,' adding: 'It will be the fifth one, I believe.'"
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11335573/Chechen-warlord-posts-video-claiming-three-sons-14-15-16-fighting-against-Ukraine.html,"Putin's Chechen warlord Kadyrov posts video claiming to show his three sons, 14, 15 and 16, fighting against Ukraine","Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov has posted a video claiming to show his three teenage sons - aged 14, 15 and 16 - fighting against Ukraine. Kadyrov, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, shared a video of the young boys firing grenades - apparently close to the frontline. Kadyrov claimed that Akhmat, 16, Eli, 15, and Adam, 14, 'made their way close to the enemy positions and provided fire cover for the advancing fighters' who were fighting against a Ukrainian counter-attack. Video shows the three boys in camouflage clothing and dark glasses firing grenades and shooting from a machine gun into what appeared to be an empty field. Kadyrov claimed this was on the frontlines. The video comes days after Kadyrov had claimed he would send his sons to the frontlines in Ukraine. 'It's time to prove themselves in a real fight, I can only welcome this desire,' Kadyrov wrote on Telegram, posting a video of the young boys firing missiles in a shooting range. 'Soon they will go to the front line and will be on the most difficult sections of the contact line. 'They are ready to show their skills in the zone of the special military operation.' Kadyrov has been one of the most vocal advocates for increased military action in Ukraine and his troops have a reputation for being particularly brutal. Earlier this month, the Kremlin dismissed statements made by Kadyrov in which he called on Putin to deploy low-yield nuclear weapons in Ukraine amid Russia's ailing military campaign. Kadyrov, a former warlord who leads the Muslim-majority Chechnya republic, has been one of Russia's most vocal supporters of Putin's Ukraine offensive. He was slotted into power by Putin in 2007 to exert control over the region which had fought bloody wars for independence from Moscow throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Since Russian tanks rolled across the border on February 24, the Chechen leader has consistently called on Russia's defence ministry to commit additional forces to the conflict and has called on fighting age men in Chechnya to volunteer to go to fight for Russian interests in Ukraine. Kadyrov has also earned a reputation for forcing his sons to face adversity from an early age. In 2016 he entered them - then aged 10, 9 and 8 - in a full contact mixed martial arts bout. Footage of the fights went viral and prompted widespread criticism, including from Russian MMA legend Fedor Emelianenko. The Chechen leader made more headlines earlier this month when he called on Putin to deploy 'low-yield nuclear weapons' in Ukraine amid the latest spate of Russian defeats. 'I do not know what the Defence Ministry reports to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief [Putin], but in my personal opinion, we need to take more drastic measures, up to the declaration of martial law in the border areas and use of low-yield nuclear weapons,' he said. Kadyrov complained that Putin's commanders had failed to rout Ukraine's supposed 'Satanists and fascists', and made no bones about his desire for nuclear weapons to be detonated on Ukrainian soil. He also criticised Colonel-General Alexander Lapin, who is in charge of Russia's forces fighting in the region, calling him 'mediocre'. But Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov this morning sought to undermine Kadyrov's spirited remarks. 'This is a very emotional moment. The heads of regions have the right to express their point of view,' Peskov said in a call with reporters on Monday. 'But even in difficult moments, emotions should be kept out of any kind of assessment. So we prefer to stick to balanced, objective assessments. 'In our country, the use of nuclear weapons happens only on the basis of what is stated in the relevant doctrine.' The Kremlin mouthpiece nevertheless hailed the 'heroic contributions' of the Chechen leader to the military operation in Ukraine. Last month, Putin warned the West he was 'not bluffing' when he said Russia was prepared to use nuclear weapons to protect its territory. On Friday he said the United States had created a 'precedent' by dropping nuclear bombs on Japan at the end of World War Two."
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11336743/Boris-Johnson-plans-run-prime-minister-AGAIN.html,"And they're off! Top Tories immediately jostle to seize power - with Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt preparing their campaigns within minutes of Truss quitting","Boris Johnson is believed to be considering a potentially explosive attempt to regain power after the resignation of Liz Truss, as other leading Tories squabble over her successor. The ex-PM, who was ousted by an unprecedented ministerial walk-out just three months ago, is believed to be sounding out advice on mounting a comeback after his successor lasted just 44 days in No10. His interest comes as other leading Tories argue over a unity candidate who can effectively be crowned leader and calm the bitter political and economic crisis of the past six weeks. Backbench leader Sir Graham Brady today set out a week-long timescale for the election of the new Tory leader, who will also become PM to replace Ms Truss. Conservative MPs this afternoon began to coalesce around at least three frontrunners: Mr Johnson, Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt. Every contender will need at least 100 backers to enter the election, five times as many as they needed in this summer's leadership vote. A run by Mr Johnson, if he does go through with it, could be massively divisive. He was forced out of Downing Street by MPs in the summer after a scandal-plagued three years in charge. But he remains popular with party members, who are set to be involved in the final phase of the election of a new leader. Tory MPs today began to split among the frontrunners, with senior figures cautioning against choosing Mr Johnson. Sir Roger Gale said: 'We need to remember that Mr Johnson is still under investigation by the Privileges Committee for potentially misleading the House. 'Until that investigation is complete and he is found guilty or cleared, there should be no possibility of him returning to Government.' But minister Brendan Clarke-Smith, who was given a job by Mr Johnson, told Sky: 'We need someone who can come in, we need somebody who can bring people together, somebody who actually has got that mandate. 'So a mandate from people in the last general election, a mandate from party members and somebody actually who can get this party going again, get us winning elections again. 'The only person that I think that ticks all those boxes is Boris Johnson.' Former prime minister Theresa May said Tory MPs must be prepared to compromise to ensure there is a 'sensible, competent government'. One Rishi Sunak ally told MailOnline he will almost certainly run, and predicted that there would be a 'natural logic' to him facing off against Boris Johnson. 'It will be a battle for the soul of the party,' they added. Meanwhile a 'PM4PM' Twitter campaign, run by grassroots supporters of Ms Mordaunt, began within minutes of Ms Truss quitting in Downing Street today, and a number of MPs gave their backing to the Leader of the House of Commons. MP Bob Seely, who backed Ms Mordaunt in the summer's Conservative Party leadership contest, said he hoped she would run for leader again. Mr Seely also indicated he did not want to 'go back' to the time when Mr Johnson was leader. 'Good luck to Boris. I don't want to go back to a few months ago where we were so whoever is going to get through I think there's going to be quite a high threshold,' he told Sky News. 'And I will see personally who those candidates are when they get the numbers.' Backing Ms Mordaunt, Mr Seely said: 'I think she has a great set of qualities. She has lots of ministerial experience. I think she comes across very well. And I think she resonates with people. 'Right now when we are facing a couple of international crises, both in energy, but also in the Ukraine war, having somebody with stature, with government experience, who can resonate with people, I think is really important. Ms Truss dramatically quit today, admitting defeat following crisis talks with Tory chiefs in Downing Street and with MPs in open insurrection. After just 44 disastrous days in No10, the PM took to a lectern outside the famous black door to confirm her departure, sealing her fate as the shortest-serving premier in modern political history. Revealing she had informed the King of her decision, she said: 'I cannot deliver on the mandate.... I will remain as PM until a successor has been chosen.' Ms Truss - who insisted she was a 'fighter not a quitter' barely 24 hours ago - said the Tory leadership contest will be completed over the next week. Giving her valedictory statement, she was watched by husband Hugh. Attention immediately turns to the leadership battle - with Jeremy Hunt ruling himself out within minutes. Mr Johnson is the most popular choice with party members but may struggle to win over enough MPs after ministers collapsed his government to force him from power in the summer. The party is keen to avoid a re-run of the summer's bitter and protracted 55-day race in which Ms Truss beat Rishi Sunak. That race saw both sides engage in bitter blue-on-blue infighting, mainly over the economy, that did not help the party in the polls. Monday 2pm: Nominations will close in the Tory leadership contest. Candidates will need 100 MPs to support them in order to make it through to the first ballot. If only one MP passes this threshold they will become prime minister without a vote. 3.30pm to 5.30pm: The first ballot of MPs will be held to choose between the leadership candidates. There will be a maximum of three contenders, due to the high nomination threshold. 6pm: The result of the first ballot of MPs is announced. If three candidates get through, the candidate with the fewest number of votes will be eliminated. But, if only two candidates made it through to the first ballot, this would become an indicative vote for MPs to express their preference between the final two contenders. 6.30pm to 8.30pm: If three candidates made it to the ballot, and the lowest was removed in the first vote above, a second ballot could be held. This would become the indicative vote on the final two candidates, allowing MPs to show party members who they want to be PM. 9pm: The result of the second ballot of MPs will be announced. The two candidates will then proceed to an online vote of Conservative members. Friday 11am: The online membership vote will close. The result will be announced later that day and the identity of the new Tory leader revealed. Ms Truss spent more than an hour in talks with 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady, Tory chairman Jake Berry and deputy PM Therese Coffey this morning. Afterwards, announcing her resignation after just 44 days in office, she revealed they had agreed a truncated election campaign lasting a week. Sir Graham told reporters that he wants to run it, including a vote of 160,000 party members, before the Chancellor makes a fiscal statement on spending on October 31. Asked if the party faithful will be included in the process, he told reporters: 'Well, that is the expectation. 'So the reason I've spoken to the party chairman and I discussed the parameters of a process is to look at how we can make the whole thing happen, including the party being consulted, by Friday next week.' Sir Graham added: 'I think we're deeply conscious of the imperative in the national interest of resolving this clearly and quickly.' They appear to be pinning their hopes on a single unity candidate can be identified who can effectively step in and avoid any further unpleasantness, with the party hemorrhaging support in the polls. However, that unity candidate has yet to emerge, with several big names suggesting it should be them. The main obstacle remains the lack of consensus on who should take over. There are signs leadership battle lines are already being drawn, with former minister Crispin Blunt openly calling for Mr Hunt to get the keys to No10. Sir Graham was vague about whether one or two candidates would be likely to run for the Conservative Party leadership. He told reporters: 'The party rules say there will be two candidates unless there is only one candidate.' Asked what happens if one candidate drops out, Sir Graham said: 'If there is only one candidate, there is only one candidate.' Pressed on whose idea it was to truncate the process into one week, he said: 'I think it's a matter on which there is a pretty broad consensus'. Sir Graham also said: 'It certainly is not the circumstances I would wish to see.' Tory members are likely to be given an online vote to pick the next Prime Minister by next Friday - but there are fears in the grassroots that MPs may 'stitch up' the 'coronation' of their favoured candidate. 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady has said the Conservative faithful should be involved in choosing a new party leader, however, he was vague about the process after MPs vote in the coming days. But with just a week-long process pencilled in, an online poll of members will be the way forward but there were problems over the summer when Liz Truss was elected because spy chiefs warned that interbet ballots 'could be vulnerable to hackers'. Sir Graham spoke minutes after Ms Truss' resignation speech this afternoon and insisted it will be 'possible to conduct a ballot and conclude it' before the fiscal statement that will take place on Halloween. Promising more details 'later', he also appeared vague about whether Tory MPs could just whittle down the candidates themselves to present a united front. If there is only one candidate, there would be no need for a members' vote. Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt are currently the clear favourites but some have claimed that a deal could be done between the two of them to avoid another brutal leadership battle, which looks inevitable if Boris Johnson stands. Asked if the party faithful will be included in the process, Sir Graham Brady told reporters: 'Well, that is the expectation. 'So the reason I've spoken to the party chairman and I discussed the parameters of a process is to look at how we can make the whole thing happen, including the party being consulted, by Friday next week.' Sir Graham added: 'I think we're deeply conscious of the imperative in the national interest of resolving this clearly and quickly.' He was vague about whether one or two candidates would be likely to run for the Conservative Party leadership. He told reporters: 'The party rules say there will be two candidates unless there is only one candidate.' Asked what happens if one candidate drops out, Sir Graham said: 'If there is only one candidate, there is only one candidate.' Pressed on whose idea it was to truncate the process into one week, he said: 'I think it's a matter on which there is a pretty broad consensus'. Sir Graham also said: 'It certainly is not the circumstances I would wish to see.' An online vote proved a problem when Liz Truss was chosen as leader over the summer. Originally, Conservative party members were going to be given a postal ballot which had a code with it, individual to each voter. Afterwards, they could then submit their choice by post or online for the first time- and were able to change their decision later in the contest. The chance to change the vote was scrapped due to National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) advice, after the organisation raised concerns about online hackers changing votes online which could have thrown the process into disarray. The new plans meant that each voter had their unique code deactivated after they have made their candidate choice. There were concerns a foreign enemy such as Russia could try to influence the result. Nadine Dorries warned the only person who could return in a 'coronation' is Boris Johnson. Other MPs want Rishi Sunak or Penny Mordaunt to take over. MP Bob Seely, who backed Mordaunt in the summer's Conservative Party leadership contest, said he hoped she would run for leader. Mr Seely also said he predicted 'quite a high threshold' for MPs to stand for leader, while also indicating that he did not want to 'go back' to the time when Boris Johnson was leader. 'Good luck to Boris. I don't want to go back to a few months ago where we were so whoever is going to get through I think there's going to be quite a high threshold,' he told Sky News. 'And I will see personally who those candidates are when they get the numbers.' Backing Ms Mordaunt, Mr Seely said: 'I think she has a great set of qualities. She has lots of ministerial experience. I think she comes across very well. And I think she resonates with people. 'Right now when we are facing a couple of international crises, both in energy, but also in the Ukraine war, having somebody with stature, with government experience, who can resonate with people, I think is really important.' Justin Tomlinson said it was 'wishful thinking' to imagine that Boris Johnson could return as prime minister. The Tory MP, who described himself as someone who had strongly supported the former prime minister in the past, told Sky News: 'I just think it's too soon. I was there supporting him to the very end but he did lose the confidence of the majority of our colleagues. 'I thought that was wrong. But you have to respect that. I don't think a sufficient enough time has probably passed for the party to then unite behind him and for me this now is about us, frankly, being grown up, being pragmatic and putting the country first.' One idea being pushed by influential Tories is that MPs vote on a successor, but there is a very high threshold of nominations to get on the ballot. The 1922 committee could ask candidates to agree that they will step aside if they are not in pole position when the field is whittled down to a final two. That would avoid the need for a run-off vote of the entire party membership. A source said of the blueprint: 'That has been put to someone very senior in the party, very, very senior.' Liz Truss has said she will stay on as Prime Minister until a successor is chosen via a leadership election to be held within the next week. Speaking in Downing Street, she said: 'This morning I met the chairman of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady. 'We've agreed that there will be a leadership election to be completed within the next week. 'This will ensure that we remain on a path to deliver our fiscal plan and maintain our country's economic stability and national security. 'I will remain as Prime Minister until a successor has been chosen. 'Thank you.' Here we look at who could take over power: BORIS JOHNSON Could Boris Johnson make an unlikely come-back just three months after resigning in disgrace? He was eventually pulled from office after a massive ministerial rebellion in July, after Partygate, Wallpapergate and a myriad of other scandals including the removal of whip Chris Pincher pulled down his premiership. But he still has his supporters in the parliamentary party and wider conservative ranks - though polls show a majority of voters believe he was right to quit. Government minister Sir James Duddridge said it was time for a comeback by Boris Johnson. Tweeting with the hashtag £bringbackboris, he said: 'I hope you enjoyed your holiday boss. Time to come back. Few issues at the office that need addressing.' Sir James had served as a parliamentary private secretary to Mr Johnson when he was in No 10. Just a few hours before Ms Truss' resignation announcement, close Johnson ally Nadine Dorries tweeted her support for him. She wrote: 'One person was elected by the British public with a manifesto and a mandate until January '25. If Liz Truss is no longer PM there can be no coronation of previously failed candidates. MPs must demand return of @BorisJohnson - if not it has to be leadership election or a GE.' Mr Johnson very reluctantly left Downing Street, saying in a speech in July outside the famous black door: 'I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world, but them's the breaks.' He told how he had been unsuccessful in trying to persuade his colleagues that it would be 'eccentric to change governments' back in the summer. RISHI SUNAK The former Chancellor, 42, was the runner-up in this summer's Tory leadership race. He and Ms Truss went head-to-head as the final pairing in the contest to replace Boris Johnson in No10. They engaged in bitter exchanges over their economic agendas during a lengthy series of hustings events across the UK. Now that Ms Truss has abandoned almost all her leadership pledges on tax cuts - and is adopting much of the approach pursued by Mr Sunak when he was Chancellor - some MPs will be wondering why they don't just put him in charge instead. A number of his supporters are also likely to take a 'told you so' attitude to the Government's current travails - after Mr Sunak's warned this summer of market turmoil if Ms Truss followed through with her unfunded tax cuts. Mr Sunak won the support of 137 MPs in the initial stages of the Tory leadership contest - 24 more than Ms Truss - and retains a strong backing within the parliamentary party. After overseeing the Government's economic response to the Covid crisis, he also has experience of political leadership in turbulent times. MPs might be wary of installing a leader who was rejected by the Tory membership little more than a month ago. There is also lingering resentment at Mr Sunak for his resignation as Chancellor in July, which many of Mr Johnson's loyalists still blame for the former PM's ousting from No10. But a new poll today suggests the grassroots of the party may be more accepting than previously thought. The poll of Conservative members by JL Partners for the Daily Telegraph found that 60 per cent of them would now back Mr Sunak for party leader, once undecided and non-voting members are excluded. More than four-in-10 (43 per cent) would support him outright, to Truss's (28 per cent). PENNY MORDAUNT The Leader of the House of Commons, 49, came close to reaching the final round of this summer's Tory leadership contest. She finished third behind Ms Truss and Mr Sunak when she secured the support of 105 MPs. The Royal Navy reservist has since been drafted back into the Cabinet, where she previously served as Defence Secretary under Theresa May's premiership. But, this summer's leadership contest saw questions raised about Ms Mordaunt's ministerial record. There was stinging criticism of Ms Mordaunt's work ethic as she was accused of going missing from her ministerial duties by rival camps. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who was Ms Mordaunt's former boss, moaned about she had 'not been available' at various times as a trade minister and left others to 'pick up the pieces'. It was claimed Ms Mordaunt had instead spent her time focusing on preparations for her leadership campaign. She also had to fight hard during the Tory leadership contest against criticism of her stance on trans issues, including her past claim that 'trans women are women'. Ms Mordaunt blasted critics trying to depict her as 'woke'. One suggestion at Westminster is the possibility of Ms Mordaunt teaming up with Mr Sunak as part of a joint ticket to replace Ms Truss. But plotters are said to be undecided on who would be PM out of the pair, if they were to front a 'government of all the talents' between them. Last week it was reported that Ms Mordaunt's allies reached out to Mr Sunak to be her chancellor, but were rebuffed. BEN WALLACE The 52-year-old is popular with Tory members following the Defence Secretary's efforts in leading Britain's military response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He is also being spoken of as a 'unity' candidate to bring the party back together, should Ms Truss depart. The former Army officer has routinely topped the polls among the Conservatives grassroots. But he did not enter this summer's leadership contest after 'careful consideration' and later backed Ms Truss. At this month's Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Mr Wallace admitted he was 'conflicted' about a possible leadership bid in the future. He told a fringe event: 'At this time of life, the idea was no. I mean do I rule it out? No. I don't rule it out, but will I be here in a few years' time? I don't know either.' Mr Wallace might be popular with Tory members, but would be less well-known to members of the public as he has only been a Cabinet minister since 2019. Tory MPs might also fear he is untested as he has never held one of the 'great offices of state' as Mrs May, Mr Johnson and Ms Truss all had before they entered No10. Mr Wallace has also been touted as a possible successor to NATO general secretary Jens Stoltenberg. Last night be repeated his desire to stay at defence, telling the Times: 'I want to be the Secretary of State for Defence until I finish. I love the job I do and we have more to do. I want the Prime Minister to be the Prime Minister and I want to do this job.' He added: 'I say to the colleagues who think our role is to feed the instability within the party, by proposing other people as leaders no matter who they are, (you) are doing a disservice. 'The markets are responding at the moment in the UK to unsurety about the Government. The best way to give those markets some confidence is for people to stop playing political parlour games.' SUELLA BRAVERMAN Suella Braverman was only in the Home Office for a matter of weeks but she spent most of it seemingly positioning herself for a tilt at another job - that of prime minister. The hardline Brexiteer was handed the top job as an acknowledgement of her popularity with the right of the party in the summer leadership contest, and for switching to Team Truss when she was knocked out. But during her tenure she made a series of outbursts that put her at odds with Liz Truss, raising suggestions she was positioning herself for the next leadership race. In a letter, Ms Braverman said she was resigning for breaching processes by sending an email from her personal account about a forthcoming ministerial statement on immigration. But in another hammer blow for the PM's chances of clinging on, she also complained that the government was breaking promises. She swiped that when people made 'mistakes' - something Ms Truss has admitted - the right thing to do was quit. They had a huge bust-up over visas policy last night. The 42-year-old mother-of two hit the headlines just yesterday with a rant against the 'tofu-eating wokerati' for effectively preventing police from arresting eco-zealots who have caused mayhem and misery during weeks of protest. She hit out at MPs who voted against tough new measures to strengthen police powers to deal with activists more quickly. Addressing the Commons as MPs debated the Public Order Bill, Mrs Braverman said: 'I'm afraid it's the Labour Party, it's the Lib Dems, it's the coalition of chaos, it's the Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati – dare I say, the anti-growth coalition – that we have to thank for the disruption we are seeing on our roads today.' Her comments came as police arrested two Just Stop Oil protesters who spent 36 hours suspended from the QEII bridge, closing a major transport link between Kent and Essex due to safety fears. At the Conservative Party conference a fortnight ago she also attacked the PM for U-turning over plans to axe the 45p top rate of income tax. She launched a swipe as the PM tried to regain her balance, branding the U-turn on axing the 45p tax rate 'disappointing' and accusing rebels of a 'coup'. She was also blamed recently for jeopardizing a free trade deal with India by accusing its people of being the worst at overstaying visas in the UK. JEREMY HUNT The 55-year-old was a shock appointment as the new Chancellor on Friday following Ms Truss's sacking of her ally Kwasi Kwarteng. He is now being referred to among some Tory MPs as the 'de facto PM' after he tore up what remained of Ms Truss's mini-Budget plans and outlined a completely new economic agenda. Mr Hunt is being talked up as a potential 'unity' candidate behind which the competing wings of the Conservative Party could rally behind, amid the current economic crisis. He is an experienced Cabinet minister and is the longest-serving Health Secretary in British political history following his spell in charge of the NHS between 2012 and 2018. Mr Hunt has also previously served as Foreign Secretary and Culture Secretary and would be seen as a safe pair of hands. There have been suggestions he could enter No10 as a 'caretaker' PM to steady the ship before another leader is elected. But Mr Hunt himself is distancing himself from talk about his leadership chances and has ruled out a tilt at the top job as he called on MPs to give Ms Truss 'a chance'. 'I rule it out, Mrs Hunt rules it out, three Hunt children rule it out,' he told Sky News. During this summer's Tory leadership contest, Mr Hunt was knocked out in the first round of voting by MPs when he attracted the support of just 18 colleagues. It is this recent demonstration of a paucity of support for Mr Hunt - who went on to support Mr Sunak against Ms Truss - among Conservative MPs that would count against him if he changed his mind. He was previously the runner-up to Mr Johnson in the 2019 Tory leadership election, in which he was roundly rejected by Tory members. Following his elimination from this summer's contest, Mr Hunt had appeared to admit his hopes of ever seizing the Tory crown were over. 'It's become obvious to me you only get one big shot at this, and I had mine in 2019.' he said at the time."
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11336479/British-Prime-Minister-Liz-Truss-QUITS-just-44-days.html,British Prime Minister Liz Truss QUITS after just 44 days: PM admits she cannot carry on after her disastrous tax plan created economic mayhem... as ousted leader Boris Johnson plans to run for re-election!,"British Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned today after just 44 days in office, sending the country's parliament into chaos and making it the laughing stock of the world. Truss only took over from former leader Boris Johnson on September 6 after winning an internal Conservative Party leadership contest. She quickly lost the faith of the party to such an extent that she was deemed unfit to lead last night in a wave of no confidence letters from colleagues. As a result, she announced her resignation today on the steps of 10 Downing Street. Her brief time in office is the shortest in modern political history. The British public have been left stunned and red-faced by the upheaval, with many now questioning who the next leader will be. Boris Johnson, who was himself forced to resign after losing the confidence of the party, is said to be mulling a return. Sources say he plans to throw his hat into the ring again for re-election. Whoever takes office will become the second unelected Prime Minister in less than two months. Truss assured on Thursday that the process would be completed within a week. President Biden, who met Truss as Prime Minister once, said: 'The United States and the United Kingdom are strong Allies and enduring friends — and that fact will never change. 'I thank Prime Minister Liz Truss for her partnership on a range of issues including holding Russia accountable for its war against Ukraine. 'We will continue our close cooperation with the U.K. government as we work together to meet the global challenges our nations face.' Truss's undoing was largely driven by a farfetched tax plan that sent the markets tumbling. Officials in the Biden administration and within the Federal Reserve are keeping 'close tabs' on whether a market crash like the one seen in the UK may be on the horizon here in the US. In the UK, The Bank of England was forced to buy bonds to ease panic in the markets after Truss revealed an economic growth plan that proposed widespread tax cuts, but gave no information about how she might pay for it elsewhere. The value of the pound against the dollar has steadily declined and today hit its lowest since 1985. The New York Times reports that officials remain confident the US will not be hit in the same way that the UK has. However they're keeping 'close tabs' on the markets here to anticipate any shockwaves. 'In the market, there is a lot of worry, and everyone is saying it feels like something is about to break,' Roberto Parli told the Times. Biden called Truss's proposed cuts 'a mistake' earlier this week before her departure. He said he 'wasn't the only one' who thought as much, in a sign that other world leaders felt the same. 'I wasn’t the only one that thought it was a mistake. I think that the idea of cutting taxes on the super-wealthy at a time when … I disagree with the policy, but it’s up to Britain to make that judgment, not me,' he said. White House Economic Adviser Cecilia Rouse said last week that the US was 'better positioned than most other countries for the Fed to achieve its goals.' Last month, US economists warned against similar tax cuts. 'While we often bemoan paying taxes, we all benefit from the infrastructure, services, and protection of our government. No one wants to pay more taxes, and we should be critical about how our money is spent, but the general thesis that less tax equates to economic growth is broadly disproven. 'The U.K.'s recent tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals without reducing spending seems predicated on that same trickle-down fallacy. It won’t work,' Austin Neudecker, Weave Growth, told The San Diego Tribune. She had promised an unprecedented period of growth to revive the economy, but the pound sank as economists questioned how she would pay for it. Biden, who met Truss once on September 21, is yet to comment. A series of previously-loyal MPs joined calls for her to go this morning. Even supportive Cabinet ministers had been conceding the situation is 'terminal'. Events accelerated after another bout of madness at Westminster yesterday culminated in stories of tears and tantrums in Parliament, with Ms Truss allegedly engaging in a shouting match with her own enforcers. Truss's resignation on Thursday came after a wave of resignations from senior ministers throughout the week. Suella Braverman resigned as Home Secretary, admitting using of her personal email to campaign against the government's own immigration policy. She also hit out at Truss for ditching key policies, suggesting she should also quit for 'mistakes', in her departure. Last night Conservative MPs were confident that between 50 and 100 letters of no confidence had been submitted to Sir Graham, despite current rules stating the committee cannot hold a vote of confidence in Liz Truss for a year after her appointment. And in another hit for the PM, Tory MP William Wragg confirmed within the House of Commons that he was one of those who has submitted a letter. There are now at least 14 Tory MPs on the record who have said Truss can't continue. Recent polling shows Truss has lower approval ratings than both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn at any time during their time as leader of their parties. After the government declared yesterday morning that the vote on banning fracking was an issue of confidence and all Conservative MPs had to vote against the motion, raucous scenes ensued after Climate Minister Graham Stuart at the last minute told the Commons it was not a confidence motion after all. Deputy chief whip Craig Whittaker had written to Conservatives telling them it is a '100 per cent hard 3 line whip!' 'We cannot, under any circumstances, let the Labour Party take control of the order paper and put through their own legislation and whatever other bits of legislation they desire,' he said. 'We are voting NO and I reiterate, this is a hard 3 line whip with all slips withdrawn.' The last-minute withdrawal of this caused Chief Whip Wendy Morton to storm out of the Chamber, before reportedly publicly declaring 'I am no longer the Chief Whip' while standing just a meter away from the PM. While Tory MPs were originally telling reporters that both the Chief Whip and her Deputy, Craig Whittaker, had quit their roles and handed in resignation letters, confusion soon intensified after it was reported Liz Truss followed Ms Morton and pulled her into an intense meeting to prevent her quitting. Mr Whittaker reportedly declared as he walked out of the division lobby: 'I am f***ing furious and I don't give a f*** any more.' For several hours, no-one from the government could confirm or deny the claims that both the top whips had resigned. When pressed on issue, Business Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said he was 'not clear' what the 'situation' with the whips was. By 9pm, Ms Coffey was telling reporters outside the Carlton Club - where with exquisite timing the entire Cabinet was due to attend a dinner for the centenary of the agreement that sunk Lloyd George's government - that Ms Morton had won a 'great victory' by defeating the Labour motion. No10 confirmed at 9.49pm that the pair were indeed remaining in post. The Carlton Club bash was originally due to be black tie, but was downgraded to avoid pix of the Cabinet looking too decadent on day huge inflation figures were unveiled. 'If only that was our biggest problem,' said one source. There were extraordinary scenes within Westminster as Tory MPs were left in chaos after the apparent U-turn on the 'confidence' vote, leaving them unsure whether they could now abstain or vote against without losing the whip. Multiple MPs claim they witnessed shouting and screaming amongst Conservative MPs and senior ministers, while the senior members of the whip's office were nowhere to be seen. The barely believable scenes in the division lobbies - captured on camera by Labour MP Chris Bryant in defiance of Commons rules - were the latest evidence of the wheels falling off Truss's administration. Labour had tabled a motion trying to ban fresh drilling and Tory whips told backbenchers it was a 'confidence motion' that could in theory bring down Truss. They threatened to kick rebels out the party if they did not vote with the Government. No Tories voted against the government but 40 abstained - including Kwasi Kwarteng, who was chancellor until last week. Commons records show Truss abstained, although there are now claims that is a mistake and she did vote with the government. Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg said: 'Late in the day, a junior official at 10 Downing Street sent a message through to the front bench that it was not a vote of confidence and nobody else was aware of that. 'The whips were not aware of that, I was not aware of that and most members thought that it was a vote of confidence. It was simply one of those unfortunate miscommunications that occasionally happens. Labour MPs reported screaming and shouting and Tory MPs being dragged in to vote with the Government. Speaking in the chamber afterwards, former minister Chris Bryant said: 'I would urge you to launch an investigation into the scenes outside the entrance to the no lobby earlier. 'As you know, members are expected to be able to vote without fear or favor and the behavior code which is agreed by the whole of the House says there shall never be bullying or harassment. 'I saw members being physically manhandled into another lobby and being bullied. If we want to stand up against bullying in this House of our staff, we have to stop bullying in this chamber as well.' Later on Sky he directly accused Deputy PM Therese Coffey and Mr Rees-Mogg of manhandling MP Alex Stafford into the voting lobby, though he described it as a 'heated exchange'. But Stafford later commented on Twitter that 'no-one pushes me around' in a denial of Labour's version of events. Nevertheless, dozens of opposition MPs shared their own eyewitness accounts on social media during and shortly after the voting period which appeared to back up the allegations, including government whips 'screaming', Therese Coffey 'practically picking up' another MP to walk them through the 'No' lobby, and multiple MPs in tears. Shadow minister Anna McMorrin wrote on Twitter that she witnessed an MP 'in tears' in the lobby. A Tory MP who witnessed the height of the chaos said: 'I was waiting for the votes and then Craig Whittaker came out crying and saying he's sick of everything. Then Wendy came out stony faced. The other whips say they have quit. It was absolute carnage.' Truss eventually won the vote by 326 to 230 but among the chaos Chief Whip Wendy Morton also abstained. One miserable Cabinet source told MailOnline: 'At this rate I'm going to be PM by Christmas. The writing was on the wall for Wendy since the day of her appointment.' Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg said he was 'not entirely clear what the situation is with the chief whip'. Conservative MP Sir Charles Walker, MP for Broxbourne since 2005, told the BBC: 'This whole affair is inexcusable. It is a pitiful reflection on the Conservative Party.' When asked whether there is a way back for the government, Walker said: 'I don't think so.' He added: 'This is an absolute disgrace. 'I think it's a shambles and a disgrace. I think it is utterly appalling. I am livid. 'I hope all those people who put Liz Truss in No.10 I hope it was worth it. [...] Because the damage they have done to our party is extraordinary.' 'I've had enough. I've had enough of talentless people putting their tick in the right box, not because it's in the national interest, but because it's in their personal interest.' Later he added: 'I expect the prime minister to resign very soon because she's not up to her job.' Hours earlier Home Secretary Suella Braverman was forced to resign yesterday, ostensibly for breaching protocol by sending an email from her personal account to a contact revealing details of an announcement on immigration policy. Downing Street said Mrs Braverman, the shortest serving Home Secretary of modern times, had resigned after sending a confidential document to a Tory MP in breach of the ministerial code. But multiple sources said her departure followed a 'fiery' 90-minute meeting between her and Miss Truss in No 10 the previous night at which the Home Secretary warned the PM it would be 'insane' to relax immigration rules in order to boost economic growth. In an explosive resignation letter last night Mrs Braverman suggested that the PM should quit and savaged her record. 'It is obvious to everyone that we are going through a tumultuous time,' she wrote. 'I have concerns about the direction of this Government. Not only have we broken key pledges that were promised to our voters, but I have had serious concerns about this Government's commitment to honouring manifesto commitments, such as reducing overall migration numbers.' She swiped that when people made 'mistakes' - something Ms Truss has admitted - the right thing to do was quit. Ms Truss responded with a much briefer letter saying it is 'important the Ministerial Code is upheld' and quickly installed Grant Shapps - previously a strident critic and Rishi Sunak supporter - as a replacement. On Monday of this week, Mr Shapps publicly said that if Ms Truss were to save her premiership, she would need to 'thread the eye of a needle with the lights off'. Ms Braverman was under pressure to sign off a plan to liberalise migration rules to help boost the economy, as part of Ms Truss's drive for growth. The former minister appears to have sent an email with details of the proposed policy to a parliamentary staffer, with speculation she could have been trying to sabotage it. One Tory MP close to Ms Braverman told MailOnline of the security breach: 'It's the kind of thing that you give a wrap on the knuckles and carry on - unless you want to get rid of someone.' The MP said Ms Braverman 'wasn't happy over their stance on immigration', and also warned more resignations could be imminent. 'I get the impression we're going to get an avalanche.' Mr Shapps did not offer any solace to Ms Truss as he spoke outside the Home Office late on Thursday, stressing his duty is to keep the country secure. 'It's been a turbulent time for the government. The most important thing is for the people of the country to know that they have got security.' MPs yesterday described the Cabinet as a 'caretaker' government, and many do not believe that Ms Truss can even survive until the Halloween Budget regardless of divisions over who should take over. After another difficult PMQs, during which she stunned the house by performing yet another u-turn in announcing she was committed to the pensions triple lock, Ms Truss abruptly cancelled a visit to an aerospace firm earlier without giving a reason beyond 'government business'. She is now facing Tory mutiny on a bewildering range of issues. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt addressed the Conservative 1922 committee last night, and is said to have quipped, 'this sh** would be interesting if I wasn't in the middle of it' - a quote from Barack Obama. Northern Ireland Secretary Steve Baker was sent out on TV to insist Ms Braverman was not attacking the premier, and would still be Home Secretary if not for the security issue. He said he hoped that she would be brought back into government in the New Year. Ms Braverman has repeatedly been embroiled in controversy since taking over at the Home Office. At the Tory conference she complained about the 45p tax rate being kept, and said she wanted Britain to leave the European Convention on Human Rights. She has also suggested that rules on visas for Indian nationals should not be relaxed, seemingly torpedoing a mooted trade deal. Earlier this week she attacked the 'tofu-eating wokerati' for effectively preventing police from arresting eco-zealots who have caused mayhem and misery during weeks of protest. The PM's press secretary shrugged off the latest intervention this afternoon, saying Ms Braverman had a 'way with words'. In front of a gloomy Tory rank-and-file in the Commons during yesterday's PMQs, a clearly-rattled Ms Truss admitted she was 'sorry' and had 'made mistakes'. But despite Keir Starmer joking that she will be 'out by Christmas' after her 'fantasy economics ended in disaster', Ms Truss insisted she will not resign. 'I am a fighter not a quitter,' she said, echoing a famous line from Labour's Peter Mandelson. The clashes came as inflation surged back into double-digits with food prices heaping more pain on hard-pressed Britons. The government had been hinting that pensioners faced real-terms cuts as part of a desperate £40billion spending squeeze - but Ms Truss tried to kill off the issue by declaring she will stick to the triple lock. 'I am completely committed to it, so is the Chancellor,' she said as Jeremy Hunt watched from beside her on the the green benches. However, she pointedly stopped short of making the same promise on uprating benefits, another area where Tories are threatening to revolt. Steve Double warned she could only have 'days' left as he called her position 'untenable', while William Wragg said he had sent a letter of no-confidence to the 1922 committee chief Graham Brady. Sir Graham is believed to have informed the premier that more than 50 Tories have privately sent him no-confidence letters. Ms Truss told MPs: 'I have been very clear that I am sorry and that I have made mistakes.' Amid shouts of 'resign', she added: 'The right thing to do in those circumstances is to make changes, which I have made, and to get on with the job and deliver for the British people.' Former Cabinet minister Sajid Javid had been slated to ask a question at PMQs, but apparently pulled out at the last minute. As the session began reports emerged that Ms Truss's senior aide Jason Stein has been suspended pending an investigating into briefing. There was a vicious barb at Mr Javid over the weekend claiming he was not offered the Chancellor job because the PM regarded him as 'sh**'. The PM's press secretary said this afternoon: 'I am not going to get into individual staffing matters but the Prime Minister has made very clear to her team that some of the sort of briefings that we have seen are completely unacceptable about parliamentary colleagues and they must stop.' The cost-of-living crisis is the stark backdrop for a crisis at Westminster as Ms Truss desperately battles to cling on after being forced to sack ally Kwasi Kwarteng and ditch the disastrous mini-Budget that triggered havoc on markets - before any of last night's chaos came into play. PMQs was only Ms Truss's third since entering No10 and came just a week after she insisted there would 'absolutely not' be spending cuts. Mr Hunt - who has been branded the 'de facto PM' - now says cuts will be 'eye-watering'. An honorable departure, an undignified sacking by her own party ... or just limping on towards a general election hammering: The options facing Liz Truss as Tory calls for her to step down grow amid deepening chaos The chaos surrounding Liz Truss today has at its heart one seemingly straightforward question: what does the Conservative Party do with her? The Tories have two equally basic answers to that question: they either find a way to get rid or her or step back and keep her in power, however unpalatable that seems. But it is there than any sort of simplicity disappears. Ms Truss yesterday vowed that she is a 'fighter, not a quitter' and suggested she wants to fight on to the next election. But with calls for her to quit as Tory leader mounting, this feels increasingly unlikely, if not totally impossible. This means that she must either a) be convinced to change her mind and leave No10 in a dignified manner or b) have the decision of whether or not to go taken out of her hands and be humiliatingly booted out. Tory MPs today emerged to plead with the PM to take the first course and spare herself and the party more damage, as they reel from truly appalling poll figures that show Labour on course for a landslide election win. Devon MP Gary Streeter said: 'Sadly, it seems we must change leader BUT even if the (arch angel) Gabriel now takes over, the parliamentary party has to urgently rediscover discipline, mutual respect and teamwork if we are to (i) govern the UK well and (ii) avoid slaughter at the next election,' And Hendon MP Matthew Offord said Liz Truss needed to agree on a 'dignified exit', telling the Evening Standard: 'She does need to sit down and discuss it with her Cabinet and with others to manage some kind of dignified exit.' Any resignation would be as leader of the Conservative Party. Ms Truss would remain PM until a successor - permanent or a caretaker - was appointed by the party. They would then take power in No10. Here we look at the possible scenarios that could emerge in the next few hours, days or, improbably, weeks. A DIGNIFIED RESIGNATION The calmest way for the current chaos to end would be with a dignified resignation by the Prime Minister. This could be done after a visit by the 'men in grey suits' - the executive of the backbench 1922 Committee. Led by chairman Sir Graham Brady. They go to see the PM and tell her she no longer enjoys the confidence of her MPs, the parliamentary Tory Party. The '22 is currently in a bit of a bind. Any new leader is safe from a no confidence vote in their first 12 months in power under rules designed to provide some stability. But Sir Graham, if he feels that the level of opposition is so high that she would lose a hypothetical vote, could lead a delegation to inform her of this and make an appeal to her honour. He could also make a veiled threat - given the level of opposition her only other option is to be embarrassingly removed by her own side. It is possible that she listens and agrees to resign. But if not... THE RULES ARE CHANGED With the PM refusing to walk out in a dignified way, the 1922 Committee can vote to change its rules and allow a vote of no confidence in the PM before 12 months are up. To trigger a vote, 15 per cent of Tory MPs have to submit letters of no confidence in her leadership of the party - which is currently 54 MPs. Rumours have suggested that more than 100 MPs have already submitted letters, but the only person who actually knows the tally is Sir Graham, who does not reveal it. Ms Truss could still resign if a vote is triggered, without waiting to see if she is deposed. But if she does lose the vote - which seems almost certain currently - she would effectively be sacked as Conservative leader, leaving MPs to decide on a replacement. In the unlikely event that she wins the vote, she has a fresh mandate to govern, albeit a slim one, from her MPs. But it could harm the party even more in the polls, with the public so against her and her polities. MINISTERIAL RESIGNATIONS Another option open to the Tories is mass ministerial walkouts. This is how Boris Johnson was eventually forced from power, after he survived a vote of confidence. Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak resigned from the Cabinet, prompting more than 50 colleagues to follow suite. While he was able to cobble together a replacement Government his authority was totally undermined and eventually it was the straw that broke the camel's back and he agreed to resign a short time later. Several ministers have already been linked with resignations, including Education Secretary Kit Malthouse and International Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch. Both deny any such plans. But a walkout by a large chunk of ministers, especially if they come from both the moderate and right wings of the party, could prove terminal. TRUSS STAGGERS ON Improbable as it seems it is still possible for the PM to remain in power. No 10 defiantly insisted she wants to fight the next election, due in 2024. There is still no agreement on a successor who can unite the disparate factions in the party and this could a real problem. MPs are keen to avoid a lengthy leadership election that leaves a power vacuum and exposes the party to another public show of infighting, after the bitter summer campaign between Ms Truss and Rishi Sunak. Mr Sunak has been mooted as a replacement, but is disliked by the party right and the Boris Johnson faction. Other names linked with a tilt include fellow summer candidate Penny Mordaunt, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and even Grant Shapps, who has been Home secretary since yesterday. Conservative peer Lord Ed Vaizey said 'the only way out of this mess' is for Liz Truss to stand down and for somebody to be appointed as prime minister by Conservative MPs. 'That is still fraught with problems,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.' He said it is clear from Suella Braverman's resignation letter that she regards herself as a credible candidate to be prime minister. 'And in terms of kind of shocking self-belief there will be at least five or six people out there who genuinely believe they could be the next prime minister. 'So if the Tory Party cannot have a degree of self-knowledge and realise that the only way forward is to appoint someone they're pretty much sunk,' he said. If the party cannot agree on a unity candidate they and the country could be left with a lame duck PM until they do. Downing Street has denied that there is any change to Liz Truss's plan to stay in No 10 beyond the fiscal plan on October 31. Asked the question, the Prime Minister's official spokesman told reporters: 'No plans for any change. The Prime Minister will continue beyond the 31st'."
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11335981/Cold-War-nuclear-bunker-accessed-14ft-shaft-hits-market-25-000.html,"Time to PUTIN an offer! Cold War nuclear bunker accessed by 14ft shaft and kitted out with gas masks and body bags hits the market for £25,000","A Cold War nuclear bunker, kitted out with gas masks, body bags and a red box telephone in case of a much-feared attack from Russia, has gone on sale for £25,000. The Royal Observer Corps monitoring post in Louth, Lincolnshire was bought off eBay on a whim nearly 20 years ago. But despite growing fears of a nuclear war at the hands of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, its owner has now decided to sell it. Mark Colledge, 64, purchased the underground vault, which lies beneath a field between the A16 London Road and Kenwick Hill and can only be accessed down a 14ft shaft, after seeing it on online for the bargain price of £12,500 in 2003. The army veteran said: 'It was built the year I was born and I think I bought it due to a bit of a midlife crisis. I thought ""that's cool"" and decided I wanted it. 'I keep a caravan close by and have been using it as a kind of holiday home. I sleep in the bunker, and shower in the caravan. 'I am selling because it seems to be a good time given the global crisis, and I haven't been there in years. I'd like some cash to go on holiday. 'I have body bags in there and some gas masks. That goes back to my army training and what to do in an attack. 'There's a bed and sleeping bag but that's pretty much it. 'There's also a red box telephone so in the event of a nuclear attack, that's the only phone that will work - not that there'll be many phones left to call. 'It has solar and wind power too.' The tiny vault, which fits three people, was built in 1959 in response to the increasing threat of nuclear attack in the 1950s. In the event of a nuclear attack three observers would have taken shelter in the hold and reported on the fallout. The observers had sufficient food and water to last for two weeks as well as landline telephones and radio communication. The bunker near Louth is identical to more than 1,500 built around the UK from the late 1950s onwards. And they didn't come cheap, costing as much as an average terrace house to build. Soldiers stopped using the hideaways for weekly training after the collapse of the Soviet Union and they were decommissioned in 1991, with the remaining underground posts closed at the end of September that year. Only 258 of the war dens still exist. Mark, of Saltburn-by-the-sea, added: 'When I bought it, I think it was a male menopause type of thing, like buying a new car. 'I would just be happy to get my money back.' Jim Demitriou, national valuer at SDL Property Auctions, said: 'It's a great property for people looking for something off grid or to get away from it all. 'It's a piece of British history so it could be nice for someone interested in historic places. 'I would advise buyers to speak with planning permission or their local council to see what they can do with it. 'We've had about four or five people enquire about it already, before it was on our site. We're anticipating a flurry of interest in the bunker. 'I'm really excited about this property. I've never sold a nuclear bunker before. The guide price is £25,000 but may the best bidder win.' The property will be auctioned on November 24 with SDL Property Auctions. The idea of a nuclear attack on the West used to be the stuff of dystopian science fiction - but it is a hellish vision that Vladimir Putin has repeatedly invoked as his war in Ukraine falls apart. While most experts agree that an atomic attack on Paris, London, New York or Washington DC is still highly unlikely, it cannot be discounted. President Biden has personally warned that the world is now closer to 'Armageddon' than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis. It is not a reality any of us relish contemplating, but as we stare down the barrel of a new nuclear crisis between east and west it begs the question: What would actually happen if Russian nukes hit a major city? Dr Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute, said: 'The first thing you'll get is a fireball that will vaporise everything inside of it. That's going to travel just over half a mile from the centre of the blast.' If dropped on Westminster, that would mean the Houses of Parliament, Downing Street, St Thomas's Hospital and Westminster Abbey being completely obliterated with a 100 per cent kill rate for anyone inside at the time. Targeting New York's financial district would reduce One World Trade and the western end of the Brooklyn Bridge to ash. A blast above the White House would obliterate everything four blocks in all directions from Pennsylvania Avenue. Targeting Paris's Elysee Palace would vaporise Place de la Concorde and most of the Champs Elysees. 'Then you'll have shockwave that is going to severely damage even really heavily built concrete buildings out to just over a mile from the blast, with everyone in that radius crushed to death', Dr Lewis added. For London, that would mean Buckingham Palace being flattened, along with Victoria and Waterloo stations - two of the city's busiest. The whole of Soho, half of Mayfair, The Oval cricket ground, virtually everything from Chelsea Bridge to Blackfriars, would be history. 'That blast wave will keep rolling - it will drop off severely, but it will keep going - destroying buildings and causing casualties out until about two and a half miles,' Dr Lewis said. In London, that encompasses the Tower of London and Battersea Power station. Most of Hyde Park, half of Regent's Park, Chelsea, Knightsbridge and Belgravia. The damage would span from Camden to Brixton. Everyone within that radius would also be given an extremely high dose of radiation. For many people it would prove fatal, but even among survivors up to 15 per cent would likely die later of cancer linked to the blast. Dr Lewis adds: 'Radiation poisoning is just a really cruel, miserable way to die. The immediate effects are vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea - people can rally and seem much better, perhaps for hours or days - but then the symptoms return and get much worse.'"
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11337825/Iran-appalled-devastation-caused-kamikaze-drones-claims-Tory-peer.html,"‘Honourable’ Iran would be ‘appalled’ to see the devastation caused by its kamikaze drones, claims Tory peer","Defence minister Baroness Goldie has said she thinks Iran would be 'appalled' to see the devastation caused by kamikaze drones in Ukraine it supplied to Russia. The Tory peer told The House of Lords Iran was a country of 'honourable traditions' that takes 'pride in its international position'. She said Iran may reconsider providing such weapons to Russia to use in its invasion. Lady Goldie said: 'I have to say that Iran may be a problematic country in many respects, but historically it's actually a country of honourable traditions and I think pride in its international position. 'And I'd have thought it was appalled at seeing the footage of what these drones were achieving and delivering for innocent citizens of Ukraine and I'd have thought that might want to make Iran consider just where it is in this. When asked what the UK might do to try and persuade Iran to end its military support for Russia, she told peers that 'severe sanctions' are already in place. She said: 'I would remind members that sanctions, and severe sanctions, have been applied both by the UK and by the UN against Iran. 'And we continue to review how it is and how we can persuade Iran to reconsider what it's doing.' The drones being dispatched in Ukraine, including in Kyiv this week, are known as single-use or kamikaze drones because they are not intended to survive their mission. According to the US, Russia took delivery of 1,000 drones from Iran at the end of August. Iran has denied exporting any weapons for use in Ukraine, but Volodymyr Zelensky's government has still ejected Iran's ambassador from the country. The weapons rained down on the Ukrainian capital in successive waves of 28 drones earlier this week, according to Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko. Five smashed into the capital itself while 13 or more were shot down in the wider Kyiv region, all of them as they flew in from the south, said a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, Yurii Ihnat. One strike appeared to target the city's heating network, hitting an operations centre while another slammed into a four-story residential building, ripping a large hole in it and collapsing at least three apartments on top of each other, killing three. The Shaheds, which Russia has rebranded as Geran-2 drones, pack an explosive charge and be fired one after the other. With a range of more than 600 miles, the explosive-laden drones can 'loiter' above potential targets for hours before being slammed directly into enemy soldiers, vehicles or buildings from above - causing an explosion. They are particularly devastating due to the psychological impact on residents, spreading fear and disrupting daily activity. Meanwhile, Iran has also been in the news over ongoing protests in Iran by women and girls, who are risking their lives to fight the harsh regime. Protests were triggered over attempts to re-impose strict hijab rules, as well as the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman killed in police custody after being arrested for wearing her hijab incorrectly."
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11337905/Biden-says-worried-Republicans-cutting-funding-Ukraine.html,Biden says he IS worried about Republicans cutting funding for Ukraine if they take the majority - as he stops for a Primanti's sandwich with Fetterman and Congress considers sneaking in a $50billion package before January,"President Joe Biden expressed concerns Thursday afternoon that Republicans would cut funding for Ukraine's war effort if they take the majority after the November midterms. 'Yeah, I am worried about that, because they said they'll cut it,' he told reporters who accompanied him inside a Primanti Brothers sandwich shop en route back to the airport in Pittsburgh, after he gave an address on infrastructure near the site of the nearly completed Fern Hollow Bridge. Biden's comments came as NBC News reported Thursday that lawmakers from both parties have discussed adding $50 billion in Ukraine funding to an omnibus spending bill that they'd pass before a new Congress is sworn-in in January. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who is poised to become speaker should Democrats lose control in the House, has warned Republicans are 'not going to write a blank check to Ukraine.' Biden made the stop alongside Pennsylvania's Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the Democratic Senate hopeful who is locked in a tight race against Republican, Dr. Mehmet Oz. Primanti's sandwiches are a Pittsburgh staple, served with a layer of coleslaw and French fries stuffed between giant pieces of bread. Biden ordered the 'Pitts-burger' - beef patty, lettuce, tomato, slaw and fries - and tipped $40, the White House said. At the restaurant stop Biden said he felt 'good' about the forthcoming election, which historically could see his party lose both chambers of Congress. While retaining the House would be more difficult, Biden said he believed Democrats could hold onto the Senate. 'I think so. It ain't over 'til it's over,' the president expressed. Fetterman is the Democrat most likely to flip a Republican-held Senate seat, as Pennsylvania's GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is retiring. But other Democratic seats are in danger, especially in the swing states of Georgia and Nevada. Asked if he planned to travel to those locations - to boost Democratic incumbents, Sens. Raphael Warnock and Catherine Cortez Masto, respectively, Biden answered: 'I've got about 16 to 18 requests.' 'We're trying to work it out now,' Biden said. Earlier, he clapped back when a reporter pointed out that not many candidates have appeared with him in the run-up to the November 8 midterms. 'That's not true, there have been 15. Count, kid, count,' Biden said Thursday morning, before boarding Marine One. He also said he planned to hold more campaign events with Democrats in the next three weeks. When asked for specifics, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre remained tight lipped on board Air Force One Thursday. 'I don't have any travel to preview for you at this time,' she said. At Primanti's, where the president went in to get take-out, he motioned to diners when asked if his economic message was resonating with voters. 'Well, we'll find out. You'll have to ask these folks right here,' Biden said. One diner piped up, 'Don't ask us!' He also affirmed that he'd be able to work with Republicans if they took over Congress. 'I've always been able to do that,' the president said. 'I got a lot of bipartisan stuff passed you guys never thought I never could have passed.' As the president left one diner asked the reporters in the room, 'Why didn't you ask about the border.' 'All these guys want to do is eat their lunch,' Biden said, putting his hand on one male diner's shoulder as he exited the establishment. Biden then headed Philadelphia to hold a closed door fundraiser for Fetterman instead of a rally, where some reporters will be allowed in, but cameras won't be permitted."
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11336119/Russian-aircraft-fired-MISSILE-near-British-plane-Black-Sea.html,"15ft from disaster: Russian jets 'recklessly' buzzed NATO aircraft, it emerges after Ben Wallace reveals Putin warplane fired a MISSILE near RAF patrol above the Black Sea","Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has accused Russia of using its jets 'recklessly' after one of Putin's fighters went within 15 feet of a Nato aircraft. Mr Wallace also revealed that a fighter jet accidentally fired a missile 'in the vicinity' of an RAF patrol above the Black Sea. Speaking to the Commons, he said Russia was using its fighters in a 'reckless' and 'unnecessary' way, which includes flying 'very, very' close to Nato aircraft. 'In one event I was aware of, a Russian fighter went within 15 feet of a Nato aircraft,' he said. Mr Wallace said two Russian Su-27 fighters had 'interacted' with an RAF RC-135 Rivet Joint spy plane on patrol above international waters to the south of Crimea on September 29 when one of them 'released a missile'. Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, blamed the incident on a technical malfunction and Britain does not believe it was a deliberate attempt to escalate, Mr Wallace added. But it will do little to ease fears that the war in Ukraine could spiral into World War Three. Detailing what happened between the Russian fighter and the UK plane, Mr Wallace said: 'I would also like to share with the House details of a recent incident which occurred in international airspace over the Black Sea. 'On September 29 an unarmed RAF RC-135 Rivet Joint, a civilian-style aircraft on routine patrol over the Black Sea was interacted with by two Russian armed Su-27 fighter aircraft. 'It is not unusual for aircraft to be shadowed and this day was no different. 'During that interaction however, it transpired that one of the Su-27 aircraft released a missile in the vicinity of the RAF Rivet Joint beyond visual range. 'The total time of the interaction between the Russian aircraft and the Rivet Joint was approximately 90 minutes. 'The patrol completed and the aircraft returned to base.' Mr Wallace told MPs Russia blamed the missile release on a 'technical malfunction'. 'The patrol completed and the aircraft returned to its base,' he said. 'In light of this potentially dangerous engagement, I have communicated my concerns directly to my Russian counterpart, defence minister (Sergei) Shoigu, and the chief of defence staff in Moscow.' He added: 'In my letter I made clear the aircraft was unarmed, in international airspace, and following a pre-notified flight path. 'I felt it was prudent to suspend these patrols until a response was received by the Russian state. 'The reply by the Russian minister of defence on October 10 stated they have conducted an investigation into the circumstances of the incident and stated it was a technical malfunction of the Su-27 fighter. 'They also acknowledge that the incident took place in international airspace.' Mr Wallace concluded his report by telling the Commons: 'The UK Ministry of Defence has shared this information with allies and, after consultation, I have restarted routine patrols, but this time escorted by fighter aircraft. 'Everything we do is calibrated with regard to ongoing conflict in the region and in accordance with international law. 'We welcome Russia's acknowledgement this was in international airspace, and the UK has conducted regular sorties with the RAF Rivet Joint in international airspace over the Black Sea since 2019 and we will continue to do so.' The Defence Secretary suggested the Black Sea incident shows the Russian military are 'not beyond' deciding 'the rules don't apply to them'. He also asked the public to have faith in the UK's attempt to 'walk that sometimes tightrope' when responding to Russian aggression. He added: 'Calibration is incredibly important to me. We are dealing with the president and indeed a Russian forces who, as we have seen from the Rivet Joint incident, are not beyond making the wrong calculation or indeed deciding that the rules don't apply to them. 'And that is why for those constituents of ours who will be fearful that this support could lead somewhere, I ask them to have faith in us, and indeed all of us in this chamber, that we do work this very detailed response to try and make sure we walk that sometimes tightrope, and make sure it is in the right place to do it.' Labour MP Luke Pollard thanked Mr Wallace for his 'calmness and professionalism' amid 'much Government chaos'. The shadow defence minister described the Russian fighter jet incident as 'serious', and welcomed the fact that RAF flights have restarted. 'The RAF have this House's full support and we are grateful to them, to other UK forces, and our Nato allies in their work protecting the alliance and protecting freedom,' he said. 'This incident also acts as a serious reminder about the importance of avoiding escalation and miscalculation while continuing the UK's united support for Ukraine.' He added: '(Vladimir) Putin needs to be in no doubt that our resolve will continue and, whether it's his (Mr Wallace's) party or my party that's in charge, that will not change.' He also asked about the Government's position on defence spending, saying: 'Last night the Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, threw into doubt the planned rise to 3 per cent of GDP on defence spending when in a speech he referred to it as a potential increase.' Top speed: 1,550mph Length: 72ft Wing span: 48ft Range: 2,193 miles Cost: £27million Crew: 1 Weapons: 30mm gun with 150 rounds, range of missiles, rockets and bombs mounted externally on ten hardpoints Top Speed: 540mph Length: 135ft Wing span: 131ft Range: 3,900 miles Cost: Around £200million Crew: Up to 30 Task: Reconnaissance aircraft"
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11335761/Shetland-completely-cut-mainland-phones-internet-computers-hit-blackout.html,"Shetland is completely cut off from the mainland as phones, internet and computers are hit by blackout after subsea cable is cut - weeks after mystery underwater Nord Stream explosion","Communications in Shetland have been completely shut down with phones, internet and computers in a total blackout after the south subsea cable between the islands and the mainland was cut. Police have declared a major incident and are patrolling to try and reassure residents, telling them they still may be able to call 999 in an emergency even without signal. People are being warned not to try and make non urgent calls and to check on elderly or vulnerable neighbours as assistance alarms may not be working. Repairs to another cable connecting Shetland and Faroe are ongoing after it was damaged last week. Engineers are working to restore services or divert them by other routes as the cause of today's blackout is yet to be confirmed, with extra resources being sent to Shetland as Police Scotland tries to ensure the public can access emergency services. This comes after a top military man warned in January that Russian sabotage could wreck undersea cables that supply our internet and $10 trillion of financial deals a day. Then just weeks ago senior politicians, defence chiefs and experts warned Europe's critical infrastructure is now at risk after the Nord Stream gas pipes were blown up in an attack widely thought to have been orchestrated by Russia. The MP for Orkney and Shetlands, Alastair Carmichael, told Mailonline: 'We don't know the cause yet. These things have happened in the past with catastrophic effect. 'It is not unknown and usually it is because a trawler picks up the line on the seabed and pulls it up and breaks it. 'That has been known to happen in the past but at the moment they are pretty well focussed on finding out exactly where it is broken and getting whatever you need to do to get it fixed.' While he said the priority was fixing the issue, that resilience would also need to be looked at in future. 'That is kind of the order of things,' Mr Carmichael said. 'Get it fixed, find out how it broke and then think about what you need to do to make sure it doesn't happen again in the future.' Asked if the damage could have been caused by the Russians in retaliation for the UK's support for Ukraine during the country's war with Putin's army, Mr Carmichael said that had not been ruled out and was very much on people's minds. Mr Carmichael added that it was too early to say with any certainty what was behind the damage and that Russian interference could not be ruled out. He said: 'You're not the first person to ask me that. I have no reason to believe that is the case and as I say we have known this kind of thing to happen before. 'But until you know anything I guess is possible.' Northern Police said in a tweet about the Shetland outage today: 'Engineers are working to fix a complete outage on Shetland affecting its connection to the main line. 'Phones, internet and computers are not usable. 'Officers will continue to patrol the area and we will give you an update on the situation as soon as we have more information.' A BT Group spokesperson said: 'Due to a break in a third-party subsea cable connecting Shetland with the Scottish mainland, some phone, broadband and mobile services are affected. 'Engineers are working to divert services via other routes as soon as possible and we'll provide further updates. 'Our external subsea provider is also looking to restore their link quickly. 'Anyone who needs to call 999 should try their landline or their mobile, even if they don't have signal from their own mobile provider. We're sorry for any inconvenience.' People have been tweeting about the incident as minimal WiFi appears to be functioning. One said: 'I messaged my dad and no reply, obviously.' She added: 'Guess I won't be speaking to my parents then.' Another wrote: 'No internet. No mobiles. Limited landline phone, sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. Shop down the road only accepting cash.' One said he was having to reschedule meetings and described the implications of the outage given the scale of it as 'pretty scary'. Shetland, also known as the Shetland Islands, lie 105 miles north of the Scottish mainland. The total area is just 550 square miles and, in 2019, the population totalled 22,920. The local authority, Shetland Islands Council, is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland and the islands' administrative centre is Lerwick - which has been the capital of Shetland since 1708. The islands were initially dominated by Scandinavian influences, especially from Norway, and they later became part of Scotland in the 15th century. Scotland became part of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 which caused a decrease in trade with northern Europe. Fishing continues to be an important aspect of the economy up to the present day. The discovery of North Sea oil in the 1970s significantly boosted Shetland's economy, employment and public sector revenues. There are also numerous areas set aside to protect the local fauna and flora, including a number of important sea bird nesting sites. The Shetland pony and Shetland Sheepdog are two well-known animal breeds that originated on the islands. Police Scotland is currently in talks with partners including the Scottish Fire and Recue Service and HM Coastguard to bring additional emergency support to the island. Ch Insp Jane Mackenzie told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that police officers would be more visible on the island in the meantime. Officers are patrolling both in vehicles and on foot, Police Scotland confirmed. Ch Insp Mackenzie said: 'We're still trying to work to establish the full extent of the problem - we know there are some telephone lines working, 999 lines are believed to be working and some mobile networks are still working. 'So anyone calling 999 should be able to do so from a mobile phone. What we would ask is if you have an emergency you should first try a landline or mobile to call 999. 'If that doesn't work, you should flag down an emergency service vehicle that isn't using their blue light or attend either a police station, hospital, fire or ambulance station to report the emergency.' People are being advised not to make non-urgent calls for the time being so that all available lines can be used for emergencies if required. The incident could last until Saturday, council chief executive Maggie Sandison who was meeting with local police and representatives from other vital services this morning told Shetland News. Repairs to another cable connecting Shetland and Faroe are ongoing after it was damaged last week. MP for Orkney and Shetlands Alastair Carmichael said he had raised the issue with the UK government, but understood it could be days before communications were restored. He said the priority was fixing the issue but that resilience would also need to be looked at in future. He insisted both the Scottish and UK governments should be 'all hands to the pump' to get the line repaired as soon as possible. 'There is that element of it just being part of what people on islands have to put up with but you shouldn't have to,' he said. 'There should be more resilience in the system so that if something like this happens there is an adequate fall back. We clearly just don't have that at the moment. 'The best estimate is that it might be a couple of days. It only happened in the early hours of the morning and I think they are still working that sort of thing out. 'The impact has been severe. It is a massive inconvenience because we rely on good phone and broadband lines for so much these days but also the fact that you are not easily going to be able to contact the emergency services has got to be worrying. 'Getting this fixed has got to be the priority and it has to be all hands to the pump because modern life needs this service. It feels like It would if you'd lost water or electricity. 'I was in the chamber today so I asked the Secretary of State about it. 'She was fairly helpful but it's early days. I want to see everybody working together on this. 'I don't want ministers in Edinburgh saying this has nothing to do with us. It's all London's fault or vice versa. If there's something to be done to fix this they should all be doing it.' Homes and businesses are affected across the isles, which are 130 miles (210 km) from the Scottish mainland and have a population of about 23,000. There are reports that many shops unable to take card payments. Thousands of feet under the ocean lies a global network of internet cables responsible for carrying 97 per cent of international communications. In a digital age, these physical cables, sheathed in steel and plastic, are central to how we function. If they were to be disabled, it would not just prevent us accessing the web on our phones and laptops — it would disrupt everything from agriculture and healthcare to military logistics and financial transactions, instantly plunging the world into a new depression. According to experts, this doomsday scenario ranks alongside nuclear war as an existential threat to our way of life. In January, chief of the defence staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said he thought Russia is the hostile power most likely to cripple these vital arteries. In an interview, he said there had been 'a phenomenal increase' in Russian submarine activity over the past 20 years, adding: 'Russia has grown the capability to put at threat those undersea cables and potentially exploit them.' Any such interference would be treated with the utmost seriousness. Asked whether destroying cables could be considered an act of war, Britain's most senior military officer said: 'Potentially, yes.' In shallower waters, a vessel could deliberately drag an anchor along the seabed to rip the cables apart. Such an attack could be covered up by passing it off as an innocent fishing boat accident. Defence experts warned last month that Europe's critical infrastructure could be at risk after the Nord Stream gas pipes were blown up in an attack widely thought to have been orchestrated by Russia. Fears mounted that pipelines, rigs and undersea cables that countries including Britain rely on for energy, banking, stock trading and business could now be targeted, as German interior minister Nancy Faeser warned leaders to prepare for 'previously unimaginable' threats to their nations. Some have already begun scrambling to shore up their defences. Jonas Gahr Stoere, Norway's prime minister, said the military would be visibly deployed around oil and gas rigs to protect them. That suggests the UK - connected to Norway via two major pipelines which carry a third of this country's gas - could also be at risk. Britain's largest oil and gas fields, which are dotted with dozens of rigs and criss-crossed by pipes, also sit close to Norwegian waters. A Ministry of Defence spokesman earlier said: 'We constantly observe our areas of responsibility and interest, this includes protecting critical infrastructure such as underwater cables and offshore structures.' Mark Galeotti - a Russia expert, former adviser to the foreign office, and now at the Council on Geostrategy - told MailOnline that Putin is 'likely' behind the Nord Stream attack and intended it 'as a warning'. 'They blow up their own pipeline to remind the West that if it really pushes Putin into a corner, amongst his options are attacks on infrastructure,' he said. 'A pipeline from Norway to Poland has just been inaugurated, after all. Just as seriously, he could target undersea internet cables, which would not 'break' the internet but would certainly degrade it.' The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the explosions, dismissing the suggestion as 'stupid '. But Russia does have the capacity to carry out such an attack. Britain sent warships to the North Sea to protect underwater gas and oil pipelines and internet cables from Russian sabotage after the Nordstream was blown up in a suspected Kremlin attack. Type 23 frigate HMS Somerset and survey ship HMS Enterprise were deployed earlier this month amid fears that pipelines, rigs and undersea cables that countries including Britain rely upon for energy were at risk of further attacks. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace acted to 'reassure' those working near the pipelines after Western intelligence agencies were blindsided by the pipeline blasts. The cable that was damaged between Faroe and Shetland last week will be repaired on Saturday, according to Faroese Telecom's head of infrastructure Páll Vesturbú. He said: 'The damage is affecting most of telecom services to Shetland. There are some services still working but we will try to establish more services during the day if that's possible. 'We expect it will be fishing vessels that damaged the cable but it is very rare that we have two problems at the same time.' Isles MP Alistair Carmichael has already raised today's outage as an urgent issue in the Commons. 'I am glad that the Secretary of State [for digital, culture, media and sport Michelle Donelan] is taking this seriously. I will be staying in touch with UK government ministers and with BT to ensure that we get reconnected as soon as possible. 'Thanks to police, coastguard and other emergency services for stepping up quickly and effectively to minimise the impact and give clear information to those affected. 'I will be in Shetland from this evening and hope to meet with local partners and emergency services.' Russian jet fired a MISSILE near British plane patrolling over the Black Sea: Two of Putin's SU-27s 'interacted' with RAF spy plane, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace reveals By Chris Pleasance A Russian fighter jet accidentally fired a missile 'in the vicinity' of a British spy plane above the Black Sea, the defence secretary has revealed. Ben Wallace said two Russian Su-27 fighters had 'interacted' with an RAF RC-135 Rivet Joint spy plane which was on patrol above international waters to the south of Crimea on September 29. During the interaction one fighter 'released a missile' that Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu later blamed on a technical malfunction, Mr Wallace added. Britain does not believe the move was a deliberate escalation, Mr Wallace said, but it none-the-less underlines just how quickly the Ukraine war could spiral into World War Three. Detailing what happened between the Russian fighter and the UK plane, Mr Wallace said: 'I would also like to share with the House details of a recent incident which occurred in international airspace over the Black Sea. 'On September 29 an unarmed RAF RC-135 Rivet Joint, a civilian-style aircraft on routine patrol over the Black Sea was interacted with by two Russian armed SU-27 fighter aircraft. It is not unusual for aircraft to be shadowed and this day was no different. 'During that interaction however, it transpired that one of the SU-27 aircraft released a missile in the vicinity of the RAF Rivet Joint beyond visual range. 'The total time of the interaction between the Russian aircraft and the Rivet Joint was approximately 90 minutes. 'The patrol completed and the aircraft returned to base.' Mr Wallace told the Commons that Russia blamed the missile release on a 'technical malfunction'. 'The patrol completed and the aircraft returned to its base,' he said. 'In light of this potentially dangerous engagement, I have communicated my concerns directly to my Russian counterpart, Defence Minister (Sergei) Shoigu, and the chief of defence staff in Moscow.' He added: 'In my letter I made clear the aircraft was unarmed, in international airspace, and following a pre-notified flight path. 'I felt it was prudent to suspend these patrols until a response was received by the Russian state. 'The reply by the Russian minister of defence on October 10 stated they have conducted an investigation into the circumstances of the incident and stated it was a technical malfunction of the SU-27 fighter. 'They also acknowledge that the incident took place in international airspace.' Mr Wallace concluded his report by telling the Commons: 'The UK Ministry of Defence has shared this information with allies and, after consultation, I have restarted routine patrols, but this time escorted by fighter aircraft. 'Everything we do is calibrated with regard to ongoing conflict in the region and in accordance with international law. 'We welcome Russia's acknowledgement this was in international airspace, and the UK has conducted regular sorties with the RAF Rivet Joint in international airspace over the Black Sea since 2019 and we will continue to do so.' The defence secretary suggested the Black Sea incident shows the Russian military are 'not beyond' deciding 'the rules don't apply to them'. He also asked the public to have faith in the UK's attempt to 'walk that sometimes tightrope' when responding to Russian aggression. He added: 'Calibration is incredibly important to me. We are dealing with the president and indeed a Russian forces who, as we have seen from the Rivet Joint incident, are not beyond making the wrong calculation or indeed deciding that the rules don't apply to them. 'And that is why for those constituents of ours who will be fearful that this support could lead somewhere, I ask them to have faith in us, and indeed all of us in this chamber, that we do work this very detailed response to try and make sure we walk that sometimes tightrope, and make sure it is in the right place to do it.' Labour MP Luke Pollard thanked Mr Wallace for his 'calmness and professionalism' amid 'much Government chaos'. The shadow defence minister described the Russian fighter jet incident as 'serious', and welcomed the fact that RAF flights have restarted. 'The RAF have this House's full support and we are grateful to them, to other UK forces, and our Nato allies in their work protecting the alliance and protecting freedom,' he said. 'This incident also acts as a serious reminder about the importance of avoiding escalation and miscalculation while continuing the UK's united support for Ukraine.' He added: '(Vladimir) Putin needs to be in no doubt that our resolve will continue and, whether it's his (Mr Wallace's) party or my party that's in charge, that will not change.' He also asked about the Government's position on defence spending, saying: 'Last night the Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, threw into doubt the planned rise to 3% of GDP on defence spending when in a speech he referred to it as a potential increase.'"
2022-10-20,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11335153/Russia-plans-false-flag-attack-hydroelectric-dam-FLOOD-Kherson.html,Russia 'plans false flag attack on hydroelectric dam to FLOOD Kherson' in latest attack on energy plants as Ukraine brings in four-hour blackouts to tackle electricity shortages,"Russia is laying the groundwork to destroy a key Ukrainian dam which would flood Kherson and cover its troops' retreat from the city, a think-tank has concluded. General Sergei Surovikin, Russia's new supreme commander in Ukraine, has spoken to Russian media in recent days about what he called a 'devastating strike' on the Nova Kakhovka dam which he said was being plotted by Kyiv's troops. Surovikin, who has also been preparing the Russian public for a retreat from the region, said the blast would flood Kherson and cause widespread damage. This is likely setting up for a 'false-flag attack' that would cover Russia's retreat and prove a distraction from its latest battlefield humiliation, analysts from the Institute for the Study of War have concluded. Breaching the dam would also be another blow to Ukraine's battered energy grid, with people told to brace for rolling four-hour blackouts from today after a third of the country's power plants were blown up in a little over a week. Ukraine has already struck the dam several times with long-range rockets, because a key roadway runs over it which Russia was using to supply its troops. But Kyiv's attacks stopped once the roadway was unusable. Blackouts will occur across Ukraine from 7am local time today, the country's national grid operator said, and continue each day until 10pm. The power cuts will also affect heating, with people told to stock up on 'warm socks and blankets and hugs for family and friends' as winter approaches and temperatures dip below freezing overnight. Russia has been using hundreds of missiles and suicide drones to attack Ukraine's infrastructure in an apparent attempt to break civilian will to continue the war. Such attacks are a war crime, under international law. In an evening address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky warned 'Russian terror will be directed at energy facilities' and urged the country to conserve electricity starting at 7am. He added that the government was 'working on the creation of mobile power supply points for critical infrastructure in cities and villages'. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko asked residents of the capital not to turn on major electrical appliances. He said: 'Even a small saving and reduction of electricity consumption in each residence will help to stabilise the national energy system's operation'. Ukraine said it had downed 'several Russian rockets' over Kyiv in the third consecutive day of attacks, with Zelensky saying ten Iranian-made drones aimed at the city had also been destroyed Wednesday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said today that Russian president Vladimir Putin was using energy and hunger as weapons but has failed to break the West's unity and will not achieve his war aims through scorched earth tactics. He told the German parliament that the country had freed itself from dependence on Russian gas but was working to bring energy prices down, including by securing new gas delivery contracts from other countries. In preparation for a battle to control Kherson, Russia began evacuating 60,000 civilians yesterday which occupation officials said would last six days. A Ukrainian representative called the evacuations the 'equivalent of deportation'. The city has been in Moscow's hands since the earliest days of the invasion. Putin's 'aim is to create a kind of panic in Kherson and an image (to fuel) propaganda', Sergiy Khlan said, adding Ukrainian forces were still pushing their counter-offensive southward. He said the Russians were using evacuations as a pretext to justify 'their withdrawal from Kherson and more generally from the right bank' of the Dnieper River. Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's national security and defence council, said Moscow's move was criminal. 'Putin's martial law in the annexed regions of Ukraine is preparation for the mass deportation of the Ukrainian population to depressed areas of Russia in order to change the ethnic composition of the occupied territory,' Mr Danilov said. Pro-Russian officials in the town of Oleshky across the Dnieper said residents from Kherson were already arriving. Russia's Rossiya 24 TV showed images of people waiting to board ferries, unable to use bridges damaged by Ukraine. Vladimir Saldo, the Kherson region's Moscow-installed head, told Russian state television that the city's administration would relocate east of the Dnieper. Putin's introduction of military rule in the Moscow-controlled territories also gives additional power to authorities in Russian regions bordering Ukraine to quash dissent. 'We are working on solving very complex large-scale tasks to ensure security and protect the future of Russia,' Putin said. Separately, the secretary of Russia's National Security Council Nikolay Patrushev said around five million people from Russian-held parts of Ukraine had 'found shelter' in Russia. Ukraine's resilience has won plaudits internationally and the European Parliament on Wednesday awarded the annual Sakharov Prize for human rights to 'brave' Ukrainians. Zelensky tweeted in response: 'Ukrainians prove dedication to the values of freedom, democracy every day on the battlefield.' Meanwhile, in parts of Ukraine recently recaptured from Russian forces, repairs were under way before the onset of winter, with many residents still depending on humanitarian aid. 'Apart from this, nothing is working,' said Ivan Zakharchenko, a 70-year-old resident of Izyum queueing for aid in the square where Zelensky celebrated the town's liberation just over a month ago. Ukraine has recaptured occupied eastern territory in recent weeks. Its advance in the south, while far slower, has been gaining momentum. There have been some advances on the Russian side too, with Moscow reporting Tuesday its troops had retaken territory in eastern Kharkiv region. Russia's Wagner mercenary group said it was working on building a 'multi-level and layered defence' in the Lugansk region. Russian forces, meanwhile, continue to occupy the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Petro Kotin, head of Ukraine's nuclear energy agency Energoatom, told AFP Wednesday that Russian forces were currently holding about 50 plant employees. Russia's strikes following Ukrainian battlefield gains have demolished large parts of Ukraine's power grid ahead of winter. The government has warned of the risk of blackouts, saying about 30 percent of Ukraine's power stations have been destroyed. After strikes Monday and Tuesday, multiple explosions were heard in central Kyiv on Wednesday. Kyiv and Western allies have accused Moscow of using Iranian-made drones, with Ukraine saying it has successfully shot down 233 of them since mid-September. The Kremlin and Iran have denied this, but EU foreign policy spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said the EU had 'sufficient evidence' and would prepare fresh sanctions on Iran."
2022-10-19,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11331805/ABC-national-security-producer-seen-APRIL-FBI-mysteriously-raided-house.html,ABC national security producer hasn't been seen since APRIL when FBI mysteriously raided his house: Journalist was writing a book about Biden's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan,"An ABC News investigative producer has not been seen by colleagues since April, when the FBI mysteriously raided his apartment in Virginia. James Gordon Meek, 52, moved out of his home in Arlington, Virginia, after the raid and hasn't been seen by neighbors since. He 'abruptly' left his job at the news network, withdrew from the book he was co-authoring about Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan, and has kept a low profile ever since. The Rolling Stone first reported the raid on Wednesday morning, along with sources close to the investigation who say Meek was suspected of possessing classified documents. The source said agents found classified information on his laptop. If that is the reason for the raid, it raises serious questions about the government's approach towards journalists seeking to expose corruption or wrongdoing. It also raises questions of how they knew about it. The FBI - which routinely refuses to comment on ongoing investigations as a matter of policy - has not commented on its reason for the raid. All the bureau will say is that a raid was carried out at his address on the day in question. The warrant that enabled the raid has not been made public, and Meek's attorneys are being tight-lipped about what they have been told. In a statement, attorney Eugene Gorokhov said he knew nothing of any classified documents, but that if Meek did possess them it would have been within the scope of his career as a journalist investigating national security and military operations. 'Mr. Meek is unaware of what allegations anonymous sources are making about his possession of classified documents. 'If such documents exist, as claimed, this would be within the scope of Mr. Meek’s long career as an investigative journalist covering government wrongdoing. 'Press inquiries on this issue are troubling for a different reason: they appear to be based on statements from a source inside the government. 'It is highly inappropriate, and illegal, for individuals in the government to leak information about an ongoing investigation.' A spokesman for ABC News told DailyMail.com that Meek resigned 'abruptly' but they would not be drawn on the details of his departure. 'He resigned very abruptly and hasn’t worked for us for months,' they said. No one from the Department of Justice has confirmed an investigation into Meek. Around the same time as the raid on his home, Meek also withdrew from the book he had been co-writing with Lt. Col. Scott Mann, a retired Green Beret. The book was published in August with only Lt. Col. Mann listed as the author. A previous description of the book included a line about Meek being contacted by a Special Forces operator overseas. It read: 'In April, ABC News correspondent James Gordon Meek got an urgent call from a Special Forces operator serving overseas.' Now, promotional text for the book has no mention of his name. Instead, the blurb reads: 'In April, an urgent call was placed from a Special Forces operator serving overseas.' Neighbors told Rolling Stone that Meek vanished after the raid on his apartment. He has two daughters who often spent time at the apartment, they said. The entire raid lasted only ten minutes, according to the neighbors. They spotted a large, armored vehicle, accompanied by some local county patrol cars. 'They didn’t stick around. They took off pretty quickly and headed west on Columbia Pike towards Fairfax County. 'Most people seeing that green vehicle would think it’s some kind of tank. But I knew it was the Lenco BearCat. 'That vehicle is designed to be jumped out of so they can do a raid in that kind of time. It can return fire if they’re being fired upon,' said neighbor John Antonelli. Meek worked at ABC for nine years before he suddenly resigned. In the past, he had also served as a senior counterterrorism adviser and investigator for the House Homeland Security Committee. He had also produced a documentary about a separate US military mission in Niger, which he believed exposed a cover-up. Another producer who worked on that documentary with him, Brian Epstein, also abruptly left ABC earlier this year."
2022-10-19,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11334069/US-busts-network-providing-technology-Russian-military.html,"US busts ring of Russians, Latvians and a Ukrainian attempting to smuggle US military tech to to Moscow arms makers - including device for building NUCLEAR weapons","The Biden administration on Wednesday announced a round of criminal charges and sanctions related to a complicated scheme to procure military technologies from U.S. manufacturers and illegally supply them to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Some of the equipment was recovered on battlefields in Ukraine, the Justice Department said, and other nuclear proliferation technology was intercepted in Latvia before it could be shipped to Russia. The electronic components purchased by various Russian nationals included semiconductors, radars and satellites. Some of the electronics obtained through the scheme have been found in Russian weapons platforms seized in Ukraine, prosecutors said. The Justice Department charged nearly a dozen people in separate cases in New York and Connecticut, including Russian nationals accused of purchasing sensitive military technologies from U.S. companies and laundering tens of millions of dollars for wealthy Russian businessmen. Latvians accused of conspiring to smuggle equipment to Russia were also part of the group who were charged - so too were oil brokers for Venezuela accused of working on illicit deals for a Venezuelan state-owned oil company. 'As I have said, our investigators and prosecutors will be relentless in their efforts to identify, locate, and bring to justice those whose illegal acts undermine the rule of law and enable the Russian regime to continue its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,' Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. Five of the defendants charged in New York are Russian nationals, and two have been arrested. Two others are oil brokers for Venezuela. All four defendants in the Connecticut case - three Latvians and one Ukrainian - were taken into custody months ago at the request of U.S. authorities. They are accused of conspiring to smuggle a jig grinder, a high-precision computer controlled grinding machine, that was manufactured in Connecticut to Russia. The equipment requires a license for export or reexport to Russia. The machine can be used in nuclear proliferation and defense programs. The individuals - all citizens of Latvia or Ukraine - have been arrested by Latvian or Estonian authorities at the request of the United States, prosecutors said. The criminal charges complement the latest round of Biden administration sanctions targeting Russia. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control announced sanctions Wednesday against one of the men charged by the Justice Department, designating Yury Orekhov and two of his firms, Nord-Deutsche Industrieanlagenbau GmbH and Opus Energy Trading LLC, for procuring advanced semiconductors and microprocessors used in fighter aircraft and ballistic and hypersonic missile systems among other military uses. Orekhov and the firms ultimately sent the materials to Russian end-users, including companies designated by various federal agencies, in violation of U.S. export controls. Prosecutors said Orekhov and Uss own NDI and used it as a front to purchase the technologies and ship them to Russian end-users, including sanctioned companies controlled by Timofey Telegin and Sergey Tulyakov, two of the other Russian nationals charged on Wednesday. The defendants used fake companies and submitted false information to U.S. banks, which processed tens of millions of dollars worth of transactions in violation of sanctions, prosecutors said. The defendants also used cryptocurrency for the transactions and to launder the proceeds, prosecutors said. The U.S.-origin technologies can be used in fighter aircraft, ballistic and hypersonic missile systems, smart munitions, and other military applications, Treasury said. The charges and sanctions come as Washington is seeking to expand sanctions on Russia and crack down on evasion to pressure the Kremlin to stop its invasion of Ukraine. Prosecutors say Orekhov was arrested in Germany. It was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf. Svetlana Kuzurgasheva, a fellow Russian national was also arrested. Another Russian charged in the case, Artem Uss, has been arrested in Italy. The United States is seeking his extradition, prosecutors said. Orekhov and Uss also used NDA to ship millions of barrels worth of oil from Venezuela to buyers in Russia and China, working with two other defendants, Juan Fernando Serrano and Juan Carlos Soto, to broker the deals with Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, upon which the United States placed sanctions in 2019. According to the indictment unsealed on Wednesday, Orekhov and Uss 'repeatedly' bought oil from PDVSA and supplied it to a publicly-traded Russian aluminum company controlled by a Russian billionaire and industrialist. Without naming the company, the indictment said it had been under U.S. sanctions from April 6, 2018 until January. 27, 2019 - which matches the dates that Russian aluminum company Rusal was sanctioned. Rusal was founded by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who is himself facing U.S. charges of violating sanctions. The Justice Department, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Treasury´s Office of Foreign Assets Control worked in coordination to identify the Russian network. After the initial round of U.S. sanctions on PDVSA, Russia's Rosneft emerged as a key intermediary for Venezuelan crude. After Washington sanctioned Rosneft subsidiaries over their dealings with PDVSA, dozens of firms with no track record of oil trading have been intermediating in sales of Venezuelan oil to Chinese buyers. Along with sanctions on members of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner-circle, the U.S. has frozen Russian Central Bank funds and imposed aggressive export controls. The latest effort is dedicated to preventing Russia from procuring military technologies. 'We will continue to investigate, disrupt and prosecute those who fuel Russia's brutal war in Ukraine, evade sanctions and perpetuate the shadowy economy of transnational money laundering,' Breon Peace, the top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, said in a statement. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a statement Wednesday that Russia has increasingly struggled to get the technologies it needs to sustain the war 'thanks to the unprecedented sanctions and export controls imposed by our broad coalition of partners and allies.' At a first-of-its kind gathering last week with officials from 32 countries and the United States, Washington warned it can impose sanctions on people, countries and companies that provide ammunition to Russia or support its military-industrial complex. 'We know these efforts are having a direct effect on the battlefield,' Adeyemo said, 'as Russia's desperation has led them to turn to inferior suppliers and outdated equipment.' Information from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, presented Friday at the Treasury Department, said Russia has lost more than 6,000 pieces of equipment since the beginning of the war in late February and is turning to Iran and North Korea for supplies. Russia is reliant on foreign production machinery and ongoing banking sanctions have undercut the Kremlin's ability to obtain financing for importing military equipment, the ODNI said."
2022-10-19,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11333401/Netflix-throws-shade-HBO-Amazon-sharing-Google-Trends-graph.html,Netflix throws serious shade on HBO and Amazon by sharing Google Trends graph showing how hit show Dahmer crushed competition from House of the Dragon and Rings of Power,"Netflix bragged about the success of their latest hit show 'Dahmer' by comparing it on Google Trends, showing that its popularity surpassed HBO's House of the Dragon and Amazon's Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. The Google Trends data, which measures the shows' engagement, was shared in the company's third-quarter earnings letter to shareholders on Tuesday. After its debut on September 21, Dahmer as a search term skyrocketed in interest, passing 'Rings of Power' and 'House of the Dragon.' The crime drama was watched for 824 million hours in its first month, according to Netflix. Netflix used the data to tout the success of its binge-watching model, while some competing streaming services use a traditional weekly release. The Q3 report on Tuesday also revealed that Netflix added over 2 million subscribers, beating its forecast of 1 million and avoiding its third straight quarter of subscriber loss. Netflix now has 223 million members worldwide. The global data in the Q3 report was for August 15-October 1. Interest in the shows over the past two weeks were not included in the report. However, while Dahmer surpassed the two shows as a search term, data for each show as a 'topic' revealed that 'House of the Dragon' passed both other shows in interest over time. 'We think our bingeable release model helps drive substantial engagement, especially for newer titles,' Netflix said in the report. 'This enables viewers to lose themselves in stories they love. As the Google Trends chart shows, the ability to watch all of 'Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story' helped drive significant interest in the show.' Dahmer is the third biggest overall Netflix series - just behind Squid Game and Stranger Things. 'It's hard to imagine, for example, how a Korean title like 'Squid Game' would have become a mega hit globally without the momentum that came from people being able to binge it.' Now that Netflix has reversed its recent subscriber losses with a summertime gain, management is hoping to build on that with the upcoming launch of a cheaper version of the video streaming service that will include ads for the first time. The Los Gatos, California, company disclosed Tuesday that it picked up 2.4 million subscribers during the July-September period, a comeback from a loss of 1.2 million customers during the first half of the year amid stiffer competition and soaring inflation that´s squeezing household budgets. Netflix now boasts 223 million subscribers, enabling the company to at least temporarily reclaim the mantle as the world´s largest video streaming service. Walt Disney Co. eclipsed Netflix in August when it reported its service had 221 million subscribers, a number that will be updated Nov. 8 when Disney is scheduled to report its summertime results. 'Thank God, we are done with shrinking quarters,' Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings exclaimed in a video conference call Tuesday. 'We are back to positivity.' The uptick in subscribers also helped Netflix earn $1.4 billion, or $3.10 per share, a 4 percent dip from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 6 percent from last year to $7.93 billion. The subscriber gains, earnings per share and revenue all topped analyst projections compiled by FactSet. Netflix´s shares surged by about 14 percent after the latest numbers came out. Even so, the stock has still lost more than half its value so far this year, reflecting worries that Netflix´s best days have passed. Now that Netflix is growing again, it will be aiming to accelerate the momentum with its first ad-supported plan that debuts in the U.S. and 11 other markets in early November. The new option will cost $7 per month in the U.S., less than half the price for Netflix´s most popular $15.50-per-month plan without commercial interruptions. Plans and Pricing info: Netflix.com 'Netflix still has a lot of room to grow and capture the share in a price-sensitive market,' Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said in a sign of renewed optimism about the company´s prospects. In a possible sign Netflix isn´t expecting the ad-backed plan to be an immediate hit, management is forecasting it will add 4.5 million subscribers during the October-December period. Although that would be Netflix´s biggest quarterly gain this year, it would still be down from the 8.3 million subscribers added during the same holiday-season period last year. Netflix is apparently hoping to de-emphasize Wall Street's long-running focus on its subscriber growth by stopping to provide forecasts about how many customers it expects to add from one quarter to the next. Management disclosed Tuesday that its subscriber projection for the current quarter will be its last, but that it will continue to predict earnings and revenue in hopes investors will pay more attention to those figures. Although investors have generally been enthusiastic about Netflix´s expansion into the advertising market, one major concern is whether the additional revenue generated from selling commercials will be enough to offset the losses from current subscribers who switch to the cheaper option from higher prices they are currently paying. Netflix is projecting revenue of nearly $7.8 billion for the quarter covering the holiday season that traditionally spurs more advertisers, slightly below what analysts had been anticipating, according to FactSet. If Netflix delivers on its revenue forecast, it will translate into a 4 percent increase from the same time last year. By comparison, Netflix's posted a year-over-year revenue gain of 16 percent in its 2021 holiday-season quarter. But an analysis by the research firm Insider Intelligence foresees advertising contributing a significant chunk of Netflix's revenue. Next year, Netflix should bring in more than $830 million from advertisers in the U.S. alone, followed by more than $1 billion in the U.S. in 2024, according to Insider Intelligence. 'The economics will be just fine,' Greg Peters, Netflix's chief operating officer, said during Tuesday's conference call. Netflix is expecting to bring in even more subscribers early next year when it begins to crack down on rampant password-sharing that has allowed millions of people watch its service for free.

As Putin sparks fears of nuclear war - DailyMail.com reveals the locations of thousands of bunkers across the Big Apple,"The daily fear that New York City - and her millions of inhabitants - might disappear in a nuclear mushroom cloud was once of another era. However, that Cold War anxiety is once again stalking the bustling streets of the Big Apple thanks to Vladimir Putin's repeated threatens to use nuclear weapons. It may come as some small comfort - and perhaps surprise - to New Yorkers to know that they are, in fact, never very far from a nuclear fallout shelter. While not all are fully operational, they may still provide some shelter and respite if the city ever suffered an attack. The old and weather-worn yellow and black signs outside buildings and apartment blocks signify that they were once fully stocked fortresses that could serve as protection in the event of a nuclear bomb. New Yorkers can find out here where their nearest nuclear fallout bunker is. A nuclear fallout building spree was triggered by the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. By the following decade, however, money had run out and the majority were converted into basement storage spaces. The shelter program was spearheaded by then-governor Nelson Rockefeller, who in 1960 authorized a ‘state shelter’ initiative which oversaw the building of tens of thousands of shelters across the city with a projected price tag of $1.5 billion - the equivalent of more than $12 billion today. New York boasted tens of thousands nuclear fallout shelters during the Cold War, when tensions with the USSR were at their peak. At the height of the 1950s and 1960s, police in New York would run compulsory air raid drills, where people had to duck into shelters when sirens sounded. President John F. Kennedy even created a nationwide program to create shelters amid the threat of a nuclear attack as the US went toe-to-toe with the USSR. In New York, prolific black and yellow signs reading 'Fallout Shelter' were seen across the city on buildings which the Army Corps of Engineers deemed to have enough protection against radiation. There were roughly 17,448 of these buildings, according to the New York Times, and they were equipped with survival kits if there were to be a nuclear attack. Worth about $2.40 per person at the time, packed-in New Yorkers would have aspirin, toilet paper, and appetite-suppressing candies to survive on. Instead of buying mass bomb shelters in urban areas, the US decided to opt for suburban backyard shelters instead. The governor at the time, Nelson Rockefeller, called for a mandatory state shelter program. At one property on New York Avenue in Crown Heights, there is still a fallout shelter in the basement of a tenant building. According to Gothamist, it's now bused to store bicycles, washing machines, and also is no longer an enclosed concrete room. Resident Nathan Pensler told the website: 'I don't think we would last very long.' Shelters would be at the center of strong concrete buildings, and would have no windows to minimize the damage if a nuclear attack was imminent. Some of the larger shelters were found at the Lindsay Park cooperative complex in Williamsburg and on the 43rd floor of the Waldorf Astoria. And in 2006, nuclear fallout equipment and supplies were found in the Brooklyn Bridge by workers. In May 2022, Russian state media has issued a chilling new nuclear threat to the US, boasting that Putin could wipe out the entire East and West coast with just four missiles. And an expert has warned that if a nuke were to hit New York City, locals would be devastated as the war in Ukraine continues on. Dr Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute, told MailOnline that by targeting New York's financial district, One World Trade and the western end of the Brooklyn Bridge would be brought to ash. A blast would flatten the entire lower end of Manhattan: Wall Street, the Manhattan Bridge, Chinatown, Little Italy - everything south of 2nd Street - as the effect rolled on. As the blast keeps moving everything south of 30th street would be devastated. The Flatiron Building, Madison Square Park, Union Park, the whole of the Lower East Side and West Village. The blast wave would roll over Brooklyn Heights and Jersey City. The Statue of Liberty would likely fall into New York Harbor. Dr Lewis explained: 'The first thing you'll get is a fireball that will vaporize everything inside of it. That's going to travel just over half a mile from the center of the blast. 'Then you'll have shockwave that is going severely damage even really heavily built concrete buildings out to just over a mile from the blast, with everyone in that radius crushed to death. 'That blast wave will keep rolling - it will drop off severely, but it will keep going - destroying buildings and causing casualties out until about two and a half miles,' Dr Lewis said. Dr Lewis adds: 'Radiation poisoning is just a really cruel, miserable way to die. The immediate effects are vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea - people can rally and seem much better, perhaps for hours or days - but then the symptoms return and get much worse.' In the aftermath, there would be hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of people suffering burns, broken bones, cuts and other injuries while most if not all of the hospitals in the blast zones would have been reduced to rubble and the doctors who keep them running killed. Acute radiation exposure kills because it badly damages both blood vessels and bone marrow, weakening veins and arteries and affecting your body's ability to make white blood cells that fight off disease. Most people who die from radiation poisoning die because they contract an infection that their body can no longer fight - effectively rotting alive - or else their blood vessels burst and they bleed to death internally. The process can take weeks to play out, and recovery - if it comes at all - can take up to two years. But that is hardly the last effect of a nuclear blast. The shockwave does not stop there but actually keeps rolling out to around six miles from the epicenter, shattering windows and causing injuries as it goes. Within that radius, anyone directly exposed to the heat of the blast is also likely to suffer horrifying and potentially lethal burns in a 'gruesome lottery', Dr Lewis explains. 'If you're inside a building you're probably OK, but if you're exposed you're likely to have third degree burns all over your body,' he said. 'You might get lucky and be behind a hill, or you might get unlucky and the same hill reflects a shockwave on to you that kills you.' And that's before considering the effects of nuclear fallout. The amount of fallout caused would depend on the kind blast Russia opted for: An airburst, where the bomb is detonated some distance above the ground to maximize the effects of the shockwave, causes relatively little. But a groundburst - where the bomb goes off close to the earth - would produce a huge amount of ash that would be sucked up into the fireball and surrounding mushroom cloud, and then come falling back down. If it mixes with clouds then it may fall as black rain - as happened after Hiroshima - or flakes of ash may come drifting down like snow, as happened after the botched US nuclear test on Bikini Atoll during the Cold War. Those living on the surrounding islands recall the flakes falling and - not knowing what they were - described how children caught them on their tongues. How far this spread would depend on the vagaries of the weather, but it could well drift up to 20 miles from the impact, passing Yonkers in New York. The blast may also produce a 'fire storm' similar to forest fires, where the amount of oxygen being sucked into the blaze produces its own weather systems - driving the inferno further and faster than it would otherwise spread. That could cause damage many times greater than the blast itself, Dr Lewis believes, though the actual extent of it would be largely a mystery until the bomb went off. 'A fire storm did start in Hiroshima after it was bombed, because the city had a lot of wooden buildings,' he said. 'But then, so did Nagasaki, and there was no fire storm. We don't really know why. And we have no idea how a modern city would burn.' Even then, that would be far from the end of the bomb's effects. While it is easy to focus on the over-awing power of the blast itself, the knock-on effects are perhaps even more terrifying. In the aftermath, there would be hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of people suffering burns, broken bones, cuts and other injuries while most if not all of the hospitals in the blast zones would have been reduced to rubble and the doctors who keep them running killed. And that's if Russia only dropped one bomb. If Putin were to decide to attack multiple cities in the same country at the same time, Dr Lewis says the possibility of society completely breaking down is 'not trivial'. In the event of all-out nuclear war between states, the amount of dust kicked into the atmosphere would be so severe that it would reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches Earth - blighting crops, killing fish, and causing global famine in a so-called nuclear winter. What happens after that, including whether humanity itself could survive in such conditions, is the subject of deep and rather abstract speculation among experts - and none of it is good. 'It is a common joke among nuclear experts that the best advice in the event of a strike is to make sure you die in the first wave,' Dr Lewis says, grimly. Asked if he had any advice for Putin in light of his nuclear sabre-rattling, Dr Lewis added simply: 'This is not a game. Don't screw around with this.' In July this year, New York City released a public service announcement for a nuclear attack weeks after Russian state media claimed Putin could wipe out the US East Coast. In the new clip, the city's Emergency Management Department tells New Yorkers: 'So there's been a nuclear attack. Don't ask me how or why. Just know that the big one has hit. OK. So what do we do?' A city spokesperson tells citizens: 'While the likelihood of a nuclear weapon incident occurring in/near New York City is very low, it is important New Yorkers know the steps to stay safe.' She encourages them to follow these 'key, simple steps in the event of such an incident.' The three simple steps for New Yorkers to follow are to 'get inside, stay inside and stay tuned' to broadcasts about what to do next. There is a reminder that staying in a car is not an option. 'Don't go outside until officials say it's safe,' we're told. The PSA spokesperson continues: 'If you were outside after the blast, get clean immediately. Remove and bag all outer clothing, to keep radioactive dust or ash away from your body.' People are also encouraged to head to a basement if they have one. There is no mention of 'duck and cover' in the video. The reason for discontinuing the building of fallout shelters was that they provided more of a liability than encouraging people to stay where they were in the case of a nuclear bomb. 'The guidance we give now is if something happens you should stay inside or get into the nearest building as quickly as possible,' Nancy Silvestri, a spokesperson for the New York Office of Emergency Management told the DailyMail.com. 'Most buildings in New York City are concrete – you’d have more protection inside. Going into the subway would be safer than being outside or exposed,' she continued. The concepts behind the fallout shelters, however, remain true today. Ready.gov has identified the three key elements to protection from nuclear blasts: distance, shielding, and time. Their tips include: It is advised to have a safe space in your home that is well stocked with food, flashlights, and medical supplies, as one can expect to be hidden for at least 24 hours after a nuclear blast to avoid the subsequent radiation. However, if cover is not possible, there are also a number of emergency precautions that can be taken."
2022-10-19,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11333381/MEGHAN-MCCAIN-Millions-Americans-freeze-far-left-anti-human-energy-policy.html,MEGHAN MCCAIN: Millions of Americans may freeze this winter because of far-left anti-human energy policy. Voters are sick of this garbage — and Democrats WILL pay for it at the ballot box,"We take it for granted in America in 2022. During the winter when we turn up the thermostat, we expect the heat to kick on. Not so in Joe Biden's America. Welcome to the new green future. New England's regional power-grid operator is now warning millions of Americans in the Northeast of the potential for rolling blackouts this winter. That's right. Those counting on a reliable supply of fuel to heat their homes this winter may need to start chopping wood. 'If we get a sustained cold period in New England this winter, we'll be in a very similar position as California was this summer,' said Nathan Hanson, a regional power company executive. But not to worry, Biden and Democrats have a solution. Get an abortion, says Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. 'Having children is why you're worried about your price for gas, it's why you're concerned about how much food costs… You can't divorce being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy from the economic realities of having a child,' Abrams told an interviewer on MSNBC. Okay? Not sure I follow that. After the abortion, we're still going to be driving cars, no? Then Biden stepped up to the microphones on Wednesday to repeat the same old gibberish. It's the oil companies' fault, he said. But regardless, he's here to help. The president is releasing 15 million more barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. However, since the U.S. consumes 20 million barrels a day, this is quite literally a drop in the bucket. It's like putting a Band-Aid on a stab wound. Let's be clear, the winter fuel crisis facing the northeast is a microcosm of the problem facing the nation. Many of us scoffed at those crazy Californians when they started getting text messages in September pleading with them to 'turn off your appliances,' turn down the air conditioning and stop recharging the electric cars so as not to overwhelm the overtaxed energy grid. Only in California – right? Wrong, the left's anti-human, environmental policies are having an impact coast to coast. The Biden White House has leased fewer acres, both offshore and on federal lands, for oil and gas development than any other administration in a similar period dating back to the end of World War II, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. In the predominately Democratically controlled Northeast coal, oil and nuclear plants are being shut down faster than renewable-energy alternates can come online to replace them. Liberal New York state blocks pipeline construction. And don't even get me started on fracking. Despite sitting on one of the richest pockets of natural gas in the world, New York state and parts of Pennsylvania have banned it. Now, with the war in Ukraine, there may not be enough gas to go around. Stock up on winter socks. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts average household spending will increase for all heating fuels this winter with natural gas and heating oil leading the surge at 28% and 27% year-over-year respectively. To be clear, I believe in environmental conservationism and that climate change is real. I do not, however, buy into the hyperbole of the modern Democratic party that screams no cost is too high, no sacrifice too great and no suffering too painful to stand in the way of the clean energy future. Especially because it is always the average working man and woman who will pay the harshest price. So, here we are. Vermont is going to look and feel like Soviet Russia this winter. Democrats and the environmental extremists who vote for them should be thrilled. Of course, Biden and his administration don't really believe the garbage they spew. They pay lip service to the green activists in this party, while Biden begged Saudi Arabia to pump more oil. Hell, even our 'special envoy for climate' John Kerry's private family jet emitted over 300 metric tons of carbon since Biden took office. But now, the proverbial chickens have come home to roost and Democrats are about to pay a price in the fast-approaching midterm elections. New polling shows Republicans gaining on Democrats and it seems increasingly likely that the GOP will ride a red wave to control of the House and quite possibly the Senate. To put it very simply, as James Carville famously said, 'it's the economy, stupid.' And Democrats are left scrambling. Democratic Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman said on a national TV last week that he has always supported fracking in his state, but he hasn't. 'I don't support fracking at all and I never have,' he told the left-wing YouTube channel Real Progress in Action in 2018 when he was running for lieutenant governor. The American public are not a stupid bunch, in fact, they are incredibly smart, and savvy and they know when they are being played. How much will President Biden and the Democrats flip-flop as we hurdle towards November 8th is anyone's guess. But with winter fast approaching and Americans left with no real solutions to this energy crisis, it seems like it's the Democrats' turn to pay up."
2022-10-19,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11333235/Vladimir-Putin-using-deeply-irresponsible-nuclear-rhetoric-options-left.html,"'Weak' Vladimir Putin is turning to 'deeply irresponsible' nuclear rhetoric because he has 'few options left', says Britain's Chief of the Defence Staff","Russian president Vladimir Putin has been criticised for 'deeply irresponsible' nuclear rhetoric, as fears grow that he may make a show of force using a nuke over the Black Sea. Last month Putin said he was ready to use nuclear weapons if necessary to defend Russia's 'territorial integrity' and yesterday Russia said seized Ukrainian lands are under its nuclear protection. The threatening statements are believed to have increased in frequency due to Putin having 'few options left' after weeks of humiliating losses to Ukraine on the battlefield. Today, Chief of the Defence Staff Tony Radakin urged the international community to remain united against what he called Russian President Vladimir Putin's 'deeply irresponsible' nuclear rhetoric. 'He (Putin) has few options left. Hence, the nuclear rhetoric,' he said during a speech. 'And while this is worrying and deeply irresponsible, it is a sign of weakness, which is precisely why the international community needs to remain strong and united.' There are serious concerns the Russian despot will make a 'nuclear show of force' after Defence Secretary Ben Wallace flew to Washington on Tuesday for emergency talks with the Pentagon. A third of Ukraine was left without power as the new head of Russia's armed forces Sergei Suvorikin, nicknamed 'General Armageddon', launched a series of missile and drone strikes. Following the attack, Mr Wallace cancelled a meeting with MPs and travelled Washington DC to discuss 'security concerns'. A security source told The Sun that 'the threat has increased recently'. Junior defence minister James Heappey told Sky News that Mr Wallace was in Washington 'having the sort of conversations that - beyond belief, really - the fact that we're at a time when these sort of conversations are necessary'. While Prime Minister Liz Truss's spokesman said there would be 'severe consequences' if Russia used nuclear weapons, but added: 'I would guide away from speculating on this as an issue.' 'I think it would be a mistake to be drawn into speculation on this rather than focusing on what we are seeing take place day-by-day, which is a senseless and barbaric attack on civilians across Ukraine,' he told reporters. Earlier today Putin declared martial law in the occupied regions of Ukraine as officials began evacuating civilians from the city of Kherson. He said the order will come into effect from midnight in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions - giving him sweeping powers to curtail the freedoms of civilians, repurpose industries, and press-gang Ukrainians into his armed forces to fight their fellow countrymen, though it is unclear if all these powers will be used. The order also affects occupied Crimea and Krasnodar, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk, and Rostov, all of which are on Russia's own territory bordering Ukraine. Putin made the announcement shortly after Sergei Surovikin, his new commander in Ukraine, said the situation in Kherson is 'tense'. Evacuations got under way there today as Vladimir Saldo, the Kremlin's man in the city, said up to 60,000 people will be moved in the next six days - suggesting it could come under attack within a week. The administration is also moving, Saldo added, though vowed Russia would 'fight to the death' to regain full control. If Putin's army is forced to flee then the defeat would be the most humiliating it has suffered to date, raising fears of further escalation. By Chris Pleasance The idea of a nuclear attack on the West used to be the stuff of dystopian science fiction - but it is a hellish vision that Vladimir Putin has repeatedly invoked as his war in Ukraine falls apart. While most experts agree that an atomic attack on Paris, London, New York or Washington DC is still highly unlikely, it cannot be discounted. President Biden has personally warned that the world is now closer to 'Armageddon' than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis. It is not a reality any of us relish contemplating, but as we stare down the barrel of a new nuclear crisis between east and west it begs the question: What would actually happen if Russian nukes hit a major city? Here, MailOnline - with help from Dr Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute - unpacks what such a strike would look like, the grim toll it would cause, and the nightmare survivors would face... Hunkered down in his nuclear bunker deep within the Ural mountains, Vladimir Putin does the unthinkable and gives the order to launch atomic weapons at the West. Codes, contained within his Cheget Briefcase, are passed down the chain of command until they reach the crew of a missile silo. Moments later, an intercontinental ballistic missile streaks towards the atmosphere, breaking apart as it goes like a space rocket. It ends its journey high above Earth, releasing its nuclear warheads which are then positioned on target by a reentry vehicle and sent back down at supersonic speed - along with decoys to trick defence systems. Flight time from Russia to the UK for a nuclear weapon is around 15 minutes - half an hour for the US - so in all likelihood the first anyone in the street would know about an attack would be a blinding flash and a huge fireball wiping a city off the map. Dr Lewis explains using the example of a 500 kiloton nuclear bomb - more than thirty times the size of the Little Boy bomb that America dropped on Hiroshima, but far from the largest in Russia's arsenal. 'The first thing you'll get is a fireball that will vaporise everything inside of it,' he said. 'That's going to travel just over half a mile from the centre of the blast.' If dropped on Westminster, that would mean the Houses of Parliament, Downing Street, St Thomas's Hospital and Westminster Abbey being completely obliterated with a 100% kill rate for anyone inside at the time. Targeting New York's financial district would reduce One World Trade and the western end of the Brooklyn Bridge to ash. A blast above the White House would obliterate everything four blocks in all directions from Pennsylvania Avenue. Targeting Paris's Elysee Palace would vaporise Place de la Concorde and most of the Champs Elysees. 'Then you'll have shockwave that is going severely damage even really heavily built concrete buildings out to just over a mile from the blast, with everyone in that radius crushed to death', Dr Lewis added. For London, that would mean Buckingham Palace being flattened, along with Victoria and Waterloo stations - two of the city's busiest. The whole of Soho, half of Mayfair, The Oval cricket ground, virtually everything from Chelsea Bridge to Blackfriars, would be history. A similar-sized blast would flatten the entire lower end of Manhattan: Wall Street, the Manhattan Bridge, Chinatown, Little Italy - everything south of 2nd Street. For Washington, it would scrub almost the entire National Mall off the map - including the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, as far west as the Arlington Memorial Bridge and as far east as the National Gallery of Art. In Paris, the Arc de Triomphe would be no more. The Louvre, and all its artistic treasures including the Mona Lisa, would be smashed to smithereens. 'That blast wave will keep rolling - it will drop off severely, but it will keep going - destroying buildings and causing casualties out until about two and a half miles,' Dr Lewis said. In London, that encompasses the Tower of London and Battersea Power station. Most of Hyde Park, half of Regent's Park, Chelsea, Knightsbridge and Belgravia. The damage would span from Camden to Brixton. In New York, that would devastate everything south of 30th street. The Flatiron Building, Madison Square Park, Union Park, the whole of the Lower East Side and West Village. The blast wave would roll over Brooklyn Heights and Jersey City. The Statue of Liberty would likely fall into New York Harbor. Notre Dame, the Eiffel Tower, and Garde du Nord station in Paris would likely be damaged beyond repair. In Washington, the Capitol, Jefferson Memorial, and half of Arlington National Cemetery would be lucky to survive. Everyone within that radius would also be given an extremely high dose of radiation. For many people it would prove fatal, but even among survivors up to 15 per cent would likely die later of cancer linked to the blast. Dr Lewis adds: 'Radiation poisoning is just a really cruel, miserable way to die. The immediate effects are vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea - people can rally and seem much better, perhaps for hours or days - but then the symptoms return and get much worse.' Acute radiation exposure kills because it badly damages both blood vessels and bone marrow, weakening veins and arteries and affecting your body's ability to make white blood cells that fight off disease. Most people who die from radiation poisoning die because they contract an infection that their body can no longer fight - effectively rotting alive - or else their blood vessels burst and they bleed to death internally. The process can take weeks to play out, and recovery - if it comes at all - can take up to two years. But that is hardly the last effect of a nuclear blast. The shockwave does not stop there but actually keeps rolling out to around six miles from the epicentre, shattering windows and causing injuries as it goes. Within that radius, anyone directly exposed to the heat of the blast is also likely to suffer horrifying and potentially lethal burns in a 'gruesome lottery', Dr Lewis explains. 'If you're inside a building you're probably OK, but if you're exposed you're likely to have third degree burns all over your body,' he said. 'You might get lucky and be behind a hill, or you might get unlucky and the same hill reflects a shockwave on to you that kills you.' And that's before considering the effects of nuclear fallout. The amount of fallout caused would depend on the kind blast Russia opted for: An airburst, where the bomb is detonated some distance above the ground to maximise the effects of the shockwave, causes relatively little. But a groundburst - where the bomb goes off close to the earth - would produce a huge amount of ash that would be sucked up into the fireball and surrounding mushroom cloud, and then come falling back down. If it mixes with clouds then it may fall as black rain - as happened after Hiroshima - or flakes of ash may come drifting down like snow, as happened after the botched US nuclear test on Bikini Atoll during the Cold War. Those living on the surrounding islands recall the flakes falling and - not knowing what they were - described how children caught them on their tongues. How far this spread would depend on the vagaries of the weather, but it could well drift up to 20 miles from the impact. That would take it outside London's M25, shower Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport, pass Yonkers in New York, or travel roughly halfway from DC to Baltimore. Again, Dr Lewis returns to the idea of a 'gruesome lottery'. 'You'll get fairly serious radiation contamination [within that area],' he says. 'Some of those people will get quite ill. Though hiding in your house for a few days might make a real difference.' The blast may also produce a 'fire storm' similar to forest fires, where the amount of oxygen being sucked into the blaze produces its own weather systems - driving the inferno further and faster than it would otherwise spread. That could cause damage many times greater than the blast itself, Dr Lewis believes, though the actual extent of it would be largely a mystery until the bomb went off. 'A fire storm did start in Hiroshima after it was bombed, because the city had a lot of wooden buildings,' he said. 'But then, so did Nagasaki, and there was no fire storm. We don't really know why. And we have no idea how a modern city would burn.' Even then, that would be far from the end of the bomb's effects. While it is easy to focus on the over-awing power of the blast itself, the knock-on effects are perhaps even more terrifying. In the aftermath, there would be hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of people suffering burns, broken bones, cuts and other injuries while most if not all of the hospitals in the blast zones would have been reduced to rubble and the doctors who keep them running killed. In the case of strikes on London, Washington or Paris, the government would be in chaos - if it survived at all - and its ability to coordinate an effective response to such a disaster would be extremely limited. Energy, food and water supplies would all either be cut off or badly reduced, further worsening the situation, while transport links such as roads and rails would be ruined - delaying the arrival of help. On top of which, piles of dead bodies would be havens for pests and disease to spread among a population with devastated immune systems, opening the door to epidemics. And that's if Russia only dropped one bomb. If Putin were to decide to attack multiple cities in the same country at the same time, Dr Lewis says the possibility of society completely breaking down is 'not trivial'. In the event of all-out nuclear war between states, the amount of dust kicked into the atmosphere would be so severe that it would reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches Earth - blighting crops, killing fish, and causing global famine in a so-called nuclear winter. What happens after that, including whether humanity itself could survive in such conditions, is the subject of deep and rather abstract speculation among experts - and none of it is good. 'It is a common joke among nuclear experts that the best advice in the event of a strike is to make sure you die in the first wave,' Dr Lewis says, grimly. Asked if he had any advice for Putin in light of his nuclear sabre-rattling, Dr Lewis added simply: 'This is not a game. Don't screw around with this.'"
2022-10-19,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11333129/Naive-German-government-relying-China-Berlin-intelligence-warns.html,"'Naive' German government is blundering out of the frying pan into the fire by over-relying on China after Merkel's gas deals with Putin sparked energy crisis, Berlin intelligence warns","The head of Germany's BND foreign intelligence service warned parliamentarians in Berlin not to be 'naïve' about China after Angela Merkel's dealings with Moscow left Germany over-reliant on Russian oil and gas. Federal Intelligence Service President Bruno Kahl made the remarks in an annual public hearing of Germany's three main spy agencies on Monday, calling into question Germany's relationship with China. President of Military Counterintelligence Service (MAD) Martina Rosenberg was also present, as was the president of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BAMAD), Thomas Haldenwang. In an annual public hearing before the Bundestag, the three spy chiefs warned about the threat form China, asking the German government not to repeat the same mistakes it made when dealing with Vladimir Putin. China has been conducting 'sophisticated' spying operations on the German military for years, said MAD President Rosenberg. The news came in the same week that Germany removed the country’s cybersecurity chief after allegations emerged of his links to Russian intelligence. 'If Russia is a storm, China is climate change,' said BfV President Haldenwang, trying to impress the gravity of the situation on to the parliament, according to DW. Kahl said Germany would be better off if the parliament had headed the advice of intelligence services in the past, accusing law makers of brushing off warnings from the three agencies. The spy chiefs used Russia as an example, explaining that they had warned politicians for years over the risks that relying on oil and gas from Moscow posed to energy security. Germany has been forced to upend its energy policy and spend billions on alternative supplies of oil and gas, despite a push toward renewables, in order to both meet the energy demand of its citizens and cut off funding to Putin. Their warnings over Russian aggression against Ukraine had been brushed of as scaremongering, they claimed. Germany should not make the same mistake when it comes to China, the chiefs added. German businesses have invested heavily in China, despite warnings from allies that Chinese state-affiliated companies often steal intellectual property from rivals. Volkswagen announced last week it will invest €2.4 billion (£2billion) with China's Horizon Robotics. Kalh highlighted a proposal from a Chinese shipping giant COSCO to acquire a 35% stake in Hamburg's container terminal. About one third of cargo handled at the Port of Hamburg comes from and goes to China, said CEO Axel Mattern, who called the move a 'pure business decision'. But Beijing has a history of acquiring foreign ports in strategic locations to gain political advantage, such as the Hambantota port which Sri Lanka signed over to China on a 99-year lease after it found itself unable to repay the Chinese loans it took out to build the port in the first place. 'We must not allow a situation in which the Chinese state can influence political events in Germany,' said BfV President Haldenwang. China's strategy of becoming a global technology leader by 2049 also relies heavily on copying scientific developments from countries like Germany. 'I believe that a great change in awareness has already set in but of course there is a lot of trust and naivety in the scientific field, that is not appropriate,' said Kahl. Germany's interior ministry fired the country's cybersecurity chief on Tuesday and launched an investigation into his conduct after allegations were made that he may have come into contact with Russian security circles through a consultancy he co-founded. Arne Schoenbohm came under scrutiny in recent weeks after a satire TV show highlighted his ties with a cybersecurity consultancy, which it alleged was ultimately a subsidiary of a Russian firm founded by a former KGB employee. Schoenbohm had co-founded the Cyber Security Council Germany to advise companies and authorities on cybersecurity matters in 2012 before in 2016 being appointed head of BSI, the federal information security agency. A spokesperson for the interior ministry, now run by the Social Democrats, said Schoenbohm was dismissed because the allegations had 'permanently damaged the necessary public confidence in the neutrality and impartiality of his conduct in his office as president of Germany's most important cybersecurity authority'. Schoenbohm said he had himself on Monday asked the ministry to launch an investigation."
2022-10-19,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11333199/Biden-says-Putins-tool-available-brutalize-Ukrainian-citizens.html,Biden says Putin's 'only tool available is to brutalize Ukrainian citizens' and intimidate them into capitulating after the Russian leader declared martial law in four annexed regions,"President Joe Biden said Wednesday that Russia's repeated attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine were an effort by Russian President Vladimir Putin to force the Ukrainians to capitulate – and that it will fail. He was asked about Putin's latest gambit, declaring martial law in four annexed Ukrainian territories seized by Russia, in the latest effort to use force to try impose order and control. That followed days of stepped up bombings of apartment buildings and other civilian targets, as well as infrastructure that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has cut power to one-third of his country. 'I think that Vladimir Putin finds himself in an incredibly difficult position,' Biden told reporters, pausing to collect his thoughts while holding a binder of material. 'And what it reflects to me is, it seems his only tool available to him is to brutalize individual citizens in Ukraine, Ukrainian citizens, to try to intimidate them into capitulating. They're not going to do that.' Biden then concluded his remarks, at an event in the Roosevelt Room to talk about oil releases from a strategic U.S. reserve, intended in part to counter the impacts of the war in Ukraine. 'That's why I have been doing everything in my power to reduce gas prices since Putin's invasion of Ukraine caused these price hikes, these prices to spike and rattle international oil markets,' Biden said. As he walked away from the event, he declined to respond to a question about whether he would meet Putin at the upcoming G20 summit in Indonesia. That followed reports that the administration is privately ruling out a meeting between the two leaders, with Russia's brutal war in Ukraine continuing to drive the countries apart. Putin said regional governors in the regions, taken from Ukraine after referendums under armed occupation that the U.S. and allies denounced as a 'sham,' would get emergency powers to impose order. 'We are working to solve very difficult large-scale tasks to ensure Russia´s security and safe future, to protect our people,' Putin said in televised remarks. 'Those who are on the frontlines or undergoing training at firing ranges and training centers should feel our support and know that they have our big, great country and unified people behind their back.' The administration has never talked up the chance of a meeting, even after Putin, who Biden has called a 'war criminal,' indicated he planned to attend. Biden kept the possibility of a narrow conversation alive last week, in comments that made clear he had no intention of opening up a broader discussion of the war, after Putin's repeated comments attacking the US and relentless bombing of civilians in Ukraine. 'Look, I have no intention of meeting with him, but look, if he came to me at the G20 and said, 'I want to talk about the release of [detained American Brittney] Griner,' I would meet with him, but that would depend,' Biden said. Now, officials are going so far as to say they are seeking to discourage even a 'sideline' informal meeting with Putin, Politico reported. U.S. officials have 'ruled out' a formal meeting with Putin, and are 'taking steps' to make sure they don't bump into each other in a hallway or doing the typical 'family photo.' Putin himself was sounding bearish on the chances, as his military unleashed a wave of drone and rocket attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine, drawing repeated condemnation from the West. The Russian leader said Friday there was 'no need' to meet Biden and his own attendance was 'not finalized' Biden is already likely to have an encounter with one dictator who he has called a top competitor to the U.S.: with China's Xi Jinping, who is set to secure a third term at the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing after a decade in power. Biden said last month he was open to meeting Xi. The two men spoke by phone in March, when the president warned Beijing it would face consequences if it propped up Russia's invasion, and again in July. Biden has called Putin a 'murderous dictator,' as well as a 'pure thug' and a 'killer.' Biden hasn't gotten much mileage out of his last face-to-face meeting with an autocratic ruler. He took political hits for his 'fist bump' with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman last summer, but the Saudis infuriated the administration when OPEC+ voted to cut oil production – a move that helps Putin fund his war and kept oil prices higher weeks before the U.S. elections. Indonesian President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, whose nation hosts the summit, invited Putin and traveled to Moscow in June to extend the invitation in person. After the insistence by the U.S. and other leaders, also invited Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky, whose nation is not a member. Zelensky said he would attend if Putin does."

2022-10-19,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11285621/The-dog-war-mans-best-friend.html,The dog of war who became man's best friend: Starving pooch forges incredible bond with rescuer who found him wandering among blown up tanks and cars in Ukraine,"Walking through the ruins of a war-ravaged Bucha, alone and abandoned, a dog desperately searched for its owners. He stood among a multitude of destroyed Russian tanks and Ukrainians who sadly lost their lives. Koda was hungry and thin- he needed someone to find and love him. Help came in the form of Yannick Böge, 24, from Hamburg, who travelled to the newly-liberated city on 24 April with friend Robin and has now forged an incredible bond with Koda. The 24-year-old told MailOnline: 'Koda was found a few hundred metres away from the city centre, where he was walking all alone in the middle of dozens of exploded Russian tanks and destroyed civilian cars. 'We saw cars, body parts. I saw every bullet hole. It was just horrible. 'Koda was very skinny when we found him hanging around a burnt out Russian tank. There was something special about him, perhaps his curiosity and more so, he was such a friendly dog!' Yannick added: 'He just started playing and goofing around with us. It's like he's known us for years!' Koda jumped straight into their car when Yannick opened the door and he said: 'It was like him saying: I'm coming with you! 'This is exactly the attitude he carries with him to this day, he is always by my side, no matter what I do.' Footage taken by Yannick also shows an excited Koda jumping up on Robin on the day he was rescued. The 24-year-old and his friend rescued seven dogs during that mission, including Koda. He said that there were animals on the street and when people saw they were coming to rescue them, they came to ask for food. Yannick and his team of four volunteers Evelien, Kinga, Robin and Mortiz look after 30 dogs and 15 cats including Koda at their small animal shelter Der Beste Freund Fluchtet Mit (DBFFM) in Yavoriv. When the team first rescued him, Yannick said he was underweight but in good overall physical health. Yannick told MailOnline: 'Right after we first met Koda, he came across as very restless. 'It was clear he couldn't find any peace. One thing that stood out to us, was that in the first 4 or 5 days at our shelter, he never laid down to sleep. 'He was always sitting up and falling asleep. It was a funny sight in a way, as it kind of looked like he was meditating. 'But we really also felt sorry for him when we saw that. He probably had to be on his guard and watchful the weeks before he came to us, because hell was all around him. 'Rocket strikes and military fighting around him all the time... You just can't even imagine what he must have experienced and witnessed.' Yannick had watched the war begin to unfold from home and decided to go to Ukraine with aid for the border with Poland-Medyka in March. After a few weeks helping, the 24-year-old decided to open Der Beste Freund Fluchtet Mit at the border as organizations rescuing animals had been told by guards that they were transporting 'street animals' from Ukraine into an EU country. Animals and other organizations are able to stop and decompress before trying to cross the border. Koda was one of the first animals he rescued after he decided to set up an animal shelter on the border. The duo, who now have an unbreakable bond, go on rescue missions together and spend a lot of time in each other's company. Yannick explained that he has seen a range of cities that have been affected hugely by the war during these missions. And he said at on one trip he did to Bucha by himself, he was stopped about 50 times and asked for food by people so he gave them as much as he could. He told MailOnline: 'I have visited cities which were devastated in unimaginable ways. 'There's been a number of close calls but we've saved a lot of animals and that's what matters.' At the shelter, the animals are given vaccines so that they can travel and pregnant dogs are checked up on. They are nursed back to health by the team, who give them lots of hugs and love. On a typical day at the shelter, the animals roam the grounds as if they were living in a normal home. They get fed twice a day. Yannick often has to do vet runs with the animals as there is not a vet on site. Volunteers also work on training dogs which prepares them for life at home. The team have faced challenges along the way such as a lack of resources and petrol and continue to as they rescue animals in an active warzone. There have also been outbreaks of diseases such as distemper. The shelter had to be put in full quarantine and new puppies lost their lives. These were the same puppies which Yannick had fed two hours after their birth and he said: 'It was the toughest moment.' Also, sometimes the dogs fight each other when they get bored which can be challenging. But Yannick said: 'I think we are very lucky. We are a young team and we are very lucky to have found each other. We all share the same common goal- Save lives. 'This is exactly what we've managed to achieve despite working inside an active war zone without regular funding or 'big' donors. 'That's something to be proud of. More so, we are growing, expanding and continuing our operations despite most charities stepping away from rescuing in Ukraine.' The team run a number of social media pages for Der beste Freund flüchtet mit where they document the daily life of their dogs including @DBFFMshelter on Twitter. At the moment, the shelter is also working on a number of projects, including 'Lifesaving Real Estate.' Yannick said: 'Supporters can purchase one of our custom built, insulated, waterproof huts which will be built by us and then transported to animals living along Ukraine's frontline.' The 24-year-old said that the shelter is also working on a Dodo Heroes feature which will help the animals survive the winter and will be out in November. Yannick has also been asked to go down to the frontline by some of his friends that he met in Ukraine and volunteer there, supporting the local village. He said: 'We're going to take some animals and bring some food because many animals suffered there.' Those wanting to adopt animals from the shelter can contact through the website directly. Yannick has remote volunteers that will visit prospective families before the animals are adopted. He added: 'The process is easy going and the shelter offers support throughout the adoption and continued support once the pet is in its new home.' The shelter is a long-term project and the volunteers will not leave even as the war continues. Yannick and his team are always looking for remote volunteers who can help with content writing, managing their website, editing videos and fundraising. Anyone who wants to get involved can contact them through their social media or via their website. Yannick said: 'I am proud because I know it is the right thing to do. I love the people who live here. 'The animals give me so much back every day. I'm just happy.' He added: 'It has been life changing. It truly feels like living a dream.'

2022-10-19,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11332383/Workers-maintain-Britains-Trident-nuclear-weapons-voting-STRIKE.html,Workers who maintain Britain's Trident nuclear weapons are voting on whether to go on STRIKE - just as fears grow that Putin will detonate nuke over the Black Sea,"Staff maintaining the UK's nuclear weapons are to vote on strike action - amid fears Putin could deploy one of his own bombs. Union Prospect said it will ballot its members working at the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) amid an ongoing dispute with the company over pay. The move by the workers, who are key to Britain's nuclear deterrent, comes as speculation grows that Putin could be preparing a nuclear show of force, including the first open-air detonation of an atomic weapon since the 1960s - potentially over the Black Sea. AWE, headquartered in Aldermaston, Berkshire, supports and maintains Trident, the UK's nuclear programme which is based at HMNB Clyde in Faslane, Argyll and Bute. Prospect said the atomic weapons company recently became 'an arms-length body of the MoD' with the associated freedoms on pay awards, but has offered an increase of 5 per cent, which members have formally rejected. An additional lump sum payment averaging £780 has also been offered. The union said the combined offer is about a 7 per cent increase in the context of the retail price index reaching 11.8 per cent at the pay review date of June, which members said does not address a real-terms reduction in pay. Prospect said it has warned repeatedly that unless pay problems are addressed, 'recruitment and retention issues affecting AWE will continue'. The ballot opens on October 24 and will run for two weeks. The Unite union will also be balloting about the same issue. Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect, said: 'Several years of deteriorating workforce engagement and stagnating pay against inflation, has left workers at AWE with no option but to move towards industrial action. In March Boris Johnson moved to boost stocks of warheads held by the UK - with the top limit raised from 180 to 260. Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent is currently carried by the Royal Navy's four Vanguard Class submarines. They are due to be replaced by a new generation of four Dreadnought Class boats also armed with Trident missiles from 2030. The Vanguard Class can carry up to 16 missiles, each armed with up to eight Trident warheads, meaning the 260 warhead ceiling would not allow them all to deploy at once. 'Safely maintaining the UK's nuclear deterrent is a complex and highly stressful operation that requires an extremely high level of dedication and training at all levels. 'It should attract a commensurate level of pay and respect, for these staff who keep the country safe. Staff are struggling with the basic costs of living which is unacceptable in the context of this employer and its funding. 'This is not a workforce that can bear a high level of churn while safely functioning - the jobs simply require too high a degree of training. 'If the MoD and AWE don't think again and make a pay offer that reflects the rocketing cost of living, there is a real risk that AWE will struggle to recruit and retain the skills that it needs.' The Prime Minister's spokesman told reporters that any potential industrial action remained a 'hypothetical' but insisted that the nuclear deterrent would not be affected. Putin has declared martial law in the occupied regions of Ukraine as officials began evacuating civilians from the city of Kherson, with a battle for control of the stronghold now looming. Putin said the order will come into effect from midnight in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions - giving him sweeping powers to curtail the freedoms of civilians, repurpose industries, and press-gang Ukrainians into his armed forces to fight their fellow countrymen, though it is unclear if all these powers will be used. The order also affects occupied Crimea and Krasnodar, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk, and Rostov, all of which are on Russia's own territory bordering Ukraine. It is unclear exactly what measures will come into force here, though Putin's order stops short of calling it full martial law. What happens if the nukes fall? Expert reveals which areas of London, New York and other cities will be instantly obliterated by Putin strike…and where you'd stand best chance of surviving The idea of a nuclear attack on the West used to be the stuff of dystopian science fiction - but it is a hellish vision that Vladimir Putin has repeatedly invoked as his war in Ukraine falls apart. While most experts agree that an atomic attack on Paris, London, New York or Washington DC is still highly unlikely, it cannot be discounted. President Biden has personally warned that the world is now closer to 'Armageddon' than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis. It is not a reality any of us relish contemplating, but as we stare down the barrel of a new nuclear crisis between east and west it begs the question: What would actually happen if Russian nukes hit a major city? Here, MailOnline - with help from Dr Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute - unpacks what such a strike would look like, the grim toll it would cause, and the nightmare survivors would face... Hunkered down in his nuclear bunker deep within the Ural mountains, Vladimir Putin does the unthinkable and gives the order to launch atomic weapons at the West. Codes, contained within his Cheget Briefcase, are passed down the chain of command until they reach the crew of a missile silo. Moments later, an intercontinental ballistic missile streaks towards the atmosphere, breaking apart as it goes like a space rocket. It ends its journey high above Earth, releasing its nuclear warheads which are then positioned on target by a reentry vehicle and sent back down at supersonic speed - along with decoys to trick defence systems. Flight time from Russia to the UK for a nuclear weapon is around 15 minutes - half an hour for the US - so in all likelihood the first anyone in the street would know about an attack would be a blinding flash and a huge fireball wiping a city off the map. Dr Lewis explains using the example of a 500 kiloton nuclear bomb - more than thirty times the size of the Little Boy bomb that America dropped on Hiroshima, but far from the largest in Russia's arsenal. 'The first thing you'll get is a fireball that will vaporise everything inside of it,' he said. 'That's going to travel just over half a mile from the centre of the blast.' If dropped on Westminster, that would mean the Houses of Parliament, Downing Street, St Thomas's Hospital and Westminster Abbey being completely obliterated with a 100% kill rate for anyone inside at the time. Targeting New York's financial district would reduce One World Trade and the western end of the Brooklyn Bridge to ash. A blast above the White House would obliterate everything four blocks in all directions from Pennsylvania Avenue. Targeting Paris's Elysee Palace would vaporise Place de la Concorde and most of the Champs Elysees. 'Then you'll have shockwave that is going severely damage even really heavily built concrete buildings out to just over a mile from the blast, with everyone in that radius crushed to death', Dr Lewis added. For London, that would mean Buckingham Palace being flattened, along with Victoria and Waterloo stations - two of the city's busiest. The whole of Soho, half of Mayfair, The Oval cricket ground, virtually everything from Chelsea Bridge to Blackfriars, would be history. A similar-sized blast would flatten the entire lower end of Manhattan: Wall Street, the Manhattan Bridge, Chinatown, Little Italy - everything south of 2nd Street. For Washington, it would scrub almost the entire National Mall off the map - including the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, as far west as the Arlington Memorial Bridge and as far east as the National Gallery of Art. In Paris, the Arc de Triomphe would be no more. The Louvre, and all its artistic treasures including the Mona Lisa, would be smashed to smithereens. 'That blast wave will keep rolling - it will drop off severely, but it will keep going - destroying buildings and causing casualties out until about two and a half miles,' Dr Lewis said. In London, that encompasses the Tower of London and Battersea Power station. Most of Hyde Park, half of Regent's Park, Chelsea, Knightsbridge and Belgravia. The damage would span from Camden to Brixton. In New York, that would devastate everything south of 30th street. The Flatiron Building, Madison Square Park, Union Park, the whole of the Lower East Side and West Village. The blast wave would roll over Brooklyn Heights and Jersey City. The Statue of Liberty would likely fall into New York Harbor. Notre Dame, the Eiffel Tower, and Garde du Nord station in Paris would likely be damaged beyond repair. In Washington, the Capitol, Jefferson Memorial, and half of Arlington National Cemetery would be lucky to survive. Everyone within that radius would also be given an extremely high dose of radiation. For many people it would prove fatal, but even among survivors up to 15 per cent would likely die later of cancer linked to the blast. Dr Lewis adds: 'Radiation poisoning is just a really cruel, miserable way to die. The immediate effects are vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea - people can rally and seem much better, perhaps for hours or days - but then the symptoms return and get much worse.' Acute radiation exposure kills because it badly damages both blood vessels and bone marrow, weakening veins and arteries and affecting your body's ability to make white blood cells that fight off disease. Most people who die from radiation poisoning die because they contract an infection that their body can no longer fight - effectively rotting alive - or else their blood vessels burst and they bleed to death internally. The process can take weeks to play out, and recovery - if it comes at all - can take up to two years. But that is hardly the last effect of a nuclear blast. The shockwave does not stop there but actually keeps rolling out to around six miles from the epicentre, shattering windows and causing injuries as it goes. Within that radius, anyone directly exposed to the heat of the blast is also likely to suffer horrifying and potentially lethal burns in a 'gruesome lottery', Dr Lewis explains. 'If you're inside a building you're probably OK, but if you're exposed you're likely to have third degree burns all over your body,' he said. 'You might get lucky and be behind a hill, or you might get unlucky and the same hill reflects a shockwave on to you that kills you.' And that's before considering the effects of nuclear fallout. The amount of fallout caused would depend on the kind blast Russia opted for: An airburst, where the bomb is detonated some distance above the ground to maximise the effects of the shockwave, causes relatively little. But a groundburst - where the bomb goes off close to the earth - would produce a huge amount of ash that would be sucked up into the fireball and surrounding mushroom cloud, and then come falling back down. If it mixes with clouds then it may fall as black rain - as happened after Hiroshima - or flakes of ash may come drifting down like snow, as happened after the botched US nuclear test on Bikini Atoll during the Cold War. Those living on the surrounding islands recall the flakes falling and - not knowing what they were - described how children caught them on their tongues. How far this spread would depend on the vagaries of the weather, but it could well drift up to 20 miles from the impact. That would take it outside London's M25, shower Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport, pass Yonkers in New York, or travel roughly halfway from DC to Baltimore. Again, Dr Lewis returns to the idea of a 'gruesome lottery'. 'You'll get fairly serious radiation contamination [within that area],' he says. 'Some of those people will get quite ill. Though hiding in your house for a few days might make a real difference.' The blast may also produce a 'fire storm' similar to forest fires, where the amount of oxygen being sucked into the blaze produces its own weather systems - driving the inferno further and faster than it would otherwise spread. That could cause damage many times greater than the blast itself, Dr Lewis believes, though the actual extent of it would be largely a mystery until the bomb went off. 'A fire storm did start in Hiroshima after it was bombed, because the city had a lot of wooden buildings,' he said. 'But then, so did Nagasaki, and there was no fire storm. We don't really know why. And we have no idea how a modern city would burn.' Even then, that would be far from the end of the bomb's effects. While it is easy to focus on the over-awing power of the blast itself, the knock-on effects are perhaps even more terrifying. In the aftermath, there would be hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of people suffering burns, broken bones, cuts and other injuries while most if not all of the hospitals in the blast zones would have been reduced to rubble and the doctors who keep them running killed. In the case of strikes on London, Washington or Paris, the government would be in chaos - if it survived at all - and its ability to coordinate an effective response to such a disaster would be extremely limited. Energy, food and water supplies would all either be cut off or badly reduced, further worsening the situation, while transport links such as roads and rails would be ruined - delaying the arrival of help. On top of which, piles of dead bodies would be havens for pests and disease to spread among a population with devastated immune systems, opening the door to epidemics. And that's if Russia only dropped one bomb. If Putin were to decide to attack multiple cities in the same country at the same time, Dr Lewis says the possibility of society completely breaking down is 'not trivial'. In the event of all-out nuclear war between states, the amount of dust kicked into the atmosphere would be so severe that it would reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches Earth - blighting crops, killing fish, and causing global famine in a so-called nuclear winter. What happens after that, including whether humanity itself could survive in such conditions, is the subject of deep and rather abstract speculation among experts - and none of it is good. 'It is a common joke among nuclear experts that the best advice in the event of a strike is to make sure you die in the first wave,' Dr Lewis says, grimly. Asked if he had any advice for Putin in light of his nuclear sabre-rattling, Dr Lewis added simply: 'This is not a game. Don't screw around with this.'"
2022-10-19,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11332311/British-Russian-son-Putin-ally-detained-flying-drone-restricted-area-Norway.html,British-Russian son of Putin ally is detained for flying a drone in restricted area of Norway – the seventh Russian recently arrested in the Scandinavian country for drone activity,"The British-Russian son of a close Vladimir Putin ally has been arrested in Norway for flying a drone in a restricted area, Norwegian Police said today. Andrei Yakunin, 47, was arrested on Monday in Hammerfest in northern Norway, according to police and court documents. Police have accused Yakunin - the son of ex-Russian Railways boss Vladimir Yakunin, who is considered to be close to Putin - of illegally flying a drone in the Svalbard archipelago, located in the geopolitically strategic Arctic region. He becomes the seventh Russian arrested in the past few days suspected of illegally flying drones or taking photos in restricted areas in the Scandinavian country, which shares a border with Russia in the far north. Soon after police announced the arrest, Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store accused 'foreign intelligence' services of being behind the recent slew of 'unacceptable' drone flights in the country, indirectly pointing the finger at Russia. 'It is not acceptable that foreign intelligence is flying drones over Norwegian airports. Russians are not allowed to fly drones in Norway,' Store said, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK. 'We do not want anyone to fly this type of craft over important installations in Norway.' Yakunin's press office said he was using the drone for recreational purposes. Yakunin heads up VIY Management, a private equity and real estate investment company that facilitates foreign investment in Russia. According to the New Yorker in 2015, he once owned a house on North London's Bishop's Avenue, a 'billionaires' row' between Hampstead and Highgate. His son is reported to have a attended Highgate School. It is unclear whether he still owns the house after Britain imposed sanctions on several Russian businessmen following Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February. Russian investigative publication Insider reported in July that Yakunin publicly stated that he was against the invasion, telling Italian television he 'never voted for Putin'. Yakunin's father Vladimir Yakunin has in the past been among Vladimir Putin's closest allies. He was the president of Russian Railways from 2005 to 2015. He was sanctioned by Britain April, having already been sanctioned by the US since 2014. [Yakunin] did use a recreational drone during his holiday trip to Svalbard in late August,' said a spokesperson, responding to a request from MailOnline. 'Andrey is passionate about nature, photography and extreme sports, as can be seen from his social media activity. Yakunin's press office said he is fully cooperating with authorities to provide 'all the necessary information regarding the normal tourist activities of his boating holiday'. Along with several other Western nations, Norway has forbidden Russians and Russian entities from flying over its territory following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, whether by drone or aircraft. Breaking that ban is punishable by a three-year prison term while unauthorised photography can merit a one-year sentence. A number of mysterious drone flights have been observed in Norway in recent weeks, sparking fears of Russian espionage. Combined with the presumed sabotage on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in the Baltic Sea, the observations have prompted Oslo to beef up security around strategic infrastructure, in particular its oil and gas offshore platforms. Norwegian police arrested two Russians in two separate incidents last week. They were accused of illegally flying drones and taking photos or videos. Officers arrested the four in northern Norway in a car with Russian licence plates last Thursday and a day later placed them in custody for a week, regional police said in a statement. Police have not disclosed what the four Russians - three men and one woman - were interested in but they had taken photos of objects covered by a photography ban. The four, in their late 20s, had arrived in Norway from Finland in late September or early October. They were arrested with a 'substantial' amount of photos, but have denied any wrongdoing and have claimed they were just tourists, police official Gaute Rydmark told Norwegian television TV2. Norway's Justice Minister Emilie Enger Mehl refused to comment on the matter, but said 'there is heightened pressure on Norway, from an intelligence point of view'. Police said the four were not in possession of any drones, unlike the other two Russians arrested last week, also in the country's north. In addition to the four last week, two other Russians have been arrested in Norway in recent days. LAst week, Police in Kirkenes detained a 50-year-old Russian when they found two drones in his luggage during a routine stop at the border. The drones had hours of footage at locations taken across Norway, they said. On Friday, a 51-year-old Russian was arrested en-route to Svalbard was detained at Tromso airport, also for photographing sensitive objects. The arrest of Andrei Yakunin brings the total up to seven. 'The suspect [Yakunin] has admitted flying a drone in Svalbard,' police official Anja Mikkelsen said. Yakunin has been placed in custody for two weeks, and drones and electronics in his possession have been confiscated, police said. Located about 620 miles from the North Pole, the Svalbard archipelago is a Norwegian territory strategically located in the heart of the Arctic. It is home to a relatively large Russian community, and its special legal status enables foreign nationals to mine some of its natural resources. On Monday, Russia's embassy in Oslo said 'hysteria' in Norway was impacting 'ordinary tourists', calling the ban on Russians flying drones 'unjustified and discriminatory'. On Wednesday, a drone was observed near the airport in Bergen, Norway's second-biggest city, briefly suspending air traffic. The Airport was shut down at around 6.30am (5.30BST) and reopened two and a half hours later. With 15 gates, it is Norway's second-largest airport and serves more than six million passengers a year, according to the airport's website. Numerous drone sightings have been reported near Norwegian offshore oil and gas platforms and infrastructure in recent weeks. Airport operator Avinor told NRK on Tuesday that 50 possible drone observations have been reported at civilian airports so far this year, 27 of them since July. NTB said 17 and 14 drone sightings were reported in 2021 and 2020, respectively, while the number was 44 in 2019. On Monday, Norwegian justice minister Emilie Enger Mehl asked people to be aware of suspicious activity and said that domestic security agency PST had received a number of new drone tips. Norway's domestic security agency has now taken charge of the investigation into the drone sightings the country's far north. Hedvig Moe, deputy chief at PST, the intelligence agency's acronym, said there was 'an elevated intelligence threat from Russia' and that 'Russia is in a pressed situation as a result of the war and is isolated by sanctions' over its war in Ukraine. 'We are in a tense security-political situation, and at the same time a complex and unclear threat picture that can change in a relatively short time,' she said. Norway has also beefed up security at its offshore oil and gas drilling platforms after the drone sightings and last month's Nord Stream gas pipeline blasts in the Baltic Sea, widely assumed to be the result of sabotage. The Scandinavian country has overtaken Russia as the main supplier of natural gas to Western Europe after the invasion led to a cut in energy imports from Moscow. On Sunday, the airspace around Norway's oil capital Stavanger was briefly closed after a drone was observed in the southwest region. On Friday, satellite images showed that Russian president Vladimir Putin had increased the number of his strategic nuclear bombers stationed at an airbase near the Finnish and Norwegian borders. The move came amid high tension over whether Putin plans to launch an atomic attack in Europe and his on-going invasion of Ukraine, which has suffered a string of embarrassing setbacks in recent months. The disclosure came from Faktisk.no - an independent Norwegian fact checking website - which obtained the data from American satellite operator Planet. The buildup above at the air base follows international concern over another report two weeks ago, when The Jerusalem Post revealed there was an 'unusual deployment' of seven nuclear bombers at the airbase. This was highlighted by Israeli intelligence firm ImageSat International which detected the 'irregular presence' of TU-160s and TU-95s. The Armageddon planes are usually stationed at Engels Air Base, 450 miles south-east of Moscow. Now, however, the bombers are stationed around 115 miles away from the border of NATO member Norway, and about 95 miles away from the soon-to-become Alliance member, Finland."

A missile and drone blitz has knocked out a third of the country’s power stations in just eight days as winter approaches, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Further drone attacks on energy supplies left parts of the capital without electricity for several hours yesterday. At least three residents were killed. Officials said 1,162 towns or villages across 16 Ukrainian regions were now without power. Mr Zelensky said Vladimir Putin’s targeting of power supplies, a crime under the laws of armed conflict, was ‘causing massive blackouts’ with hospitals forced on to back-up generators. ‘No space left for negotiations with Putin’s regime,’ Mr Zelensky said, once again ruling out the prospect of peace talks with the Kremlin despot. ‘The terrorist state will not change anything for itself with such actions,’ he added. ‘It will only confirm its destructive and murderous essence, for which it will certainly be held to account.’ The main power station in the central city of Dnipro, the gateway to Ukraine’s partially occupied industrial heartland of the Donbas, was also hit. And Zhytomyr, home to military bases and key industries west of Kyiv, was left without energy. Mayor Serhiy Sukhomlyn said 150,000 of its 250,000 residents were still without electricity last night. Pavlo Raboschuk, a 33-year-old computer repairman in Zhytomyr, said he was ready ‘for a tough and dark winter’ with dehydrated foods, warm clothes and batteries stockpiled at home. ‘Only swear words come to mind,’ he added. Iryna Kolodzynska, a school headmistress, managed to have students back at their desks within 30 minutes of the air raid all-clear. ‘We must not break down,’ she said. ‘There are regions that suffered much more from the war than we did.’ Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said: ‘The situation is critical now across the country because our regions are dependent on one another. The whole country should prepare for electricity, water and heating outages.’ Oleksandr Khorunzhyi, a spokesman for Ukraine’s emergency services, said more than 70 people have been killed and 240 injured since Russia’s assault began last Monday. In the north east, Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv, some 25 miles from the border with Russia, was hit with eight missiles. The UK Ministry of Defence wrote in its daily intelligence briefing that ‘a key objective of this strike campaign is to cause widespread damage to Ukraine’s energy distribution network’. ‘As Russia has suffered battlefield setbacks since August, it has highly likely gained a greater willingness to strike civilian infrastructure,’ the MoD declared. A senior Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said kamikaze drones supplied to Moscow by Iran were being used because Russian missiles were running out. ‘Our assessment is that the ability for the Russians to continue with these saturating barrages of precision weapons is getting to the point now where this will be unsustainable,’ the source said. But pro-Kremlin Telegram channels lavished praise on Putin for attacking energy infrastructure in civilian areas. Moscow denied it was using Iranian drones. ‘Russian tech is being used,’ Putin’s chief propagandist Dmitry Peskov said."
2022-10-19,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11331639/Russias-leadership-increasingly-dysfunctional-worsening-shortage-capable-officers.html,"Russia's military leadership is 'increasingly dysfunctional', with a 'worsening shortage of capable officers' and four of the five commanding generals fired since war began, MoD reveals","Russia's military leadership is 'increasingly dysfunctional', with the war in Ukraine being spearheaded by rookie officers as Putin's forces are beaten back on the battlefield. Four out of five of Russia's top generals have been sacked since the start of the war, Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) said today, with Sergei Surovikin now in charge. 'Their replacements have so far done little to improve Russia's battlefield performance', the MoD added, as Surovikin appeared to be preparing for a retreat from the southern stronghold of Kherson. British spies did not name the four generals who had been sacked, but one of them is almost certain to be Valery Gerasimov - chief of the general staff who was last seen in a tense encounter with Putin during war games in eastern Russia. The other three are likely to be Aleksandr Dvornikov, Surovikin's predecessor, Gennady Zhidko, former commander of Russia's southern armies, and Aleksandr Zhuravlev, who headed the western grouping. The full MoD update said: 'Eight months into the invasion, major elements of Russia’s military leadership are increasingly dysfunctional. 'At the tactical level, there is almost certainly a worsening shortage of capable Russian junior officers to organise and lead newly mobilised reservists. 'Eyewitness testimony suggests that the shooting of 11 Russian soldiers near Belgorod by a fellow recruit on 15 October 2022 occurred after an officer’s abusive comments towards ethnic minority recruits. 'Poor lower-level leadership is likely worsening the low morale and poor unit cohesion in many parts of the Russian force. 'Four of the five generals with direct operational command of elements of the invasion in February 2022 have now been dismissed. Their replacements have so far done little to improve Russia’s battlefield performance. 'The lack of command continuity will likely be more disruptive than in a Western military because under Russian doctrine the development of plans sits largely with the commander personally, rather than as a collective effort across a broader staff.' Putin is now eight months into what was intended to be a days-long war ending with the collapse of the Ukrainian government. But he has instead found himself caught up in a grinding war of attrition that has minced his armed forces and may yet result in total defeat. Russia has already been forced to retreat from the cities of Kyiv, Chernihiv and Kharkiv in Ukraine's north, which were the key objectives of the war. Attacks in the Donbas have proved mildly more successful but have failed to result in a decisive victory. Instead, they have sapped Putin's army of strength to hold back Ukraine's advances elsewhere. Kyiv's men now appear poised to retake at least partial control of the city of Kherson, in the south, as Russian occupation officials begin evacuating civilians. Volodymyr Saldo, the Kremlin's man in Kherson, said 60,000 civilians will leave over the next six days - suggesting the city could fall within a week. If Russia is forced to retreat here, then it would be the most embarrassing defeat that Putin has yet suffered - which has sparked fears about how he might respond. Within Russia, concern is growing that he may use today's emergency meeting of the security council to declare all-out war - granting him sweeping powers to close borders, declare martial law and force more men into the army. Meanwhile in the West, speculation is growing that he could be ramping himself up for the first open-air detonation of a nuclear weapon since the 1960s. Such a blast could take place at a testing ground in the Russian far east, or else over the Black Sea to demonstrate his stockpile of ageing warheads still works."
2022-10-19,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11331691/General-Armageddon-feared-commander-brought-oversee-Ukraines-destruction.html,General Armageddon: The feared commander - and convicted criminal - brought in by Putin to oversee Ukraine's destruction with missile blitz... who will relish the impending Battle of Kherson,"He is a feared commander and convicted criminal who has served the Kremlin in five wars around the world, leaving behind a trail of blood, crushed cities and destroyed lives - while earning himself the chilling nickname of 'General Armageddon'. Now, there are signs that Sergei Surovikin - brought in by Russian president Vladimir Putin to oversee Ukraine's destruction - is preparing the ground for a retreat from the city of Kherson. But while recapturing the southern Ukrainian city would represent a major victory for Kyiv, the news came amid fears that Putin is preparing to declare all-out war against Ukraine. There is also mounting speculation the increasingly desperate despot could resort to a nuclear show of force over the Black Sea as his invasion fails. Surovikin, known for his use of unconventional and devastating tactics in Syria where he earned his feared nickname - would certainly not resist such a terrifying move, and his history offers insight into what is coming in the battle for Kherson. He was appointed as Putin's overall commander in Ukraine on October 8. Two days later Russia unleashed dozens of missiles that struck more than 300 towns and cities across the beleaguered country, killing at least 19 people and injuring hundreds. Russia claimed it struck military, energy and communications networks. In Kyiv, attacked for the first time since June, officials said missiles hit parks, playgrounds and rush-hour commuters in cars that exploded. The next day – Surovikin's 56th birthday – Putin rang to congratulate him. They discussed the callous assault that the dictator said was reprisal for the explosion at the weekend which wrecked his beloved Kerch Bridge linking Russia to Crimea. In the last week, attacks on civilian targets have increased, with Putin's forces increasingly making use of unconventional weapons - such as Iranian-supplied kamikaze drones. Analysts say Surovikin's finger prints are all over the attacks. Surovikin is adored by Russian hardliners. He is hated by human rights groups. He is accused of horrifying atrocities, including ties to the use of nerve gas in Syria. And, as he has risen to the pinnacle of Russia's military over three decades, shrugging off two bouts of imprisonment and leaving a string of strange deaths in his wake, he and his wife Anna have become astonishingly wealthy. His modus operandi is to deluge cities with missiles – as seen in the hideous destruction of the Syrian cities of Aleppo and Idlib. 'He was always a strong proponent of massive missile strikes on civilian infrastructure,' according to Ukrainian defence expert Oleksandr V Danylyuk. 'He doesn't care at all about human life.' General Armageddon's rise to the top has been built on a mountain of corpses. Born in 1966 in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, the general would go on to serve in the Soviet Union's doomed war in Afghanistan in the 1980s. But he first gained notoriety in the 1991 coup attempt by Soviet hardliners to thwart democracy. His unit caused the only deaths among protesters who had gathered in Moscow to protect elected president Boris Yeltsin. A tank division under his command broke through a line of protesters in central Moscow, crushing three people to death. He spent several months in prison, and was later released without trial when officials ruled he was following orders. By Jason Groves for the Daily Mail New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt had refused to commit to the Prime Minister's pledge to raise defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade. Mr Hunt said 'everything' was on the table as part of a brutal round of spending cuts to save £40billion by the end of the month. But Downing Street backed down yesterday after armed forces minister James Heappey warned both he and the Defence Secretary Ben Wallace would resign if it was dropped. The pledge, which experts say could cost £157billion, is now one of the few Government promises protected from the spending review. No 10 refused to say whether Miss Truss would even stand by her pledge this month to raise pensions in line with inflation. Mr Heappey said the increased defence spending was essential to meet the security threats facing the UK. In 1995, he received a sentence – later overturned – for illegal arms trading. In another incident, the military – notorious for its corruption – lost most of the contents of a massive arms dump under his control in Siberia when it burned down. Twelve generals were reprimanded but he escaped censure because he was on holiday. Such controversy has stuck to this 'Hero of Russia' like the blossoming ribbon bar on his uniform – with three strange incidents in 2005 alone that might have derailed most military careers. A colonel accused Surovikin of beating him up in a political row. One month later, another colonel died by suicide after a vicious dressing down by Surovikin. Then soldiers under his command committed war crimes by beating Chechens, burning down houses and killing an elderly man, leading to a £1.7million compensation payout. Later, there were claims he threatened to kill a prominent journalist and liberal MP – an ally of opposition leader and anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny – who was investigating Surovikin's wife Anna's thriving business activities. She owns several plush apartments and, reportedly, a plot of land in an expensive Moscow suburb near ultra-rich oligarchs. The most disturbing insight into Surovikin's disregard for civilian lives, however, occurred amid the bloodbath of the Second Chechen War in 2005. Nine of his soldiers were killed after entering a house and coming under a hail of gunfire that made the walls collapse – although local media claimed several were drunk and someone had fired a grenade launcher. Surovikin, then a major general, pledged revenge. He vowed to kill three of the enemy for each lost life and a few days later, boasted to journalists that 24 'bandits' had been killed and eight detained. The rising star of Russia's military then complained about the legal constraints that stopped them 'working as efficiently as we could'. He gave an example of soldiers shooting at a car containing a woman and child alongside a militant. He said it was unsurprising that 'talented and honest officers serving in Chechnya develop the so-called Ulman syndrome'. A chilling statement. Eduard Ulman was an army captain sentenced in absentia to 14 years in jail for shooting six civilians, including a pregnant woman, then burning a car containing their corpses to cover his tracks. He fled rather than face trial for war crimes. Surovikin is a veteran of wars in Afghanistan and Tajikistan as well as Chechnya, but it was in Syria that he reinforced his reputation for cruelty and ruthlessness - and it was his command of troops in Syria that culminated in him being awarded the Kremlin's highest medal - Hero of Russia. Most notably, he oversaw the 2016 destruction of Aleppo, when Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime retook the city with the support of Russian airstrikes. Human rights groups have accused him of being complicit in the indiscriminate bombing, using barrel bombs, and of overseeing chemical weapon attacks. More than 600 civilians were killed in what is considered one of the most brutal events of the Syrian civil war, including dozens of children. 'He's a brutal, calculated leader,' said Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, who said Surovikin's command also coincided with a nerve agent attack that killed 90 civilians and injured 500. A Human Rights Watch report identified Surovikin as one of the key military figures 'indiscriminately' striking 'homes, markets, schools, and healthcare facilities' using incendiary weapons, barrel bombs and cluster munitions. Until being appointed on October 8, Surovikin led the 'South' forces in Ukraine, according to a defence ministry report in July. Experts have suggested he was appointed by Putin to take total command in Ukraine because of his ruthlessness. Practically, however, some analysts have said he has been in command for some time, and question what difference his appointment will have on the war itself. While he has typically commanded infantry, he has also commanded Russian air forces. This could be another reason behind Putin's appointment, as Russia's army, air force and navy have been disjointed so far in the war in Ukraine. 'Surovikin knows how to fight with bombers and missiles - that's what he does,' General Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's military intelligence service, said in June. Speaking to Sky News, Military analyst Forbes McKenzie, head of McKenzie Intelligence, said Surovikin's reputation is the reason for his appointment. 'He's seen as a hero of the former Soviet Republic,' he said. 'He has shown his ability to wage a war that involves nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, the last of which he used in Syria.' In recent weeks, the Kremlin has been sabre-rattling over the use of nuclear weapons. McKenzie said now, Putin needs commanders who would be able to carry out such attacks. 'This is a man who has used chemical weapons in recent history, so that demonstrates capability,' he said. On Saturday, Britain's Ministry of Defence released its assessment of Surovikin's appointment. 'For much of its operation, Russia has likely lacked a single empowered field commander. General Alexandr Dvornikov likely held the role for a period between April and August 2022, but it is unclear whether he was able to effectively exercise control over the often disparate and competing groupings of forces,' the MoD said. 'Surovikin's appointment likely reflects an effort by the Russian national security community to improve the delivery of the operation. However, he will likely have to contest with an increasingly factional Russian MOD which is poorly resourced to achieve the political objectives it has been set in Ukraine.' Meanwhile, Surovikin's appointment has pleased Russian hardliners who were growing increasingly frustrated with Putin and the progress of the war in Ukraine. Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner Group mercenary group, said 'Surovikin is the most competent commander in the Russian army', according to The Times. 'He is the same officer who without hesitation, having received an order, got into a tank and rushed to save his country,' Prigozhin said, in relation to his crackdown on demonstrators in Moscow that landed him in jail. Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Putin leader of Chechnya, said Russia's invasion of Ukraine was now in 'reliable hands' thanks to Putin's appointment. But other analysts speculate Surovikin has been set up as a fall guy, noting Putin claimed his appointment was made by the under-pressure defence minister Sergei Shoigu. Yuri Butusov, a Ukrainian military journalist insists that the appointment will not lead to a 'strengthening of the quality of management of Russian troops'. On Wednesday, pro-Kremlin officials were pulling out of Kherson, as Kyiv's forces advanced on territory in Russian hands since the war's earliest days. Kherson was the first major city to fall to Moscow's troops after the February invasion and retaking it would be a major prize in Ukraine's ongoing counter-offensive. Kyiv's recapturing of swathes of territory in the east and south has been followed by punishing missile and drone strikes that have demolished large parts of Ukraine's power grid ahead of winter. Evacuations got under way today as Vladimir Saldo, the Russian official overseeing occupied Kherson, said up to 60,000 people will be moved over the next six days - suggesting the city could fall within a week. The administration is also moving to the left bank of the Dnieper river, Saldo said on Russian state television, while vowing Russia would 'fight to the death' to regain full control. Surovikin on Tuesday said the situation in the city is 'tense' and that people living there will be 'resettled' in order 'to protect the lives of civilians and our service members'. 'We are not excluding the most difficult decisions,' he added. The city is located on the western bank of the Dnieper, the same side where Kyiv's troops have been moving forward in a counter-offensive that began in August. Saldo said the pull-out, along with the organised movement of civilians from the city, was a precaution. Pro-Russian officials have said civilians would only be allowed to leave towards Russia or Russian-held parts of Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have targeted bridges across the river to disrupt supply lines so Russian-installed officials said the evacuations were being done with ferries. Russia's Rossiya 24 state television channel showed images of people waiting to board ferries to cross the river. Ukraine meanwhile scrambled to rebuild damaged energy facilities across the country following a series of Russian strikes. Ukraine has warned of an emerging 'critical' risk to its power grid after repeated Russian bombardments had destroyed one third of the country's power facilities as winter approaches, according to the presidency. 'It's necessary for the whole country to prepare for electricity, water and heating outages,' Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the Ukrainian president's office, told Ukrainian television on Tuesday. Drones also bombarded Kyiv on Monday, leaving five dead, in what the presidency described as an attack of Russian desperation after a string of battlefield losses. Kyiv and its Western allies have accused Moscow of using Iranian-made drones in the strikes, a move Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky portrayed as a sign of Russia's failure. The Kremlin said on Tuesday it had no knowledge of its army using Iranian drones in Ukraine and Tehran has said the claims that it is providing Russia with weapons are 'baseless'."
2022-10-19,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11327611/What-happen-Russia-hit-major-city-nuke.html,"What happens if the nukes fall? Expert reveals which areas of London, New York and other cities will be instantly obliterated by Putin strike…and where you'd stand best chance of surviving","The idea of a nuclear attack on the West used to be the stuff of dystopian science fiction - but it is a hellish vision that Vladimir Putin has repeatedly invoked as his war in Ukraine falls apart. While most experts agree that an atomic attack on Paris, London, New York or Washington DC is still highly unlikely, it cannot be discounted. President Biden has personally warned that the world is now closer to 'Armageddon' than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis. It is not a reality any of us relish contemplating, but as we stare down the barrel of a new nuclear crisis between east and west it begs the question: What would actually happen if Russian nukes hit a major city? Here, MailOnline - with help from Dr Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute - unpacks what such a strike would look like, the grim toll it would cause, and the nightmare survivors would face... Hunkered down in his nuclear bunker deep within the Ural mountains, Vladimir Putin does the unthinkable and gives the order to launch atomic weapons at the West. Codes, contained within his Cheget Briefcase, are passed down the chain of command until they reach the crew of a missile silo. Moments later, an intercontinental ballistic missile streaks towards the atmosphere, breaking apart as it goes like a space rocket. It ends its journey high above Earth, releasing its nuclear warheads which are then positioned on target by a reentry vehicle and sent back down at supersonic speed - along with decoys to trick defence systems. Flight time from Russia to the UK for a nuclear weapon is around 15 minutes - half an hour for the US - so in all likelihood the first anyone in the street would know about an attack would be a blinding flash and a huge fireball wiping a city off the map. Dr Lewis explains using the example of a 500 kiloton nuclear bomb - more than thirty times the size of the Little Boy bomb that America dropped on Hiroshima, but far from the largest in Russia's arsenal. 'The first thing you'll get is a fireball that will vaporise everything inside of it,' he said. 'That's going to travel just over half a mile from the centre of the blast.' If dropped on Westminster, that would mean the Houses of Parliament, Downing Street, St Thomas's Hospital and Westminster Abbey being completely obliterated with a 100% kill rate for anyone inside at the time. Targeting New York's financial district would reduce One World Trade and the western end of the Brooklyn Bridge to ash. A blast above the White House would obliterate everything four blocks in all directions from Pennsylvania Avenue. Targeting Paris's Elysee Palace would vaporise Place de la Concorde and most of the Champs Elysees. 'Then you'll have shockwave that is going severely damage even really heavily built concrete buildings out to just over a mile from the blast, with everyone in that radius crushed to death', Dr Lewis added. For London, that would mean Buckingham Palace being flattened, along with Victoria and Waterloo stations - two of the city's busiest. The whole of Soho, half of Mayfair, The Oval cricket ground, virtually everything from Chelsea Bridge to Blackfriars, would be history. A similar-sized blast would flatten the entire lower end of Manhattan: Wall Street, the Manhattan Bridge, Chinatown, Little Italy - everything south of 2nd Street. For Washington, it would scrub almost the entire National Mall off the map - including the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, as far west as the Arlington Memorial Bridge and as far east as the National Gallery of Art. In Paris, the Arc de Triomphe would be no more. The Louvre, and all its artistic treasures including the Mona Lisa, would be smashed to smithereens. 'That blast wave will keep rolling - it will drop off severely, but it will keep going - destroying buildings and causing casualties out until about two and a half miles,' Dr Lewis said. In London, that encompasses the Tower of London and Battersea Power station. Most of Hyde Park, half of Regent's Park, Chelsea, Knightsbridge and Belgravia. The damage would span from Camden to Brixton. In New York, that would devastate everything south of 30th street. The Flatiron Building, Madison Square Park, Union Park, the whole of the Lower East Side and West Village. The blast wave would roll over Brooklyn Heights and Jersey City. The Statue of Liberty would likely fall into New York Harbor. Notre Dame, the Eiffel Tower, and Garde du Nord station in Paris would likely be damaged beyond repair. In Washington, the Capitol, Jefferson Memorial, and half of Arlington National Cemetery would be lucky to survive. Everyone within that radius would also be given an extremely high dose of radiation. For many people it would prove fatal, but even among survivors up to 15 per cent would likely die later of cancer linked to the blast. Dr Lewis adds: 'Radiation poisoning is just a really cruel, miserable way to die. The immediate effects are vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea - people can rally and seem much better, perhaps for hours or days - but then the symptoms return and get much worse.' Acute radiation exposure kills because it badly damages both blood vessels and bone marrow, weakening veins and arteries and affecting your body's ability to make white blood cells that fight off disease. Most people who die from radiation poisoning die because they contract an infection that their body can no longer fight - effectively rotting alive - or else their blood vessels burst and they bleed to death internally. The process can take weeks to play out, and recovery - if it comes at all - can take up to two years. But that is hardly the last effect of a nuclear blast. The shockwave does not stop there but actually keeps rolling out to around six miles from the epicentre, shattering windows and causing injuries as it goes. Within that radius, anyone directly exposed to the heat of the blast is also likely to suffer horrifying and potentially lethal burns in a 'gruesome lottery', Dr Lewis explains. 'If you're inside a building you're probably OK, but if you're exposed you're likely to have third degree burns all over your body,' he said. 'You might get lucky and be behind a hill, or you might get unlucky and the same hill reflects a shockwave on to you that kills you.' And that's before considering the effects of nuclear fallout. The amount of fallout caused would depend on the kind blast Russia opted for: An airburst, where the bomb is detonated some distance above the ground to maximise the effects of the shockwave, causes relatively little. But a groundburst - where the bomb goes off close to the earth - would produce a huge amount of ash that would be sucked up into the fireball and surrounding mushroom cloud, and then come falling back down. If it mixes with clouds then it may fall as black rain - as happened after Hiroshima - or flakes of ash may come drifting down like snow, as happened after the botched US nuclear test on Bikini Atoll during the Cold War. Those living on the surrounding islands recall the flakes falling and - not knowing what they were - described how children caught them on their tongues. How far this spread would depend on the vagaries of the weather, but it could well drift up to 20 miles from the impact. That would take it outside London's M25, shower Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport, pass Yonkers in New York, or travel roughly halfway from DC to Baltimore. Again, Dr Lewis returns to the idea of a 'gruesome lottery'. 'You'll get fairly serious radiation contamination [within that area],' he says. 'Some of those people will get quite ill. Though hiding in your house for a few days might make a real difference.' The blast may also produce a 'fire storm' similar to forest fires, where the amount of oxygen being sucked into the blaze produces its own weather systems - driving the inferno further and faster than it would otherwise spread. That could cause damage many times greater than the blast itself, Dr Lewis believes, though the actual extent of it would be largely a mystery until the bomb went off. 'A fire storm did start in Hiroshima after it was bombed, because the city had a lot of wooden buildings,' he said. 'But then, so did Nagasaki, and there was no fire storm. We don't really know why. And we have no idea how a modern city would burn.' Even then, that would be far from the end of the bomb's effects. While it is easy to focus on the over-awing power of the blast itself, the knock-on effects are perhaps even more terrifying. In the aftermath, there would be hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of people suffering burns, broken bones, cuts and other injuries while most if not all of the hospitals in the blast zones would have been reduced to rubble and the doctors who keep them running killed. In the case of strikes on London, Washington or Paris, the government would be in chaos - if it survived at all - and its ability to coordinate an effective response to such a disaster would be extremely limited. Energy, food and water supplies would all either be cut off or badly reduced, further worsening the situation, while transport links such as roads and rails would be ruined - delaying the arrival of help. On top of which, piles of dead bodies would be havens for pests and disease to spread among a population with devastated immune systems, opening the door to epidemics. And that's if Russia only dropped one bomb. If Putin were to decide to attack multiple cities in the same country at the same time, Dr Lewis says the possibility of society completely breaking down is 'not trivial'. In the event of all-out nuclear war between states, the amount of dust kicked into the atmosphere would be so severe that it would reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches Earth - blighting crops, killing fish, and causing global famine in a so-called nuclear winter. What happens after that, including whether humanity itself could survive in such conditions, is the subject of deep and rather abstract speculation among experts - and none of it is good. 'It is a common joke among nuclear experts that the best advice in the event of a strike is to make sure you die in the first wave,' Dr Lewis says, grimly. Asked if he had any advice for Putin in light of his nuclear sabre-rattling, Dr Lewis added simply: 'This is not a game. Don't screw around with this.'"
2022-10-19,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11331035/Fears-Putin-declare-war-Ukraine-resort-nukes-Kherson-look-set-fall.html,"Putin brings in martial law in annexed Ukrainian territory amid fears he will move to full war footing and detonate a nuke over Black Sea - as 'General Armageddon' evacuates 60,000 people before Battle of Kherson","Vladimir Putin has declared martial law in the occupied regions of Ukraine as officials began evacuating civilians from the city of Kherson, with a battle for control of the stronghold now looming. Putin said the order will come into effect from midnight in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions - giving him sweeping powers to curtail the freedoms of civilians, repurpose industries, and press-gang Ukrainians into his armed forces to fight their fellow countrymen, though it is unclear if all these powers will be used. The order also affects occupied Crimea and Krasnodar, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk, and Rostov, all of which are on Russia's own territory bordering Ukraine. It is unclear exactly what measures will come into force here, though Putin's order stops short of calling it full martial law. Putin made the announcement shortly after Sergei Surovikin, his new commander in Ukraine, said the situation in Kherson is 'tense'. Evacuations got under way there today as Vladimir Saldo, the Kremlin's man in the city, said up to 60,000 people will be moved in the next six days - suggesting it could come under attack within a week. The administration is also moving, Saldo added, though vowed Russia would 'fight to the death' to regain full control. If Putin's army is forced to flee then the defeat would be the most humiliating it has suffered to date, raising fears of further escalation. Speculation has been growing that Putin could be preparing some kind of nuclear show of force, including the first open-air detonation of an atomic weapon since the 1960s - potentially over the Black Sea - with Downing Street today warning that he will face 'severe consequences' if nukes are used. Vladimir Putin has declared martial law in occupied regions of Ukraine - Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - and additional but less-severe measures in Crimea, and the Russian regions bordering Ukraine. This gives him sweeping powers to repurpose local industry to help the war effort, restrict the movement of civilians, commandeer goods or properties deemed necessary for troops, ban elections and gatherings, and impose curfew. It also allows Putin to declare partial or total mobilisation and press-gang Ukrainians into his armed forces to fight their own countrymen, though it is unclear whether and to what extent he will use this power. Putin's order also affects occupied Crimea along with the Russian regions of Krasnodar, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk, and Rostov. This includes similar limitations on movement, and 'mobilising' the local economy for the war effort. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, denied that the order will involve closing Russia's borders - after hundreds of thousands fled the country in recent weeks rather than risk being drafted into the army. Prime Minister Liz Truss's spokesman issued the statement as Defence Minister Ben Wallace attended last-minute talks at the Pentagon, though refused to comment on the subject of those talks directly. At the same time, Russian missiles continued to rain down on the capital Kyiv today - again targeting Ukraine's battered power network as winter sets in and temperatures plunge. Authorities said Ukrainian soldiers shot down four Russian cruise missiles and 10 Iranian-made drones during the attack. Air raid sirens rang out for more than three hours, sending people into the capital's subway stations for shelter from the blasts. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, announced that the so-called heating season - when authorities pump heat to urban buildings - will begin on Thursday, several days earlier than usual. Klitschko said the early step was being taken so that Kyiv residents do not overload the beleaguered power supply system by turning on electric heaters and air conditioning units. Ukraine said its military had shot down more than 220 Iranian-made drones in a little more than one month. Dr Stepan Stepanenko, research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, told MailOnline: 'The meeting of the Russian security council is a frequent occurrence, being held regularly by the head of the Kremlin. 'Unfortunately, it is also through these meetings that he presents the unthinkable and implicates the council members for a sense of collective responsibility, or political unity as it is being presented to the home crowd. 'The rapid departure of Ben Wallace to the US is a clear sign that Putin's threats are being taken seriously but remains reactionary and it may be a little too late. 'The US and the UK had a chance to act before the Russian ""not a bluff"" statement to bolster Ukrainian defence. 'They had a chance to act before the Iranian drones hit power stations and homes in Ukraine. The collective West is playing Putin's game by reacting to his every move instead of pre-empting.' Putin's announcement came as Ukrainian forces advanced in territory held by Moscow for months. 'The Kyiv regime refused to recognise the will of the people, rejects any proposals for negotiation, gunfire continues, civilians are dying,' the 70-year-old Russian leader said. He accused Ukraine of using 'terrorist methods'. 'They send sabotage groups into our territory,' he said, claiming Moscow had foiled other attacks after its Crimea bridge was targeted 'including at our nuclear power facilities'. 'We are working on solving very complex large-scale tasks to ensure security and protect the future of Russia,' he added. He also ordered the establishment of a coordination committee to increase interaction between government agencies in dealing with the fighting in Ukraine that he continued to call a 'special military operation'. In televised remarks at the start of a security council meeting, he said: 'Those who are on the front lines or undergoing training at firing ranges and training centres should feel our support and know that they have our big, great country and unified people behind their back.' Increasing the unease is the fact that Russia is expected to carry out an annual test of its nuclear weapons within days in an exercise dubbed 'Grom', but has not yet notified Washington when it will take place. By Jason Groves for the Daily Mail New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt had refused to commit to the Prime Minister's pledge to raise defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade. Mr Hunt said 'everything' was on the table as part of a brutal round of spending cuts to save £40billion by the end of the month. But Downing Street backed down yesterday after armed forces minister James Heappey warned both he and the Defence Secretary Ben Wallace would resign if it was dropped. The pledge, which experts say could cost £157billion, is now one of the few Government promises protected from the spending review. No 10 refused to say whether Miss Truss would even stand by her pledge this month to raise pensions in line with inflation. Mr Heappey said the increased defence spending was essential to meet the security threats facing the UK. Under treaties governing the use of nuclear weapons, Russia is supposed to inform the US before carrying out nuclear drills to avoid the risk that a test is mistaken for an actual launch - which could prompt a potentially-devastating response. Likewise, the US is supposed to give notice to Moscow. 'No, we have not received any type of official notification,' a US military official said on Monday. At the same time, Nato is carrying out exercises involving its own nuclear forces with long-range bombers, fighters and refuelling planes currently in the skies above Belgium, the North Sea and the UK. 'The exercise, which runs until 30 October, is a routine, recurring training activity and it is not linked to any current world events,' the alliance declared on its webpage last week. Officially, Putin's security meeting today is to discuss 'neutralising threats to national security in the migration sphere' but within Russia there is speculation that the main topic is likely to be the war in Ukraine. Increasing fears is the fact that the session is due to take place remotely - meaning Putin may not be in Moscow and could instead be holed up in his nuclear bunker in the Ural Mountains. But Foreign Secretary James Cleverly sought to calm anxieties on Wednesday by suggesting Mr Wallace was actually in Washington to talk about Russia's latest tactics in Ukraine - using suicide drones and missiles to blow up power plants - and not nukes. Mr Cleverly said the talks Mr Wallace was involved in were a 'normal and regular part of what is frankly a very abnormal and perverse situation'. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'The Defence Secretary is in Washington DC to discuss shared security concerns, including Ukraine. He will be visiting his counterpart at the Pentagon and senior figures at the White House.' A spokesman for Lloyd Austin, the US secretary of defence, said they discussed the 'ongoing support to Ukraine by our two nations, as well as the continued importance of transatlantic and regional security cooperation in light of Russia's attack in Ukraine'. Mr Wallace's emergency talks came ahead of a delivery of new Nato systems which will bolster Ukraine's air defences against strikes on civilians from kamikaze drones and missiles. Russia has been firing an increased number of rockets and drones at Ukraine following several embarrassing weeks of retreats on the battlefield. The use of drones, believed to be from Iran, may suggest their stockpiles of 'high-precision, long-range, significantly sized warheads' are running low. Sources in Tehran told Reuters that Iran is planning to send more drones and surface-to-surface missiles to Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Putin's targeting of power supplies, a crime under the laws of armed conflict, was 'causing massive blackouts' with hospitals forced on to back-up generators. 'No space left for negotiations with Putin's regime,' Mr Zelensky said 'The terrorist state will not change anything for itself with such actions. 'It will only confirm its destructive and murderous essence, for which it will certainly be held to account.' The energy facilities that have been targeted recently include in the city of Zhytomyr, west of the capital Kyiv, which was left without electricity and water, as well as in Kyiv and Dnipro. Mr Cleverly said: 'Putin failed to capture Ukrainian towns and cities with tanks, now he tries cowardly drone attacks. 'These are the desperate acts of a man losing a war on the battlefield. It's why we sent air defence missiles. He won't break the Ukrainians or our resolve to stand with them.' The advanced medium-range air-to-air missile rockets are able to knock cruise missiles and drones such as Iran's Shahed-136 out of the sky. Ukraine will also receive a fleet of drones from Nato to be used to gather intelligence. The Ministry of Defence wrote in its daily intelligence briefing that 'a key objective of this strike campaign is to cause widespread damage to Ukraine's energy distribution network'. 'As Russia has suffered battlefield setbacks since August, it has highly likely gained a greater willingness to strike civilian infrastructure,' it added. Vladimir Putin's blitz plunges Ukraine into darkness: Missile attacks knock out one in three power stations as war-torn nation faces winter By James Franey in Kyiv for the Daily Mail Ukraine's energy supplies are at critical lows after Russian strikes, Kyiv warned last night. A missile and drone blitz has knocked out a third of the country's power stations in just eight days as winter approaches, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Further drone attacks on energy supplies left parts of the capital without electricity for several hours yesterday. At least three residents were killed. Officials said 1,162 towns or villages across 16 Ukrainian regions were now without power. Mr Zelensky said Vladimir Putin's targeting of power supplies, a crime under the laws of armed conflict, was 'causing massive blackouts' with hospitals forced on to back-up generators. 'No space left for negotiations with Putin's regime,' Mr Zelensky said, once again ruling out the prospect of peace talks with the Kremlin despot. 'The terrorist state will not change anything for itself with such actions,' he added. 'It will only confirm its destructive and murderous essence, for which it will certainly be held to account.' The main power station in the central city of Dnipro, the gateway to Ukraine's partially occupied industrial heartland of the Donbas, was also hit. And Zhytomyr, home to military bases and key industries west of Kyiv, was left without energy. Mayor Serhiy Sukhomlyn said 150,000 of its 250,000 residents were still without electricity last night. Pavlo Raboschuk, a 33-year-old computer repairman in Zhytomyr, said he was ready 'for a tough and dark winter' with dehydrated foods, warm clothes and batteries stockpiled at home. 'Only swear words come to mind,' he added. Iryna Kolodzynska, a school headmistress, managed to have students back at their desks within 30 minutes of the air raid all-clear. 'We must not break down,' she said. 'There are regions that suffered much more from the war than we did.' Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian president's office, said: 'The situation is critical now across the country because our regions are dependent on one another. The whole country should prepare for electricity, water and heating outages.' Oleksandr Khorunzhyi, a spokesman for Ukraine's emergency services, said more than 70 people have been killed and 240 injured since Russia's assault began last Monday. In the north east, Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv, some 25 miles from the border with Russia, was hit with eight missiles. The UK Ministry of Defence wrote in its daily intelligence briefing that 'a key objective of this strike campaign is to cause widespread damage to Ukraine's energy distribution network'. 'As Russia has suffered battlefield setbacks since August, it has highly likely gained a greater willingness to strike civilian infrastructure,' the MoD declared. A senior Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said kamikaze drones supplied to Moscow by Iran were being used because Russian missiles were running out. 'Our assessment is that the ability for the Russians to continue with these saturating barrages of precision weapons is getting to the point now where this will be unsustainable,' the source said. But pro-Kremlin Telegram channels lavished praise on Putin for attacking energy infrastructure in civilian areas. Moscow denied it was using Iranian drones. 'Russian tech is being used,' Putin's chief propagandist Dmitry Peskov said."

The two Tu-95 Bear-H bombers were 'positively' identified flying in the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) on Monday, according to NORAD - a combined defense organization between America and Canada. Two USAF F-16 jets intercepted it before it could enter American or Canadian airspace, but the planes 'remained in international airspace.' NORAD did not see the spotting of the two jets as a 'threat, nor is the activity provocative.' 'NORAD tracks and positively identifies foreign military aircraft that enter the ADIZ. NORAD routinely monitors foreign aircraft movements and as necessary, escorts them from the ADIZ,' the organization said. The spotting comes as tensions build since Russia invaded Ukraine. The US has provided billions in aid to Ukraine and continues to impose sanctions on Russia. Vladimir Putin recently warned of 'global catastrophe' if NATO troops clash directly with Russia, adding that he sees no need to carry out massive strikes against Ukraine 'for now.' The Russian strongman also said the recent military mobilization he ordered is coming to an end, and he has no plans for further conscriptions once it has finished. He also repeated the Kremlin position that Russia was willing to hold talks, although he said they would require international mediation if Ukraine was willing to take part. He said he currently saw no need for 'massive strikes' on Ukraine now having hit their intended targets earlier in the last week - but that could change in the future - and insisted that it was not his goal to destroy Ukraine. 'There is no need now for massive strikes. There are other tasks. For now. And then it will be clear,' he said, adding: 'We do not set ourselves the task of destroying Ukraine. No, of course not,' Putin said at the The Commonwealth of Independent States Summit. Fears have risen in throughout the war over the possibility of Moscow launching nuclear strikes, especially suffering a series of embarrassing setbacks in Putin's invasion. It was revealed on Friday - shortly before he spoke in Astana - that Putin has increased the number of his strategic nuclear bombers stationed at an airbase near the Finnish and Norwegian borders, satellite images show. He went on to say that the 'partial mobilization' he announced last month, which the defense minister said aimed to recruit 300,000 soldiers, was finishing and would be over within two weeks. 'Nothing additional is planned. No proposals have been received from the defense ministry and I don't see any additional need in the foreseeable future. 'Now 222,000 people have been mobilized out of 300,000. Within about two weeks, all mobilization activities will be completed.' A total of 33,000 of them are already in military units and 16,000 are involved in the military operation in Ukraine, he said. He said his decision to call-up of reserve forces to fight in Ukraine, criticized as chaotic by some Kremlin allies, had been vital to hold the front line. 'The line of contact is 680 miles so it is practically impossible to hold it with forces formed only of contract soldiers, especially since they take part in offensive activities,' Putin claimed. Asked if he had any regrets over ordering the invasion of his neighboring country on February 24, Putin said: 'No.' He acknowledged that the war us unpleasant, but said he believed what his forces were doing was right. 'I want to make it clear: what is happening today is unpleasant, to put it mildly, but we would have got the same thing a little later, only in worse conditions for us, that's that,' he said. 'So we are acting correctly and in a timely manner.' Putin said he 'doesn't see the need' for talks with US President Joe Biden over an end to the war, but suggested he was open to talks with Kyiv. 'We should ask him if he's ready to hold such talks with me or not. I don't see the need, to be honest,' Putin said, asked about a potential meeting with Biden on the sidelines of a G20 summit in November. He added that his participation in the summit hosted by Indonesia is not yet decided. 'The question of my trip there has not been finalized. Russia will certainly take part. As for the format, we're still thinking about it,' Putin told reporters following a summit in Kazakhstan. Speaking earlier this week, Biden said he had 'no intention' of meeting with Putin but did not rule out potential talks. He also attacked Germany for siding with NATO. '(Germany) must decide what is more important for them: the fulfillment of alliance obligations, as they see it, or their national interests. In this case, it seems that Germany placed its obligations to the (NATO) alliance above all. I believe that this is a mistake,' he said. 'German citizens, businesses, and its economy are paying for this mistake, because it has negative economic consequences for the eurozone as a whole, and in Germany. But very few people take into account its interests, otherwise Nord Stream 1 and 2 would not have been undermined. 'But although one branch remains, as I said, in working order, a decision has not been made and is unlikely to be made. But this is no longer our business, this is the business of our partners.' Meanwhile, Lukashenko warned Ukraine and the West on Friday not to force his ally Russia into a corner, saying Moscow had nuclear weapons for a reason."
2022-10-19,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11330205/Defence-Secretary-Ben-Wallace-jets-amid-fears-Putin-launch-nuclear-force.html,West holds its breath over Putin's nuke threat: Defence Secretary Ben Wallace jets to US for talks amid spies' fears the Russian despot WILL detonate nuclear bomb over the Black Sea - as Kremlin promotes Chechnya veteran nicknamed 'General Armageddon',"There are serious concerns Vladimir Putin will make a 'nuclear show of force' after Defence Secretary Ben Wallace flew to Washington yesterday for emergency talks with the Pentagon. A third of Ukraine was left without power as the new head of Russia's armed forces Sergei Suvorikin, nicknamed 'General Armageddon', launched a series of missile and drone strikes. At least three residents were killed and now 1,162 towns or villages across 16 Ukrainian regions are without power as the general, who is suspected of using chemical weapons in Syria, targeted critical infrastructure. Following the attack, Mr Wallace cancelled a meeting with MPs and travelled Washington DC to discuss 'security concerns'. Fears are mounting that the Russian president is considering detonating a low-yield nuclear warhead over the Black Sea - after he said last month that he is prepared to do so in order to defend Russia's 'territorial integrity'. A security source told The Sun that 'the threat has increased recently'. While General Surovikin admitted he was preparing contingency plans for the fall of Kherson and said he would evacuate the entire city if Ukrainian attacks continue. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said yesterday that 'we are at a time when these sorts of conversations are necessary'. By Jason Groves for the Daily Mail New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt had refused to commit to the Prime Minister’s pledge to raise defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade.

By Jason Groves Political Editor for The Daily Mail Liz Truss retreated over defence cuts yesterday after senior ministers threatened to quit. New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt had refused to commit to the Prime Minister’s pledge to raise defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade. Mr Hunt said ‘everything’ was on the table as part of a brutal round of spending cuts to save £40billion by the end of the month. But Downing Street backed down yesterday after armed forces minister James Heappey warned both he and the Defence Secretary Ben Wallace would resign if it was dropped. The pledge, which experts say could cost £157billion, is now one of the few Government promises protected from the spending review. No 10 refused to say whether Miss Truss would even stand by her pledge this month to raise pensions in line with inflation. Mr Heappey said the increased defence spending was essential to meet the security threats facing the UK. Asked directly if he would resign if the pledge was dropped, he told LBC radio: ‘Yeah, we need to be spending 3 per cent of our GDP on defence of our nation by 2030 because there is no prosperity without security.’ He also indicated that Mr Wallace – seen as a potential candidate to replace Miss Truss – was ready to resign over the issue. The public warning triggered an immediate reversal from Downing Street. On Saturday Mr Hunt refused to confirm the pledge would survive, saying: ‘We do need to increase defence spending but I can’t make a promise to you here and now about the timings of that. ‘The long-term ability to fund an increase in defence spending will depend on stability in the economic situation and a healthily growing economy.’ A defence source said at the weekend that Mr Wallace saw the issue as a major priority, adding: ‘The Defence Secretary will hold the PM to the pledges made. ‘The Prime Minister made clear in her leadership campaign and since that she wants 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2026 and 3 per cent by 2030 to be spent on defence. We are working on that basis. ‘Current world events, and allies’ commitments, show that defence is not a “discretionary” spend but a priority.’ Yesterday the PM’s official spokesman signalled a climbdown, saying the 2030 target would remain in place. ‘We are obviously committed to maintaining the UK’s position at the forefront of Nato, that’s why the PM committed to raise defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP by 2030,’ he said. ‘The shape of that increase will be set out at future spending reviews in the normal way.’ The Treasury still looks set for a major battle with the Ministry of Defence over the speed at which spending rises to meet the target. Downing Street refused to commit to the target to raise it from its current level of 2.2 per cent of GDP to 2.5 per cent by 2026. A defence source said an even trajectory of spending increases was needed to allow the armed forces to build up capacity over time. ‘It takes time to generate and train new forces – you can’t just switch them on,’ they said. But Mr Hunt told the Cabinet yesterday that ‘all’ departments would have to contribute to a major efficiency drive in a bid to balance the Government’s books. Mr Heappey said: ‘I am confident that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor, and the Foreign Secretary, and everyone else around Government, understands the importance of investing in our nation’s armed forces.’ Vladimir Putin's blitz plunges Ukraine into darkness: Missile attacks knock out one in three power stations as war-torn nation faces winter By James Franey in Kyiv for the Daily Mail Ukraine's energy supplies are at critical lows after Russian strikes, Kyiv warned last night.

It was the first all-female exchange,’ said Andriy Yermak, the Ukraine presidency’s chief of staff, on social media. Mr Yermak said some Ukrainians exchanged were mothers and daughters who had been held together. Thirty-seven, he added, had surrendered at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol. Images released by Kyiv showed dozens of women disembarking from white buses. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said ‘96 [swapped prisoners] are servicewomen, including 37 evacuees from Azovstal, and 12 are civilians’. He added: ‘The more Russian prisoners we have, the sooner we will be able to free our heroes.’ Denis Pushilin, head of the breakaway region of Donetsk, said that out of 110 people agreed in the swap, two decided to stay in Russia. Moscow said that 72 people returned from Ukraine were the crew of civilian ships held since February. It added that all of those returned would be flown to Moscow and provided with medical and psychological assistance.

The heart-wrenching report details how Russian troops, while occupying a village in the Chernihiv region, also raped an 83-year-old woman in her house in front of her physically disabled husband. A 56-year-old woman, from a village in the Kyiv region, also revealed in horrific testimony of how three Russian soldiers broke into her home, with two of them gang-raping her while the third one watched. These testimonies - and there are many more within the report - show how Russian soldiers have used rape as a weapon of war in the eight months since the barbaric invasion began. The report also details how Russian soldiers conducted summary executions - executions without trial or due process - in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and the Summy regions, with the youngest victim being a 14-year-old boy. In the report, the members of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine said they had also documented patterns of torture, ill-treatment and unlawful confinement committed in areas occupied by Russian armed forces - all of which amount to war crimes. The report detailed how Russian soldiers raped women and girls in their homes or took them and raped them in unoccupied dwellings - leading some to consider committing suicide. In many cases, the Russian soldiers would shoot dead the women's husbands - or threaten to do so - as soon as they tried to defend their wives and stop them from being raped. In March this year, two Russian soldiers burst into a young family's home in the Kyiv region and raped a 22-year-old woman several times before sexually abusing her husband. The two soldiers then forced the traumatised couple to have sex in front of them. One of the soldiers then forced the couple's four-year-old daughter to perform oral sex on him. 'In most cases, these acts of rape also amount to torture and cruel or inhumane treatment for the victims and for relatives who were forced to watch,' the report says. In another village in the Kyiv region, a Russian soldier entered a home and tried to drag a 50-year-old woman from the house. Her husband desperately tried to defend his wife, but the Russian soldier shot him. The soldier took the woman to a nearby empty house where he raped her until a Russian armed forces military unit arrived and took him away, the report says. Her husband died two days later from his injuries as he could not be taken to hospital. In the Chernihiv region, an 83-year-old woman told investigators how she was raped by occupied Russian forces in her house where her physically disabled husband was also present. In the Kyiv region, a 56-year-old women told investigators how three Russian soldiers broke into her home. Two of them gang-raped her while the third one watched. Before leaving the house, the soldiers stole food and money from her. The woman learned to weeks later that her husband had been tortured and executed by Russian soldiers. Rape has historically been used as a weapon of war - in Bosnia in 1992, Rwanda in 1994 and Darfur in 2003 to name but a few instances. Russian soldiers have also been known to use rape as a weapon of war in the past. The Soviet Red Army solders raped an estimated two million German women after the fall of Hitler's Third Reich at the end of the Second World War. The true scale of wartime rape - and now in Ukraine - will continue to remain unknown as many women remain silent about their experiences for fear of being stigmatised. One Ukrainian victim, who had been raped by Russian troops, told the Commission: 'This experience is very shameful for me and I am extremely scared and intimidated'. The report says: 'Stigma that continues to surround sexual violence requires patience until victims feel safe and adequately cared for to speak out about what happened.' One psychologist who has worked with the Ukrainian survivors said: 'All victims with whom I am working are blaming themselves for being spotted by perpetrators and being raped.' Systematic mass rape campaigns use forced impregnation as a tool to ethnically cleanse a nation and psychologically traumatize generations of people. The children born as a result of this wartime rape are often stigmatised themselves as they become a 'living reminder of the conflict', academics say. Russia invaded Ukraine back in February as Putin ordered what was supposed to be a days-long 'special military operation' to topple the government. But he now finds himself bogged down in an eight-month long war that looks set to continue for months longer at least, and suffering huge losses. Ukrainian resistance has proved fiercer than almost all observers expected, and has been spurred on by atrocities that Russia troops have committed in occupied areas. Back in April, after Putin's men withdrew from areas around the capital Kyiv, mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of civilians were uncovered. Survivors of the occupation told how Russian soldiers hunted down anyone suspected of working with the government or military to interrogate and torture - some were ultimately killed. Others told how soldiers came to their homes, beat or raped them, stole, and then fled as Ukraine's forces advanced. Kyiv argues that Moscow is fighting a genocidal war aimed at wiping out their national identity by murdering innocents, deporting people into Russia, and systemic rapes. Putin denies that his armed forces are deliberately targeting civilians."
2022-10-18,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11328437/Kevin-McCarthy-warns-Ukraine-wont-blank-check-GOP-led-Congress.html,Republican leader Kevin McCarthy warns Ukraine won't get a 'blank check' in GOP-led Congress: Says recession fears will dominate with the US having already given Kyiv $66billion,"A Republican-led Congress may grow weary of cutting checks to Ukraine, GOP leader Kevin McCarthy warned as Congress has already offered some $66 billion since the start of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion. 'I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they're not going to write a blank check to Ukraine. They just won't do it,' the Republican leader, who stands to cinch the speakership if his party takes back the House, told Punchbowl News in an interview published Tuesday. 'It's not a free blank check. And then there's the things [the Biden administration] is not doing domestically. Not doing the border and people begin to weigh that. Ukraine is important, but at the same time it can't be the only thing they do and it can't be a blank check.' In next month's midterm elections Republicans are favored to take back the House and have a chance at taking control of the Senate. Ukraine aid so far has had broad bipartisan consensus, but Republican grumblings over the cost and the lack of accountability as to where it goes have grown with each fading month the Russia-Ukraine war drags on. Such a threat could prompt the Biden administration to push for a year-long aid package during the lame duck session between November and January, should Republicans capture either chamber. McCarthy's remarks come as Russian strikes over the past week have knocked out power for a third of Ukraine, so says President Volodymyr Zelensky. He asked the U.S. and other G7 nations for modern air defense systems. Putin is set to deploy 9,000 troops to Belarus on its border with Ukraine, sparking fears that a fresh ground assault on the Ukrainian capital could be imminent. It comes as Russia also threatened to equip Belarusian warplanes with nuclear missile capability after Russian soldiers came flooding across the border 'by the trainload' on Saturday. The Belarusian border, which lies 140 miles from Kyiv, was used as a launchpad for Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February. Lawmakers tacked another $12.2 billion in aid to a stopgap spending bill last month. One day later on September 28 the Defense Department offered another $1.1 billion in security assistance. On October 15 the DoD announced another $725 milllion in security assistance for Ukraine. Congress initially offered $13.6 billion to Ukraine in March at the onset of the invasion and topped it off with a $40 billion aid package in May. About half of the $54 billion has been targeted toward security aid through the Department of Defense, the other half has gone through the Department of State and other aid agencies. The Republican Study Committee, the largest conservative caucus in the House, criticized the most recent $12 billion in aid. All but 10 House Republicans voted against the stopgap funding bill, but largely because they felt they had been locked out of negotiations and wanted government funding to run until the new Congress in January. As of September, about 37 percent of Americans believe the U.S. is giving about the right amount of aid to Ukraine, 20 percent think too much and 18 percent think not enough, according to Pew Research. Thirty-two percent of Republicans thought the U.S. is giving too much aid, 30 percent thought just enough. Rep. Michael McCaul, top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, still thinks the U.S. could do more aid. 'Once we finally gave them what they needed, like the HIMARS, they started winning and they're beating them,' McCaul said according to the Dallas Morning News. 'And I don't understand [opposition to Ukraine aid]. I grew up during the Cold War and I thought killing Russians was a good thing.'"
2022-10-18,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11326397/White-House-plans-release-15-MILLION-barrels-oil-USs-emergency-stockpile.html,White House 'plans to release another 15 MILLION barrels of oil' from the US's emergency stockpile this week in a bid to balance markets and crack down on rocketing gas prices,"Joe Biden is planning to release up to 15million barrels of oil from the US's emergency oil reserves as he tries to stem soaring gasoline prices. The oil release would be the latest portion of a deal Biden struck last spring to release 180million barrels of oil from energy companies. His administration is planning to announce the latest reserve release later this week, according to Bloomberg. Biden said last week gasoline prices are too high and he would have more to say about lowering the costs this week. David Turk, the president's deputy energy secretary, also said last week the administration can tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in coming weeks and months as necessary to stabilize oil. News of the move to temper gasoline prices come just weeks before the pivotal midterm elections will put Biden's approval to the test. A source familiar with the White House deliberations said Biden was looking to ease gas prices before the midterms. 'The administration has a small window ahead of midterms to try to lower fuel prices, or at least demonstrate that they are trying,' the unnamed source said. 'The White House did not like $4 a gallon gas and it has signaled that it will take action to prevent that again,' they added. Average US gasoline prices hit about $3.89 a gallon on Monday, up about 20 cents from a month ago and 56 cents higher than last year at this time, according to the AAA motor group. Gasoline prices hit a record average above $5.00 in June. Last May, the Department of Energy said it would launch bids late this year for a buy-back of about one third of the 180 million barrel sale. It suggested then that deliveries would be linked to lower oil prices and lower demand, likely after fiscal year 2023, which ends September 30 next year. Two sources said the buy-backs could continue through 2025. Biden officials in recent months also urged oil refiners including Exxon Mobil Chevron and Valero to not increase exports of fuel and warned them it could take actions if plants do not build inventories. The administration has not taken a potential ban of gasoline and diesel exports off the table although opponents of such a move say it could exacerbate Europe's energy crisis and raise fuel prices at home. In addition, the administration is mandated by a law Congress passed years ago to sell another 26 million barrels of SPR oil in fiscal year 2023, which started October 1. News of the president's latest plans for oil come he announced said he would 'reassess' the US's alliance with the oil-rich Saudis for their support to Russia, a move was sure to jack up gas prices just ahead of midterm elections. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's cousin issued a violent threat against those who 'challenge' Saudi Arabia after Biden warned there would be 'consequences' for OPEC cutting oil production. In a message aimed at 'the West,' Saud al-Shaalan is seen in a video saying 'anybody who challenges the existence of this kingdom, we are all projects of jihad and martyrdom. Anybody that thinks they can threaten us.' Al-Shaalan's threat comes at a time of sky-high tensions between Washington and Riyadh after OPEC+ cut oil production by two million barrels per day and the Biden administration accused the Saudi Kingdom of aligning itself with Russia and Putin. Biden claimed that Riyadh would face 'consequences' as aides announced the US would be reevaluating its relationship with the Saudis. 'There's going to be some consequences for what they've done with Russia,' Biden said in a CNN interview aired last Tuesday. 'I'm not going to get into what I'd consider and what I have in mind,' he added. 'But there will be - there will be consequences.' The Kingdom then hit back with bombshell statement that the Biden administration had requested to delay the OPEC production cut until after the midterms. The White House is now bracing for a further spike in gas prices before millions of Americans are set to cast their ballots. 'The country that benefits the most from this 2 million barrel cut is Russia,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said in a call with reporters on Friday. The cut 'allows [Putin] to continue to fund his war making machine and it certainly gave him, Mr Putin, a sense of comfort here,' Kirby continued. The Saudi foreign minister said such an accusation is intended to 'distort the facts' and claimed Saudi Arabia has taken a 'principled position' with respect to the Russia-Ukraine war. Biden himself had a controversial meeting with the crown prince, beginning with a fist bump rather than a handshake, in July to talk energy production. 'The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would first like to express its total rejection of these statements that are not based on facts, and which are based on portraying the OPEC+ decision out of its purely economic context,' bin Farhan Al Saud said in a statement. The foreign minister said that Saudi Arabia supports UN resolutions regarding the war and rejects 'any infringement on the sovereignty of countries over their territories.' 'The Government of the Kingdom clarified through its continuous consultation with the U.S. Administration that all economic analyses indicate that postponing the OPEC+ decision for a month, according to what has been suggested, would have had negative economic consequences,' bin Farhan Al Saud said. But Kirby said Washington presented Riyadh with analysis showing there was 'no market basis' for production cuts and 'they could easily wait till the next OPEC meeting and see how things developed.' 'Other OPEC nations communicated to us privately that they felt coerced to support Saudi's direction.' In a press call Kirby said Saudi Arabia had been 'twisting arms' to get other nations to agree to the cut, and 'more than one' had privately expressed concerns about doing so. Oil prices climbed on Tuesday, bolstered by a weaker U.S. dollar and supply woes, although gains were capped by the spectre of lower fuel demand from China as it persists with its stringent zero-COVID policy. Brent crude futures rose 74 cents, or 0.8%, to $92.36 per barrel by 0505 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 78 cents, or 0.9%, to $86.24 per barrel. The U.S. dollar index - which measures the greenback against six major peers including sterling - sagged near a one and a half week low as Britain's dramatic U-turn over a controversial tax-slashing 'mini-budget' lifted risk appetite. A weaker dollar makes oil cheaper for non-U.S. buyers. Following the steep production cut agreed on by OPEC+ - the Organization of the Production Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia - earlier this month, investors have been seen increasing their long positions in futures, ANZ Research analysts said in a note. OPEC+ member states have been lining up to endorse the cut to the output target after the White House accused Riyadh of coercing some other nations into supporting the move. Meanwhile, expectations that China will keep with loose monetary policy to help its economy, hobbled by COVID-19 restrictions, lent some support to oil prices. The country's central bank rolled over maturing medium-term policy loans on Monday while keeping its key interest rate unchanged for a second month. However, China's fuel demand outlook weighed on sentiment after the world's top crude oil importer delayed the release of its economic indicators, originally scheduled to be out on Tuesday, CMC Markets analyst Tina Teng said. No date for a rescheduled release has been given. China's adherence to its zero-COVID policy has continued to increase the uncertainties about the country's economic growth, Teng added. On the supply side, U.S. crude oil stocks were expected to have risen for a second consecutive week and are estimated to have increased by 1.6 million barrels in the week to Oct. 14, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday. Output in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the biggest U.S. shale oil basin, is forecast to rise by about 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a record 5.453 million bpd this month, the Energy Information Administration said."
2022-10-18,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11328755/Dramatic-video-shows-final-moments-Su-34-bomber-pilots-eject-seconds-explodes.html,"Dramatic video shows final moments of Su-34 bomber as pilots eject seconds before it explodes in a fireball, killing 15 people in Russian apartment block","A dramatic video shows the final seconds of the Russian Su-34 bomber which destroyed an apartment block in Yeysk as the death toll rose to 15 on Tuesday. The Sukhoi 34 fighter-bomber was taking off from an airfield in the southern Russian city of Yeysk, near the border with Ukraine, on Monday evening when it plunged from the sky moments later with one engine on fire — slamming into the ground in front of an apartment block and dousing the building in burning fuel. Both pilots ejected safely, with footage showing one of them on the ground nearby still attached to his parachute. The stricken low-flying plane which is believed to have been on a mission to attack Ukraine. Other claims are that the warplane was on a training mission. If so, it is not clear why it had ammunition on board which exploded when the aircraft hit the yard of the apartment block. The crewmen may have ejected after they realised a crash was inevitable and could not fly the plane away from the residential building. The death toll in the apartment block has hit 15, including three children and three adults who jumped from a burning apartment block after a Russian military jet crashed next to the building and set it on fire. The Sukhoi Su-34 is a Russian-made supersonic fighter-bomber aircraft. It was developed in the 1990s to replace its ageing predecessor, the Su-24, but did not enter widespread use with Russia's air force until well into the 2000s. The Su-34 is considered a fairly capable multi-role aircraft, in that it is primarily designed to strike ground and surface targets with missiles and bombs, but can also engage in air-to-air combat missions. However, it has a reputation for being accident prone. On two separate occasions in 2019, two pairs of Su-34s collided during training exercises, and a fifth jet crashed during a training mission in 2020. The Russian military said the men were taking part in training when the crash happened and the stranded pilot can be heard denying the craft was shot down as people try to help him. The crash is yet another humiliating loss for Russian president Vladimir Putin's beleaguered air force, which has now suffered ten non-combat crashes since the start of the war. His pilots have also failed to destroy Ukraine's much smaller air force and are limited to operating behind Russian lines after failing to take out Kyiv's air defences. Footage of the pilot lying on the ground also appears to capture the sound of explosions in the background, sparking rumours on Russian social media that the plane was flying a combat mission and ammunition detonated after it came down. But Krasnodar regional governor Veniamin Kondratyev denied this, saying the explosions were fuel tanks bursting. Russian outlet Zvezdanews reported the fire was extinguished with the help of 410 firefighters and emergency services personnel. Deputy governor Anna Minkova said additional beds were being prepared for injured civilians, adding: 'Specialists of the burn department from regional clinical hospitals have been sent to Yeysk.' Putin was informed of the fire and ordered 'all necessary assistance be given to casualties from the military plane incident', the Kremlin told state-run news agency TASS. The Russian ministry of defence said: 'On October 17, 2022, while climbing to perform a training flight from the military airfield of the southern military district, a Su-34 aircraft crashed. The aircraft crashed within the city of Yeysk. 'According to the report of the ejected pilots, the cause of the plane crash was the ignition of one of the engines during take-off. 'At the site of the crash of the Su-34 in the courtyard of one of the residential areas, the fuel of the aircraft ignited.' Aleksandr Kots, chief war correspondent for pro-Kremlin newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, said the aircraft was an Su-34 from Russia's 277th Bombing Aviation Regiment. 'So far, the main version is that it was birds getting into the engines at take-off,' he claimed. Firefighters, helicopters and ambulances went to the nine-floor apartment block, with Mr Kondratyev declaring all regional emergency services were working to put out the fire. 'The fire spread to a few floors. According to preliminary information, 17 flats have been affected,' the governor added. Russia's investigative committee, which probes serious crimes, said it had opened a criminal investigation into the crash. The first to fifth floors of the block were set ablaze, witnesses said. One report said emergency services were struggling to extinguish the flames, which had spread throughout the building, exacerbated by jet fuel spewed across the crash site. Oksana, a resident who declined to give her last name, said the area was cordoned off. 'There could be an explosion. Everything is burning inside. there is smoke,' she told AFP. 'I'm in shock obviously. My child was alone at home. We already used to go to sleep with fear every day - Mariupol is just across from us,' she said, referring to the Ukrainian port across the Sea of Azov which withstood months of heavy bombardment earlier in the war. Former Russian presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak said: 'It's scary to imagine how many dead there will be.' Just a few hundred miles across the border from Yeysk, Ukrainian civilians experienced more terror yesterday as Iranian-made kamikaze drones launched by Russia attacked Kyiv in the morning. At least five explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital, starting around 3.30am on Monday as waves of Shahed-136 drones - 28 in total - dodged air defences and slammed into the city, with police and armed forces resorting to firing machine guns into the air in an attempt to bring them down. One of the drones bore the phrase 'for Belgorod' - a Russian city that acts as a staging ground for attacks on Ukraine that was shelled at the weekend. It was also the scene of a gun attack on a barracks that saw at least 11 soldiers killed by two conscripts on Saturday. One strike appeared to target Kyiv's heating network, hitting an operations centre. Another slammed into a four-story residential building, ripping a large hole in it and collapsing at least three apartments on top of each other. Three people were killed and 19 rescued from the rubble, four of them wounded. Airstrikes then hit critical infrastructure in the Dnipro and Sumy regions - in the centre and north of Ukraine - killing 'several' people while leaving hundreds of villages without power, prime minister Denys Shmyhal said. Suicide drones also struck the port of Mykolaiv late on Sunday night, setting sunflower oil storage tanks alight. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said the strikes were aimed at 'terrorising the civilian population' but vowed: 'The enemy can attack our cities but it won't be able to break us.'"
2022-10-18,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11329069/Report-finds-military-WEAK-struggle-win-war.html,"Report finds US military is WEAK and will struggle to win a war: China is building more warships, fighter pilots don't have jets or training and army can't recruit enough soldiers","The US military has grown increasingly week over the years and is considered at risk of not being able to win a war against burgeoning threats overseas, a new report has found. The worrisome trend was aired Tuesday by The Heritage Foundation, a think tank that analyzes the strength of the armed forces and potential threats to the US. In its Foundation's Index of US Military Strength, Heritage rated America's military as 'weak' and 'at growing risk of not being able to meet the demands of defending America's vital national interests' from growing powers such as China and Russia. The weak rating, down from 'marginal' recorded by the Washington-based agency last year, is the first in the index's nine-year history. It further found that rapidly advancing China remained the most 'comprehensive security challenge' to an ill-prepared US force, with the foundation citing Beijing's recent bolstering of their land, sea, and air outfits. Conversely, US forces, the study found, remained largely stagnant - and have actually regressed to a point where pilots have been left without crafts to fly and enlisters have had difficulty recruiting citizens to field a legitimate fighting force. Aside from the overall 'weak' rating garnered by the military, Heritage provided each of the military branches with their own individual rankings based on capability, capacity, and readiness, especially in the event of a two-pronged conflict. The Army scored 'marginal,' while the Air Force was ranked 'very weak' and the Navy 'weak.' The Marine Corps, meanwhile, fared the best, receiving a 'strong' rating - an improvement from the 'marginal' it received in 2021. The reports release comes as the military 'faces a full-blown recruitment crisis,' according to Heritage - spurred by two straight years where the Biden administration submitted defense budget requests that were below the rate of inflation. 'For the first time, The Heritage Foundation's Index of U.S. Military Strength finds that as currently postured, the U.S. military is rated 'weak' and at significant risk of not being able to meet the demands of a single major regional conflict while attending to various presence and engagement activities,' the report began. It added that 'the military has seen a general erosion of capacity, capability, and readiness' that 'have become so significant' that the military's ability to fulfill its primary objective is in jeopardy. The org asserted that those concerns were particularly prevalent when it comes to the Air Force and Navy, citing 'readiness and capacity issues across the force(s).' Compounding those concerns, according to the report, are inflation and budget cuts, which account for a loss of $59 billion in funding between 2018 and 2023. That, Heritage wrote, has been further worsened by 'the limited assistance' that American allies such as the UK and South Korea can contribute in the event of a global conflict, given conflicting security interests. In contrast, America's key adversaries - China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea - have all rapidly advanced their military capabilities in recent years, and have ramped up efforts to intimidate our overseas affiliates, the think tank added. To that point, Heritage cited Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and both China and North Korea's increasing intimidation of neighboring Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea - all disputes the agency said could eventually boil over into a conflict on the world stage. Such a conflict, the foundation claimed, the US would not be ready for, especially in the event two major skirmishes surfaced at once - for instance, one in the Middle East and another on the Korean peninsula. Americans might wish 'that the world be a simpler, less threatening place,' the report notes, but 'the patterns of history show that competing powers consistently emerge and that the US must be able to defend its interests in more than one region at a time.' Heritage went as far to claim that the US military, in its current state, may not even be able to handle 'a single major regional conflict' due to its forces being spread increasingly thin amongst the various branches stations overseas 'The 2023 Index concludes that the current US military force is at significant risk of not being able to meet the demands of a single major regional conflict while also attending to various presence and engagement activities,' the report read. 'It most likely would not be able to do more and is certainly ill-equipped to handle two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts.' The US has also lagged behind its increasingly powerful rivals in technologically, including its dwindling stock of long-range missiles. America currently possesses just 300 land based missiles, while China boasts more than 14,000, and Russian more than 12,000. With that said, Heritage wrote that the global operating environment, aggregated across Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and even Latin America and Africa, is still 'favorable' to the US and its ability to project military power. In the interim, the American military's four main facets have found themselves hopelessly hampered by Pentagon budgets that have failed to keep up with rampant inflation, forcing the branches to make difficult decisions about whether to be technologically advanced, well-manned, or ready to fight at a moment's notice. Achieving all three, especially within the Navy and Air Force, would be virtually impossible. Taking into account capacity, capability, and readiness of each on a scale of very weak, weak, marginal, strong, and very strong, the decline among those two branches was especially stark. The Navy in particular, Heritage wrote, has shown a 'persistent inability to arrest and reverse the continued diminution of its fleet,' while rival fleets in both Russia and China have more than tripled their respective manpower over the past two decades. The report backed calls for the Navy to increase its fighting force - arguing that the service’s fleet of 298 ships cannot keep up with an 'intensified operational tempo.' In an explanation of the military body's poor performance in the index, Heritage cited the 'the Navy’s persistent inability to arrest and reverse the continued diminution of its fleet while adversary forces grow in number and capability.' In 2000, the United States boasted nearly 350 ships in their fleet, while both Russian and China had just over 400 between the two of them. Now, the US' fleet has dwindled to under 300 manned boats, while both Moscow and Beijing each possess over 700 apiece. From 2005 to 2020, for instance, the US fleet grew to 296 warships from 291, while China’s navy grew to 360 from 216 - a nearly 75 percent increase. With that said, the Navy has for years sought to bolster its once-storied fleet to at least 350 ships, but due to budget concerns and forces being spread so thin, it has largely failed in even approaching that goal. In fact, Heritage revealed, that one day in June, roughly one-third of the entire 298-strong fleet was deployed on routine missions - a number double the average of the Cold War. That sort of overwork, Heritage asserted, has spawned maintenance delays and extensive backlogs, leaving the force's maintenance yards overwhelmed as the shipbuilding industry continues to shrink amid deteriorating demand. An analysis offered in the report, consequently, revealed the Navy has under-performed on shipbuilding plans by at least 10 ships a year on average over the past five years, as the gap between the US and powers burgeoning overseas continues to widen - warranting the 'weak' rating. Age was also an issue for the Navy, with 34 of the branch's 298 ships set to retire within the next three years. The Air Force, meanwhile, performed even worse, based on a criteria that analyzed the branches' capacity, capability, and readiness for war. With those factors in mind, Heritage offered the American Air Force a 'very weak' rating - with authors citing aging 'aircraft and very poor pilot training and retention,' in the current state of a fighting force Heritage said 'would struggle greatly against a peer competitor.' The agency's current state, the think tank explained, can be largely attributed to a 'shortage of pilots and flying time for those' servicemen, which in turn 'degrades the ability of the Air Force to generate the quality of combat air power that would be needed to meet wartime requirements.' The age of the branch's aircraft is also a major factor contributing to the branch's slow but pronounced decline, which has been recently worsened by the pilot shortage. According to Heritage, the 'current generation of fighter pilots' - referring to those who have been actively flying for the past seven years - 'has never experienced a healthy rate of operational flying.' The report revealed that pilots flew just 10 hours a month on average in 2021, up from 8.7 in 2020 during the pandemic, but still well below the 200 hours a year mark pilots are required to meet in order to to be considered capable of engaging in a dog fight against a formidable opponent. The Army did not fare much better on the agency's grading scale, with Heritage citing how the branch has collectively lost $59 billion in buying power since 2018 due to flat budgets and recent, rampant inflation. And like its aerial counterpart, the branch is falling well short when it comes recruiting soldiers - nearly 20,000 less than its 485,000 active-duty goal in fiscal 2022. Those recruiting challenges - coupled with unspecified 'funding uncertainties' - yielded the branch a strength classification of 'marginal.' As for the Marines, the only body to warrant a 'strong' rating, the branch seemed to score better due to its propensity change, as it made preparations for a prospective war in the Pacific in a concept known as Force Design 2030, as the branch picks up the slack left by the Navy for measures taken in the event of a potential conflict with China or North Korea. New and emerging threats have also changed how the Marine Corps is organized, trained, equipped, and employed, helping it achieve the stellar score - despite recently slimming down to a bare-bones 21 infantry battalions, from 27 as recently as 2011. With that said, mission success for the operation depends on the construction of a still-in-production amphibious ship that the Navy may never be able to deliver. The scores were all achieved as American branches collect an $800 billion budget from the federal government, with the country currently spending roughly 3 percent of its GDP on its military. That's down from the 5 to 6 percent set aside for American military spending in the 80s - suggesting that good self-defense does not come cheap. This comes as the U.S. House of Representatives July paved the way for the nation's defense budget to exceed $800 billion next year - albeit barely - authorizing $37 billion in spending on top of the record $773 billion proposed by President Biden. The Senate has yet to pass its version of the bill, but the Senate Armed Services Committee has already backed an even larger increase - one that would add $45 billion in spending - over Biden's proposal."
2022-10-18,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11327983/Biden-considers-telling-American-business-stop-investing-expanding-Saudi-Arabia.html,Biden now considers telling American businesses to stop investing and expanding in Saudi Arabia after failing to get Kingdom to delay the OPEC production cut - and as Republicans demand he tap into domestic sources,"One of the potential 'consequences' for Saudi Arabia backing an oil production cut is coming into focus, with a report the Biden administration may urge U.S. businesses not to invest in Saudi Arabia. The move, while voluntary in nature, could chip away at longstanding U.S.-Saudi business ties, at a time when prominent Democrats are calling to reexamine the U.S. relationship with the kingdom after OPEC+ announced an oil production cut that goes into effect next month. The decision infuriated the administration, and President Biden vowed there would consequences. The administration will not be sending an emissary to the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, known as 'Davos in the desert,' an annual confab that brings top executives and investors to rub elbows with leading Saudi dignitaries. That event is set to take place next week, with major private figures in U.S. slated to attend. Administration officials are considering efforts to discourage U.S. from expanding future business in Saudi Arabia in the future, however, NBC reported. That could put a dent in the longstanding business ties between the two countries. An administration official told the network the decision to sit out the conference was made before Opec+ announced its cut of 2 million barrels a day – prompting the administration to say the move was aiding Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine. Russia relies on high energy prices to procure weapons and keep its economy going amid international sanctions. The move forced Biden to defend his infamous fist-bump with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman during his visit to Saudi Arabia this summer. Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry hit back, saying the Biden administration asked it to delay production cuts until November – which in turn prompted calls by Republicans to probe whether Biden sought to delay the cut to boost his party's chances in the November elections. In yet another escalation, the crown prince's cousin issued a violent threat against those who 'challenge' Saudi Arabia after Biden's warning. In a message aimed at 'the West,' Saud al-Shaalan is seen in a video saying 'anybody who challenges the existence of this kingdom, we are all projects of jihad and martyrdom. Anybody that thinks they can threaten us--' The potential admonition to U.S. business comes as the administration has is beginning its review of the relationship, without announcing any changes on U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. That relationship is a boon to U.S. military contractors, as well as a tool to try to keep the Saudis aligned with U.S. security interests by providing high-tech weaponry. In August, following Biden's visit, the U.S. approved a $5 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, with $3 billion for the Saudis to buy Patriot missile defenses as protection against Iran. With the Opec+ cuts going into effect, the administration is planning to release 15 million barrels of oil from the US's Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to stem soaring gasoline prices. The oil release would be the latest portion of a deal Biden struck last spring to release 180 million barrels of oil from energy companies. The administration is planning to announce the latest reserve release later this week, according to Bloomberg. David Turk, the president's deputy energy secretary, also said last week the administration can tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in coming weeks and months as necessary to stabilize oil. National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson denied discouraging U.S. business with Saudi Arabia to date, with a comment that didn't rule out doing so in the future and highlighted the importance of 'reputational concerns.' 'We are not reaching out to companies to make such requests,' she said. 'As they do in every part of the world, American companies will make their own decisions about their presence and where to invest, taking into account a range of factors, including legal constraints, the business environment and reputational concerns that can arise from public policy choices made by host countries.'"
2022-10-18,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11327057/Tories-call-Boris-return-grassroots-say-prefer-Rishi-Sunak-Liz-Truss.html,So who could replace Liz Truss? As MPs plot grassroots demand Boris Johnson returns AND say they prefer Rishi Sunak to PM just six WEEKS after electing her - while Ben Wallace and de facto leader Jeremy Hunt insist they don't want top job (for now),"Tory members suggested they want Boris Johnson back as prime minister today - as they said they would even accept Rishi Sunak over beleaguered Liz Truss. A new poll today made the former leader, evicted from No10 just three months ago after a year of sleaze, the favourite to make an unlikely return. It comes as some Tory MPs say he is the closest thing available to a unity candidate around which the party can coalesce if Liz Truss quits or is removed. More than half of Tory members feel Ms Truss should quit, according to a YouGov poll. And 32 per cent want Mr Johnson to replace her, compared to 23 per cent who want Rishi Sunak. A separate survey of members by JL Partners today suggests that Mr Sunak would now win a re-run of the Tory leadership election, which he lost to Truss six weeks ago. But Tories plotting to replace Liz Truss appear divided on who actually could do the job. Mr Sunak is reported to have rebuffed an attempt by Penny Mordaunt to come back as Chancellor under her leadership - a sign he has sights on the top job himself. Other frontrunners have appeared to rule themselves out, at least for now. Ben Wallace, the respected Defence Secretary, said he wanted to remain in that post to oversee the UK's aid for Ukraine fighting Russia. And Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor who is widely seen as a de-facto PM, again ruled himself out, saying: 'I rule it out, Mrs Hunt rules it out, three Hunt children rule it out.' It is just three months since Mr Johnson was finally removed from power after months of political, social and sexual scandals finally overwhelmed his premiership. But with Liz Truss reigning over a period of economic and political turmoil unparalleled even by recent standards, more Tories are starting to wonder if he was all that bad. Here we look at possible runners and riders amid the turmoil in Westminster. BORIS JOHNSON 22/1 Could Boris Johnson make an unlikely come-back just three months after resigning in disgrace? He was eventually pulled from office after a massive ministerial rebellion in July, after Partygate, Wallpapergate and a myriad of other scandals including the removal of whip Chris Pincher pulled down his premiership. But he still has his supporters in the parliamentary party and wider conservative ranks - though polls show a majority of voters believe he was right to quit. One MPO told MailOnline he could be the best solution to the problems the party faces. 'If you can find a unity candidate you are a better man than I,' the former minister said. 'There isn't one. It is a funny kind of strength. 'The membership didn't want to get ride of Boris... They would welcome it. He is the only one with a personality that can appeal to anybody.' They added: 'He is like Heineken. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility.' However defence minister James Heappey threw shade at the ex-PM today. The Armed Forces Minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was no alternative unity candidate and defended Ms Truss, saying that at least she had apologised quicker than Boris Johnson did when he was prime minister. Last night Tory plotters were told to reinstate Boris Johnson to No 10 or face a general election 'within weeks'. Nadine Dorries, a staunch ally of the former prime minister and a backer of Liz Truss, made a fresh appeal to doubting Conservative MPs to stand behind the current leader. In recent weeks she has called for Miss Truss to hold a fresh election if she was insistent on wavering over her predecessor's policies. But yesterday the former Culture Secretary said 'only one MP has a mandate' from both the Tory party and the British public – Mr Johnson. RISHI SUNAK 6/4 The former Chancellor, 42, was the runner-up in this summer's Tory leadership race. He and Ms Truss went head-to-head as the final pairing in the contest to replace Boris Johnson in No10. They engaged in bitter exchanges over their economic agendas during a lengthy series of hustings events across the UK. Now that Ms Truss has abandoned almost all her leadership pledges on tax cuts - and is adopting much of the approach pursued by Mr Sunak when he was Chancellor - some MPs will be wondering why they don't just put him in charge instead. A number of his supporters are also likely to take a 'told you so' attitude to the Government's current travails - after Mr Sunak's warned this summer of market turmoil if Ms Truss followed through with her unfunded tax cuts. Mr Sunak won the support of 137 MPs in the initial stages of the Tory leadership contest - 24 more than Ms Truss - and retains a strong backing within the parliamentary party. After overseeing the Government's economic response to the Covid crisis, he also has experience of political leadership in turbulent times. MPs might be wary of installing a leader who was rejected by the Tory membership little more than a month ago. There is also lingering resentment at Mr Sunak for his resignation as Chancellor in July, which many of Mr Johnson's loyalists still blame for the former PM's ousting from No10. But a new poll today suggests the grassroots of the party may be more accepting than previously thought. The poll of Conservative members by JL Partners for the Daily Telegraph found that 60 per cent of them would now back Mr Sunak for party leader, once undecided and non-voting members are excluded. More than four-in-10 (43 per cent) would support him outright, to Truss's (28 per cent) JEREMY HUNT 4/1 The 55-year-old was a shock appointment as the new Chancellor on Friday following Ms Truss's sacking of her ally Kwasi Kwarteng. He is now being referred to among some Tory MPs as the 'de facto PM' after he tore up what remained of Ms Truss's mini-Budget plans and outlined a completely new economic agenda. Mr Hunt is being talked up as a potential 'unity' candidate behind which the competing wings of the Conservative Party could rally behind, amid the current economic crisis. He is an experienced Cabinet minister and is the longest-serving Health Secretary in British political history following his spell in charge of the NHS between 2012 and 2018. Mr Hunt has also previously served as Foreign Secretary and Culture Secretary and would be seen as a safe pair of hands. There have been suggestions he could enter No10 as a 'caretaker' PM to steady the ship before another leader is elected. But Mr Hunt himself is distancing himself from talk about his leadership chances and has ruled out a tilt at the top job as he called on MPs to give Ms Truss 'a chance'. 'I rule it out, Mrs Hunt rules it out, three Hunt children rule it out,' he told Sky News. During this summer's Tory leadership contest, Mr Hunt was knocked out in the first round of voting by MPs when he attracted the support of just 18 colleagues. It is this recent demonstration of a paucity of support for Mr Hunt - who went on to support Mr Sunak against Ms Truss - among Conservative MPs that would count against him if he changed his mind. He was previously the runner-up to Mr Johnson in the 2019 Tory leadership election, in which he was roundly rejected by Tory members. Following his elimination from this summer's contest, Mr Hunt had appeared to admit his hopes of ever seizing the Tory crown were over. 'It's become obvious to me you only get one big shot at this, and I had mine in 2019.' he said at the time. PENNY MORDAUNT 13/2 The Leader of the House of Commons, 49, came close to reaching the final round of this summer's Tory leadership contest. She finished third behind Ms Truss and Mr Sunak when she secured the support of 105 MPs. The Royal Navy reservist has since been drafted back into the Cabinet, where she previously served as Defence Secretary under Theresa May's premiership. But, this summer's leadership contest saw questions raised about Ms Mordaunt's ministerial record. There was stinging criticism of Ms Mordaunt's work ethic as she was accused of going missing from her ministerial duties by rival camps. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who was Ms Mordaunt's former boss, moaned about she had 'not been available' at various times as a trade minister and left others to 'pick up the pieces'. It was claimed Ms Mordaunt had instead spent her time focusing on preparations for her leadership campaign. She also had to fight hard during the Tory leadership contest against criticism of her stance on trans issues, including her past claim that 'trans women are women'. Ms Mordaunt blasted critics trying to depict her as 'woke'. One suggestion at Westminster is the possibility of Ms Mordaunt teaming up with Mr Sunak as part of a joint ticket to replace Ms Truss. But plotters are said to be undecided on who would be PM out of the pair, if they were to front a 'government of all the talents' between them. Last night it was reported that Ms Mordaunt's allies reached out to Mr Sunak to be her chancellor, but were rebuffed. BEN WALLACE 10/1 The 52-year-old is popular with Tory members following the Defence Secretary's efforts in leading Britain's military response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He is also being spoken of as a 'unity' candidate to bring the party back together, should Ms Truss depart. The former Army officer has routinely topped the polls among the Conservatives grassroots. But he did not enter this summer's leadership contest after 'careful consideration' and later backed Ms Truss. At this month's Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Mr Wallace admitted he was 'conflicted' about a possible leadership bid in the future. He told a fringe event: 'At this time of life, the idea was no. I mean do I rule it out? No. I don't rule it out, but will I be here in a few years' time? I don't know either.' Mr Wallace might be popular with Tory members, but would be less well-known to members of the public as he has only been a Cabinet minister since 2019. Tory MPs might also fear he is untested as he has never held one of the 'great offices of state' as Mrs May, Mr Johnson and Ms Truss all had before they entered No10. Mr Wallace has also been touted as a possible successor to NATO general secretary Jens Stoltenberg. Last night be repeated his desire to stay at defence, telling the Times: 'I want to be the Secretary of State for Defence until I finish. I love the job I do and we have more to do. I want the Prime Minister to be the Prime Minister and I want to do this job.' He added: 'I say to the colleagues who think our role is to feed the instability within the party, by proposing other people as leaders no matter who they are, (you) are doing a disservice. 'The markets are responding at the moment in the UK to unsurety about the Government. The best way to give those markets some confidence is for people to stop playing political parlour games.'"
2022-10-18,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11327115/Halloween-horror-cost-candy-soars-13-year.html,Halloween horror as cost of candy soars by 13% in a year - the largest jump EVER driven by surging cost of sugar and flour,"Americans who fancy a sweet treat this Halloween will have a shock as the cost of candy has risen by 13 percent in a year. The figure comes from the most recent inflation report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 13.1 percent climb is the largest recorded by the CPI in a year. And the increase comes after it previously took from 1997 to 2006 for candy prices to rise 13 percent. Just since August, the price of candy has risen 2 percent. According to the report, it is one of the largest monthly increases. The National Retail Federation projects that Americans will spend around $3.1 billion on Halloween candy this year. Due to inflation, a bag of $15 Halloween-sized candy will now be around $2 more expensive. The five most popular candies in 2021 according to Instacart were Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, Peanut M&M's, Snickers, and Hershey's Milk Chocolate. Consumers may also feel that Halloween costumes are pricier this year. Clothing is now 5.5 percent more expensive than last year and while this is not reflected in the CPI report, the price rise may be felt among those who wanted to purchase costumes. Even people who may want to try their hand at homemade costumes may struggle. Since last September, sewing machines, fabric, and supplies are 11 percent more expensive. Elsewhere, costs have risen across all confectionery as sugar and flour are now much more expensive than last year. Additionally, a poor beet sugar production year and supply chain pandemonium have caused issues. And now, flour prices are 24 percent more than they were, according to NPR. Because of this, since last September, sweet treats such as cakes, cupcakes, and cookies are now 16 percent more expensive. There has also been an increase of more than 20 percent in frozen and refrigerated baked goods. Wholesale inflation in the US rose 8.5 percent in September from a year ago, marking a slowdown from recent peaks, but remaining painfully high and indicating that businesses continue to struggle with high costs. The producer price index, which measures inflation before it reaches consumers, jumped 0.4 percent from August to September, driven largely by rising food and energy prices, the Labor Department said last Wednesday. The index's annual gain of 8.5 percent was another decline from the all-time record high of 11.7 percent reached in March but remained well above historical levels even as the Federal Reserve battles to rein in soaring prices with rate hikes. Last Wednesday's report showed that core wholesale inflation (excluding food, energy, and trade services) remained unchanged in September from August and 5.6 percent from year to year, after peaking at 7.1 percent in March. The report showed a broad-based rise in the cost of food at the wholesale level, with grains up 30 percent from a year ago as Russia's war in Ukraine raises world prices. Both Russia and Ukraine are major grain producers. Fresh vegetable costs rose 40 percent from last year, while fresh fruits were up 21 percent, reflecting a range of factors including weather conditions and an increased minimum wage in Mexico, raising costs for producers. As well, wholesale energy prices rose in the month of September after retreating in August, as oil prices reversed their late-summer retreat and began to rise again. The producer price data captures inflation at an earlier stage of production and can sometimes signal where consumer prices are headed. It also feeds into the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index. The new data came ahead of the consumer price index report for September, which was released on Thursday October 13. CPI, the best-known measure of inflation, jumped 8.3 percent in August from last year, representing a decline from four-decade highs reached earlier this year, but still well above the Fed's 2 percent target rate. Economists expected last Thursday's CPI report to show the annual inflation rate dipped again, to 8.1 percent. However, they also forecasted core inflation, excluding food and energy, would rise to 6.5 percent in September, up from 6.3 percent in August to reach a new 40-year high. Although consumer tend to focus on headline inflation, because food and energy are major factors in their monthly budgets, economists tend to focus on the core numbers, which reflect underlying trends. Because food and energy prices are highly volatile, a rise in core inflation can be troubling, because it reflects how higher prices are becoming more 'sticky' and pervasive in the economy, a trend that is not easily reversed. It comes as DailyMail.com yesterday revealed that it is a 100 percent certainty that the United States is headed for economic recession with some models suggesting that it could strike in less than 12 months, according to a new study published by Bloomberg. A second study performed by the network found that another set of economists put the certainty of a recession at around 60 percent, which is up from a 50 percent certainty in September. Despite that gloom, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan continued to maintain that the economy is robust, judging by the activities of his bank's customers. According to CNBC, on the same day of the publication of the Bloomberg report, Moynihan told board members: 'Analysts might wonder whether the talk of inflation, recession and other factors could [result] in a slower spending growth.' He added: 'We just don't see [that] here at Bank of America.' An internal study from the banking giant found that their customers account balances are higher than they were prior to the Covid-19 recession. On Saturday, President Joe Biden received criticism for saying that the economy was 'strong as hell' while eating ice cream in Oregon. A few days previously, Biden conceded that there could be a 'very slight' recession. A separate Wall Street Journal study that was published over the weekend found that 63 percent of economists felt a recession coupled with job losses was inevitable in 2023. However that 63 percent is highest chance of recession that WSJ economists have given since July 2020 in the midst of recession. Those involved in the study ascertained that the recession would bring about a federal interest rate cut at some point over the next two years. In reference that cut, the University of Michigan's Daniil Manaenkov told the Journal: ''Soft landing' will likely remain a mythical outcome that never actually comes to pass.' Earlier surveys by the Journal found predictions of economic growth in 2023, now average of 36,000 job cuts per month are predicted. Jeffries LLC's chief economist Aneta Markowska told the Journal: 'The coming drag from higher rates and stronger dollar is enormous and will knock off about 2.5 percentage points from next year's GDP. In light of this, it's hard to imagine how the U.S. can avoid a recession.' The recession is predicted to end within eight months. According to KPMG's Diane Swonk: 'The Federal Reserve is choosing between the lesser of two evils — take a recession with a rise in unemployment today or risk a more corrosive and entrenched inflation taking root.' She told the Journal: 'The risks of misstep are large, given the sins that low rates likely papered over.' Meanwhile, the steep ascent of the US dollar - which comes as the US grapples with a post-pandemic financial crisis not seen in decades - has affected other currencies such as the pound euro, which both fell below parity for the first time in decades last month. For the GBP, it was the first time it fell below the American greenback. The diminishing value of the currencies - as well as others across the globe including the yen and won - adds another element of concern amid current economic uncertainty seen in countries across the world as they look to offset losses incurred during the pandemic. Moreover, the US dollar largely serves as a safe haven investment that sees inflows during times of uncertainty - meaning it will often rise in times of economic turmoil, while other currencies fall. In the Asia-Pacific region, Japan, South Korea, and China’s currencies all weakened against the dollar, while the Australian dollar remained for the most part flat. The Japanese yen traded at 144-levels against the dollar, weaker compared with after the country's federal government intervened in the currency market last week. South Korea’s won, meanwhile, was near 2009 levels as of Monday, at 1,428.52 per dollar. With that said, the economic outlook in the UK means the pound is suffering more than most, amid a disastrous energy crunch and the highest inflation among G7 nations. The previous record low for the British pound against the US dollar was 37 years ago on February 25, 1985, when 1 pound was worth $1.054. The US and the UK - as well as other countries like Canada - are consequently battling rampant inflation seen as the world struggles to recover from the pandemic, with the UK's sitting at 9.9 percent as of August 2022, and the US' at 8.2 percent - both down slightly from record highs seen in previous months. However, the prices of almost everything else have risen sharply in the past year, with groceries, electricity, and vehicles all up well over 10 percent compared to this time last year. The increase for amenities such as gasoline, and airfares, meanwhile, is even more marked - with gas now costing more than 25 percent than its price in October 2021 and plane tickets up by more than a third. While the world's wealthiest man, Elon Musk may be worried about the economy, job openings on Tesla's website suggest the world's most valuable car maker is hiring employees at a quick pace, in nearly every category of job. Tesla this week listed over 6,900 jobs on its career website, almost a 50% surge since mid-June, when Reuters began tracking the data. That compares to a 2022 peak of over 7,400 job ads in May, according to data similarly tracked by Thinknum Alternative Data and hedge fund Snow Bull Capital. Musk warned colleagues in early June he had a 'super bad' and said the electric car maker needed to cut jobs. He later tweeted that total headcoun"
2022-10-18,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11319609/Xi-Jinping-aim-break-Western-world-order-term-power.html,"Get ready for China 'on steroids': Xi Jinping will complete his totalitarian spy-state, take on the US and aim to break Western world order if he is given historic third term as leader, experts predict","Xi Jinping is the man that everyone underestimated. Now, he is poised to start an historic third term as Chinese Communist Party leader and effective ruler of the nation - giving him near-free reign to mold the country as he sees fit and to impose his authority on the world. For the Chinese, this will mean the completion of a totalitarian spy-state that uses technology to stamp out opposition and control what they think and say. For the West, it tees up a global war of ideals that will see liberal world order tested by Xi's brand of Leninist authoritarianism. At least that is according to two experts who spoke to MailOnline about what Xi's continued rule is going to mean: Charles Parton, a former British diplomat now at the Council on Geostrategy; and Chris Johnson, formerly a China analysts for the CIA and now with the CSIS think-tank. But Xi faces problems. A global recession is looming, his zero-Covid policy is dragging down China's economy, debts are piling up, climate change is wreaking havoc - alternatively causing droughts and floods - and the question of Taiwan's future remains unresolved. Is Xi really the man to lead China through these crises and challenge the West for supremacy, or will his power-hungry rule doom his country to stagnation? Here, MailOnline puts the planet's most-powerful man under the microscope, to see what his life tells us about the future of China - and the world... Xi was born to greatness. The son of a Communist war hero who fought alongside Mao, he grew up in Zhongnanhai - a presidential compound in Beijing reserved for the elite of the elite. But all that suddenly changed during the Cultural Revolution, a massive purge of top officials carried out by an increasingly authoritarian and paranoid Mao towards the end of his reign. Xi found himself taken from his family and sent to labour in the countryside, and has recalled in interviews how he was forced to toil in farms and sleep in beds where fleas bit him until his body was swollen all over. After Mao's death, Xi's family was rehabilitated and his path to power restored - but Mr Johnson believes a lot of his character was formed in this outcast period. 'The key lesson for Xi was that the Chinese political system is very insular with few rules,' he said. 'Xi learned that, if you're going to fight, then you fight to win. 'I think you can see the influence of this on his later anti-corruption drive, his wolf-warrior diplomacy, and his relations with the West.' This is also where Xi's absolute devotion to the Chinese Communist Party comes from, Mr Johnson believes. He could have fled the country or become a debauched outcast, like many of his contemporaries did, but instead Xi became 'redder than red' - he devoted himself to the party as a way of overcoming it. Xi's climb up the political ladder was an unusual one. He opted to take posts in cities far from the nerve-centre of Beijing, where he became known as a capable and loyal party man, who somehow managed to stay above the corruption that was rampant at the time. He spent 17 years rising to become governor of Fujian province before spending another five in neighbouring Zhejiang. He was promoted to a post in Shanghai, then quickly gained a position on the Politburo Standing Committee - the top government job in China bar leader. The following year, he was made heir apparent. Mr Parton said: 'The party was in real trouble in early 2000s. Entrepreneurs were taking off, there was lots of corruption, society was becoming more free, the internet came in which in those days was relatively free. Many in the CCP thought they would get swept away without re-imposing power 'Those in power thought Xi was safe pair of hands, that he would have the power to tackle corruption, and that he would be a good Leninist and restore the party without everything getting swept away in another revolution.' Most people had not figured Xi for a leader, Mr Parton and Mr Johnson agree, but when the moment came he presented himself as an unexceptional but unobjectionable candidate - so he got the job. 'They under-estimated him,' Mr Johnson added. Driven by the fear that the fall of the Soviet Union could be repeated in China - because nobody was 'man enough' to stand up to the US, in Xi's own words - he launched an anti-corruption drive to restore faith in the party, with the happy coincidence that it gave him all the tools he needed to crack down on rivals and promote his allies to power. Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the Politburo and head of the security services, was found guilty of embezzling money and sentenced to life in jail. His downfall came immediately after that of Bo Xilai, another of Xi's rivals, who was also jailed for life after it was revealed his wife pensioned a British businessman. Bo's fall came before Xi took the party reigns and his involvement in it is not proven - but it is difficult to view the two events as unconnected. In a short time after becoming leader, Xi had assumed a tight grip on the key power institutions in China. Mr Johnson said: 'A plan like that does not spring fully formed. Xi relies on a kitchen cabinet of advisors. He was planning with military, with other areas, crafting a game plan. He is a man in a hurry, a man of history who feels he needs to accomplish things in a certain time frame - though how long that time is we don't know.' Mr Parton added: 'Xi already had a military rank from his time serving a general earlier in his career. Moving against Zhou also gave him control of the security services. 'To the surprise of many who expected business as usual, he accelerated and left them behind. He gathered very considerable power - as positions came or were made vacant he stacked the ranks with his people. He filled all of China's centres of power with his men.' He also used technology to create an effective surveillance state, making it extremely difficult for rivals to conspire against him while drilling party values into the population. All CCP members now have an app which routinely tests them on party doctrine and 'Xi Jinping thought', and tracks their responses. But, for all that Xi has achieved in the last decade, both experts think he is just getting started. Mr Johnson said: 'I think you can see the first decade as Xi righting wrongs through his corruption war, fixing problems in critical agencies: The military, propaganda, bureaucracy, secret services. He's done a lot of cleaning up. Implementing the vision becomes fundamental from this point on. 'What we are likely to witness in the next five years is more of the same, but on steroids.' Mr Parton agreed, saying: 'He is a Leninist. He is intending to strengthen the grip of the party over all aspects of China. The country will become more totalitarian. People will be controlled from cradle to grave because Xi has a strong belief in ""forging the soul"". 'Culture, business, entertainment: His aim is to have every company with a party cell embedded within it. He wants control over everything. If you control everything you increase the chances of the party staying in power.' And with the country firmly under his thumb, Xi is expected to turn his attention to the West - becoming more confrontational with the US as he seeks to break post-Cold War world order and establish another system with China at its peak, through which he can push his vision of totalitarian control out into the world. We have already seen glimpses of what this will mean. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, Xi invited Putin to China and the pair issued statements hailing a new era of closer cooperation, the 'transformation of the global governance' and the 'redistribution of power in the world'. We know, from leaked Russian state media propaganda, that Putin aims to create a so-called 'multipolar world order' in which Washington would be put on at least an equal footing with the likes of Moscow and Beijing. We can assume that Xi was given the same pitch at their meeting, and approved of it. While China's love-in with Russia may have hit the skids since the invasion went awry, Xi has also been busy forming or bolstering other alliances in a bid to create power structures that can oppose the US. On his first visit outside the country since Covid, Xi chose to head to central Asia to a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation - a political, economic and military grouping that includes Russia alongside India, Pakistan and a handful of formerly Soviet countries - in a move which Mr Johnson called 'very telling'. 'The global south, Africa included, is very much in-play for Xi,' Mr Johnson added. 'He has been making big in-roads there - selling leaders on his narrative of which system is better: The Chinese or the American. 'A lot of countries there are run by kleptocracies whose leaders don't want to answer questions on how they govern,' he added. 'Beijing is making a serious effort there.' Mr Parton agreed, also flagging the BRICS alliance - Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa - as another body where Beijing is likely to make a big play to challenge the West. Europe, he added, is likely to become a diplomatic battleground as Beijing tries to divide and conquer the continent with the ultimate aim of wrenching it out of Washington's sphere of influence. 'They have tried to detach us from the US, but they increasingly realise that is difficult to do,' Mr Parton said. 'We're a big and important market for Chinese prosperity, but also a continent which they could divide and rule. 'They will be hard on us when we go against them, but not as hard as they will be on the US because they're trying to break bonds between Europe and America. The will use diplomacy to enlarge any gaps.' There can be little doubt that Xi sees his system of authoritarian control as superior to the liberal Western order - but his aim is for the rest of the world to believe it too, and to act accordingly. In many ways, that makes him little different to Chinese leaders of the past - particularly Mao, whose legacy he is looking to surpass. But the key difference is that Xi now leads a country that is far more capable than the China of Mao's day, and far better able to mount a serious challenge. 'We haven't deal with Chinese leader, or really any other leader, with the level of authority that Xi has for at least the last three decades,' Mr Johnson said. 'We have a guy who feels far less awestruck by US power than his predecessors... Xi sees China as an equal power and believes US needs to listen. That is a very challenging situation for the US.' But, asked whether this could lead China into direct conflict with America over Taiwan, he was emphatic: 'No.' Mr Parton argues it is 'extremely unlikely' that Xi will ever invade the self-governing island, which Beijing views as a rebel province but which Taipei's leaders say is an independent state. He explained that, militarily, the island will be extremely hard for the large but inexperienced Chinese military to seize even without America getting directly involved, and economically it would cripple Chinese exports and see the country sanctioned - potentially costing Beijing trillions of dollars. 'Xi Jinping appears to be a rational leader, neither deluded nor desperate like Vladimir Putin,' Mr Parton said. 'To risk invasion would be to imperil his entire “China dream”, his ambition that China should replace the US as the pre-eminent global power and redraw the world in line with its interests and values. It is an unnecessary risk.' Mr Johnson agreed, saying that 'Xi and the rest of the Politburo still see possible military action against Taiwan as a crisis to be avoided rather than an opportunity to be seized' - at least for the time being. China, he argues, is facing too many other threats in the near and medium term and it would be self-defeating to create another one by invading. So what of Xi's other challenges? Here, the two experts differ. Mr Johnson said a lot will depend on whether Xi has the ability to recognise that his draconian policies - such as zero Covid - are choking his economy and to see that global factors will harm it further, and whether he is able to pivot and change course. He argues there is evidence, rooted in Xi's experiences of exile as a child, that show he does know how to change course in the face of adversity. 'When he is interviewed about that [time] he doesn't moan about it, he speaks about it toughening him,' Mr Johnson said. 'The risk is that - given he survived hardship - he may see himself as man of history, as someone who is there to save the nation, no matter what. As a contact put it to me: We know Xi listens to advice, but does he hear it? Within a year we should know if he's going to correct course.' Mr Parton is far less optimistic - at least from a Chinese point of view. He believes the country faces four key challenges: A declining birth rate, a pile of foreign debt, a lack of water supplies, and educational levels which cannot sustain high-tech economy. 'Those are serious, and governance is not up to task of doing that job', Mr Parton said. 'To govern such a big country in a top-down Leninist way is impossible. 'To govern effectively you need allies, and Xi has crushed them: A free press to root out corruption, civil society to come up with new ideas, law and independent judiciary to maintain trust, and some form of political accountability - it doesn't have to be democracy, people need to know they can be removed if they mess up. 'China will plateau. It has reached that point, economic growth is not going to take it to level where it will be sustainable superpower.' Which of those visions of China's future turn out to be correct now rest in the hands of one man, with almost sole power to shape the future of the world's most-populous nation."
2022-10-18,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11326855/Extraordinary-images-emerge-mangled-Nord-Stream-attacked-extreme-force.html,Extraordinary first images emerge of mangled Nord Stream: 165ft of blown-up Baltic Sea gas pipe is 'either missing or buried under the seabed' after it was attacked with 'extreme force',"Extraordinary first images of a mangled Nord Stream pipeline have emerged, three weeks after it was blown up 'with extreme force' in a suspected act of sabotage. Footage, released on Tuesday, showed at least 165 feet of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline was destroyed or buried under the seabed, following an explosion on September 26 - assumed by many to have been a Russian attack. Release of the images came as Danish police said 'powerful explosions' were behind damage to the two gas pipelines (Nord Stream 1 and 2) in the Danish part of the Baltic Sea. On October 6, Swedish investigators said their own initial investigations had come to a similar conclusion. Scroll down for video The two Nord Stream pipelines were damaged by explosions under the Baltic Sea at the end of September, causing four leaks. Both Swedish and Danish authorities have been investigating four holes in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines. While the leaks were in international waters, two of them were in the Danish exclusive economic zone and two of them in the Swedish. It was unclear exactly which part of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline the video recorded, but it was likely to be the section Sweden has been investigating, to the north-east of the Danish island of Bornholm. The pipelines, which connect Russia to Germany, have been at the centre of geopolitical tensions as Russia cut gas supplies to Europe in suspected retaliation against Western sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Although the pipelines were not in operation, they contained gas before falling victim to the apparent sabotage. Fingers have been pointed at Russia, whose state-owned energy company Gazprom is the main owner of the pipelines. The Kremlin, however, has called such allegations 'stupid' and has blamed the United States for the damage. In the videos published by Swedish newspaper Expressen, a massive tear and twisted metal can be seen on the pipeline, 80 metres down under the ocean. Through the gloom, a deep tench can be seen in the seabed where the gas pipeline used to be, before the explosions. According to the newspaper, the videos that were filmed on Monday show how over 165 feet of the pipeline is either missing or buried under the seabed, and long tears can be observed on the seabed leading up to the burst pipe. 'It is only an extreme force that can bend metal that thick in the way we are seeing,' Trond Larsen, drone operator with the Norwegian company Blueye Robotics, told Expressen. Larsen, who piloted the submersible drone which captured the video, also said you could also see 'a very large impact on the seabed around the pipe.' Expressen said the explosions measured 2.3 on the Richter scale. Meanwhile, Danish officials on Tuesday confirmed that there has been 'extensive damage' to the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea off Denmark and that the cause of the damage was 'powerful explosions.' In a statement, the Copenhagen Police said it had carried out a number of preliminary investigations of what it called 'the crime scenes.' Danish defence minister Morten Bodskov told broadcaster TV2: 'It is very serious, and this is by no means a coincidence. It doesn't just seem planned, but very well planned.' Police were assisted by Denmark's Armed Forces and collaborated with, among others, the Danish security and intelligence agency. The further investigation of the ruptures of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in Denmark's exclusive economic zone would be handled jointly by Copenhagen Police and Denmark's Security and Intelligence Service. Danish police could not say when the investigation is expected to be concluded. 'It is still too early to say anything about the framework under which the international cooperation with e.g. Sweden and Germany will run, as it depends on several actors,' Copenhagen Police said. The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the investigations into blasts that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea appeared to have been set up with the intention of falsely blaming Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said 'elementary logic' showed the pipeline damage was a blow to Russia's interests. He said the investigation was being conducted 'secretively' and without Moscow's involvement. 'The main thing is that the way it looks in public, according to statements we are hearing from Germany, from France, and from Denmark: this investigation was set up inherently to put the blame on Russia,' he said. Swedish authorities announced on October 6 that they had conducted an underwater inspection of the site and collected 'pieces of evidence,' and that the inspection backed up suspicions of probable sabotage. 'We can conclude that there have been detonations at Nord Stream 1 and 2 in the Swedish exclusive economic zone that has led to extensive damage to the gas pipelines,' public prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said in a statement at the time. Ljungqvist added that the 'crime scene investigation had strengthened the suspicions of aggravated sabotage.' He said they had seized some material on site that it would go on to analyse. 'Pieces of evidence have been gathered at the crime scene and these will now be examined,' the prosecutor said. The prosecutor did not disclose details, citing the confidentiality of the investigation and stating that 'the issue is very sensitive.' Initially, the leaks were assumed to have been accidental, but opinions rapidly changed with several governments stating that four separate leaks happening almost simultaneously was beyond coincidence. The governments of Denmark and Sweden previously said they suspected that several hundred pounds of explosives were involved in carrying out a deliberate act. World leaders have called the damages an act of sabotage, and Moscow has sought to pin the blame on the West, suggesting the United States stood to gain. Washington has denied any involvement. The leaks from Nord Stream 1 and 2 discharged large amounts of methane into the air, and concerns have been raised of the massive environmental impact. The footage was released after Norwegian police said on Monday they arrested four Russians suspected of violating a photography ban, as the country fears possible sabotage at critical infrastructure sites. Norway is on high alert following several reports of mysterious drone sightings close to offshore oil and gas drilling platforms run by the major energy producer. Monday's announcement came just days after Norwegian police arrested two Russians in two separate incidents last week. They were accused of illegally flying drones and taking photos or videos. Officers arrested the four in northern Norway in a car with Russian licence plates last Thursday and a day later placed them in custody for a week, regional police said in a statement. Police have not disclosed what the four Russians - three men and one woman - were interested in but they had taken photos of objects covered by a photography ban. The four, in their late 20s, had arrived in Norway from Finland in late September or early October. They were arrested with a 'substantial' amount of photos, but have denied any wrongdoing and have claimed they were just tourists, police official Gaute Rydmark told Norwegian television TV2. Norway's Justice Minister Emilie Enger Mehl refused to comment on the matter, but said 'there is heightened pressure on Norway, from an intelligence point of view'. Police said the four were not in possession of any drones, unlike the other two Russians arrested last week, also in the country's north. Norway, along with several other Western nations, has forbidden Russians and Russian entities from flying over its territory following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Breaking that ban is punishable by a three-year prison term while unauthorised photography can merit a one-year sentence. The Russian embassy to Norway deplored what it termed a lack of information from Oslo on the ban, lamenting 'the groundless and discriminatory nature' of the measure. 'In general, we are concerned about the 'hysteria' unfolding in Norway,' the embassy said in a Facebook post, adding it was 'ordinary tourists who openly imported their equipment to Norway and again openly filmed the beautiful Norwegian nature' who were 'suffering' as a result. It further called for the 'swift' and 'impartial' resolution of the cases affecting its nationals to enable them to return home. Norway has also beefed up security at its offshore oil and gas drilling platforms after the drone sightings and last month's Nord Stream gas pipeline blasts in the Baltic Sea, widely assumed to be the result of sabotage. The Scandinavian country has overtaken Russia as the main supplier of natural gas to Western Europe after the invasion led to a cut in energy imports from Moscow. On Sunday, the airspace around Norway's oil capital Stavanger was briefly closed after a drone was observed in the southwest region. On Friday, satellite images showed that Russian president Vladimir Putin had increased the number of his strategic nuclear bombers stationed at an airbase near the Finnish and Norwegian borders. The move came amid high tension over whether Putin plans to launch an atomic attack in Europe and his on-going invasion of Ukraine, which has suffered a string of embarrassing setbacks in recent months. The disclosure came from Faktisk.no - an independent Norwegian fact checking website - which obtained the data from American satellite operator Planet. The buildup above at the air base follows international concern over another report two weeks ago, when The Jerusalem Post revealed there was an 'unusual deployment' of seven nuclear bombers at the airbase. This was highlighted by Israeli intelligence firm ImageSat International which detected the 'irregular presence' of TU-160s and TU-95s. The Armageddon planes are usually stationed at Engels Air Base, 450 miles south-east of Moscow. Now, however, the bombers are stationed around 115 miles away from the border of NATO member Norway, and about 95 miles away from the soon-to-become Alliance member, Finland."
2022-10-18,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11327105/Kremlin-annexed-Ukrainian-lands-protected-Russian-nuclear-weapons.html,Fresh nuke fears as Kremlin warns four invaded Ukrainian regions are under the protection of its nuclear arsenal after Kyiv begged West for powerful air defence systems,"Four occupied regions of Ukraine that Vladimir Putin annexed to Russia are under the protection of Moscow's nuclear arsenal, the Kremlin said today. Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, told reporters that the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions are 'inalienable parts of the Russian Federation [and] their security is provided for at the same level as the rest of Russia's territory.' It is the clearest indication yet that Moscow would use its nuclear weapons to protect them, and comes as Putin steps up his war in Ukraine by targeting Ukrainian energy and water facilities. Kyiv has begged its western allies for more air defences to help protect its power plants, as President Zelensky says a third have been destroyed in a little over a week just as winter is setting in. Peskov made his remarks on a conference call with journalists, one of whom asked whether occupied parts of Ukraine are now under Moscow's 'nuclear umbrella'. 'All these territories are inalienable parts of the Russian Federation and they are all protected,' he said. 'Their security is provided for at the same level as [it is for] the rest of Russia's territory.' Russian nuclear doctrine - the framework that spells out when atomic weapons could be used - permits their use when 'the existence of the state is threatened'. By extending the borders of the state into Ukraine, at least in the Kremlin's eyes, Putin has created a pre-text for using them by saying Ukrainian attacks aimed at liberating them are a threat to Russia itself. Kyiv's troops are currently advancing in three out of the four regions, and captured a significant amount of territory in Kherson two weeks ago. Putin said last month that Moscow was ready to use nuclear weapons if necessary to defend Russia's ""territorial integrity"". Meanwhile President Joe Biden said on Oct. 6 that his threat had brought the world closer to ""Armageddon"" than at any time since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Nearly eight months into his invasion of Ukraine, some analysts believe the likelihood of Putin resorting to nuclear weapons has increased since his army suffered a series of major defeats. Putin's ally Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, warned the West last week against backing Russia into a corner. Other analysts have argued the nuclear risk is overstated, suggesting it would be suicidal for Putin to embark on such an escalation. NATO is conducting nuclear preparedness exercises this week and has said it expects Russia to hold its own nuclear drills imminently, but Peskov said he had no information on that. ""There is an established system of notifications to inform about the conduct of exercises, and this is carried out through the channels of the Ministry of Defence,"" he said. Putin last month proclaimed that the territories Moscow was taking from Ukraine would be part of Russia ""for ever"". But Russia does not wholly control any of the four regions and has yet to define their borders. The annexation was condemned as illegal by Ukraine, its Western allies and an overwhelming majority of countries in the United Nations General Assembly. Russia has lost ground in the four regions even since it claimed control over them in a lavish Kremlin ceremony on Sept. 30. Peskov said work was still under way to integrate them into Russia's legal, economic and security systems."

Bombing raids once again rocked energy facilities in Kyiv and urban centres across the country this morning, causing blackouts and disrupting water supplies, just one day after the capital was peppered with a swarm of suicide drones. The strikes in the early hours of Tuesday hit Kyiv, Kharkiv in the east, Mykolaiv in the south and central regions of Dnipro and Zhytomyr, where officials said hospitals were running on backup generators. Drones bombarded Kyiv on Monday, destroying a residential building in the centre and killing five people in what the presidency described as an attack of desperation. It was the second Monday in a row that Russia launched punitive strikes which military observers have said appear to be Moscow's response to battlefield losses. Zelensky described the repeated targeted of energy infrastructure as 'another kind of Russian terrorist attacks'. 'Since October 10, 30 percent of Ukraine's power stations have been destroyed, causing massive blackouts across the country,' the Ukrainian leader said on Twitter. He said the attack meant that there was 'no space left for negotiations with (President Vladimir) Putin's regime'. Zhytomyr, located 80 miles west of Kyiv and with a population of 230,000, was completely without power and water early Monday according to the city's mayor. President Zelensky, speaking overnight, said Russia 'doesn't have any chance on the battlefield and is trying to compensate for its military defeats with terror. 'They continue to do what they do best - terrorise and kill civilians,' he added on Telegram. 'The terrorist state will not change anything with such actions.' Despite plentiful footage of Iranian suicide drones attacking Ukrainian cities this week, the Kremlin on Tuesday denied knowing anything about them being used. Many settlements in the Zhytomyr region west of Kyiv and parts of the city of Dnipro in central Ukraine were without electricity, while power was restored to the southern city of Mykolaiv after strikes overnight. 'Now the city is cut off from electricity and water supplies. Hospitals are working on backup power,' the mayor of Zhytomyr Sergiy Sukhomlyn said in a statement on line. In the northeast meanwhile, Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv some 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the border with Russia was hit with eight missiles, the regional governor said. Kharkiv's mayor Igor Terekhov said an 'industrial enterprise' had been hit. In Kyiv, meanwhile, the DETK energy provider said its staff were 'doing their best to restore electricity supply after the destruction of a critical infrastructure facility in Kyiv city.' 'The situation is critical now across the country because our regions are dependent on one another... it's necessary for the whole country to prepare for electricity, water and heating outages,' Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian president's office, told Ukrainian television. Russian strikes against civilian targets have stepped up markedly in the last 10 days, following a string of humiliating retreats on the battlefields and an attack which hit the Crimea Bridge - a pet project of Putin's that symbolised his power. It appears that, having failed to defeat Kyiv's army, Moscow is now trying to break the will of Ukrainian people to continue the war - likely in the hopes of pushing Zelensky to accept a peace deal that will favour Russia. Two explosions rocked an energy facility in the southeastern city of Dnipro, a city of nearly 1 million, causing serious damage, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a Ukrainian presidential aide. In the southern Ukrainian port of Mykolaiv, a missile slammed into an apartment building killing at least one man, a Reuters witness said, and blasts were heard and smoke seen rising in Kyiv, the capital. There were also reports of power facilities being targeted in the city of Kharkiv, a city with a pre-war population of 1.43 million people, close to the Russian border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of terrorising and killing civilians with the air attacks, which came a day after drone strikes on Kyiv and other cities killed at least four people. 'Ukraine is under fire by the occupiers. They continue to do what they do best - terrorise and kill civilians,' Zelenskiy wrote on the Telegram messaging app. 'The terrorist state will not change anything for itself with such actions. It will only confirm its destructive and murderous essence, for which it will certainly be held to account.' There was no immediate word on how many people had been killed in the strikes. Russia earlier this month named General Sergei Suvorikin as overall commander of what Moscow calls its 'special operation' in Ukraine. Suvorikin served in Syria and Chechnya where Russian forces pounded cities in a scorched earth policy against its foes. Nicknamed 'General Armageddon' by the Russian media because of his alleged toughness, his appointment was followed by the biggest wave of missile strikes against Ukraine since Moscow invaded on Feb. 24. Russia carried out its latest strikes on Tuesday after the United States warned it would hold Moscow accountable for any war crimes. Moscow denies targeting civilians. Its defence ministry has said it is carrying out attacks on military targets and energy infrastructure across Ukraine using high-precision weapons. In the port city of Mykolaiv, a Reuters witness said they had heard three explosions in the early hours of Tuesday. A missile had completely destroyed one wing of a building in the downtown area, leaving a massive crater, they said. A fire crew was seen pulling the dead body of a man from the rubble. 'In Mykolaiv, the enemy destroyed a residential building with S-300 missiles. A person died. There was also a strike at the flower market, the chestnut park. I wonder what the Russian terrorists were fighting against at these absolutely peaceful facilities?' Zelenskiy said. The Russian strikes followed advances by Ukrainian forces in the east and south and came after an Oct. 8 blast on a bridge linking mainland Russia to Crimea - the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. U.S. President Joe Biden's press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Monday that the White House 'strongly condemns Russiaâs missile strikes' and spoke of Putinâs 'brutality'. Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what he called a 'special operation' to root out what it calls dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance, with the help of arms supplied by the United States and its allies, who have also imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw."
2022-10-18,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11326693/Death-toll-Russian-jet-crash-city-Yeysk-rises.html,"Full horror of Russian warplane apartment block crash revealed: Death toll hits 13, including three children, and three adults leap to their doom rather than burn alive, as video shows shocked rookie pilot lying nearby after ejecting","Thirteen people have died including three children and three adults who jumped from a burning apartment block after a Russian military jet crashed next to the building and set it on fire. A Sukhoi 34 fighter-bomber taking off from an airfield in the southern Russian city of Yeysk, near the border with Ukraine, on Monday evening plunged from the sky moments later with one engine on fire - slamming into the ground in front of an apartment block and dousing the building in burning fuel. Firefighters who spent the night dousing the flames said early on Tuesday that 13 people had been killed in the blaze with another 68 rescued from the block, 19 of whom required treatment for various injuries. Both pilots ejected safely, with footage showing one of them on the ground nearby still attached to his parachute. The Russian military said the men were taking part in training when the crash happened and the stranded pilot can be heard denying the craft was shot down as people try to help him. The crash is yet another humiliating loss for Russian president Vladimir Putin's beleaguered air force, which has now suffered ten non-combat crashes since the start of the war. His pilots have also failed to destroy Ukraine's much smaller air force and are limited to operating behind Russian lines after failing to take out Kyiv's air defences. The Sukhoi Su-34 is a Russian-made supersonic fighter-bomber aircraft. It was developed in the 1990s to replace its ageing predecessor, the Su-24, but did not enter widespread use with Russia's air force until well into the 2000s. The Su-34 is considered a fairly capable multi-role aircraft, in that it is primarily designed to strike ground and surface targets with missiles and bombs, but can also engage in air-to-air combat missions. However, it has a reputation for being accident prone. On two separate occasions in 2019, two pairs of Su-34s collided during training exercises, and a fifth jet crashed during a training mission in 2020. Footage of the pilot lying on the ground also appears to capture the sound of explosions in the background, sparking rumours on Russian social media that the plane was flying a combat mission and ammunition detonated after it came down. But Krasnodar regional governor Veniamin Kondratyev denied this, saying the explosions were fuel tanks bursting. Russian outlet Zvezdanews reported the fire was extinguished with the help of 410 firefighters and emergency services personnel. Deputy governor Anna Minkova said additional beds were being prepared for injured civilians, adding: 'Specialists of the burn department from regional clinical hospitals have been sent to Yeysk.' Putin was informed of the fire and ordered 'all necessary assistance be given to casualties from the military plane incident', the Kremlin told state-run news agency TASS. The Russian ministry of defence said: 'On October 17, 2022, while climbing to perform a training flight from the military airfield of the southern military district, a Su-34 aircraft crashed. The aircraft crashed within the city of Yeysk. 'According to the report of the ejected pilots, the cause of the plane crash was the ignition of one of the engines during take-off. 'At the site of the crash of the Su-34 in the courtyard of one of the residential areas, the fuel of the aircraft ignited.' Aleksandr Kots, chief war correspondent for pro-Kremlin newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, said the aircraft was an Su-34 from Russia's 277th Bombing Aviation Regiment. 'So far, the main version is that it was birds getting into the engines at take-off,' he claimed. Firefighters, helicopters and ambulances went to the nine-floor apartment block, with Mr Kondratyev declaring all regional emergency services were working to put out the fire. 'The fire spread to a few floors. According to preliminary information, 17 flats have been affected,' the governor added. Russia's investigative committee, which probes serious crimes, said it had opened a criminal investigation into the crash. The first to fifth floors of the block were set ablaze, witnesses said. One report said emergency services were struggling to extinguish the flames, which had spread throughout the building, exacerbated by jet fuel spewed across the crash site. Oksana, a resident who declined to give her last name, said the area was cordoned off. 'There could be an explosion. Everything is burning inside. there is smoke,' she told AFP. 'I'm in shock obviously. My child was alone at home. We already used to go to sleep with fear every day - Mariupol is just across from us,' she said, referring to the Ukrainian port across the Sea of Azov which withstood months of heavy bombardment earlier in the war. Former Russian presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak said: 'It's scary to imagine how many dead there will be.' Just a few hundred miles across the border from Yeysk, Ukrainian civilians experienced more terror yesterday as Iranian-made kamikaze drones launched by Russia attacked Kyiv in the morning. At least five explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital, starting around 3.30am on Monday as waves of Shahed-136 drones - 28 in total - dodged air defences and slammed into the city, with police and armed forces resorting to firing machine guns into the air in an attempt to bring them down. One of the drones bore the phrase 'for Belgorod' - a Russian city that acts as a staging ground for attacks on Ukraine that was shelled at the weekend. It was also the scene of a gun attack on a barracks that saw at least 11 soldiers killed by two conscripts on Saturday. One strike appeared to target Kyiv's heating network, hitting an operations centre. Another slammed into a four-story residential building, ripping a large hole in it and collapsing at least three apartments on top of each other. Three people were killed and 19 rescued from the rubble, four of them wounded. Airstrikes then hit critical infrastructure in the Dnipro and Sumy regions - in the centre and north of Ukraine - killing 'several' people while leaving hundreds of villages without power, prime minister Denys Shmyhal said. Suicide drones also struck the port of Mykolaiv late on Sunday night, setting sunflower oil storage tanks alight. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said the strikes were aimed at 'terrorising the civilian population' but vowed: 'The enemy can attack our cities but it won't be able to break us.'"
2022-10-18,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11328569/Sir-Rod-Steward-hailed-great-hero-Ukrainian-family-saved-housed-Berkshire.html,EXCLUSIVE: 'Sir Rod is a very great man': Father of Ukrainian refugee family who were housed in Berkshire by singing legend hails him as 'a great hero' - and reveals he plays Stewart's music in the house EVERY day,"A family of Ukrainian refugees played Sir Rod Stewart's music in the house every day after the singing legend saved them from war-torn Ukraine. Grateful dad Rostyslav Kurtiak, 49, told how his family owed their lives to the rocker after he found a home for them in a leafy Berkshire town. Rostyslav's family of seven are now living in a £500,000 three-storey townhouse and the singer has pledged to pay their rent and bills for at least a year. Clutching his two-year-old son Dymtro in his arms he told MailOnline: 'Sir Rod is a very great man. He saved my family from danger. 'Now my children are safe and are learning in school like normal children.' The family are settling in to their four-bedroomed home in Bracknell, Berks after moving in in the summer. Sir Rod, 77, and wife Penny, 51, stepped in after hearing of the plight of ­Rostyslav, wife Olena and children Taras, 17, Kostya, 16, Roman, 13, Mariia, 10, and Dymtro. The family, who do not speak English, found themselves homeless and without money after fleeing their homeland. The singer had already teamed up with family members to rescue refugees after organising three trucks to take 16 refugees back to safety in Berlin. Rostyslav hailed Sir Rod as 'a great hero' and said that in tribute he plays his music round the clock. He said: 'Of course I love his music. I always liked it but now I am his biggest fan. 'I play his music every day, every day! My favourite is Sailing. I love the version he does with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. 'My children love his songs too. We play his music on You Tube. He is a very great singer and a very great man.' Rostyslav also likes Rhythm of My Heart - which Sir Rod said he wrote about the Vietnam War but said he would dedicate to Ukrainians on his upcoming tour. The family's home was built in 2005 and features a top floor master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom. There is a large family kitchen downstairs and a fenced off garden at the back. Rostyslav said: 'When we first moved in we did not know about Sir Rod. 'When we found out and it was such a shock. He came round to visit us last week. 'It was a great surprise. He had tea and ate sweets and we went in the garden.' Rostyslav said he had previously worked in the legal profession as well as as an electrician and in computers and photography. The dad, who said he is hoping to find work once he has settled in and improves his language skills, added of Sir Rod: 'He has done so much for our country saving children every day. 'Winter is coming and it is going to be a very difficult time for my people.' Sir Rod said he wanted to use his 'power' as a knight to help others. He told the Daily Mirror of the moment he met the family for the first time. He said: 'I walked through the door and they all came running down the stairs, all beautifully dressed in Ukrainian national costume. 'It was so lovely that they all made that effort. They made me a cup of tea and we had loads of biscuits and chocolates, although the baby kept nicking all of mine. It really was wonderful.' He added of the visit: 'I think they had been briefed before they met me as to who I was - and they certainly know who I am now, since I left about 500 CDs for them.' Neighbours told of their surprise after hearing the family owed their new home to the singer. One said: 'We knew they lived there but had no idea who was behind it. We didn't know who had set them up. 'They keep themselves to themselves. We see them walking their kids to school. The parents don't speak English. 'The house had been empty for quite a while. The people who owned it struggled to sell it and they put it on the rental market. 'It had been empty for quite a long time. It's good that he's come along and there are people living in there otherwise it would be unoccupied.' Another woman neighbour said; 'It's such a nice thing to do. 'It's lovely to get your house paid for and you don't have to worry about your gas and electric bills, especially now when you've got five kids. It's a start for them. 'It's nice to see someone famous doing something nice with their money.' The woman added of the family: 'They seem friendly enough. The kids play out here on bikes. Bracknell is a nice place to live. It's a new town. There's lots of schools, good facilities and there are some really lovely places around here. 'There's lots of green spaces around and parks. Windsor is just up the road so your not far from Royalty.' A woman who lives next door said: 'We haven't seen Sir Rod unfortunately. I am a fan of his. 'They moved in the summer over a month or so. It was a gradual move. There was a van that kept coming and dropping off bits and pieces here and there. 'They've done well. Very well. They don't have a car so you see them walking around. The schools are a little way away. 'It would take you about 20 minutes to walk to the town centre. 'I spoke to them a couple of weeks ago to ask them if they wanted our two bar stools because we were buying new ones and didn't know what their furniture situation is like. 'He said the little one was a bit too young and he was worried he might hurt himself. 'I had to use the translator on his phone to communicate. I spoke into the phone and it translated.' Another neighbour added: 'They have been here two or three months. I always say hello to them. The dad is always friendly. 'I haven't seen Rod Stewart but it's a really nice thing to have done.'"

In a message aimed at 'the West,' Saud al-Shaalan is seen in a video saying 'anybody who challenges the existence of this kingdom, we are all projects of jihad and martyrdom. Anybody that thinks they can threaten us--' Al-Shaalan's threat comes at a time of sky-high tensions between Washington and Riyadh after OPEC+ cut oil production by two million barrels per day and the Biden administration accused the Saudi Kingdom of aligning itself with Russia and Putin. Biden, in turn, said he would 'reassess' the U.S.'s alliance with the Saudis as the move was sure to jack up gas prices just ahead of midterm elections. A gallon of gas is now averaging $3.88 in the U.S. Biden claimed that Riyadh would face 'consequences' as aides announced the U.S. would be reevaluating its relationship with the Saudis. 'There´s going to be some consequences for what they've done with Russia,' Biden said in a CNN interview aired last Tuesday. 'I'm not going to get into what I'd consider and what I have in mind,' he added. 'But there will be - there will be consequences.' The Kingdom then hit back with bombshell statement that the Biden administration had requested to delay the OPEC production cut until after the midterms. The White House is now bracing for a further spike in gas prices before millions of Americans are set to cast their ballots. 'The country that benefits the most from this 2 million barrel cut is Russia,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said in a call with reporters on Friday. The cut 'allows [Putin] to continue to fund his war making machine and it certainly gave him, Mr Putin, a sense of comfort here,' Kirby continued. The Saudi foreign minister said such an accusation is intended to 'distort the facts' and claimed Saudi Arabia has taken a 'principled position' with respect to the Russia-Ukraine war. Biden himself had a controversial meeting with the crown prince, beginning with a fist bump rather than a handshake, in July to talk energy production. 'The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would first like to express its total rejection of these statements that are not based on facts, and which are based on portraying the OPEC+ decision out of its purely economic context,' bin Farhan Al Saud said in a statement. The foreign minister said that Saudi Arabia supports UN resolutions regarding the war and rejects 'any infringement on the sovereignty of countries over their territories.' The foreign minister also implied the Biden administration had begged them to at least wait until after the midterms to cut production. 'The Government of the Kingdom clarified through its continuous consultation with the U.S. Administration that all economic analyses indicate that postponing the OPEC+ decision for a month, according to what has been suggested, would have had negative economic consequences,' bin Farhan Al Saud said. But Kirby said Washington presented Riyadh with analysis showing there was 'no market basis' for production cuts and 'they could easily wait till the next OPEC meeting and see how things developed.' 'Other OPEC nations communicated to us privately that they felt coerced to support Saudi's direction.' In a press call Kirby said Saudi Arabia had been 'twisting arms' to get other nations to agree to the cut, and 'more than one' had privately expressed concerns about doing so."

But Ikea has increased them by up to 80 per cent in a year, a study reveals. Furniture price rises are a major contributor to the wider cost of living increase. Ikea has blamed the higher cost of raw materials and shipping for its increases, which are linked to the impact of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The Swedish firm’s Jokkmokk set of dining table and chairs has increased by 80 per cent from £99 to £179, according to the study by Retail Week. It found a Glostad two-seater sofa that cost £90 is now £150 – an increase of more than 60 per cent – while a Brimnes chest of drawers went up by 47 per cent from £85 to £125. A Vatnestrom super king mattress increased by 32 per cent from £650 to £859 and bed frames, such as the Fyresdal and Slattum, are up by 46 per cent. Ikea said it kept its prices low so that ‘as many people as possible are able to afford them [and] this remains our focus’. But it added: ‘We are not immune to the macro-economic developments that businesses, retailers and the public are currently facing, from the increased cost of materials and transportation to the war in Ukraine and inflation. ‘We have had to adjust our prices to reflect this increased cost base. Our approach during this period has sought to protect the prices of our most-loved and lowest-priced products.’ Ikea said prices continued to be a ‘key cornerstone’ of the business and it intended to keep them as low as it can and reduce them when possible"
2022-10-17,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11324979/Britain-blasts-Iran-sending-Putin-kamikaze-drones.html,Britain blasts Iran for sending Putin 'kamikaze drones' with 'For Belgorod' scrawled on them for revenge attack on Kyiv which left innocents including six-month pregnant wife dead - as protesters stage demo over killing,"Britain, the US and France have claimed that Iran's export of 'kamikaze drones' to Russia, which have been deployed in multiple attacks on Ukrainian urban and civilian centres, violates a key UN security council resolution and a landmark 2015 nuclear deal. Ukraine has reported a spate of Russian attacks using Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in recent weeks, the most recent of which saw a husband and his six-months-pregnant wife killed in Kyiv this morning. 'Earlier today our French and British allies publicly offered the assessment that Iran's supply of these UAVs (for) Russia is a violation of UN Security Council resolution 2231,' A US State Department spokesperson said. 'This is something that we agree with.' Resolution 2231 endorsed the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - that limited Tehran's uranium enrichment activity, making it harder for Iran to develop nuclear arms while lifting international sanctions. Under the resolution, a conventional arms embargo on Iran was in place until October 2020, but Western diplomats said the resolution still includes restrictions on missiles and related technologies that last until October 2023 and that encompass the export and purchase of advanced military systems such as drones. Iran has not confirmed the delivery of its drones to Russia, and the Kremlin has not confirmed their use in Ukraine. But at least five explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital from around 3.30am local time as waves of what are believed to be Shahed-136 drones dodged air defences and slammed into the city, with police and armed forces resorting to firing machine guns into the air in an attempt to bring them down. Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko confirmed that a six-months-pregnant wife and her young husband were among those who had been killed. He posted on social media, saying: 'A husband and wife who were expecting a child. The woman was six months pregnant.' Emergency services said the overall death toll in the capital from today's attacks has risen to four, while several more have been wounded. One of the drones appeared to be emblazoned with the phrase 'for Belgorod' - a Russian city that acts as a staging ground for attacks on Ukraine which was shelled at the weekend. Today's attacks prompted Ukrainian citizens to protest outside of the Iranian embassy in Kyiv, waving their national flag and demanding that the Iranian government cease the delivery of more deadly drones to Russia. One drone strike today appeared to target Kyiv's heating network, hitting an operations centre. Another slammed into a four-story residential building, ripping a large hole in it and collapsing at least three apartments on top of each other. Rescue workers searching for victims scrambled over the debris from which gray smoke billowed. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the drones strikes were aimed at 'terrorising the civilian population' but vowed: 'The enemy can attack our cities but it won't be able to break us.' It comes a week after a huge barrage of Russian missiles and Iranian-made kamikaze drones targeted virtually every major Ukrainian city, destroying infrastructure and killing civilians after a blast on the Crimean Bridge. Russia has continued striking cities and infrastructure since then - albeit at a lower intensity - having apparently changed tactics in the war after a humiliating series of defeats on the battlefield. The strikes also came as Nato this week begins nuclear weapons drills that will take place in northern Europe. Nato is set to start military drills, practising the use of Europe's nuclear bombs, today after Russian president Vladimir Putin warned a direct clash between the alliance and Russia would spark 'global catastrophe'. Its annual nuclear exercise Steadfast Noon, which does not involve live bombs, will see up to 60 aircrafts take part in flights over Belgium, the North Sea and Britain. Vitaliy Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, said the central Shevchenkivskiy district was targeted by blasts which hit several residential buildings, burying at least 18 people in rubble - two of whom remain trapped. Oksana Kovalenko, a local journalist, said critical energy infrastructure was also hit. The Iranian-made Shaheds, which Russia has rebranded as Geran-2 drones, pack an explosive charge and can linger over targets before nosediving into them. They can be fired one after the other. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, confirmed in a social media post that Shahed drones were among those used in the strike. Iran has previously denied providing Russia with weapons, although its Revolutionary Guard chief has boasted about providing arms to the world's top powers, without elaborating. The drones have also been repeatedly used by Russia elsewhere in Ukraine in recent weeks to target urban centres and infrastructure, including power stations. They are comparatively cheap, costing in the region of US$20,000. Their use in swarms presents a challenge to Ukrainian air defenses, said Ihnat, the Air Force spokesman. Western nations have promised to bolster Ukrainian air defenses with systems that can shoot down drones but much of that weaponry has yet to arrive and, in some cases, may be months away. 'The challenges are serious because the air defense forces and means are the same as they were at the beginning of the war,' Ihnat said. Some air defense weaponry supplied by Western nations can only be used during daylight hours when targets are visible, he added. Social media video showed drones buzzing over the capital and smoke billowing in the early morning light. The sound of sustained gunfire could also be heard in one post, seemingly trying to shoot a drone down. Explosions were heard from the same central Kyiv district where a missile strike tore a hole in a children's playground a week ago. Russian forces struck Kyiv with Iranian Shahed drones, wrote Yermak in a post on the Telegram social media site. Moscow has repeatedly been using the so-called suicide drones in recent weeks to target urban centres and infrastructure, including power stations. Last week's strikes were the first explosions heard in Kyiv's city centre for several months, and put the capital as well as the rest of the country back on edge as the war nears nine months. Monday's blasts seemed to continue what many fear could become more common occurrences in urban centres. Putin said last week's strikes were in retaliation for the bombing of a bridge connecting the Crimean peninsula with the Russian mainland. Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was disconnected from the national power grid on Monday following Russian shelling, prompting backup diesel generators to kick in, state nuclear energy firm Energoatom said. 'Russian terrorists once again shelled critical infrastructure substations in Ukraine-controlled territory, resulting in the shutdown of the last 750 kV ZNPP-Dniprovska communications line at 03:59,' it said in a statement. Russian forces have occupied the plant in southern Ukraine, Europe's largest, since shortly after invading Ukraine nearly eight months ago but it is operated by Ukrainian staff. Putin blames Ukraine for the blast, which suspended traffic over the bridge and curtailed Moscow's ability to supply its troops in the occupied regions of southern Ukraine. The strike on Kyiv comes as fighting has intensified in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in recent days, as well as the continued Ukrainian counter-offensive in the south near Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Mr Zelensky said on Sunday night in his evening address that there was heavy fighting around the cities of Bakhmut and Soledar in the Donetsk region. The Donetsk and Luhansk regions make up the bulk of the industrial east known as the Donbas, and were two of four regions annexed by Russia in September in defiance of international law. On Sunday, the Russian-backed regime in the Donetsk region said Ukraine had shelled its central administrative building. No casualties were reported. Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian kamikaze drones also hit tanks with sunflower oil at one of the terminals in the Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv late on Sunday, the city mayor said on Monday. One of Ukraine's largest ports, Mykolaiv halted shipments at the start of the Russian invasion, but Ukraine is pushing to open the port to expand shipments of food under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. 'In Mykolaiv, three drones hit an object of industrial infrastructure, where tanks with sunflower oil were ignited,' Mykolaiv mayor Oleksandr Senkevich. The attack took place hours before the strikes in Kyiv by suspected Iranian-made drones, increasingly used by Russia to attack deep into Ukrainian territory. The regional emergencies service published photos of huge tanks with flames and smoke rising over them. Mykolaiv, near the Russian-occupied Kherson region, has been under constant shelling in recent months. Port terminals have already been hit at least twice - in June and August. Ukraine is conducting a counter-offensive to push Russian troops out of the city of Kherson to the south-east. As Putin looks to ramp up his war after eight months of fighting with few significant gains, it was revealed that 9,000 of his troops will deploy to Belarus. The Kremlin claims the move is part of a defensive operation, but it has sparked fresh fears that Putin is trying to drag Belarus - which has so-far acted as a launch pad for Russian attacks but has not been directly involved in fighting - into the war. Russia's defence ministry stated the decision to send soldiers into Belarus, for the first time since March, was 'dictated by the ongoing activity in the areas bordering us'. Belarus borders Ukraine to the north, and if it were to join the war then its troops would almost certainly be directed in a new attack on Kyiv - which sits just 80 miles away across the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Fuelling fears of an attack on the city, China this week ordered all of its citizens to leave the country while others - such as Serbia - closed their embassies in the capital. Ukraine has accused Moscow of using Iranian-made drones as part of multiple deadly strikes that Russian forces launched across Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces used both missiles and Iranian-built drones - believed to have been sent from Belarus - to strike his country. With a range of more than 600 miles, the explosive-laden drones can 'loiter' above potential targets for hours before being slammed directly into enemy soldiers, vehicles or buildings from above - causing an explosion. Reports coming out of Ukraine suggest the drones have inflicted serious damage to Kyiv's forces, as well as Ukrainian infrastructure. Ukrainians who have witnessed attacks by the drones say they make a recognisable noise, and have described them as sounding like 'motorbikes' in the air, while some soldiers have taken to calling it 'the flying lawnmower'. While the drones can be devastating to their targets, soldiers have said they a vulnerable to small arms fire. On Saturday, the General Staff of the Armed forces of Ukraine released a video on Facebook showing a smoking wreckage that it claimed to be one of the drones. The post said it had been shot down by a machine gun. 'This is a primitive handmade product,' Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFERL) last week. 'It's not a high-tech conveyor-belt production like the [Turkish-made] Bayraktar or American and Israeli [unmanned aerial vehicles],' he added. Ukrainian residents described the drone attacks to RFE. 'You can hear the roar. First, I just hear them, but then I saw one fly by and then explode,' one man said. Another said: 'There was a buzz that woke me up. I remember thinking: 'What's that?' The sound was approaching and then there was an explosion near the house.' According to reports, the first recorded use of the drones was in Yemen in Houthi-controlled areas. Iran is reported to have sold hundreds of the drones to Russia. Tehran has denied that it is selling the deadly munitions to the Kremlin, but there is mounting evidence that Moscow's armies have been using them since September against the Ukrainian military to make up for a lack of artillery firepower. Ukrainian military officials say the drones are cheaper and less sophisticated than cruise missiles - but can have a similarly devastating affect on their target. There are concerns among Ukraine's military leaders that if they are not supplied an effective counter-measure, the drones could destroy western-supplied artillery, which have successfully been used to push Russian forces back east. The almost 12-foot long Shahed 136 is designed with a delta-wing shape, with stabilising rudders at the top of the aircraft. The explosives are contained in the nose of the drone, as well as the technology that guides it to its targets for a precision strike. The engine, meanwhile, is found at the rear of the drone, and drives two bladed propellers. It has been compared to an engine one would find on a lawnmower or a moped. 'Its motor sounds like a [motorbike]. You can spot it when it's a few kilometres away,' a Ukrainian soldier named only as Magyar told RFE. 'That's my advice to the military. They fly low and are slow, so you can shoot them down,' he said, noting the drones are usually used against larger targets. 'They carry such a load of explosives that it doesn't make sense to use them against infantry.' Overall, the drone weighs 440lbs, and can fly at speeds of almost 120mph. In order to overwhelm air defences, several of the drones (batches of five and above) are launched at once from the same rack. They are fired almost horizontally with rocket-launch assistance. The rocket is jettisoned on take-off, with the engine taking over once it is airborne. On Friday, Oleksandr Starukh - the regional governor of Zaporizhzhia - said such drones damaged facilities in the city. On Wednesday, other Ukrainian officials said the drones were used to target the town of Bila Tserkva - 50 miles south of Kyiv. The attacks destroyed several buildings in the town, Newsweek reported."
2022-10-17,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11323881/The-cost-heating-home-oil-JUMP-2-354-winter.html,"The cost of heating a home with oil will JUMP to $2,354 this winter, and propane and natural gas users will pay $1,668 and $931, the federal energy agency says, as fuel costs rise and icy weather closes in","The cost of heating a home with oil will jump by 27 percent to $2,354 this winter, and propane and natural gas users will also be hit, the federal energy agency warned as a cold snap closes in on the Midwest, South, and East. Those using propane will see a 5 percent price spike against last winter to $1,668, while Natural gas users will see a 28 percent rise to $931, according to a US Energy Information Administration (EIA) outlook released last week. And consumers will spend hundreds of dollars more if winter is colder than expected, the agency says. The projections for the October-March season come amid soaring inflation and global energy market chaos linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and as millions braced themselves for the first coldest weather of the season. A cold blast could bring freezing temperatures to more than 60 million people across the country this week, with freeze watches and warnings across parts of the Midwest, South, and East. ‘We expect household expenditures on a nominal basis to be up this winter compared to last,’ EIA administrator Joe DeCarolis posted on Twitter. Nearly half of US households rely on natural gas for heat. The average cost to heat a home with gas last winter was $724, far cheaper than other major sources of heat. Electricity is the primary heating source for about 40 percent of homes. It is more expensive than gas at an estimated $1,359 per household this winter — but that is just a 10 percent increase from last winter. Less than 12 million homes rely on the most expensive options — heating oil or propane, about 9 percent of the roughly 130 million US households. Homes that rely on heating oil are concentrated in the Northeast, while the biggest propane users are in the Midwest. Global energy markets have been roiled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February and sanctions imposed on Moscow by the West — and the disruption looks set to continue. Oil supply is likely to remain tight, pushing up prices, after the energy cartel OPEC and allies including Russia pledged on October 5 to cut output by 2 million barrels per day. OPEC+ member states on Sunday lined up to endorse the steep cut to its output target agreed this month after the White House accused Saudi Arabia of coercing other nations into supporting the move."
2022-10-17,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11324439/Aircraft-crashes-residential-building-Russian-city-near-Crimea.html,'Three die' after Russian bomber smashes into residential building 'including one who plunged from window on the ninth floor' and 19 are wounded - while pilots eject after take-off on training flight when Su-34's engine catches fire,"A Kremlin military plane has crashed into a high-rise residential building in Russia, triggering a huge fireball explosion which killed at least three people. The Russian-made Sukhoi Su-34 bomber was on a training flight when it malfunctioned and ploughed into the block of flats in Yeysk, a resort city in the Krasnodar region near Crimea, around 6:30pm local time. The engine caught fire shortly after take-off and both crewmembers ejected moments before the aircraft nosedived directly into the civilian building. An incredible image posted to social media showed one pilot's fully-deployed parachute drifting to the ground directly in front of the crash site, illuminated by a huge wall of flames mere feet away. Four floors of the building were still ablaze for hours after the accident, with flames spanning 2,000sq metres still ripping through the apartment block. Russian outlet Zvezdanews confirmed the fire was eventually extinguished with the help of 410 firefighters and emergency services personnel. It was not immediately clear how many casualties there were, but early reports from Russian outlet Baza suggest at least three people were killed and 19 people, including several children were hospitalised, four of whom are said to be in critical condition. One report claimed that a resident trapped on the upper floors of the stricken apartment block jumped to their death to avoid being burned alive. Krasnodar regional governor Kondratyev, 52, confirmed via his Telegram channel that he was at the scene of the incident, but had no immediate information about casualties. Deputy governor Anna Minkova meanwhile confirmed that additional beds were being prepared to receive injured civilians, adding: 'Specialists of the burn department from regional clinical hospitals have been sent to Yeysk.' Russian President Vladimir Putin was informed of the fire and ordered 'all necessary assistance be given to casualties from the military plane incident,' the Kremlin told the state-run news agency TASS. The Russian ministry of defence said: 'On October 17, 2022, while climbing to perform a training flight from the military airfield of the Southern Military District, a Su-34 aircraft crashed. The aircraft crashed within the city of Yeysk. 'According to the report of the ejected pilots, the cause of the plane crash was the ignition of one of the engines during takeoff. 'At the site of the crash of the Su-34 in the courtyard of one of the residential areas, the fuel of the aircraft ignited.' Chief war correspondent for the pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda Aleksandr Kots specified the aircraft was an Su-34 from Russia's 277th Bombing Aviation Regiment. 'So far, the main version is that it was birds getting into the engines at takeoff,' Kots claimed. The Sukhoi Su-34 is a Russian-made supersonic fighter-bomber aircraft. It was developed in the 1990s to replace its ageing predecessor, the Su-24, but did not enter widespread use with Russia's air force until well into the 2000s. The Su-34 is considered a fairly capable multirole aircraft, in that it is primarily designed to strike ground and surface targets with missiles and bombs, but can also engage in air-to-air combat missions. However, it has a reputation for being accident prone. On two separate occasions in 2019, two pairs of Su-34s collided during training exercises, and a fifth jet crashed during a training mission in 2020. Firefighters, helicopters and ambulances rushed to the scene of the nine-floor apartment block, with governor Kondratyev declaring that all regional emergency services were working to put out the fire. 'The fire spread to a few floors. According to preliminary information, 17 flats have been affected,' Kondratyev said. Russia's investigative committee, which investigates serious crimes, said it opened a criminal investigation into the crash. Local authorities said that the massive blaze engulfed several floors of an apartment building and at least 15 apartments were affected. The first to fifth floors of the nine storey block of flats were set ablaze, eyewitnesses said, while one report from the scene said that emergency services were struggling to extinguish the flames which had spread throughout the apartment block, exacerbated by the aviation fuel spewed across the crash site. Oksana, a local resident who declined to give her last name, said the area was cordoned off. 'There could be an explosion. Everything is burning inside. there is smoke,' she told AFP. 'I'm in shock obviously. My child was alone at home. We already used to go to sleep with fear everyday - Mariupol is just across from us,' she said, referring to the Ukrainian port city just across the Sea of Azov which withstood months of heavy bombardment earlier in the war. Former Russian presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak said: 'It's scary to imagine how many dead there will be.' Just a few hundred miles across the border from Yeysk, Ukrainian civilians were experiencing more terror today as kamikaze drones made by Iran and launched by Russia attacked Kyiv this morning. At least five explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital, starting around 3.30am local time as multiple waves of Shahed-136 drones - 28 in total - dodged air defences and slammed into the city, with police and armed forces resorting to firing machine guns into the air in an attempt to bring them down. One of the drones bore the phrase 'for Belgorod' - a Russian city that acts as a staging ground for attacks on Ukraine which was shelled at the weekend. It was also the scene of a gun attack on a military barracks that saw at least 11 soldiers killed by two conscripts on Saturday. One strike appeared to target the city's heating network, hitting an operations centre. Another slammed into a four-story residential building, ripping a large hole in it and collapsing at least three apartments on top of each other. Three people were killed there with 19 were rescued from the rubble, four of them wounded. Rescue workers searching for victims scrambled over the debris from which gray smoke billowed. Airstrikes then hit critical infrastructure in the Dnipro and Sumy regions - in the centre and north of Ukraine - killing 'several' people while leaving hundreds of villages without power, prime minister Denys Shmyhal said. Suicide drones also struck the port city of Mykolaiv late Sunday night, setting sunflower oil storage tanks alight. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the drones strikes were aimed at 'terrorising the civilian population' but vowed: 'The enemy can attack our cities but it won't be able to break us.' It comes a week after a huge barrage of Russian missiles and Iranian-made kamikaze drones targeted virtually every major Ukrainian city, destroying infrastructure and killing civilians after a blast on the Crimean Bridge."

The drones, which were made by Iran and launched by Russia, attacked the Ukrainian capital, blowing up people's homes as they slept and taking out key energy facilities. At least five explosions rocked Kyiv starting around 3.30am local time as multiple waves of Shahed-136 drones - 28 in total - dodged air defences and slammed into the city, with police and armed forces resorting to firing machine guns into the air in an attempt to bring them down. Officials said 13 were taken out, and all flew from the south. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a pregnant wife and her young husband were among those who had been killed.

Russia has continued striking cities and infrastructure since then - albeit at a lower intensity - having apparently changed tactics in the war after a humiliating series of defeats on the battlefield. The strikes also came as Nato this week begins nuclear weapons drills that will take place in northern Europe. Nato is set to start military drills, practising the use of Europe's nuclear bombs, today after Russian president Vladimir Putin warned a direct clash between the alliance and Russia would spark 'global catastrophe'. Its annual nuclear exercise Steadfast Noon, which does not involve live bombs, will see up to 60 aircrafts take part in flights over Belgium, the North Sea and Britain. Vitali Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, said the central Shevchenkivskiy district was targeted by blasts which hit several residential buildings, burying at least 18 people in rubble - two of whom remain trapped. Oksana Kovalenko, a local journalist, said critical energy infrastructure was also hit. The Iranian-made Shaheds, which Russia has rebranded as Geran-2 drones, pack an explosive charge and can linger over targets before nosediving into them. They can be fired one after the other. Andrii Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, confirmed in a social media post that Shahed drones were among those used in the strike. Iran has previously denied providing Russia with weapons, although its Revolutionary Guard chief has boasted about providing arms to the world's top powers, without elaborating. The drones have also been repeatedly used by Russia elsewhere in Ukraine in recent weeks to target urban centers and infrastructure, including power stations. They are comparatively cheap, costing in the region of US$20,000. Their use in swarms presents a challenge to Ukrainian air defenses, said Ihnat, the Air Force spokesman. Western nations have promised to bolster Ukrainian air defenses with systems that can shoot down drones but much of that weaponry has yet to arrive and, in some cases, may be months away. ""The challenges are serious because the air defense forces and means are the same as they were at the beginning of the war,"" Ihnat said. Some air defense weaponry supplied by Western nations can only be used during daylight hours when targets are visible, he added. Social media video showed drones buzzing over the capital and smoke billowing in the early morning light. The sound of sustained gunfire could also be heard in one post, seemingly trying to shoot a drone down. Explosions were heard from the same central Kyiv district where a missile strike tore a hole in a children's playground a week ago. Russian forces struck Kyiv with Iranian Shahed drones, wrote Andrii Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president's office, in a post on the Telegram social media site. Moscow has repeatedly been using the so-called suicide drones in recent weeks to target urban centres and infrastructure, including power stations. Last week's strikes were the first explosions heard in Kyiv's city centre for several months, and put the capital as well as the rest of the country back on edge as the war nears nine months. Monday's blasts seemed to continue what many fear could become more common occurrences in urban centres. Putin said last week's strikes were in retaliation for the bombing of a bridge connecting the Crimean peninsula with the Russian mainland. Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was disconnected from the national power grid on Monday following Russian shelling, prompting backup diesel generators to kick in, state nuclear energy firm Energoatom said. 'Russian terrorists once again shelled critical infrastructure substations in Ukraine-controlled territory, resulting in the shutdown of the last 750 kV ZNPP-Dniprovska communications line at 03:59,' it said in a statement. Russian forces have occupied the plant in southern Ukraine, Europe's largest, since shortly after invading Ukraine nearly eight months ago but it is operated by Ukrainian staff. Putin blames Ukraine for the blast, which suspended traffic over the bridge and curtailed Moscow's ability to supply its troops in the occupied regions of southern Ukraine. The strike on Kyiv comes as fighting has intensified in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in recent days, as well as the continued Ukrainian counter-offensive in the south near Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Mr Zelensky said on Sunday night in his evening address that there was heavy fighting around the cities of Bakhmut and Soledar in the Donetsk region. The Donetsk and Luhansk regions make up the bulk of the industrial east known as the Donbas, and were two of four regions annexed by Russia in September in defiance of international law. On Sunday, the Russian-backed regime in the Donetsk region said Ukraine had shelled its central administrative building. No casualties were reported. Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian kamikaze drones also hit tanks with sunflower oil at one of the terminals in the Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv late on Sunday, the city mayor said on Monday. One of Ukraine's largest ports, Mykolaiv halted shipments at the start of the Russian invasion, but Ukraine is pushing to open the port to expand shipments of food under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. 'In Mykolaiv, three drones hit an object of industrial infrastructure, where tanks with sunflower oil were ignited,' Mykolaiv mayor Oleksandr Senkevich. The attack took place hours before the strikes in Kyiv by suspected Iranian-made drones, increasingly used by Russia to attack deep into Ukrainian territory. The regional emergencies service published photos of huge tanks with flames and smoke rising over them. Mykolaiv, near the Russian-occupied Kherson region, has been under constant shelling in recent months. Port terminals have already been hit at least twice - in June and August. Ukraine is conducting a counter-offensive to push Russian troops out of the city of Kherson to the south-east. As Putin looks to ramp up his war after eight months of fighting with few significant gains, it was revealed that 9,000 of his troops will deploy to Belarus. The Kremlin claims the move is part of a defensive operation, but it has sparked fresh fears that Putin is trying to drag Belarus - which has so-far acted as a launch pad for Russian attacks but has not been directly involved in fighting - into the war. Russia's defence ministry stated the decision to send soldiers into Belarus, for the first time since March, was 'dictated by the ongoing activity in the areas bordering us'. Belarus borders Ukraine to the north, and if it were to join the war then its troops would almost certainly be directed in a new attack on Kyiv - which sits just 80 miles away across the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Fuelling fears of an attack on the city, China this week ordered all of its citizens to leave the country while others - such as Serbia - closed their embassies in the capital. Ukraine has accused Moscow of using Iranian-made drones as part of multiple deadly strikes that Russian forces launched across Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces used both missiles and Iranian-built drones - believed to have been sent from Belarus - to strike his country. With a range of more than 600 miles, the explosive-laden drones can 'loiter' above potential targets for hours before being slammed directly into enemy soldiers, vehicles or buildings from above - causing an explosion. Reports coming out of Ukraine suggest the drones have inflicted serious damage to Kyiv's forces, as well as Ukrainian infrastructure. Ukrainians who have witnessed attacks by the drones say they make a recognisable noise, and have described them as sounding like 'motorbikes' in the air, while some soldiers have taken to calling it 'the flying lawnmower'. While the drones can be devastating to their targets, soldiers have said they a vulnerable to small arms fire. On Saturday, the General Staff of the Armed forces of Ukraine released a video on Facebook showing a smoking wreckage that it claimed to be one of the drones. The post said it had been shot down by a machine gun. 'This is a primitive handmade product,' Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFERL) last week. 'It's not a high-tech conveyor-belt production like the [Turkish-made] Bayraktar or American and Israeli [unmanned aerial vehicles],' he added. Ukrainian residents described the drone attacks to RFE. 'You can hear the roar. First, I just hear them, but then I saw one fly by and then explode,' one man said. Another said: 'There was a buzz that woke me up. I remember thinking: 'What's that?' The sound was approaching and then there was an explosion near the house.' According to reports, the first recorded use of the drones was in Yemen in Houthi-controlled areas. Iran is reported to have sold hundreds of the drones to Russia. Tehran has denied that it is selling the deadly munitions to the Kremlin, but there is mounting evidence that Moscow's armies have been using them since September against the Ukrainian military to make up for a lack of artillery firepower. Ukrainian military officials say the drones are cheaper and less sophisticated than cruise missiles - but can have a similarly devastating affect on their target. There are concerns among Ukraine's military leaders that if they are not supplied an effective counter-measure, the drones could destroy western-supplied artillery, which have successfully been used to push Russian forces back east. The almost 12-foot long Shahed 136 is designed with a delta-wing shape, with stabilising rudders at the top of the aircraft. The explosives are contained in the nose of the drone, as well as the technology that guides it to its targets for a precision strike. The engine, meanwhile, is found at the rear of the drone, and drives two bladed propellers. It has been compared to an engine one would find on a lawnmower or a moped. 'Its motor sounds like a [motorbike]. You can spot it when it's a few kilometres away,' a Ukrainian soldier named only as Magyar told RFE. 'That's my advice to the military. They fly low and are slow, so you can shoot them down,' he said, noting the drones are usually used against larger targets. 'They carry such a load of explosives that it doesn't make sense to use them against infantry.' Overall, the drone weighs 440lbs, and can fly at speeds of almost 120mph. In order to overwhelm air defences, several of the drones (batches of five and above) are launched at once from the same rack. They are fired almost horizontally with rocket-launch assistance. The rocket is jettisoned on take-off, with the engine taking over once it is airborne. On Friday, Oleksandr Starukh - the regional governor of Zaporizhzhia - said such drones damaged facilities in the city. On Wednesday, other Ukrainian officials said the drones were used to target the town of Bila Tserkva - 50 miles south of Kyiv. The attacks destroyed several buildings in the town, Newsweek reported."

The Iran-supplied Shahed-136 weapons rained down on the capital in successive waves of 28 drones, Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Five smashed into the capital itself while 13 or more were shot down in the wider Kyiv region, all of them as they flew in from the south, said a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, Yurii Ihnat. One strike appeared to target the city's heating network, hitting an operations centre while another slammed into a four-story residential building, ripping a large hole in it and collapsing at least three apartments on top of each other, killing three. The Shaheds, which Russia has rebranded as Geran-2 drones, pack an explosive charge and be fired one after the other. With a range of more than 600 miles, the explosive-laden drones can 'loiter' above potential targets for hours before being slammed directly into enemy soldiers, vehicles or buildings from above - causing an explosion. Ukraine has accused Russia of using Iranian-made Shahed-136 UAVs - also known as suicide drones - against military and civilian targets. Tehran has denied selling the drones to Russia, but there is mounting evidence that Moscow is deploying the weapon. Here are some facts and figures about the deadly drone: Andrii Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, confirmed in a social media post that Shahed drones were among those used in the strike. Iran has previously denied providing Russia with weapons, although its Revolutionary Guard chief has boasted about providing arms to the world's top powers, without elaborating.

US B-52 long-range bombers and up to 60 aircraft will take part in training flights over Belgium, the UK and the North Sea today as part of NATO's annual nuclear exercise 'Steadfast Noon'. The nuclear drills - which do not involve live bombs - come after Vladimir Putin said that a direct clash between NATO and Russian troops would lead to 'global catastrophe'. The bulk of the war games will be held at least 625 miles from Russia's borders. Fourteen of NATO's 30 members will take part in the exercises, with around 60 aircraft including fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear warheads and surveillance and refuelling planes conducting training flights. U.S. long-range B-52 bombers will also take part in the manoeuvres after flying in from Minot Air Base in North Dakota. The exercises, which will run until October 30, were planned before Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine in February. Russia usually holds its own annual manoeuvres around the same time, and NATO is expecting Moscow to exercise its nuclear forces sometime this month. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has rejected any calls to scrap the drill after Putin ratcheted up his nuclear rhetoric as his troops lose ground in Ukraine. 'It would send a very wrong signal if we suddenly now cancelled a routine, long-time planned exercise because of the war in Ukraine,' Stoltenberg said last week. 'We need to understand that NATO's firm, predictable behaviour, our military strength, is the best way to prevent escalation.' NATO says it has seen no change in Russia's nuclear posture despite the tougher language from the Kremlin. 'But we remain vigilant,' Stoltenberg said. NATO's nuclear war games comes as Russia attacked the centre of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv during morning rush hour with kamikaze drones on Monday and shelled other cities around the country. Five explosions were reported in the city starting around 6.30am local time, the BBC reported, as the drones managed to dodge air defence systems with police resorting to using rifles to try and shoot them down. This is the second time in a week that Russia has unleashed strikes across Ukraine while its forces face setbacks on the battlefield. An official in Ukraine's presidential office said three people were killed in an attack on a residential building in Kyiv. Black smoke poured out of the windows of a blasted building and emergency service workers toiled to douse flames. Ukraine said the attacks were carried out by Iran-made 'suicide drones', which fly to their target and detonate. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the drones strikes were aimed at 'terrorising the civilian population' but vowed: 'The enemy can attack our cities but it won't be able to break us.' Russia's defence ministry said it had carried out a 'massive' attack on military targets and energy infrastructure across Ukraine using high-precision weapons. It comes a week after a huge barrage of Russian missiles and Iranian-made kamikaze drones targeted virtually every major Ukrainian city, destroying infrastructure and killing civilians after a blast on the Crimean Bridge. Russia has continued striking cities and infrastructure since then - albeit at a lower intensity - having apparently changed tactics in the war after a humiliating series of defeats on the battlefield."
2022-10-17,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11323075/Ukrainian-conductor-shot-dead-Russian-troops-Kherson-refusing-concert.html,Ukrainian conductor is shot dead by Russian troops in Kherson for refusing to take part in concert 'highlighting the improvement of peaceful life' under occupation,"A Ukrainian conductor has been shot dead in his own home by Russian troops for refusing to take part in a concert in occupied territory, Kyiv has claimed. Yuriy Kerpatenko snubbed the Kremlin-backed concert 'intended by the occupiers to demonstrate the so-called 'improvement of peaceful life' in Kherson', the Ukrainian culture ministry said. The October 1 concert was scheduled to include a performance by the Gileya chamber orchestra. Kerpatenko was their principal conductor but he 'categorically refused to cooperate with the occupants', Ukraine said. The musician was also the principal conductor of Kherson's Mykola Kulish Music and Drama Theatre, The Guardian reported. He regularly posted defiant anti-war messages on Facebook until May and family members outside Kherson say they lost contact with him in September. It is believed Russian troops raided his village and executed him in cold blood. The Kherson regional prosecutor's office has now launched a formal investigation 'on the basis of violations of the laws and customs of war, combined with intentional murder'. Fellow musicians and artists around the world have condemned the shocking killing. Dalia Stasevska, who was due to conduct this summer's Last Night of the Proms in London before it was cancelled, said: 'The history of Russia imposing a 'comply or die' policy against artists is nothing new. It has a history which spans for hundred of years.' The Finnish-Ukrainian conductor added: 'I have seen too much silence from Russian colleagues. Would this be the time for Russian musicians, especially those living and working abroad, to finally step up and take a stand against the Russian regime's actions in Ukraine?' Victoria Amelina, a Ukrainian author and war crimes investigator, said: 'We know the Russian regime is hunting activists, journalists, artists, community leaders, and anyone ready to resist the occupation. 'Yet, even knowing the current pattern and history, we cannot and, more importantly, shouldn't get used to hearing about more brutal murders of a bright, talented, brave people whose only fault was being Ukrainian.' Acclaimed novelist Andrey Kurkov who wrote Death and the Penguin said: 'Now the name of Yuriy Kerpatenko will be added to the list of murdered artists of Ukraine. 'I increasingly think that Russia is not only seeking to occupy Ukrainian territories, but also diligently destroying Ukrainian identity, an important part of which is Ukrainian culture.' A military commissar in charge of enlistment for Vladimir Putin's chaotic mobilisation campaign has been found dead in 'suspicious' circumstances prompting a murder investigation. The body of Lt-Col Roman Malyk, 49, was discovered near the fence of his home in a village in the Primorsky region of Russia. Some reports said he died from hanging. Russian police have opened a murder probe but have not ruled out suicide. On Telegram, rumours are flying that Malyk, described as 'well-adjusted and self-assured' was killed. The married father-of-two was a veteran of Russia's war in Chechnya and friends and family strongly denied he killed himself. He was in charge of enlistment in Partizan district and surrounding areas in Primorsky region. He was described by friends as a 'strong and courageous man' who was 'not broken under the weight of harsh military events and great losses' in Chechnya. 'He was a man of his word and deed, known and respected in the city for his honesty and integrity,' he said. His 'suspicious' death comes after a spate of attacks on mobilisation offices across Russia, as well as multiple gas executives who have died in mysterious circumstances. As many as 70 offices have been hit with Molotov cocktails as anger grows over enlistment. There is rising fury over mobilisation officials forcibly recruiting men with little or no training in apparent violation of the rules. Armed conscript-snatching teams of enlistment officers backed by police have been operating in Russian cities, grabbing men on underground trains, on the street, and in offices. Russia has put in place additional security for mobilisation teams and enlistment offices amid a demand by Putin to find another 80,000 men to complete a total of 300,000 recruits for the initial stage of enlistment. They are to be protected by national guardsmen, said MP Alexander Khinshtein. The mobilisation has led to hundreds and thousands of men fleeing abroad, voting with their feet against Putin. Earlier this month in neighbouring Khabarovsk region Yury Laiko, 41, a military enlistment commissioner, was dismissed amid mayhem over the forced mobilisation of local men. He was blamed for 'errors' in manically conscripting thousands of reservists in vast Khabarovsk region, half of whom were found to be 'unfit for service'. Governor Mikhail Degtyaryov said 'several thousand of our countrymen received summonses and arrived at the military registration and enlistment offices. 'Half of them we returned home as not fulfilling the selection criteria for enlistment into military service…[so] military commissar Yury Laiko was dismissed'."

Video taken from an apartment block in St Petersburg shows the man literally fleeing the draft after conscription officers showed up at his home. Running through traffic, the man manages to evade two officers before another two catch up and collar him. He is now set to be sent to a training camp and could find himself fighting and dying on the frontlines of Ukraine in just a few weeks. Putin ordered a partial mobilisation of what he said would be Russia's military reserves last month, with 300,000 men due to be sent to the battlefield. Since then, footage has emerged of large numbers of men - mostly from Russia's rural hinterlands - being herded on to buses and taken to training camps. Though their families were told they would spend months building up skills before going to fight, death notices have begun coming home after just a few weeks. Putin announced that some 220,000 men have been called up so far and that the draft order would end in a couple of weeks. But rumours have none-the-less been swirling that Putin's order actually goes far beyond the 300,000 he announced - with as many as 1million men on the list. Whispers have been stoked by the fact that a key part of the draft order issued by Putin was omitted, with sources saying it contains the number to be called up. That has sparked a rush for the exits, with almost 400,000 though to have fled across the border into Finland, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Mongolia. Putin is desperately trying to stop his military from losing any more ground to the Ukrainian army, which has made big gains on two fronts - both north and south - in the last several weeks. Experts and analysts believe the new recruits will be used to cling on to what territory he has managed to gain in eight months of fighting, while missile attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure and cities erodes the will to fight. The aim appears to be to pressure Kyiv and its allies into accepting a peace deal that favours Moscow - amid fears that would allow Putin the time to rearm his military before invading again. Russia is known to have suffered heavy losses on the battlefield in Ukraine, though its exact casualty figures are shrouded in mystery. Ukraine claims to have killed 65,000 Russian soldiers and to have taken out more than 2,500 tanks, 5,000 armoured vehicles, and hundreds of planes and helicopters. The Pentagon estimated back in August that 80,000 Russians had been killed or wounded, or around half the force that Putin originally invaded with. Russia's defence ministry improbably claims that just 5,937 of its soldiers have died which stands at odds with the admission that 300,000 more troops are needed."

At least five explosions rocked Kyiv starting around 3.30am local time as multiple waves of Shahed-136 drones - 28 in total - dodged air defences and slammed into the city, with police and armed forces resorting to firing machine guns into the air in an attempt to bring them down. Officials said 13 were taken out, and all flew from the south. One of the drones was scrawled with the phrase 'for Belgorod' - a Russian city that acts as a staging ground for attacks on Ukraine which was shelled at the weekend. It was also the scene of a gun attack on a military barracks that saw at least 11 soldiers killed by two conscripts. One strike appeared to target the city's heating network, hitting an operations center. Another slammed into a four-story residential building, ripping a large hole in it and collapsing at least three apartments on top of each other. Three people were killed there with 19 were rescued from the rubble, four of them wounded. Rescue workers searching for victims scrambled over the debris from which gray smoke billowed. Airstrikes then hit critical infrastructure in the Dnipro and Sumy regions - in the centre and north of Ukraine - killing 'several' people while leaving hundreds of villages without power, prime minister Denys Shmyhal said. Suicide drones also struck the port city of Mykoliav late Sunday, setting sunflower oil storage tanks alight. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the drones strikes were aimed at 'terrorising the civilian population' but vowed: 'The enemy can attack our cities but it won't be able to break us.' It comes a week after a huge barrage of Russian missiles and Iranian-made kamikaze drones targeted virtually every major Ukrainian city, destroying infrastructure and killing civilians after a blast on the Crimean Bridge.

Oksana Kovalenko, a local journalist, said critical energy infrastructure was also hit. The Iranian-made Shaheds, which Russia has rebranded as Geran-2 drones, pack an explosive charge and can linger over targets before nosediving into them. They can be fired one after the other. Andrii Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, confirmed in a social media post that Shahed drones were among those used in the strike. Iran has previously denied providing Russia with weapons, although its Revolutionary Guard chief has boasted about providing arms to the world's top powers, without elaborating. The drones have also been repeatedly used by Russia elsewhere in Ukraine in recent weeks to target urban centers and infrastructure, including power stations.

Explosions were heard from the same central Kyiv district where a missile strike tore a hole in a children's playground a week ago.

Moscow has repeatedly been using the so-called suicide drones in recent weeks to target urban centres and infrastructure, including power stations. Last week's strikes were the first explosions heard in Kyiv's city centre for several months, and put the capital as well as the rest of the country back on edge as the war nears nine months. Monday's blasts seemed to continue what many fear could become more common occurrences in urban centres. Putin said last week's strikes were in retaliation for the bombing of a bridge connecting the Crimean peninsula with the Russian mainland. Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was disconnected from the national power grid on Monday following Russian shelling, prompting backup diesel generators to kick in, state nuclear energy firm Energoatom said. 'Russian terrorists once again shelled critical infrastructure substations in Ukraine-controlled territory, resulting in the shutdown of the last 750 kV ZNPP-Dniprovska communications line at 03:59,' it said in a statement. Russian forces have occupied the plant in southern Ukraine, Europe's largest, since shortly after invading Ukraine nearly eight months ago but it is operated by Ukrainian staff. Putin blames Ukraine for the blast, which suspended traffic over the bridge and curtailed Moscow's ability to supply its troops in the occupied regions of southern Ukraine. The strike on Kyiv comes as fighting has intensified in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in recent days, as well as the continued Ukrainian counter-offensive in the south near Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Mr Zelensky said on Sunday night in his evening address that there was heavy fighting around the cities of Bakhmut and Soledar in the Donetsk region. The Donetsk and Luhansk regions make up the bulk of the industrial east known as the Donbas, and were two of four regions annexed by Russia in September in defiance of international law. On Sunday, the Russian-backed regime in the Donetsk region said Ukraine had shelled its central administrative building. No casualties were reported. Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian kamikaze drones also hit tanks with sunflower oil at one of the terminals in the Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv late on Sunday, the city mayor said on Monday. One of Ukraine's largest ports, Mykolaiv halted shipments at the start of the Russian invasion, but Ukraine is pushing to open the port to expand shipments of food under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. 'In Mykolaiv, three drones hit an object of industrial infrastructure, where tanks with sunflower oil were ignited,' Mykolaiv mayor Oleksandr Senkevich. The attack took place hours before the strikes in Kyiv by suspected Iranian-made drones, increasingly used by Russia to attack deep into Ukrainian territory. The regional emergencies service published photos of huge tanks with flames and smoke rising over them. Mykolaiv, near the Russian-occupied Kherson region, has been under constant shelling in recent months. Port terminals have already been hit at least twice - in June and August. Ukraine is conducting a counter-offensive to push Russian troops out of the city of Kherson to the south-east. As Putin looks to ramp up his war after eight months of fighting with few significant gains, it was revealed that 9,000 of his troops will deploy to Belarus. The Kremlin claims the move is part of a defensive operation, but it has sparked fresh fears that Putin is trying to drag Belarus - which has so-far acted as a launch pad for Russian attacks but has not been directly involved in fighting - into the war. Russia's defence ministry stated the decision to send soldiers into Belarus, for the first time since March, was 'dictated by the ongoing activity in the areas bordering us'. Belarus borders Ukraine to the north, and if it were to join the war then its troops would almost certainly be directed in a new attack on Kyiv - which sits just 80 miles away across the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Fuelling fears of an attack on the city, China this week ordered all of its citizens to leave the country while others - such as Serbia - closed their embassies in the capital. Ukraine has accused Moscow of using Iranian-made drones as part of multiple deadly strikes that Russian forces launched across Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces used both missiles and Iranian-built drones - believed to have been sent from Belarus - to strike his country. With a range of more than 600 miles, the explosive-laden drones can 'loiter' above potential targets for hours before being slammed directly into enemy soldiers, vehicles or buildings from above - causing an explosion. Reports coming out of Ukraine suggest the drones have inflicted serious damage to Kyiv's forces, as well as Ukrainian infrastructure. Ukrainians who have witnessed attacks by the drones say they make a recognisable noise, and have described them as sounding like 'motorbikes' in the air, while some soldiers have taken to calling it 'the flying lawnmower'. While the drones can be devastating to their targets, soldiers have said they a vulnerable to small arms fire. On Saturday, the General Staff of the Armed forces of Ukraine released a video on Facebook showing a smoking wreckage that it claimed to be one of the drones. The post said it had been shot down by a machine gun. 'This is a primitive handmade product,' Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFERL) last week. 'It's not a high-tech conveyor-belt production like the [Turkish-made] Bayraktar or American and Israeli [unmanned aerial vehicles],' he added. Ukrainian residents described the drone attacks to RFE. 'You can hear the roar. First, I just hear them, but then I saw one fly by and then explode,' one man said. Another said: 'There was a buzz that woke me up. I remember thinking: 'What's that?' The sound was approaching and then there was an explosion near the house.' According to reports, the first recorded use of the drones was in Yemen in Houthi-controlled areas. Iran is reported to have sold hundreds of the drones to Russia. Tehran has denied that it is selling the deadly munitions to the Kremlin, but there is mounting evidence that Moscow's armies have been using them since September against the Ukrainian military to make up for a lack of artillery firepower. Ukrainian military officials say the drones are cheaper and less sophisticated than cruise missiles - but can have a similarly devastating affect on their target. There are concerns among Ukraine's military leaders that if they are not supplied an effective counter-measure, the drones could destroy western-supplied artillery, which have successfully been used to push Russian forces back east. The almost 12-foot long Shahed 136 is designed with a delta-wing shape, with stabilising rudders at the top of the aircraft. The explosives are contained in the nose of the drone, as well as the technology that guides it to its targets for a precision strike. The engine, meanwhile, is found at the rear of the drone, and drives two bladed propellers. It has been compared to an engine one would find on a lawnmower or a moped. 'Its motor sounds like a [motorbike]. You can spot it when it's a few kilometres away,' a Ukrainian soldier named only as Magyar told RFE. 'That's my advice to the military. They fly low and are slow, so you can shoot them down,' he said, noting the drones are usually used against larger targets. 'They carry such a load of explosives that it doesn't make sense to use them against infantry.' Overall, the drone weighs 440lbs, and can fly at speeds of almost 120mph. In order to overwhelm air defences, several of the drones (batches of five and above) are launched at once from the same rack. They are fired almost horizontally with rocket-launch assistance. The rocket is jettisoned on take-off, with the engine taking over once it is airborne. On Friday, Oleksandr Starukh - the regional governor of Zaporizhzhia - said such drones damaged facilities in the city. On Wednesday, other Ukrainian officials said the drones were used to target the town of Bila Tserkva - 50 miles south of Kyiv. The attacks destroyed several buildings in the town, Newsweek reported."

Although the Kremlin has claimed that the move is part of a defensive operation, some commentators believe that Putin is attempting to draw Belarus - a country bordering both Russia and Ukraine - into his war, the Telegraph has reported. Russia's defence ministry stated that the decision to send soldiers into Belarus, for the first time since March, was 'dictated by the ongoing activity in the areas bordering us.' It comes as Russia also threatened to equip Belarusian warplanes with nuclear missile capability after Russian soldiers came flooding across the border 'by the trainload' on Saturday. Belarus and Russia reportedly began combining some of their military forces shortly after the explosion on the Kerch Bridge - joining Russian-occupied Crimea to the Russian mainland - according to Belarus dictator Alexander Lukashenko. China this week told its citizens to leave Ukraine amid increasing security threats and some countries, such as Serbia, have closed their embassies entirely. The Belarusian border, which lies 140 miles from Kyiv, was used as a launchpad for Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February. On Saturday, the Russian foreign ministry said it would equip Belarusian Su-25 warplanes with the capability to carry nuclear-capable missiles but that it was not yet arming Minsk, the Belarusian capital, with the missiles. With an army size of roughly 50,000, Belarus does not currently have any nuclear missiles of its own, and is not regarded as an effective military force by defence experts. Moscow and Minsk officials say that Ukraine is planning to invade Belarus, leading the Belarusian defence ministry to order its troops to be tested for 'combat readiness'. Dictator Alexander Lukashenko announced earlier this week that he would deploy a 'joint military task force' with Moscow - a move Minsk also claims is 'purely defensive'. The combat readiness test, ordered by Lukashenko, was announced as the head of his secret service said he expected to see a 'turning point' in Vladimir Putin's invasion in the coming months. Belarusian news agency BelTA reported Tuesday that the Security Council of the Republic of Belarus had 'begun a test of the Armed Forces of Belarus in accordance with instructions of the head of state' - echoing Russian rhetoric leading up to the invasion of Ukraine, in which Russia claimed it was carrying out military drills on the border. 'The test is comprehensive and covers the most important matters concerning the readiness of army units for carrying out their missions,' the agency reported, noting that units will practice 'switching to combat-ready state' while undertaking marching drills, deployment drills and combat training missions. The combat readiness test has included the Belarusian army testing its mobilisations procedures and calling-up reservists. Up to 60 T-72 tanks had been taken out of storage in Belarus and sent to Belgorod in Russia, near the border with Ukraine, according to reports. A Belarusian NGO, though, played down concerns of a new Russian ground assault on Kyiv originating in Minsk. It said that the Russian soldiers were newly mobilised men sent to bases across Belarus without tanks or armoured personnel vehicles. 'It can be assumed that the decision to deploy a 'regional grouping of troops' is a cover for training mobilised citizens of the Russian Federation in Belarus,' said the Belarusian Hajun Project which monitors military activity. This latest alliance has sparked fury in Europe, with the European Commission urging Belarus to refrain from any involvement in Russia's 'brutal illegitimate undertaking' that violated the United Nations Charter and international law. G7 leaders said today that Lukashenko's plan to deploy joint forces with Russia is a new instance of complicity with Moscow, and warned Minsk to 'stop enabling' Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. 'The announcement of a joint military group with Russia constitutes the most recent example of the Belarusian regime's complicity with Russia,' they said in a statement, urging the 'Lukashenko regime to fully abide by its obligations under international law'. Lukashenko has been a loyal ally of Russia's president - openly supportive of his war in Ukraine. As well as allowing Russia to invade Ukraine from Belarus at the beginning of the war, he has also allowed the Russian air force to fire missiles at Ukraine from Belarusian air space. He has, though, gone on record to complain that the war had dragged on for too long and has avoided committing Belarusian forces so far. The invasion of Ukraine is far less popular in Belarus than Russia. Domestic support for Lukashenko is also fragile. However, analysts have warned that if Putin ordered Lukansheko to join the war, he would comply. 'Joining the war against Ukraine would generate further outrage against his deeply unpopular government but his most important, and only significant, supporter, Putin, wants him to back this failing invasion,' said Kenneth Roth, the former executive director of New York-based Human Rights Watch. Speaking on Monday, Lukashenko said Kyiv presents a clear threat to his country. The remarks from Lukashenko, who has held power in Belarus since 1994, indicate a a combined Russian-Belarus joint force in the north of Ukraine. 'Strikes on the territory of Belarus are not just being discussed in Ukraine today, but are also being planned,' Lukashenko said at a meeting on security, without providing evidence for the assertion. 'Their owners are pushing them to start a war against Belarus to drag us there.' 'We have been preparing for this for decades. If necessary, we will respond,' Lukashenko said, adding that he had spoken to Putin about the situation while at a meeting in St Petersburg. Lukashenko said he had agreed with Putin to deploy a regional military group, and had started pulling forces together two days ago, apparently after an attack on Russia's road and rail bridge to Crimea early on Saturday. He said that a warning was delivered to Belarus through unofficial channels that Ukraine planned 'Crimean Bridge 2', though he did not give details. 'My answer was simple. Tell the president of Ukraine and the other lunatics: if they touch one metre of our territory then the Crimean Bridge will seem to them like a walk in the park.'"

But the tone of his tweet on Saturday also raised the possibility he was being sarcastic as he often tweets jokes. The Tesla boss said the set-up was costing SpaceX £17.8million a month. He wrote: ‘The hell with it... even though Starlink is still losing money and other companies are getting billions of taxpayer money, we’ll just keep funding Ukraine government for free.’ An official said Mr Musk had asked the US government to fund Starlink in Ukraine, but no decision has yet been made. The senior US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter not yet made public, said the issue of Starlink funding has been discussed in meetings and that senior leaders are weighing the matter. Starlink, which provides broadband internet service using more than 2,200 low-orbiting satellites, has provided crucial battlefield communications for Ukrainian military forces since early in the nation’s defence against Russia’s February invasion. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment."

Ukraine-style: Kyiv's 'Joan of Arc' poses in her white gown while clutching a machine gun as she marries soldier she met on the frontline of war with Russia,"With one arm gripping her gun and the other placed defiantly on her hip, Evhenia Emerald is the picture of Ukrainian resistance – even on her wedding day. It is little wonder the sniper, 31, is known as her country's answer to French heroine Joan of Arc. And she was determined not to let her marriage ceremony with fellow soldier Evheniy Stypaniuk detract from her duties on the Ukrainian frontline. The couple tied the knot in a forest in Kharkiv on Friday, a public holiday known as Defenders' Day to honour Ukrainian military veterans. Miss Emerald posted a series of pictures on Instagram, which showed her in a white dress, her husband's camouflage jacket, and holding a gun. Her bouquet appeared to be comprised of ears of wheat rather than flowers. 'Today I officially became the wife of a military man,' she wrote. 'I could not imagine a more perfect wedding!' The pair fell in love shortly after the war began in February and got engaged in August. Miss Emerald, who has a daughter and was a jeweller before the Russian invasion, said: 'We understand that every day could be the last one and we don't want to postpone life for later.' Speaking of her wedding day, Miss Emerald added in a post on Instagram: 'It's a special day - too many holidays. I want to congratulate all defenders. Glory to heroes! 'I also celebrate my lover because today is his birthday. Now he will definitely never forget his wedding anniversary.' The wedding was held just days after a huge barrage of Russian missiles and Iranian-made kamikaze drones targeted virtually every major Ukrainian city, destroying infrastructure and killing civilians after a blast on the Crimean Bridge. This morning, a swarm of kamikaze drones attacked Kyiv, blowing up residential buildings and energy infrastructure as air raid sirens sounded across the Ukrainian capital in the early hours. Five explosions were reported in the city starting around 6.30am local time, the BBC reported, as the drones managed to dodge air defence systems with police resorting to using rifles to try and shoot them down. Vitaliy Klitschko, mayor of the city, said the central Shevchenkivskiy district was targeted by blasts which hit several residential buildings. Oksana Kovalenko, a local journalist, said critical energy infrastructure was also hit. Social media posts showed a blaze in the area of the strike as well as a building engulfed in flames. Several loud explosions rocked the center of Kyiv before huge plumes of smoke billowed up into the skyline. Meanwhile Ukrainian soldiers could be heard desperately trying to shoot down the drones, while air raid sirens rang out in the background. Forces struck the city with Iranian Shahed drones, wrote Andrii Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president´s office, in a post on the Telegram social media site. Russia has repeatedly been using the so-called suicide drones in recent weeks to target urban centers and infrastructure, including power stations. Mayor Klichko said the central Shevchenko district of the capital had been hit, and urged residents to take shelter until it subsided. He tweeted: 'The explosion in the Shevchenkiv district - in the center of the capital. All services follow in place. Details later. The air alert continues. Stay in shelters!' He added alongside a picture of one of the drones: 'The wreckage of one of the kamikaze drones that attacked Kyiv this morning.' The explosions came from the same central Kyiv district where a week ago a missile struck a children's playground and intersection near the Kyiv National University´s main buildings. The strike on Kyiv comes as fighting has intensified in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in recent days, as well as the continued Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south near Kherson and Zaporizhzhia."
2022-10-16,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11321819/Putin-aide-warns-WNBA-player-Brittney-Griner-Russian-prison-not-priority-us.html,"Putin aide warns freeing weed-smuggler WNBA player Brittney Griner from Russian prison 'is NOT a priority for us,' and claims Biden only wants athlete released to make him look good ahead of midterm elections","An aide to Vladimir Putin has said freeing WNBA star Brittney Griner from prison 'is not a priority' for the Kremlin. The 31-year-old, a two-time Olympic basketball gold medalist, was arrested in February after she was allegedly caught carrying two vape cartridges containing cannabis oil at a Moscow airport by a police dog. She was sentenced to nine years in a Russian prison on August 4 after pleading guilty. Yury Ushakov, an advisor to Putin who spent a decade as Russia's ambassador to the United States between 1998 and 2008, believes Joe Biden merely wants to boost his grim-looking midterm election prospects. Ushakov told Rossiya-1 on Sunday: 'In this tense situation, I think that he is thinking first and foremost about the upcoming midterm elections so he keeps emphasizing the need to bring back home the basketball player who was detained for drug smuggling. However, it's not the main issue that we are concerned about.' The Kremlin aide's comments come days after Griner's lawyer, Alexandr D. Boykov, said in an interview with the New York Times that his client is struggling in prison. Boykov described Griner saying: 'She has not been in as good condition as I could sometimes find her in.' According to the lawyer, Griner is reading a book about the Rolling Stones, Dostoyevsky's book Demons and regularly plays a game that's similar to Battleship.' He said that Griner is forced to sleep in a bed that has been modified to accommodate her height. Her attorney continued: 'She is not yet absolutely convinced that America will be able to take her home. She is very worried about what the price of that will be, and she is afraid that she will have to serve the whole sentence here in Russia.' Boykov said that he last spoke to Griner on October 11. He said that she is worried about the conditions she will face in a new prison following her appeal. He added: 'Perhaps the verdict will somehow be changed and, perhaps, the sentence will be reduced, because the decision taken by the first court is very different from judicial practice.' 'Considering all the circumstances, taking into account my client's personality traits and her admission of guilt, such a verdict should be absolutely impossible,' the lawyer continued. Boykov said that it has been nearly impossible for Griner to speak to friends and family and that even organizing phone calls with the WNBA star's wife, Cherelle, was difficult. He described the prison as being too cold in the winter and too warm in the summer. The last high-profile prisoner to spend time at IK-1 was Naama Issachar, an Israeli-American who was sentenced to ten years when a third of an ounce was found in her luggage at a Moscow airport. She was initially charged with drug possession, which typically carries a one-month sentence in Russia, but that was later upgraded to drug smuggling and she was jailed for seven and a half years. Putin later pardoned Issachar in a move that was a seen as a political coup for then Israeli- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Issachar was quoted as once saying that the clouds were the only part of the outside world that inmates can see from the prison. Most of Russia's prisons are collective colonies, a system dating back to the Soviet Gulag era, with inmates sleeping in dormitories and working in production facilities. A Radio Free Europe investigation from 2019 identified a different prison known as IK-14 as the 'most dreaded female correctional facility' in Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin 'is satisfied with such prisons….He wants to have a frightening instrument in his hands. You need to have a place where everyone is afraid to go,' Olga Romanova, head of the prisoners' rights group Rus Sidyashchaya (Russia Behind Bars), said. U.S. President Joe Biden, asked if he would meet Putin at the G20 summit in Bali in November, said he didn't see a good reason for a sit-down with the Kremlin chief. 'It would depend on specifically what he wanted to talk about,' Biden told CNN, adding that if Putin wanted to discuss the jailed American basketball star Brittney Griner then he would be open to talking. 'I don't see any rationale to meet with him now,' Biden said. While the Kremlin has stayed coy on whether or not Putin would attend the summit at all. Earlier this month, Cherelle Griner told CBS Mornings that she has only spoken to her wife twice since February. She called one of those phone calls 'the most disturbing phone call I'd ever experienced.' Former US Ambassador to the United States, Bill Richardson, visited Russia three weeks ago to assist in the negotiations, and now says he's confident a deal will be reached to bring Griner and former US Marine Paul Whelan home soon. Richardson was responsible in part for the release of Marine Trevor Reed from a Russian prison in April. Speaking with CNN on Sunday, he said he'd met with senior Russian officials and individuals close to Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trip, though his visit was not on behalf of the United States. 'I am cautiously optimistic on the Griner (and) Whelan negotiations,' said Richardson, who is also former governor of New Mexico and who has worked privately to secure the release of American detainees abroad. The White House has not confirmed which Russian prisoners they would be swapped with. Previously, officials had been working to negotiate a deal with to release Merchant of Death arms dealer Viktor Bout. Richardson added that he thought an exchange of detainees would include two Russians in exchange for the two Americans. He did not identify the Russians or give an exact time frame. Asked if the two Americans might be released by the end of the year, he said: 'I do think so. Now, I hate making predictions, but yes. Whelan, who holds American, British, Canadian and Irish passports, was sentenced in 2020 to 16 years in jail after being convicted of spying. He denied the charge. The United States said in late July that it had put forward a 'substantial offer' to secure the release of the two Americans. Sources familiar with the situation said Washington has offered to exchange Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout for Griner and Whelan. Reports have surfaced that Moscow has sought the release of a second Russian, but Washington has not confirmed further details on its exact offer. Negotiations are taking place amid ruptured relations between the two countries after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which has sparked a U.S.-led effort to punish Moscow with sanctions and isolate it diplomatically."

Russia's RIA news agency, citing the defence ministry, said two gunmen opened fire with small arms during a training exercise of mobilised troops in Russia's western Belgorod region on Saturday. RIA said the gunmen, who it referred to as 'terrorists', were shot dead and Russia's defence ministry said they were from a former Soviet republic, without elaborating. But independent news outlet ASTRA claimed to have spoken to one of the men wounded in the attack who alleged the shooters were Muslims from the Central Asian republic of Tajikistan and turned on the group when the commander described Allah as a coward. His claims were echoed by senior Ukrainian official, Oleksiy Arestovych, who also said the ethnic Tajiks had opened fire on the others after an argument over religion. The incident was the latest blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin's 'special military operation' after he announced last month that 300,000 new troops would be mobilised to fight in Ukraine. The non-Russian shooters, who were recruited along with their victims as part of Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent call to mobilise more troops to fight on the frontlines in Ukraine, had reportedly told their commanding officer 'this is not our war' and demanded they be excused from serving. The commanding officer, named by ASTRA's source as Lieutenant Colonel Andrei Lapin, allegedly told all the soldiers in response: 'This is a holy war. ''Allah'' is a coward if he does not allow you to fight for the country to which you swore an oath.' The hospitalised source said the statement was met with considerable anger from the Muslims among the group, adding: 'I personally think that this is what hurt the most, the phrase that ''Allah is a weakling''. The phrase shocked many people among those standing on the parade ground because we also have Muslims among [our Russian] officers.' He said the conflict appeared to subside but then exploded again during afternoon training which involved shooting practice. 'They sent us all together to the shooting range, and the Tajiks... deployed their machine guns. 'They had live ammunition and shot our commander, Lt-Colonel Lapin - he died on the spot... they opened fire indiscriminately.' The source went on to claim that a total of 32 people were killed in the attack - a considerably higher total than that reported by Russian state news channels. 'There were both contract soldiers and mobilised on the training ground. The dead, who I saw - numbered 29 people. The 30th was Lt-Col Lapin. This is not counting the two Tajiks who were killed along with them - making 32. 'I don't know exactly how many were wounded.' The two shooters were killed by an ensign named Semyonov, according to the account. 'Semyonov at that moment was in the room where boxes of cartridges are stored, where they are given to us,' said the source. 'He has his own combat pistol. He was not present during the shooting itself, he heard what was happening, went out and shot both Tajiks.' He said the gunmen were 'ardent supporters of their faith' but were not given time to appropriately observe their religion. 'They constantly cursed because they were not allowed to pray on time, nor were they given a room for prayer,' the source said. Unsettling images published by pro-Russian blogger Anatoly Shariy, 44, seemingly showed the aftermath of the attack with several bodies lying on the ground. In Shariy's account, the shooters were ethnic Uzbeks, not Tajiks. He wrote that 'a fair share of the blame for what happened lies in the fact that someone gave weapons to some very nasty people - without them being checked - the next time it won't happen.' An official Russian defence ministry statement said: 'During a firearms training session with individuals who voluntarily expressed a desire to participate in the special military operation [against Ukraine], terrorists opened fire with small arms on the personnel of the unit.' Tajiks and Uzbeks are predominantly Muslim, but it is not clear if the gunmen had been recruited in their own country or had been living in Russia. There was fury among pro-war channels over a failure to vet recruits to the military operation."

The Islamic Republic has been sending drones along with Iranian troops into Ukraine to operate them, siding with Russia in its bloody invasion. Israeli Diaspora Affairs Minister Nachman Shai wrote on Twitter: 'There is no longer any doubt where Israel should stand in this bloody conflict. The time has come for Ukraine to receive military aid as well, just as the USA and NATO countries provide.' His comments came after the Washington Post quoted US sources on Sunday claiming Iran is stepping up its arms supply to Russia. Tehran has finalised terms for additional weapons shipments, including two types of Iranian surface-to-surface missiles, the sources said. A shipment of Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar missiles, weapons capable of striking targets at distances of 300 and 700 kilometers respectively, are set to be delivered for Putin's troops to use against targets in Ukraine — where Russian soldiers have been targeting civilians with missile strikes. Moscow has been searching for allies for its nearly eight-month war in Ukraine after invading the country on February 25, only to have its nose bloodied by fierce Ukrainian resistance and a subsequent counter-attack. The news comes as Ukrainian forces mounted another counterattack on Russian occupiers in the south of the country, with the Armed Forces of Ukraine reportedly requesting a blackout of videos, photos, with regards to Kherson — the largest Ukrainian city taken by Russian forces during the conflict — to stop Putin's forces from locating Ukrainian troop movements. Russia is loosing more than six troops for every one Ukrainian soldier killed, according to Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar, citing Andrii Kovalchuk, commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' Operational Command 'South'. Now, Vladimir Putin has announced the end to mobilisation only two months after starting forced military conscription, with more Russians ending up fleeing the country than fighting in the army. The Russian president has also stepped up attacks on civilians in Ukrainian cities, with analysis pointing to increased Russian anxiety about its home front. Turning to other despot regimes, Putin has reached out to countries as far flung as North Korea and Syria in hopes of winning the war. But despite western sanctions and a coalition of countries working to isolate Russia, Iran has remained its steadfast ally, with US intelligence identifying invading Russian forces using Iranian munitions — despite denials from Iran. Russia allegedly repainted the weapons and gave them Russian names. is a short-range, road-mobile, solid-propellant ballistic missile. It is most likely a modified version of the unguided Zelzal-2, with the addition of control and guidance systems. While the program is based in Iran, the missile is believed to incorporate components from Chinese contractors. In 2006, the US Department of Treasury accused Chinese firm Great Wall Industry and its partners of playing a lead role in the development of the Fateh missile system. Iran has launched several Fateh missiles, as well as longer-range variants in military operations since 2017. On September 25, 2016, Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan announced that Iran’s new Zolfaghar ballistic missile, a member of the Fateh family. On June 18, 2017, Iran reportedly launched six Zolfaghar missiles into Syria towards the Deir ez-Zor region. Houthi fighters in Yemen, backed by Iran, have also used the weapons against oil refineries and other civilian targets in neighboring Gulf countries. Iran has also reportedly employed both missile types against targets in Iraq. Earlier this week, Russian forces rained down air strikes using Iranian-made Shahed-136 'suicide' drones near Makrariv, in retaliation for the Kerch Bridge linking Russian with the annexed Crimean Peninsula. The 12-mile bridge holds importance as a symbol of Moscow's power and carries military supplies from Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Iran is preparing new deliveries of Shahed-136s to Russia, as well as Mohajer-6s drones. The speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament said on Thursday Russian forces struck more than 70 energy facilities in Ukraine this week. He threatened an 'even tougher' response to future attacks by 'the Kyiv regime', although Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the bridge bombing. Putin vowed a 'tough' and 'proportionate' response to Ukrainian attacks that threatened Russia's security. On the same day, France pledged an air defense systems to protect Ukrainian cities against drone strikes, as well as an expanded training program for Ukrainian soldiers. Up to 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers will be embedded with military units in France, rotating through for several weeks of combat training, Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu, said in an interview published in Le Parisien. 'We are noting the fact that the war, alas, will last,' the newspaper quoted the minister as saying. 'A new generation of soldiers must also be trained, to last the distance.' France had previously trained Ukrainian artillery troops to use Caesar self-propelled howitzers it has supplied. The expanded training that France is now offering is 'a very important step,' the minister said. 'We are changing the scale.' The minister said Crotale air defense missile batteries that France is preparing to send to Ukraine 'will be particularly useful in the fight against drones and against aerial bombardments.' The French defense budget for 2023 will climb to its highest levels since World War II, at €44billion (£38billion). With a range of more than 600 miles, the explosive-laden Iranian Shahed-136 UAVs can 'loiter' above potential targets for hours before being slammed directly into enemy soldiers, vehicles or buildings from above - causing an explosion. Reports coming out of Ukraine suggest the drones have inflicted serious damage to Kyiv's forces, as well as Ukrainian infrastructure. Ukrainians who have witnessed attacks by the drones say they make a recognisable noise, and have described them as sounding like 'motorbikes' in the air, while some soldiers have taken to calling it 'the flying lawnmower'. While the drones can be devastating to their targets, soldiers have said they a vulnerable to small arms fire. On Saturday, the General Staff of the Armed forces of Ukraine released a video on Facebook showing a smoking wreckage that it claimed to be one of the drones. The post said it had been shot down by a machine gun. 'This is a primitive handmade product,' Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, told Radio Free Europe (RFE) last week. 'It's not a high-tech conveyor-belt production like the [Turkish-made] Bayraktar or American and Israeli [unmanned aerial vehicles],' he added. Ukrainian residents described the drone attacks to RFE. 'You can hear the roar. First, I just hear them, but then I saw one fly by and then explode,' one man said. Another said: 'There was a buzz that woke me up. I remember thinking: ""What's that?"" The sound was approaching and then there was an explosion near the house.' According to reports, the first recorded use of the drones was in Yemen in Houthi-controlled areas. Now, Iran is reported to have sold hundreds of the drones to Russia. Tehran has denied that it is selling the deadly munitions to the Kremlin, but there is mounting evidence that Moscow's armies have been using them since September against the Ukrainian military to make up for a lack of artillery firepower. Ukrainian military officials say the drones are cheaper and less sophisticated than cruise missiles - but can have a similarly devastating affect on their target. There are concerns among Ukraine's military leaders that if they are not supplied an effective counter-measure, the drones could destroy their western-supplied artillery, which have successfully been used to push Russian forces back east. The almost 12-foot long Shahed 136 is designed with a delta-wing shape, with stabilising rudders at the top of the aircraft. The fuselage is at the centre of the drone and blended into the almost 4ft wings, giving it an elegant-looking shape. The explosives are contained in the nose of the drone, as well as the technology that guides it to its targets for a precision strike. The engine, meanwhile, is found at the rear of the drone, and drives two bladed propellers. It has been compared to an engine one would find on a lawnmower or a moped. 'Its motor sounds like a [motorbike]. You can spot it when it's a few kilometres away,' a Ukrainian soldier named only as Magyar told RFE. 'That's my advice to the military. They fly low and are slow, so you can shoot them down,' he said, noting the drones are usually used against larger targets. 'They carry such a load of explosives that it doesn't make sense to use them against infantry.' Overall, the drone weighs 440lbs, and can fly at speeds of almost 120mph. In order to overwhelm air defences, several of the drones (batches of five and above) are launched at once from the same rack. They are fired almost horizontally with rocket-launch assistance. The rocket is jettisoned on take-off, with the engine taking over once it is airbourne. On Friday, Oleksandr Starukh - the regional governor of Zaporizhzhia - said such drones damaged to facilities in the city. On Wednesday, other Ukrainian officials said the drones were used to target the town of Bila Tserkva - 50 miles south of Kyiv. The attacks destroyed several buildings in the town, Newsweek reported. The weapons are unlikely to significantly affect the course of the war, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said following last week's strikes. 'They have used many drones against civilian targets in rear areas, likely hoping to generate non-linear effects through terror. Such efforts are not succeeding,' analysts at the think tank wrote. Drones have played a significant part in the war in Ukraine so far. The United States has supplied Ukraine's military with switchblade drones, while Kyiv has also deployed the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 - that fire guided missiles - to great effect."
2022-10-16,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11321191/President-joe-biden-mbs-saudi-arabia-g20.html,Biden WON'T meet with Saudi Crown Prince at the G20 summit says Jake Sullivan - after oil-rich nation humiliated president by confirming he BEGGED them to delay production cut until after midterms,"President Joe Biden as of Sunday has no plans for another one-on-one meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, after OPEC+ announced dramatic cuts to production that are likely to force gas prices up in the United States and elsewhere. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan was asked by CNN's State of the Union whether Biden has any plans to meet with MBS, as he's colloquially known, at the upcoming G20 summit of the world's wealthiest nations. 'He has no plans to meet with the Crown Prince at the G20 summit,' Sullivan said. 'And he is focused, however, on making sure that - through every engagement he has across the board - he's looking out for not just the US but our allies as well.' But the Saudi Arabia-led oil cartel's recent decision to cut production of 2 million barrels of oil per day has dealt a blow to Biden's efforts to fight rising costs while providing a boost to Russia and its illegal invasion of Ukraine. Both Republican and Democrat lawmakers are now calling for retaliation against the Saudis, including a legislative push to halt the American military's lucrative arms sales to the Gulf kingdom. The White House said it would re-evaluate its relationship with the Saudis but has not elaborated on any further discussions. Sullivan on Sunday said Biden would not 'act precipitously,' but assured that he would consult Congress before taking any meaningful action. 'This is a relationship that got built over decades on a bipartisan basis,' the advisor said. 'And so the president isn’t going to act precipitously, he’s going to act methodically, strategically.' 'And he’s going to take his time to consult with members of both parties, and also to have an opportunity for Congress to return so that he can sit with them in person.' Biden met with MBS in Jeddah in July as part of a wider trip to meet with Gulf allies. The White House has maintained it was not about oil, despite domestic gas prices still hovering near June's record levels at the time. Critics of the president who previously accused him of cow-towing to Saudi Arabia instead of doing more to expand domestic energy production are now blaming him for the expected price increases to come at the pump. Sullivan stressed the positive outcomes of Biden's Saudi visit, including the subsequent opening of the country's airspace to Israeli flights. 'One of the things that he was able to achieve in that meeting in July was the historic opening of Saudi airspace to Israeli commercial air traffic,' Sullivan said. 'The first step Saudi Arabia has ever taken on a path towards normalization with Israel, which we believe was a positive thing for him to be able to deliver for a strong partner of ours.' Biden promised during a CNN interview last week that there would be 'consequences' for the decision led by Riyadh. OPEC+'s production cut has put the president in a politically precarious place, with gas prices once again creeping back up and the midterm elections less than a month away. It also stands to undermine the US-led energy sanctions against Russia, which has been relying on its oil and gas exports to help finance Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine. The Saudi Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that the Biden administration had previously asked OPEC and its allies to delay the cuts for a month - until just before the midterm elections. Such a move would have likely minimized political fallout at the ballot box, and led to a delay in the expected increase in gas prices. 'The government of the kingdom clarified through its continuous consultation with the U.S. administration that all economic analyses indicate that postponing the OPEC+ decision for a month, according to what has been suggested, would have had negative economic consequences,' Saudi Arabia said in a statement shared by the Associated Press. The White House denied any political motivations in such discussions, according to the AP."
2022-10-16,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11321041/Dozens-Russian-couples-tie-knot-mass-wedding-fast-tracked-men-mobilised-Ukraine.html,We do! Dozens of couples tie the knot in mass wedding in Russia as ceremonies are fast-tracked for men mobilised to head to the frontline in Ukraine war,"Russia is now holding fast-tracked mass weddings for men mobilised to fight in Ukraine. Footage from a ceremony in St Petersburg last week shows dozens of couples exchanging nuptials simultaneously. The newlyweds gave their voluntary agreements to wed from their seats at the Sestroretsk Registry Office, video from local TV outlet SCTV.ru revealed. The unique ceremony comes after Moscow added mobilisation to the list of 'exceptional cases' that allows a wedding to be fast-tracked. Russian law states that without an exception, couples cannot get married until at least one month after a marriage application is submitted. The TV outlet claims the fast tracking weddings for soldiers ahead of deployment is 'good for morale' and 'creates a sense of stability.' However, critics argue the 'accelerated procedure' is for the sole purpose of securing compensation for soldiers' wives in case they die on the frontlines. 'Let me shake your hand before and say thank you,' local deputy Vera Sergeeva, speaking in Russian, told one soldier who participated in the ceremony. 'You didn't run away, not scared that you're here and the victory will be ours.' Ms Sergeeva added: 'The legislature's gift to you is a marriage ceremony.' An estimated 43 couples participated in the mass ceremony last week. The couples were reportedly wed in groups of 10. The couples completed individual marriage applications and had a ceremony simultaneously, with each pair getting the change to individually say: 'I do.' Then the newlyweds exchanged rings and kisses at the same time, standing between their chairs in the conference hall. The ceremony leader noted how Russia's process of marriage requires 'formal confirmation of approval of loved ones and the state.' Ms Sergeeva argued the fast-tracked ceremony was a 'great gift' and 'very nice for all.' 'This creates a sense of stability,' she said. 'I am absolutely convinced that on a woman's fragile shoulders she also holds much love.' One couple who participated in the ceremony told SCTV they were happy to formalise their relationship, The Insider reported. 'I have known for a long time,' one groom said. He and his wife noted how 'of course, we wanted to' get married and that 'in the long run we chose the right date.' 'I didn't expect to have such a wedding actually,' the bride said of the ceremony. She apparently expected to wait some time before officially becoming a wife. Another mobilised suitor who participated in the ceremony added: 'The gift is very good, for the whole family. I'll come back from the war, we'll definitely have a drink from him.'"
2022-10-16,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11320743/Death-toll-terrorist-shooting-Russian-military-base-near-Ukraine-border-rises-22.html,"Death toll in 'terrorist' shooting at Russian military base near Ukraine border rises to 22, reports claim: Two gunmen 'from Tajikistan' opened fire 'in row over religion' as local governor says no civilians were killed in massacre","The death toll following a shooting at a Russian military base on the Ukraine border has risen to 22 after two gunmen from Tajikstan opened fire at fellow recruits reportedly in a row over religion. Initial reports announced that 11 soldiers had been killed and a further 15 injured on a training ground in the Belgorod region on the Ukrainian border, the Russian Defense Ministry revealed yesterday. But it has now been suggested that double this number were shot dead, with independent news outlet SOTA suggesting that 22 soldiers have died and 16 were wounded. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy in the figures after the mass shootings. The defence ministry, which only revealed the shooting some 12 hours after the incident, said two volunteer soldiers fired at fellow troops before they themselves were shot dead by a sniper. The incident took place during target practice, with one shooter firing at a target before he suddenly turned his machine gun on a crowd of forces watching. A second shooter used another weapon to fire at the men, before a 'sniper' then shot dead the gunmen, said reports. They were both nationals from an unspecified former Soviet republic, it is understood. SOTA is also reporting that a third assailant is currently 'on the run' following the incident. Ukrainian official Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said a dispute over religion preceded the shooting. The gunmen were reported to be from ex-Soviet state Tajikistan and were among mobilised 'reservists' at an army base in Belgorod region which borders Ukraine. Tajikistan is a predominantly Muslim nation, while around half of Russians follow various branches of Christianity. Governor of Belgorod region Vyacheslav Gladkov today said: 'A terrible event happened on our territory, on the territory of one of the military units. 'Many soldiers were killed and wounded. There are no residents of the Belgorod region among the wounded and killed. The Russian defence ministry ministry has labelled the incident a terrorist attack. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the incident. An eyewitness said: 'They just went out and started [to shoot].' The killings were at a training ground as the soldiers were about to undergo target practice ahead of postings to the frontline. The military 'volunteers' were mainly from Bryansk region, but at least one was from Moscow region, said SOTA. The bloodbath was at a military unit near the village of Soloti, where a military camp was built in 2017 along with a training ground for the 752nd motorised rifle regiment of the 3rd motorised rifle division of the Western Military District. It comes after a recent mutiny at the same base when 100 mobilised servicemen reportedly refused to be moved to the epicentre of intense fighting at Lyman. An official source said: 'During a firearms training session with individuals who voluntarily expressed a desire to participate in the special military operation (against Ukraine), the terrorists opened fire with small arms on the personnel of the unit.' Meanwhile, Mr Zelensky said yesterday that Ukrainian troops arere still holding the strategic eastern town of Bakhmut despite repeated Russian attacks - as the situation in the larger Donbas region remains very difficult. Russian forces have repeatedly tried to seize Bakhmut, which sits on a main road leading to the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Both are situated in the Donetsk region. In the past 24 hours, Russian forces targeted more than 30 towns and villages across Ukraine, launching five missile and 23 air strikes and up to 60 rocket attacks, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said today. In response, Ukraine's air forces have carried out 32 strikes, hitting 24 Russian targets. Fighting is particularly intense in the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, and the strategically important Kherson province in the south, three of the four regions Putin 'annexed' in sham referendums. The positions of southern forces were attacked several times yesterday and a small 'shooting battle' took place near the village of Tryfonivka, Kherson, Ukraine's Armed Forces southern command said. It comes as Putin is seeking to reverse his fortunes in the war by mobilising some 300,000 recruits - a move that triggered protests and caused hundreds of thousands to flee Russia. Putin said on Friday that more than 220,000 reservists already had been called up as part of an effort to recruit 300,000. Even though the Russian leader declared that only people who had recently served in the military will be subject to the call-up, activists and rights groups reported military conscription offices rounding up people without any army experience - some of whom were also unfit for service for medical reasons. Some of the freshly called-up reservists posted videos of them being forced to sleep on the floor or even outside and given rusty weapons before being sent to the front lines. Authorities have acknowledged that the mobilisation was often poorly organised and promised to improve the situation. Putin said earlier this week recent military mobilisation he ordered is coming to an end, and he has no plans for further conscriptions once it has finished. But it was revealed earlier this week Iranian troops have quietly joined the Ukrainian frontline to help train Moscow's forces in how to operate kamikaze drones. Up to 50 Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) specialists have been sent to the southern and eastern front with hundreds of Shahed-136 drones, according to the Mirror. A strike using the Iranian-made 'suicide drones' hit near Makrariv, a small city located 31 miles west of Kyiv, on Thursday, destroying critical infrastructure. Despite denials from the Iranian regime that their forces are getting involved in the conflict, IRGC troops have reportedly been based in Dzankoi in Crimea and Kherson in the south, where one team has already been destroyed. A Ukrainian source told the newspaper: 'At least one of the Iranian training teams has been hit recently and they are actively being hunted down. 'We have been concerned for some time that IRGC specialists are helping Russia in their terrible attacks on civilians and they are of course being targeted.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia earlier this week of using Iranian-made Shahed-136 UAVs - also known as suicide drones - against military and civilian targets. Tehran has denied selling the drones to Russia, but there is mounting evidence that Moscow is deploying the weapon. Between September 30 and October 6 alone, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said it had destroyed 24 of the weapons, which are designed to be flown directly into targets - overwhelming and evading air defences along the way. With a range of more than 600 miles, the explosive-laden drones can 'loiter' above potential targets for hours before being slammed directly into enemy soldiers, vehicles or buildings from above - causing an explosion. Russia has intensified its bombardment of civilian areas in recent weeks as its military lost ground in multiple occupied regions of Ukraine that Russian President Vladimir Putin has illegally annexed. Kyiv said 83 missiles or drones were launched against the country on Monday morning, striking the capital and several other cities, killing civilians in the process. 'They want panic and chaos. They want to destroy our energy system,' Zelensky said in a video address on Telegram. He added: Russia is 'trying to destroy us and wipe us off the face of the earth.' There are mounting concerns about Putin's willingness to start nuclear war. The Russian leader has increased the number of strategic nuclear bombers stationed at an airbase near the Finnish and Norwegian borders, satellite images show. Putin warned of 'global catastrophe' if Nato troops clash directly with Russia, despite having now heightened that risk himself. The coming weeks will see a number of Russian nuclear drills, predicted to include the test-firing of ballistic missiles, at the same time as Nato tests its preparedness to respond to such attacks. Western officials said Russia was 'rapidly exhausting' its supply of missiles and because of sanctions was unable to import the parts required to manufacture replacements. One added: 'For these reasons Russia cannot sustain the aerial campaign indefinitely.'"
2022-10-16,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11320591/War-criminal-wanted-downing-MH17-commander-Putins-frontline-forces-Ukraine.html,'War criminal' wanted in West over shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 is 'made commander of Putin's frontline forces in Ukraine',"A wanted 'war criminal' accused of complicity in the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 has been 'made a commander in Vladimir Putin's frontline forces fighting in Ukraine'. Igor Strelkov, 51, former defence minister of self-styled Donetsk People's Republic, has been an arch-critic of the Kremlin over the Ukraine campaign. But now in a change of tack, the ex-FSB colonel and hardliner has been appointed a frontline commander, it is reported. He was pictured bidding farewell to his wife wearing military fatigues. Strelkov - real named Igor Girkin - was blamed for the downing of MH17 which was hit by a BUK missile supplied by Russia in 2014. Over the 298 civilians killed when the Boeing 777 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was blown out of the sky. Strelkov, under his previous name, was among the three Russian nationals and one Ukrainian tried for murder in the Netherlands over the downing of the plane. The Dutch court handling the trial is expected to hand down its verdict next month. Strelkov - with half a million followers - had gone quiet on his Telegram channel which has been used for months to demand a far tougher and more brutal approach to the war from Russian forces. His wife, Miroslava Reginskaya, 29, posted: 'He is okay. He will be in touch soon.' Military reporter Yuri Kotenok said: 'Strelkov's silence since October 10 is explained by the fact that after eighty years he was allowed to leave for the war zone…. 'He went to fight in one of the volunteer battalions as chief of staff or deputy commander.' Strelkov was earlier blocked by the Russians from reaching the front. He had warned last month that more military defeats could topple Putin, and accused the Kremlin leader and his defence minister of incompetence. 'All it will take is an outbreak of inflation or a few more military defeats to finish him off,' he posted about the Russian president. He labelled Putin 'clueless' over Russia's frontline failings and suggested that 'execution by shooting' was too good a punishment for defence minister Sergei Shoigu. Strelkov had long called for full mobilisation while slating the military hierarchy in Russia. He was known for his cruelty in Donetsk, bragging about ordering prisoners and looters to be shot. His new role as a commander - possibly in a private army backing Putin - appears a sign that hardliners are now fully in charge of Putin's war. Meanwhile, Strelkov is on trial for murder in the Netherlands over MH17, which was hit over the Donetsk region by what international investigators say was a Russian-made surface-to-air missile. Prosecutors say three Russian nationals - Oleg Pulatov, Igor Girkin (Strelkov) and Sergei Dubinsky - and one Ukrainian citizen, Leonid Kharchenko, helped supply the missile system used to fire a rocket at the plane in July 2014. All four remain at large. Most of the victims on board MH17 were Dutch nationals. The Dutch government holds Russia responsible for the crash. Authorities in Moscow deny any involvement. The Dutch court handling the murder trial of four suspects announced in August that it would hand down its verdict on November 17. The eastern Donetsk region has also become a key focus of Russia's nearly six-month-old war in Ukraine. News of Strelkov's new role as commander comes as Ukrainian forces shelling damaged the administration building in the city of Donetsk, the capital of the Donetsk region, Russian-backed administration of the city said on Sunday. The administration said on the Telegram messaging app that the main entry into the building was hit and several nearby cars damaged. There was no immediate reaction from Ukraine to the attack. Reuters could not verify the report. Donetsk city has been controlled by the Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic since 2014. Russia moved in September to annex the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, in the biggest expansion of Russian territory in at least half a century. Moscow declared the annexations after holding what it called referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine. Western governments and Kyiv said the votes breached international law and were coercive and non-representative."

A Kyiv power installation had to have emergency repairs after it was damaged in a bombing raid and officials called for energy rationing. The capital was plunged into darkness but Governor of Kyiv Oblast, Oleksiy Kuleba, said no one was killed or wounded in the attack. It came after the Kremlin launched what is believed to be its largest coordinated missile attacks in Ukraine since the initial invasion of the country in late February as revenge for the Kerch Bridge explosion. Electricity transmission company Ukrenergo said repair crews were working to restore electricity service but warned residents about further possible outages. The state operator has called for energy rationing for the three million people in Kyiv between 5pm and 11pm, along with Zhytomyr, Cherkasy and Chernihiv, according to The Sun. Seniro adviser Kyrylo Tymoshenko warned that if the calls for rationing were ignored, candles would be necessary. This week's wide-ranging retaliatory attacks, which included the use of self-destructing explosive drones from Iran, killed dozens of people. The strikes hit residential buildings as well as civil infrastructure such as power stations in Kyiv, Lviv in western Ukraine, and other cities that had seen comparatively few strikes in recent months. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that Moscow did not see a need for additional massive strikes but his military would continue selective ones. He said that, of 29 targets the Russian military planned to knock out in this week's attacks, seven weren't damaged and would be taken out gradually. The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, interpreted Putin's remarks as intended to counter criticism from pro-war Russian bloggers who 'largely praised the resumption of strikes against Ukrainian cities but warned that a short campaign would be ineffective.' 'Putin knew he would not be able to sustain high-intensity missiles strikes for a long time due to a dwindling arsenal of high-precision missiles,' the think tank said. Regions of southern Ukraine that Putin illegally designated as Russian territory last month remained a focus of fighting on Saturday. Ukrainian forces pressed on with a campaign to recapture the mostly Russian-occupied Kherson region. Kirill Stremousov, a deputy head of the administration Moscow installed in the region, reminded residents they could evacuate to Crimea and cities in southwestern Russia as Ukrainian forces try to advance toward the regional capital. On Thursday, Kremlin-backed leaders asked civilians to evacuate to ensure their safety and to give Russian troops more manoeuvrability. Moscow offered free accommodations to residents who agreed to leave. Ukrainian troops attempted to advance south along the banks of the Dnieper River but did not gain any ground, according to Stremousov."

Two assailants are reported to have opened fire on a group of volunteers preparing to fight in Ukraine, the Russian Defense Ministry revealed on Saturday. The attack is said to have occurred in the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine. The defence ministry said two volunteer soldiers fired at fellow troops before they themselves were shot dead. At least 11 people died at the scene with another 15 seriously wounded. The incident took place during target practice, when the two volunteers from an unnamed ex-Soviet nation opened fire on the training group. The ministry has labelled the incident a terrorist attack. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the incident. 'During a firearms training session with individuals who voluntarily expressed a desire to participate in the special military operation (against Ukraine), the terrorists opened fire with small arms on the personnel of the unit,' the ministry said in a statement provided to local media. 'As a result of the shooting, 11 people were fatally wounded. Another 15 people with wounds of varying severity were taken to a medical facility.' The shooting comes amid a hasty mobilisation ordered by President Vladimir Putin to beef up Russian forces in Ukraine - a move that triggered protests and caused hundreds of thousands to flee Russia.

Putin said earlier this week recent military mobilisation he ordered is coming to an end, and he has no plans for further conscriptions once it has finished. But it was revealed earlier this week Iranian troops have quietly joined the Ukrainian frontline to help train Moscow's forces in how to operate kamikaze drones. Up to 50 Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) specialists have been sent to the southern and eastern front with hundreds of Shahed-136 drones, according to the Mirror. A strike using the Iranian-made 'suicide drones' hit near Makrariv, a small city located 31 miles west of Kyiv, on Thursday, destroying critical infrastructure. Despite denials from the Iranian regime that their forces are getting involved in the conflict, IRGC troops have reportedly been based in Dzankoi in Crimea and Kherson in the south, where one team has already been destroyed. A Ukrainian source told the newspaper: 'At least one of the Iranian training teams has been hit recently and they are actively being hunted down. 'We have been concerned for some time that IRGC specialists are helping Russia in their terrible attacks on civilians and they are of course being targeted.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia earlier this week of using Iranian-made Shahed-136 UAVs - also known as suicide drones - against military and civilian targets. Tehran has denied selling the drones to Russia, but there is mounting evidence that Moscow is deploying the weapon. Between September 30 and October 6 alone, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said it had destroyed 24 of the weapons, which are designed to be flown directly into targets - overwhelming and evading air defences along the way. With a range of more than 600 miles, the explosive-laden drones can 'loiter' above potential targets for hours before being slammed directly into enemy soldiers, vehicles or buildings from above - causing an explosion. Russia has intensified its bombardment of civilian areas in recent weeks as its military lost ground in multiple occupied regions of Ukraine that Russian President Vladimir Putin has illegally annexed. Kyiv said 83 missiles or drones were launched against the country on Monday morning, striking the capital and several other cities, killing civilians in the process. 'They want panic and chaos. They want to destroy our energy system,' Zelensky said in a video address on Telegram. He added: Russia is 'trying to destroy us and wipe us off the face of the earth.' There are mounting concerns about Putin's willingness to start nuclear war. The Russian leader has increased the number of strategic nuclear bombers stationed at an airbase near the Finnish and Norwegian borders, satellite images show. Putin warned of 'global catastrophe' if Nato troops clash directly with Russia, despite having now heightened that risk himself. The coming weeks will see a number of Russian nuclear drills, predicted to include the test-firing of ballistic missiles, at the same time as Nato tests its preparedness to respond to such attacks. Western officials said Russia was 'rapidly exhausting' its supply of missiles and because of sanctions was unable to import the parts required to manufacture replacements. One added: 'For these reasons Russia cannot sustain the aerial campaign indefinitely.'"
2022-10-15,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11318723/GOP-Rep-Lauren-Boebert-triggers-Twitter-war-AOC-branding-sellout.html,"GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert sparks Twitter war with AOC by branding her a 'sellout', over video of Dem congresswoman being heckled at empty town hall for supporting Ukraine war effort","Colorado Congresswoman Lauren Boebert added on to the criticism of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was recently heckled at a town hall event, by saying the New York Democrat has 'sold out' her constituents. 'On the rare occasions that @AOC actually spends time with her constituents, she is reminded that she has sold them out at every turn,' Boebert tweeted on Thursday. 'She campaigned as an outsider and has now just morphed into Sandy Pelosi.' AOC responded to the tweet hours later: 'Hey Boebert, you seem to have us confused.' 'I have attended and hosted (hundreds) of community events, hold regular town halls (and) don't take a dime in corporate cash. 'You are bankrolled by (Political Action Committees), Big Ag, and Oil. (You) are too scared to hold regular town halls open to all.' Just over 12 hours later, Boebert returned to the online feud. 'I have governed as I campaigned,' Boebert wrote. 'You have sold out your supporters. 'Just own it. You're the machine now.' Boebert started the Twitter conflict a day after AOC was interrupted by protesters at her Bronx town hall event over her vote to approve military aid to Ukraine. 'I believed in you, and you became the very thing you sought to fight against. That's what you've become,' one of the protesters yelled. 'You are the establishment.' Two men shouted down AOC during the question-and-answer period of the town hall. 'You originally ran as an outsider, yet you've been voting to start this war in Ukraine, you're voting to start a thermonuclear war with Russia and China. Why are you playing with the lives of American citizens?' One heckler identified himself by his Twitter handle, @Noggatone. A second protestor, Jose Vega, who circulated a video of the protest online, chimed in: 'You voted to mobilize and send money to Ukrainian Nazis.' 'You have done nothing. Tulsi Gabbard has shown guts, where you've shown cowardice.' Likening Ukrainian forces to Nazis is a key piece of propaganda deployed by Vladimir Putin to justify his invasion of Ukraine, although Ukrainian forces do include a far-right faction called the Azov regiment. Former Democratic presidential candidate and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard announced earlier this week her decision to leave the Democratic Party. In her announcement, Gabbard branded her ex-colleagues as an 'elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness.' The interruption was met with a mix of shouts - and some applause - as the congresswoman asked the men to wait their turn, as there was apparently a line of constituents waiting to ask AOC questions. 'I will get to the issue,' she said. When asked why she wouldn't immediately explain her votes to send military assistance to Ukraine, she answered: 'Because you are being rude to everyone around you.' In February, as Russia started its invasion of neighboring Ukraine, Ocasio-Cortez called the move in a tweet 'indefensible.' At the time she called for targeted sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his oligarchs. She's since voted in favor of military aid funding. President Vladimir Putin has warned that direct clashes with Russia would spark 'global catastrophe'. NATO is set to start military drills practicing the use of Europe's nuclear bombs on Monday. The nuclear drills - which do not involve live bombs - are annual exercises that the alliance said are not 'linked to current world events'. President Biden suggested in a Tuesday evening interview that the United States military has a contingency plan in the event Russian President Vladimir launches a nuclear on Ukraine. 'He, in fact, cannot continue with impunity to talk about the use of a tactical nuclear weapon, as if that’s a rational thing to do,' the president told CNN's Jake Tapper. 'The mistakes get made...and the miscalculation could occur. No one can be sure of what would happen. And it could end in Armageddon.'"
2022-10-15,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11318437/Now-Putin-listen-lectures-President-TAJIKISTAN-berates-Russian-leader.html,Now Putin has to listen to lectures from the President of TAJIKISTAN: Central Asian Republic boss berates Russian leader and tells him: 'We want to be respected',"Vladimir Putin was given a stern dressing down by the president of Tajikistan in another indicator that the Russian dictator has lost respect and influence in his own backyard. Fellow longstanding dictator Emomali Rahmon, ruler of the Central Asian state of 9 million since 1994, seized upon Putin's woes back home and in Ukraine to give him a piece of his mind and tell him how he really feels during a summit in the Kazakh capital of Astana. A glum and awkward looking Putin slouched back in his chair and took the seven minute tirade as a host of Central Asian leaders and officials at the Commonwealth Of Independent States Summit (CIS) watched on. 'Yes, we are small nations, we are not 100-200 million, but we have history, culture, we love, we want to be respected.' Rahmon said in a fiery outburst. 'We do not need anything; just to be respected.' The humiliation was witnessed by the rulers of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. 'Why do we have to beg (Russia to attend) some miserable forum in Tajikistan?' Rahmon demanded of Putin, jabbing his finger and making expansive gestures. 'I gave instructions to the Foreign Ministry, I even talked to you to ask (Russia) to attend at least at the ministerial level. No, at the level of deputy ministers. Is this what Tajikistan deserves, a strategic partner?' It is not the first time that Putin's so-called friends and partners in Asia have turned on him publicly since his debacle in Ukraine now that they sense weakness and smell blood. At a summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan last month, Chinese premier Xi Xinping snubbed dinner with Putin, while Indian prime minister Narendra Modi told Putin in front of the media that 'now is not the time for war'. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan also humiliated the Russian warmonger by making him wait in front of rolling cameras for half a minute before coming out to greet him ahead of talks. In the rambling and unscripted tirade, the Tajik dictator almost predicted Putin's demise, accusing his Russian counterpart of making the same mistakes that led to the downfall of the Soviet Union last century. He also complained that Russian businessmen came into the country and enriched themselves by extracting Tajikistan's natural resources while refusing to invest in the country. 'We do not want your money, we want to be respected as we deserve. We host your military bases, we do everything you ask for, we really try to be what you pretend to be to us ''strategic partners.'' But we are never being treated like strategic partners! No offence, but we want to be respected!' While Putin has continued to try to project a strong image of everything going to plan externally, that his erstwhile clients and vassals of small, impoverished dictatorships are turning on him - as well as big, important countries like India and China - tells its own story. Putin has been severely weakened by the disastrous course his senseless war in Ukraine has taken since last month, when Ukraine started autumn offensives to liberate occupied territory. His announcement of a partial mobilisations and rushed through annexations of the Ukrainian territory his army has managed to occupy have been seen as desperate signs of weakness rather than strength. His prestige was dealt another blow when Ukraine managed to hit the Kerch bridge that joins Crimea to the Russian mainland with what is currently thought to have been a truck bomb. And his callous bombardment of Ukrainian cities with long range missiles - which has done nothing to impact the strategic position - have similarly been seen as symptoms of his impotence. Putin recently announced that Russia does not need to unleash massive new strikes on Ukraine at the moment, amid speculation that Moscow's supplies of precision weapons may be depleted. And he also said that the 'partial mobilisation' he announced last month, which the defence minister said aimed to recruit 300,000 soldiers, was finishing and would be over within two weeks. 'Nothing additional is planned. No proposals have been received from the defence ministry and I don't see any additional need in the foreseeable future,' Putin said of his on-going mobilisation. 'Now 222,000 people have been mobilised out of 300,000. Within about two weeks, all mobilisation activities will be completed.' But the battlefield outlook for Putin remains grim, with Ukraine holding the initiative amid expectations that they will push on to retake the Kherson region and venture further into occupied Donbas. Expectations are also low for Putin's new conscript army, as reports come out that he is unable to feed them, clothe them or arm them, and they are being thrown onto the front lines with zero or close to zero training. And the Russian autocrat will be disheartened to hear that the United States will send fresh munitions and military vehicles to Ukraine as part of a new $725 million assistance package aimed at bolstering the country's defence against the Russian invasion, the Defense Department said."

In a classic piece of Kremlin sabre-rattling, Moscow moved a fleet of 11 nuclear-capable jets more than 1,500 miles to the Arctic Circle. Deployed to the Olenya airbase, close to Finland and Norway, the planes are capable of launching long- and short-range weapons. The seven TU-160 'Blackjack' strategic bombers and four TU-95 'Bear' hydrogen bomb carriers were picked up on new satellite images. As recently as mid-August, according to similar images, no such bombers sat at the base in the Kola Peninsula. Putin yesterday warned of 'global catastrophe' if Nato troops clash directly with Russia, despite having now heightened that risk himself. The coming weeks will see a number of Russian nuclear drills, predicted to include the test-firing of ballistic missiles, at the same time as Nato tests its preparedness to respond to such attacks. The relocation of the Russian aircraft from a base close to the Ukraine battlefields was spotted by Israeli intelligence officials. They are now fewer than 100 miles from Finland, which is in the process of joining Nato, and 115 miles from Norway, an existing member of the alliance. The Royal Air Force is completing last-minute preparations for Exercise Steadfast Noon, which will see up to 60 Nato aircraft taking part in training flights over Belgium, the North Sea and Britain to practise the use of US nuclear bombs based in Europe. Beginning on Monday, the drills will simulate tactical strikes and see RAF Typhoons playing the role of Russian MiG fighter jets, while RAF F-35 Lightnings escort US nuclear bombers. Nuclear-capable US B-52 'Stratofortress' aircraft will cross the Atlantic to take part, joining US F-15 Eagle jets based at RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg made clear this week that the alliance would proceed with its annual operation despite the tense international situation. Cancelling the drills because of the war in Ukraine would send a 'very wrong signal', he said, arguing that Nato's military strength was the best way to prevent any further escalation of tensions. Putin yesterday warned Nato not to intervene in Ukraine, adding: 'I hope those who make decisions will decide not to.' Western officials said Russia was 'rapidly exhausting' its supply of missiles and because of sanctions was unable to import the parts required to manufacture replacements. One added: 'For these reasons Russia cannot sustain the aerial campaign indefinitely.'"
2022-10-14,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11316383/Russian-analyst-debunked-Steele-Dirty-Dossier-paid-200-000-FBI.html,"Russian analyst behind the debunked Steele 'Dirty Dossier' was paid more than $200,000 by the FBI and Democratic operative who was a source admits he LIED about Trump, federal court hears","The ongoing trial of Russia analyst Igor Danchenko has brought more revelations about how the FBI pays for information, with testimony the source got $200,000 over a period of more than three years. FBI Special Agent Kevin Helson testified about the payments in Danchenko's trial on charges of lying to the FBI, following a years-long investigation by Trump-appointed Special Counsel John Durham into the origins of the Russia probe. Helson told the court Danchenko, who was a primary source for ex-British Intelligence officer Christopher Steele's infamous dossier, got paid $3,000 for just one meeting. It is all part of Durham's look at a series of missteps that went into the creation of the dossier, which also included salacious unproven allegations about Trump's alleged conduct in a Moscow hotel room during the 2013 Miss Universe pageant. Durham's team has highlighted the FBI's use of the dossier to secure surveillance warrants on former Trump foreign policy advisor Carter Page. Helson testified that he put in for an additional $346,000 when he was closed as a source, Fox News reported, but that it didn't get approved. The work that earned him $200,000 came over three and a half years. That revelation came days after FBI supervisory analyst Brian Auten testified that the FBI offered Steele $1 million in cash to prove the salacious allegations in the dossier he compiled on Trump, but that the bureau didn't hand over the money because Steele couldn't back up the claims. Danchenko is accused of lying to the FBI when questioned about his information, and is on trial in Alexandria, Virginia federal courthouse. He was indicted on five counts of making false statements to the FBI about the dossier as agents rushed to try to verify its information. Prosecutors told the court earlier that Danchenko fabricated one of his own sources and hid the identity of another when he was interviewed by the bureau. Danchenko's own sources are also coming under scrutiny and feature in the charges. One of them, Democratic PR exec Charles Dolan Jr., testified that he lied when he fed information to Danchenko, who was seeking intelligence on the sudden resignation of former Trump 2016 campaign chair Paul Manafort. Manafort had substantial lobbying and financial links to Kremlin-backed figures in Ukraine, and there were public reports of internal campaign tensions when he exited. And it turns out that Dolan was relying on public information that he tried to pass off as inside dope. Danchenko in turn passed on the information, and it got included in the dossier, which contained other unsubstantiated and salacious allegations about Trump. Dolan read from an Aug. 19, 2016 where Danchenko sought information on the Manafort intrigue. Dolan said he would 'dig around,' and later told Danchenko: 'I had drinks with a GOP friend who knows the players.' On the stand he admitted he never met with a GOP source, the Washington Times reported. 'I thought I'd embellish a bit.' He said Dolan had helped him in the past and he wanted to 'throw a bone.' 'I thought I would just embellish a bit to make it seem like his contacts were good,' he said. 'You actually didn't have any inside information, did you?' prosecutor Michael Keilty asked him. 'No,' he responded. Dolan said he wasn't sure why Danchenko was seeking the information at the time. 'You never talked with Mr. Danchenko about anything that showed up in the dossier, correct?' lawyer Stuart Sears asked him. 'Correct,' Dolan responded. Prosecutors read a portion of the dossier in court that said a Trump-linked political figure provided the reasons behind 'Manafort's demise' and that it 'was true that the Ukraine corruption revelations had played a part in this but also, several senior players close to Trump had wanted Manafort out, primarily to loosen his control on strategy and policy formulation.' Manafort was sentenced to 7 1/2 years in prison on tax, bank fraud, and corruption charges, but received a pardon from Trump. His Russia contacts were part of multiple Russia ties of Trump-linked figures that are included in the dossier. Durham's years-long probe has resulted in a single conviction – of FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith for doctoring an email used to justify surveillance. The trial of Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann resulted in an acquittal."

They want to destroy our energy system,' Zelensky said in a video address on Telegram. He added: Russia is 'trying to destroy us and wipe us off the face of the earth.' In a statement on Facebook, Ukraine's military specified that 'the enemy used Iranian Shahed-136 UAVs in strikes launched from the territory of Belarus' and the Crimean peninsula annexed by Russia, adding that nine drones were 'destroyed'. Tonight, Ukraine's air defence teams are again having to shoot down missiles and suspected drones fired in Kherson, the only major urban site that Russia has continually occupied since its invasion in February. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin said today that the recent military mobilisation he ordered is coming to an end, and he has no plans for further conscriptions once it has finished. He also repeated the Kremlin position that Russia was willing to hold talks, although he said they would require international mediation if Ukraine was willing to take part. Putin was speaking in Astana after a meeting of The Commonwealth of Independent States Summit (CIS), where he sat down with fellow leaders of ex-Soviet states. Other attendees included Belarusian dictator Aleksandr Lukashenko, who said on Friday that Russian troops would soon be arriving to take part in a 'regional grouping' of forces to protect its borders. 'The introduction of troops into a direct confrontation with the Russian army is a very dangerous step that could lead to a global catastrophe,' Putin told reporters. 'I hope that those who speak of this have enough sense not to take such steps.' He said he currently saw no need for 'massive strikes' on Ukraine now having hit their intended targets earlier in the week - but that could change in the future - and insisted that it was not his goal to destroy Ukraine. 'There is no need now for massive strikes. There are other tasks. For now. And then it will be clear,' he said, adding: 'We do not set ourselves the task of destroying Ukraine. No, of course not,' Putin said. Fears have risen in recent weeks over the possibility of Moscow launching nuclear strikes, after suffering a series of embarrassing setbacks in Putin's invasion. It was revealed on Friday - shortly before he spoke in Astana - that Putin has increased the number of his strategic nuclear bombers stationed at an airbase near the Finnish and Norwegian borders, satellite images show. With a range of more than 600 miles, the explosive-laden Iranian Shahed-136 UAVs can 'loiter' above potential targets for hours before being slammed directly into enemy soldiers, vehicles or buildings from above - causing an explosion. Reports coming out of Ukraine suggest the drones have inflicted serious damage to Kyiv's forces, as well as Ukrainian infrastructure. Ukrainians who have witnessed attacks by the drones say they make a recognisable noise, and have described them as sounding like 'motorbikes' in the air, while some soldiers have taken to calling it 'the flying lawnmower'. While the drones can be devastating to their targets, soldiers have said they a vulnerable to small arms fire. On Saturday, the General Staff of the Armed forces of Ukraine released a video on Facebook showing a smoking wreckage that it claimed to be one of the drones. The post said it had been shot down by a machine gun. 'This is a primitive handmade product,' Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, told Radio Free Europe (RFE) last week. 'It's not a high-tech conveyor-belt production like the [Turkish-made] Bayraktar or American and Israeli [unmanned aerial vehicles],' he added. Ukrainian residents described the drone attacks to RFE. 'You can hear the roar. First, I just hear them, but then I saw one fly by and then explode,' one man said. Another said: 'There was a buzz that woke me up. I remember thinking: ""What's that?"" The sound was approaching and then there was an explosion near the house.' According to reports, the first recorded use of the drones was in Yemen in Houthi-controlled areas. Now, Iran is reported to have sold hundreds of the drones to Russia. Tehran has denied that it is selling the deadly munitions to the Kremlin, but there is mounting evidence that Moscow's armies have been using them since September against the Ukrainian military to make up for a lack of artillery firepower. Ukrainian military officials say the drones are cheaper and less sophisticated than cruise missiles - but can have a similarly devastating affect on their target. There are concerns among Ukraine's military leaders that if they are not supplied an effective counter-measure, the drones could destroy their western-supplied artillery, which have successfully been used to push Russian forces back east. The almost 12-foot long Shahed 136 is designed with a delta-wing shape, with stabilising rudders at the top of the aircraft. The fuselage is at the centre of the drone and blended into the almost 4ft wings, giving it an elegant-looking shape. The explosives are contained in the nose of the drone, as well as the technology that guides it to its targets for a precision strike. The engine, meanwhile, is found at the rear of the drone, and drives two bladed propellers. It has been compared to an engine one would find on a lawnmower or a moped. 'Its motor sounds like a [motorbike]. You can spot it when it's a few kilometres away,' a Ukrainian soldier named only as Magyar told RFE. 'That's my advice to the military. They fly low and are slow, so you can shoot them down,' he said, noting the drones are usually used against larger targets. 'They carry such a load of explosives that it doesn't make sense to use them against infantry.' Overall, the drone weighs 440lbs, and can fly at speeds of almost 120mph. In order to overwhelm air defences, several of the drones (batches of five and above) are launched at once from the same rack. They are fired almost horizontally with rocket-launch assistance. The rocket is jettisoned on take-off, with the engine taking over once it is airbourne. The weapons are unlikely to significantly affect the course of the war, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said following last week's strikes. 'They have used many drones against civilian targets in rear areas, likely hoping to generate non-linear effects through terror. Such efforts are not succeeding,' analysts at the think tank wrote. Drones have played a significant part in the war in Ukraine so far. The United States has supplied Ukraine's military with switchblade drones, while Kyiv has also deployed the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 - that fire guided missiles - to great effect."

Its annual nuclear exercise 'Steadfast Noon' will see up to 60 aircrafts take part in training flights over Belgium, the North Sea and Britain. The nuclear drills - which do not involve live bombs - come after Vladimir Putin said today that a direct clash between NATO and Russian troops would lead to 'global catastrophe' The alliance said the routine drills were not 'linked to current world events'. Putin also said today that he sees no need to carry out massive strikes against Ukraine... 'for now'. On its website, NATO said the exercise, which runs until 30 October, was a routine, recurring training activity and added that no live weapons would be used. Spokesperson Oana Lungescu, said the exercise helps ensure NATO's nuclear deterrent 'remains safe, secure and effective'. Belgium is hosting the drills that will involve 14 countries and up to 60 aircraft, including the most advanced fighter jets on the market and U.S. B-52 long-range bombers that will fly in from Minot Air Base in North Dakota, a statement from NATO said. Earlier, Putin said the recent military mobilisation he ordered is coming to an end, and he has no plans for further conscriptions once it has finished. He also repeated the Kremlin position that Russia was willing to hold talks, although he said they would require international mediation if Ukraine was willing to take part.

It was revealed on Friday - shortly before he spoke in Astana - that Putin has increased the number of his strategic nuclear bombers stationed at an airbase near the Finnish and Norwegian borders, satellite images show. He went on to say that the 'partial mobilisation' he announced last month, which the defence minister said aimed to recruit 300,000 soldiers, was finishing and would be over within two weeks. 'Nothing additional is planned. No proposals have been received from the defence ministry and I don't see any additional need in the foreseeable future. 'Now 222,000 people have been mobilised out of 300,000. Within about two weeks, all mobilisation activities will be completed.' A total of 33,000 of them are already in military units and 16,000 are involved in the military operation in Ukraine, he said. He said his decision to call-up of reserve forces to fight in Ukraine, criticised as chaotic by some Kremlin allies, had been vital to hold the front line. 'The line of contact is 680 miles so it is practically impossible to hold it with forces formed only of contract soldiers, especially since they take part in offensive activities,' Putin claimed. Russian troops are using rape as a weapon of war against Ukrainians, according to damning evidence collected by the UN. Pramila Patten, UN special envoy on sexual violence, said she has verified more than 100 cases of rape against Ukrainians during the war - but the true figure is almost certain to be higher. Victims have ranged in age from four years old to 82 and have been mostly women and girls but included a number of men and young boys, she added. Patten said survivors have told her of genital mutilations and of soldiers 'equipped with Viagra' in what appears to be a 'military strategy' to dehumanise people. 'When women are held for days and raped, when you start to rape little boys and men, when you see a series of genital mutilations, when you hear women testify about Russian soldiers equipped with Viagra, it's clearly a military strategy,' she said. 'And when the victims report what was said during the rapes, it is clearly a deliberate tactic to dehumanise the victims.' The United Nations has verified 'more than a hundred cases' of rape or sexual assaults in Ukraine since Russia invaded in February, Patten said, referring to a UN report released in late September. The report 'confirmed crimes against humanity committed by the Russian forces, and according to gathered testimonies, the age of the victims of sexual violence ranges from four to 82-years-old,' she said. Asked if he had any regrets over ordering the invasion of his neighbouring country on February 24, Putin said: 'No.' He acknowledged that the war us unpleasant, but said he believed what his forces were doing was right. 'I want to make it clear: what is happening today is unpleasant, to put it mildly, but we would have got the same thing a little later, only in worse conditions for us, that's that,' he said. 'So we are acting correctly and in a timely manner.' Putin said he 'doesn't see the need' for talks with US President Joe Biden over an end to the war, but suggested he was open to talks with Kyiv. 'We should ask him if he's ready to hold such talks with me or not. I don't see the need, to be honest,' Putin said, asked about a potential meeting with Biden on the sidelines of a G20 summit in November. He added that his participation in the summit hosted by Indonesia is not yet decided. 'The question of my trip there has not been finalised. Russia will certainly take part. As for the format, we're still thinking about it,' Putin told reporters following a summit in Kazakhstan. Speaking earlier this week, Biden said he had 'no intention' of meeting with Putin but did not rule out potential talks. He also attacked Germany for siding with NATO. '(Germany) must decide what is more important for them: the fulfillment of alliance obligations, as they see it, or their national interests. In this case, it seems that Germany placed its obligations to the (NATO) alliance above all. I believe that this is a mistake,' he said. 'German citizens, businesses, and its economy are paying for this mistake, because it has negative economic consequences for the eurozone as a whole, and in Germany. But very few people take into account its interests, otherwise Nord Stream 1 and 2 would not have been undermined. 'But although one branch remains, as I said, in working order, a decision has not been made and is unlikely to be made. But this is no longer our business, this is the business of our partners.' Meanwhile, Lukashenko warned Ukraine and the West on Friday not to force his ally Russia into a corner, saying Moscow had nuclear weapons for a reason. In extracts of an interview with the American TV channel NBC released by Belarus's state news agency, Lukashenko said: 'The most important thing is, don't drive your interlocutor and even your opponent into a corner. So you mustn't cross those lines - those red lines, as the Russians say. You can't cross them.' Concern has mounted in the West that Russian President Vladimir Putin may resort to nuclear weapons since a series of defeats for his forces in Ukraine swung the momentum of the war in Kyiv's favour. 'As for nuclear weapons, any weapon is a weapon created for something,' Lukashenko was quoted as saying. 'Russia has clearly outlined its position: God forbid there will be an attack on the territory of the Russian Federation; in that event, Russia can use all types of weapons if necessary.' The call-up, announced by Putin in September, has proved hugely unpopular in Russia, where almost all men under the age of 65 are registered as reservists. The Russian leader initially described the mobilisation as 'partial' and said only those with combat or service experience would be drafted. However, a decree he signed outlined almost no specific criteria. Russian media reports have described attempts to round up men without the relevant experience, including those ineligible for service for medical reasons. In the wake of the president's mobilisation order, tens of thousands of men left Russia. In the wake of Putin's order, tens of thousands of men left Russia. Reports have surfaced since then of recruits getting deployed to the front lines in Ukraine with little training and inadequate equipment. Several mobilised reservists were reported to have died in combat in Ukraine this week, several days after they were drafted. While Putin struck a confident tone about hitting his mobilisation target, report from Russia on Friday said sinister raids by conscript-catchers have begun in Moscow and St Petersburg - in a sign that he is getting desperate. Police alongside enlistment officers are said to be lurking on street corners and near blocks of flats. The armed recruiters are cruising offices seeking men to join the war, while there have been previous reports of them picking up homeless men. In some cases enlistment teams are reportedly using facial recognition cameras to snare dodgers. 'They are acting like dog catchers,' said one comment. 'It's sickening how they are dragging men away as cannon fodder.' In Polyustrovo Park residential complex, St Petersburg men of mobilisation age were trapped near the entrance for summonses to be served. In Moscow, there was a mass delivery of summonses at underground stations, reported Ostorozhno News. Eyewitnesses said police officers interview men, take their personal details, then serve some of them with summonses. Some people are taken away to police cars. Pavel Chikov, prominent lawyer and human rights activist, warned: 'increasing reports of raids'. 'There are cases of summonses being served on the street, citizens being detained by the police in the subway and hotels, and their forced delivery to military enlistment offices or mobilisation points' He stated: 'This practice is illegal.' Senator Andrey Klishas - from pro-Putin United Russia party - called for checks on whether it was legal to pluck men from the metro and force them to the war. The authorities are using police, traffic police, FSB security service and residential databases to track down possible dodgers. They are also raiding offices to root out men of mobilisation age, even though Russians were promised that one one percent of the male population would be sent to Putin's war. 'Police officers walk around the floors and take men of military age,' reported a source of The Village online media. 'In the morning there was one [...] wagon, it was filled. A second was brought. They took our administrator and other men who were on the first floor. [Men] are caught in the corridor. Specifically, three policemen came to our reception.' Reservists are vulnerable for mobilisation to the lower ranks up to the age of 35. Junior officers can be called up to the age of 50. Senior officers can be drafted up to 55. The conscript-catching raids seem to give the lie to claims in Russia that the first wave of mobilisation is over, and that no second wave has begun. Putin's comments came after widespread attacks against Ukraine, such as those Russia launched Monday in retaliation for an October 8 truck bomb explosion on a prized bridge linking Russia to Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. The Kerch Bridge explosion followed Ukraine's recapturing of occupied areas in the country's east and south in continuing counteroffensives that have restored Ukrainian confidence and embarrassed Russia's military. The Russian tyrant has gradually increased the number of strategic bombers at Olenya air base - from none on August 12, to four supersonic Tu-160s on August 21, to 11 now - satellite images released on Friday revealed. There are seven Tu-160 strategic bombers (marked in red on newly released satellite images) and four Tu-95 aircraft (marked in yellow) at the facility on the Kola Peninsula - found in the extreme northwest of Russia, and in the Arctic Circle. The disclosure comes from Faktisk.no - an independent Norwegian fact checking website - which obtained the data from American satellite operator Planet. The buildup above at the air base follows international concern over another report two weeks ago, when The Jerusalem Post revealed there was an 'unusual deployment' of seven nuclear bombers at the airbase. This was highlighted by Israeli intelligence firm ImageSat International which detected the 'irregular presence' of TU-160s and TU-95s. The Armageddon planes are usually stationed at Engels Air Base, 450 miles south-east of Moscow. Now, however, the bombers are stationed around 115 miles away from the border of NATO member Norway, and about 95 miles away from the soon-to-become Alliance member, Finland. They can also be used with conventional weapons. There is evidence the deployment at Olanya has Kh-101 cruise missiles for possible use against targets in Ukraine. The Kh-101 can carry conventional or nuclear warheads. The runway at Olenya airbase was empty on 12 August, with satellite images from October 7 showing that it is now full of warplanes. The Tu-160 - aka White Swan, but known in the West as Blackjack - is a supersonic strategic bomber that has been the workhorse of Russia's strategic missile forces since Soviet times. It is the largest Mach 2+ military aircraft ever built, and as of 2022 is the largest and heaviest combat aircraft still in use - while also being the fastest bomber. As of 2016, the Russian Air Force's Long Range Aviation branch had 16 aircraft in service, with upgrades on the aircraft being undertaken in recent years. The jet can carry 88,000lbs of weapons on-board, with each of its two internal bays capable of holding 44,000lbs or free-fall weapons or a nuclear missile launcher. In May 2020, it was reported that the Russian military was exploring whether the Tu-160 could carry a hypersonic missile. Russia's Kh-47M2 Kinzhal (also known as 'dagger'), is a nuclear-capable missile with a range of 1,200 miles and a speed of up to Mach 10 (ten-times the speed of sound). Meanwhile, the super-loud Tu-95, known as Bear, is the only propeller-powered strategic bomber still in operational use today. The aircraft first flew 70 years ago, but was only used in combat for the first time in 2015. It was originally intended to drop free-falling nuclear weapons, but has since been modified to perform several other roles. Putin has deployed the Tu-95s to buzz Britain at moments of high tension, for example in February this year when the Royal Air Force scrambled Typhoon fighters to escort two Bears off northern Scotland. News of Putin's increasing numbers of nuclear-capable bombers came as footage showed the moment an ammunition store inside Russia was hit by a Ukrainian strike. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said on Friday he had placed his country in what he called a state of heightened terrorism alert because of tensions on its borders. Lukashenko linked the move to his announcement on Monday that he had ordered Belarusian troops to deploy with Russian forces near Belarus's southern border with Ukraine. 'In connection with the escalation of tension, a regime of heightened terrorist danger has been introduced,' Lukashenko said in a Russian TV interview. 'Therefore we began a procedure with the Union group of forces, the basis of which, as I already said, is the Belarusian army, which will be supplemented by units from the Russian Federation. Everything is going according to plan.' Allied with Moscow and wedged between Russia, Ukraine and three NATO countries, Belarus allowed Russia to use its territory as one of the launchpads for its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Its latest troop movements have raised concern in Kyiv and the West that Lukashenko may be about to commit his army to support Russia's faltering war effort. Political analysts say that is an unappealing option for him but that he may not be in a position to refuse if Russian President Vladimir Putin demands it. Belarus depends on Russia politically and economically, and Putin's support helped Lukashenko survive mass pro-democracy protests in 2020. Lukashenko crushed the demonstrations and all leading opposition figures have been jailed or forced to flee abroad. The warehouse was reported to be at a sugar plant in Oktyabrsky, close to the border, in Belgorod region. Oktyabrsky, close to the border, in Belgorod region. The strike seven miles inside Russia caused a major blaze with shells exploding in the inferno, according to local Telegram channels. It is the latest example of Kyiv taking the battle inside Putin's territory in retaliation for his relentless attacks on Ukraine, and in a bid to dim Russian war enthusiasm. Russian military correspondent Yevgeny Poddubny confirmed the village was hit. Other Ukrainian missiles were shot down by Russian air defence, according to reports in Belgorod. However, at least one got through hitting the warehouse. Regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov also confirmed the strike, saying: 'An ammunition depot located in a settlement in the Belgorod District came under Ukrainian Armed Forces' fire. 'Ammunition detonated. According to preliminary reports, there were no casualties. We will now evacuate local residents to a safe distance.' Separately, he said air defence had shot down incoming missiles in Novooskol district. 'The remains fell in the area of the railway. Power lines are damaged. 'Trains are temporarily suspended. Emergency crews are waiting. I am sure that they will correct the situation very quickly and traffic will be restored. The most important thing is that there are no victims.' A day earlier, Russia claimed a tower block was hit in Belgorod city. On Friday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday promised victory over Russia as his country celebrated its first Defenders Day public holiday since the start of Moscow's invasion almost eight months ago. 'On October 14, we express our gratitude... gratitude to everyone who fought for Ukraine in the past. And to everyone who is fighting for it now. To all who won then. And to everyone who will definitely win now,' Zelensky said in a video address to mark the occasion. Zelensky laid a wreath with the yellow and blue colours of the Ukrainian flag in front of a memorial in the capital Kyiv, dedicated to soldiers killed on the frontlines since 2014, when fighting broke out with Russia-backed separatists in the east. Zelensky said that by 'defeating' Russia 'we will respond to all enemies who encroached on Ukraine'. 'This will be a victory for all our people,' he said. 'The world stands with us. More than ever in our history' he added, referring to the unprecedented support from Western capitals. Ukraine's commander-in-chief General Valeriy Zaluzhny on social media congratulated his troops and thanked them for their service. 'We have stopped the enemy onslaught and ended the myth about the invincibility of the Russian army,' he said in a video address. In Kyiv, religious services and exhibitions were planned on the occasion, with the country's post service announcing the release of commemorative stamps. Defenders Day was established in 2014 to replace a previous February 23 holiday of Soviet origin that is still celebrated in Russia."
2022-10-14,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11316417/Republicans-criticize-Biden-begging-Saudi-Arabia-produce-oil-time-midterms.html,'Biden begged Saudi Arabia to churn out just enough oil to get his failing party past the midterms': Republicans tear into President's failed bid to delay OPEC deal - and say it's more evidence of 'trading favors for power' and trying to influence votes,"Republicans are piling on their criticism of Joe Biden after Saudi Arabia released a damning statement confirming the administration's failed bid to get them to delay cutting oil production by two million barrels a day until after the midterms. The White House, bracing for another spike in gas prices less than a month before millions head to the polls, has furiously hit back at the Kingdom and accused them of siding Russia instead of the financial implications of the deal. The Saudi Foreign Ministry statement didn't specifically mention the November 8 elections, where Biden will try onto the razor-thin Democratic majority in Congress, but stated the U.S. 'suggested' the cuts be delayed by a month. The West Wing dropped the gloves in the spat and said they would 're-evaluate' diplomatic relations while the Democrats threatened to suspend all arms deals to the long-time ally. But the GOP have said the humiliation for the Biden administration is more evidence that it is more concerned with 'political clout' than lowering cost for Americans, and that he should tap into domestic energy resources rather than rely on foreign powers. Republicans have also called for Nancy Pelosi to launch hearings to find out who in the Biden administration contacted Saudi Arabia to request the delay, and to potentially 'influence the outcome of an election'. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told DailyMail.com: 'President Biden's anti-energy agenda is the sole obstacle preventing a resurgence of American energy production and more affordable energy. 'Biden and Democrats' radical policies have crippled domestic production and caused a spike in energy prices. 'While President Biden continues to beg for energy abroad, the solution can be found here at home. 'House Republicans are committed to restoring American energy independence by maximizing the production of reliable, cleaner, American-made energy.' New Mexico Republican Rep. Yvette Herrell told DailyMail.com: 'In addition to sabotaging domestic energy production and presiding over record inflation and gas prices, we now know that President Biden begged Saudi Arabia to churn out just enough oil to get his failing party past the midterm elections. 'This is yet another instance of the Biden administration trading favors for power while throwing American families under the bus—I look forward to investigating this matter with my colleagues on the House Oversight Committee.' Rep. August Pfluger (TX-11) added: 'This is politics at its worst. Democrats are prioritizing their electoral outlook over the pocketbooks of American families and attempting to use OPEC+ as a scapegoat for their failing policies. 'This Administration needs to end its Green New Deal crusade and champion American oil and gas. Mr. President, the Calvary isn't coming---it's time to return to American energy dominance.' Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman, who is on the House Committee on National Resources said: 'This news goes to show what we've known all along: that Democrats and the Biden administration are far more concerned with political clout than they are with implementing policies to lower costs for the American people. 'Groveling to OPEC is not the solution; reopening domestic energy leasing is. Republican Rep. Tom Tiffany on Thursday demanded the release of transcripts of any calls between President Joe Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris and Saudi officials. And he said hearings were needed to get to the bottom of what happened. 'The allegations from the Saudi foreign ministry are serious, and if the Biden administration did attempt to pressure a foreign government to influence the outcome of the U.S. election, that' something Americans deserve to know,' said Tiffany in a tweet. Tiffany also wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi outlining her concerns and urging her to use her powers of oversight. 'This is a very serious allegation,' he wrote. 'One that, if true, may very well constitute an illegal solicitation of a foreign in-kind by the White House on behalf of Democrats' midterm campaign efforts.' Tiffany asked Pelosi and committee chairs to convene hearings, demand details of communications between American and Saudi officials, and identify who in the administration had asked for a delay. Republican Senator Ted Cruz tweeted in reference to the bombshell Saudi statement: 'Is there even a single US ally left that Joe Biden hasn't tried to bully for his own political gain?' Earlier the White House had hit back angrily at the claims, accusing the Saudis of trying to 'spin or deflect. John Kirby, the National Security Council's coordinator for strategic communications, said the U.S. had been talking to the Saudis about ensuring that Russia remained isolated and was unable to benefit from oil prices. 'We presented Saudi Arabia with analysis to show that there was no market basis to cut production targets, and that they could easily wait for the next OPEC meeting to see how things developed,' he said. The controversy erupted on Thursday morning with a statement issued by the Saudi Foreign Ministry defending its decision to cut production. It said it had explained to Washington that delaying the Oct. 5 decision by a month 'according to what has been suggested' would have led to 'negative economic consequences.' The Kingdom also brushed off suggestions it sided with Russia by insisting it took a 'principled position' on the Ukraine war and said the OPEC decision was entirely based on economics, not politics. Last week OPEC+ announced it would cut oil production by two million barrels per day, in a major blow to the Biden administration that for months had asked them to instead increase production. Production cuts are already jacking gas prices back up - $3.91 is the average cost per gallon as of Thursday, up eight cents from when the cut was announced last week. 'The country that benefits the most from this 2 million barrel cut is Russia,' Kirby said in a call with reporters. The cut 'allows [Putin] to continue to fund his war making machine and it certainly gave him, Mr Putin, a sense of comfort here,' Kirby continued. On Wednesday State Department spokesman Ned Price refused to confirm reports the Biden administration had begged the Saudis to wait and spare them the political consequences in next month's election. 'I certainly can't confirm that report. What I can confirm is that we conveyed a consistent message to the Saudis: energy supply needs to meet energy demand. We have made the point repeatedly that we have a multiplicity of interests with Saudi Arabia; energy is one of them,' Price said. 'And in the context of those discussions regarding energy, we have had senior members of the administration travel to Saudi Arabia in recent months. This was not—this engagement did not take place solely in the context of October 2022 or September 2022,' he added. But a Saudi statement released hours later implied that the U.S. did ask for at least a one-month delay. 'The Government of the Kingdom clarified through its continuous consultation with the U.S. Administration that all economic analyses indicate that postponing the OPEC+ decision for a month, according to what has been suggested, would have had negative economic consequences,' bin Farhan Al Saud said. It was never likely that such a request would have been granted as experts believe that Saudi Crown-Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the cut at least in part to spite Biden and Democrats in the midterm elections. Biden himself had a controversial meeting with the crown prince, beginning with a fist bump rather than a handshake, in July. Rep. Michael McCaul, lead Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that Biden should focus less on Saudi oil and more on production here at home. 'High gas prices are a direct result of President Biden's war on traditional U.S. energy production. Attempting to blame foreign countries every time gas prices rise is ridiculous. Voters won't be fooled,' he said in a statement. The Texas Republican said the White House's latest quarrel with the Saudis would 'alienate Saudi Arabia and harm U.S. national security.' Victoria Coates, Donald Trump's former special energy envoy to Saudi Arabia, told DailyMail.com that Biden's 'outsourcing' of the energy secretary is a 'national disgrace'. Vandenberg Coalition Advisory Board member and Senior Fellow at the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation added that Biden has placed the American people 'at the mercy of foreign wars, dictators and cartels'. 'The proper response is not to cut off arms sales to Saudi Arabia, an ally of more than seventy years that is taking daily direct fire from Iranian proxies in Yemen. 'It is to embrace our potential as a major energy producing nation that can responsibly protect our citizens against shocks in international energy markets.' After OPEC+ announced the decision, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called the move a 'mistake' and accused the Saudis of 'aligning with Russia.' The foreign minister said such an accusation is intended to 'distort the facts' and claimed Saudi Arabia has taken a 'principled position' with respect to the Russia-Ukraine war. 'The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would first like to express its total rejection of these statements that are not based on facts, and which are based on portraying the OPEC+ decision out of its purely economic context,' bin Farhan Al Saud said in a statement. The foreign minister said that Saudi Arabia supports UN resolutions regarding the war and rejects 'any infringement on the sovereignty of countries over their territories.' 'The Kingdom stresses that while it strives to preserve the strength of its relations with all friendly countries, it affirms its rejection of any dictates, actions, or efforts to distort its noble objectives to protect the global economy from oil market volatility,' bin Farhan Al Saud said. But Kirby said Washington presented Riyadh with analysis showing there was 'no market basis' for production cuts and 'they could easily wait till the next OPEC meeting and see how things developed.' 'Other OPEC nations communicated to us privately that they felt coerced to support Saudi's direction.' In a press call Kirby said Saudi Arabia had been 'twisting arms' to get other nations to agree to the cut, and 'more than one' had privately expressed concerns about doing so. Kirby said the U.S. would keep a close eye on the next OPEC meeting in December to see where the Saudis stand on Russian aggression. The production cut incensed lawmakers, who questioned why the U.S. had been selling arms to the Middle Eastern nation and ignoring human rights abuses and its role in the war in Yemen if it wasn't going to get oil out of the deal. Biden claimed that Riyadh would face 'consequences' as aides announced the U.S. would be reevaluating its relationship with the Saudis. 'There´s going to be some consequences for what they've done with Russia,' Biden said in a CNN interview aired Tuesday evening. 'I'm not going to get into what I'd consider and what I have in mind,' he added. 'But there will be - there will be consequences.' But the Saudi statement showed no ill will to the U.S. 'The Kingdom affirms that it views its relationship with the United States as a strategic one that serves the common interests of both countries. The Kingdom also stresses the importance of building on the solid pillars on which the Saudi-US relationship has stood over the past eight decades.'"
